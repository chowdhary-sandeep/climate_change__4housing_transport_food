"comment": "&gt;You're taking historical sea level rise data and projecting that into the future, which totally fails to take into account future warming and any feedback effects.\n\nScience is based on testing hypothesis and analyzing results, not just throwing around ideas.  My, \"napkin calculations,\" are based on real world phenomena.  The idea that there's some CO2 or heat tipping point exists only in the minds of the people pushing the idea.  The big problem with this, and why Climate Gate was such a big deal is because they have not provided the evidence to prove these ideas.  They simply want us to believe them.  Michael Mann has been fighting tooth and nail to keep people from seeing his data with which he created the hockey stick.  How in the world are we supposed to take these people at their word when they fight so vigorously to prevent us from seeing their work?\n\n\n\n&gt;As far as what do do about our energy issues, you seem to have a fatalist view. You don't have an idea for how we would solve it... So we just shouldn't try? You didn't say that exactly, but it sounded like you didn't think it was worth trying.\n\nYou couldn't be more wrong.  I absolutely support the elimination of fossil fuels in energy generation.  But based on the mountains of information that I've read on solar and wind production, there's simply no way that they will serve our needs on their own.\n\nThe biggest problem is energy storage.  We could build enough solar arrays and wind farms to power our country during the day, but we don't have the energy storage capacity (or technology) to power the country at night.  \n\nYou made the claim that night time power usage is significantly less than during the day, but what about the people in the north who are currently burning fuels to heat their homes during the winter?  If those people switch to electricity, then energy usage is going to go up significantly during the winter.\n\n\nPeople toss around the claims that a solar array on every roof would provide enough energy, but those people have not done their research.  Most home solar arrays, under ideal conditions, don't provide enough power to meet the demands of that home, much less providing power to industry, or to keep the traffic lights running.\n\n\nWind power is highly volatile.  In some places, it's quite practical.  In others, it's quite impractical.  You can't just put a wind farm in Oregon and transmit the power to New York.  The loss of energy from transmission inefficiency is too high.  The cost of maintaining wind farms is also very high, and the cost increases significantly with age.  Don't get me started on the insanity of offshore wind farms.  You also don't want to have wind turbines where people are, as the turbines are prone to catastrophic failure.  \n\nThat brings me to this article, which is one of the many reasons that I absolutely support the idea of getting rid of fossil fuels for energy generation.\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/\n\n\nOur current Nuclear reactors are horribly outdated.  But due to heavy opposition and red tape, we have not been able to build new, upgraded nuclear plants.  The newer plant designs are significantly safer, and significantly more efficient.  There's also new research being done on molten salt reactors and thorium reactors.  These technologies could safely power our country for a millennium, and could serve as a supplement to any renewable energy generation methods that we have in place.  But as long as people are vehemently opposed to nuclear, these technologies aren't going to be put into production.\n\n\nI'm also quite interested in geothermal and tidal power generation, but Geothermal doesn't generate enough energy, and tidal is possibly the most difficult to implement.\n\n\n\n&gt;We can easily nudge the market away from carbon emission in a technology agnostic way with a carbon tax, which would provide incentives to move towards carbon neutral energy sources.\n\nThis doesn't work.  The businesses hit with these taxes just pass the costs on to the consumer.  All that this does is takes money from consumers and puts it in the hands of the government.  The government then pisses away the funds on wars, special projects, etc.  The consumer, who now has less money, cannot afford to invest in renewable technologies.  Carbon taxes are worse than useless.\n\n\n\n&gt;Once we have a solid install base of solar, energy will be cheap and abundant. Then we use electric cars with a tesla-style rapid charging system (which they have shared the patents for) and we're all golden.\n\nHave you done the math for how much this would increase the demands on our power grid?  Based on what I've read, switching from gasoline to electric in our cars would increase the demands on our energy grid by 25%, and most of the charging associated with electric vehicles would likely be done at night.\n\n\nYou claimed that I have a, \"fatalist view.\"  I believe that my views are informed, and realistic.  I have done a lot of my own research to see how viable these ideas are, and the conclusion that I have come to is that we can eliminate fossil fuel use, provided we supplement renewable generation with nuclear generation.  I do not believe, given our current level of technological advancement, that we can power the United States, much less the world, from only renewable sources.",

"comment": "&gt; Well if you do the math for say Tesla's battery(85kwh). Each cell can probably do 5amps charging but lets say 1amp. 18,000amps because it has 18,000 cells.\n\n* Model S has 7,104 cells, not 18,000.\n\n* Each cell in the Model S has a nominal voltage of 3.6 V, and a maximum voltage of 4.2 V. Therefore, you cannot apply 120 V to each cell. Doing that would likely cause the battery pack to explode. Actual charging power for each cell will be the charge current multiplied by cell voltage. Current is dependent on voltage and impedance - you can't just arbitrarily say 100V and 1A.\n\n* Battery capacity varies depending on charge &amp; discharge rate, and temperature.\n\n* Each cell in the Model S is 3100 mAh. That means 1C is 3100 mA, not 1 A. They can probably do up to a couple of C when charging, which works out to be ~150 kW for the pack. Unfortunately a detailed datasheet isn't available for the NCR18650A to get actual data.\n\n* A simple, possibly slightly inaccurate way to calculate charge power, is simply get the charging C-rate of the battery and multiply that by the pack capacity (kWh).\n\n* A simple way to calculate charge-time is to divide cell capacity (mAh) by charge rate (mA). Result in hours. Of course, charging will slow when the battery reaches high SOC.",

I'm thinking half of that (12kWh) would add 50% range at a 5k option. That would make the cars in this segment much more attractive, in my opinion. Not to mention that with more capacity, can also come more performance.",

We could all switch to electric cars tomorrow but that would be financiall impossible for the vast majority of people.  However, going down a different aisle of the supermarket and putting different things in their basket is a viable and easy change most people could do.\n\nComparing car use to animal use only works for the environemtal argument anyway.  There is no immediate ethical reason to stop using cars (non environmental) there are very good reasons for not using animals.\n\nThe two are only superficially comparable on the environmental side of things, but veganism is a multi faceted position so I don't believe it is right to compare the cessation of unnecessarily killing animals with switching to an alternative energy source.\n\nI appreciate the rational approach though.  Good on you.",

When it comes to electricity (from the grid) for refining, it's 47 billion kWh. I'm assuming this electricity is used for things like lights, pumps, compressors, and for general processes. \n\nHowever, there is a great deal of energy needed to heat oil to separate it. The refinery's I have been to, they use a combination of natural gas, waste steam, or other by-products to produce their heat. \n\nIf you look at the link provided, you see that the majority of the input energy comes from natural gas and still gas. If I take the amount of still gas (which I'm assuming has the same energy content as natural gas), natural gas and convert it's heat energy into kWh, I get something like 3kWh per gallon of gas (using my link). However, this is missing a few huuuuuge points about the refining process.\n\nA lot of the energy used to refine gasoline does not convert with (near) 100% efficiency to electricity. For example, the natural gas boilers probably use something like 80%-90% of the energy in the natural gas to heat the steam. If you tried to turn that natural gas into electricity, it would only yield something like 30% of it's energy in a typical gas-fired plant and 50% in a combine cycle plant.\n\nAlso, lets take still gas as an example. Still gas is just natural gas (ish) that boils out of oil during the refining process. This gas is then piped over to boilers to create steam which is used to heat the crude oil. Sure there is a lot of energy expended by burning the still gas, but if they didn't use it, they typically would just flare it. Essentially, if we decommissioned the refinery, we would also lose that source of energy.\n\nSo yes, there is a lot of energy used to refine oil. However, the loss in electricity demand from refineries would not be enough to offset all of the new electricity demand by new EVs on the road.",

It's a bit like a highway gas station that only has E10 and no other fuels like Euro95, LPG, or diesel.  \n  \nOf course, since it's being built by the manufacturers and they apparently don't know yet how/what they're going to charge for it, it's pretty clear they don't intend this to be comparable to gas stations. I prefer to see this investment as (mostly) a marketing expense. \"If people see enough chargers of *our type* they're more likely to buy a car with *our connector*\" (not surprisingly all car manufacturers in the group seem to be part of the CCS guys.) I think it's a neat 'trick' to get people to buy cars with a specific standard, I'm personally not sure how good it will work in practice.  \n  \nI firmly believe in the long run we need companies going the 'gas station replacement' route, with a transparent pricing model and chargers supporting as much different EVs as possible like what [Fastned](https://fastned.nl/en/) is doing in The Netherlands.",

"comment": "&gt; Bit my goal is definitely the electric car,      \n\nIf you can get used to the idea of renting a (petrol) car/van several times per year for unusual trips like holidays etc, then the battery only needs to be large enough for your daily commute, the rest is number of seats and storage etc (and if it looks pretty), the same as with every car.          \n(You already mentioned 30kWh, much smaller than Tesla's range, and I expect much more 'public' outlets will be installed in the coming years, and maybe your boss is willing to install a 'normal' 16A outlet to charge during the day (3kW/h=~15km)).     \n\nYou can lease a car (empty handed after 3 years), buy with monthly payments or pay cash (you still have the car and battery), you'll have to compare local prices, obviously, and iirc there are EVs you can only buy *without* the battery, which must be leased separately.           \n(When the battery reaches 80% capacity after several years and needs replacement, you can sell the car or keep it and buy a new battery, *owning* that old battery means you can (maybe) add it to your rooftop PV system for another 10 years.)     \n\nIf you can give some info on what you find important, and maybe links to cars you have in mind, that would make it a lot easier.",

Tesla July was up maybe 5,000 over June (assuming their International S+X were stable, maybe a bad assumption) but overall industry was down 13,000, which was also down very slightly from May. Note that I don't think it was Tesla' Model 3 directly stealing sales in July, as the US numbers were up 4.5K, almost exactly what Tesla's June - July increase was.\n\nI'm wondering where the slack came from or was the burst of sales in Korea due to the short-windowed $23,000 incentive enough to create a somewhat artificial peak on top of a longterm rising trend, or something else that's creating temporary noise (BYD had an early Q2/Summer push or something?), and we should expect rising industry-wide to resume in Aug?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

"comment": "Actually the individual impact on the whole carbon footprint thing is very small, it's the corporations and factories producing majority of worlds CO2. Instead of going vegan you could do cheaper and easier things like buy an electric car, install solar cells on the roof of your house, and replace your thermostat. It's also a good idea to replace your old appliances with newer, energy efficient A+++ appliances. Every little bit helps!\n\nI think that for someone with an average salary and typical 8-4 job, eating 100% vegan is just too expensive and time consuming, not everyone has time to cook at home every day and not everyone can afford to eat vegan food out daily.\n\nIt's still good idea to reduce your meat intake for health reasons, maybe think about doing meatless Mondays or eat chicken or fish instead of steak every now and then.",

I did consider the bolt, but really wasn’t comfortable with it, besides the price itself.  I was trying to wait longer for a new car but I had kinda already waited longer than I was comfortable with.\n&gt;\n&gt;We are getting closer, my next car will probably be an bev.\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh and I said 300 mile range, the 2017 bolt was only rated for 238. \n\nRight, which is why I noted that it was less than 300 miles, but also less than your price.  As in, someone can buy a bolt today if they want a good range for cheap. The bolts major shortcoming is weak DCFC (50kWh or so)\n\n\n Even the 2019 isn’t 300 yet.  If I lived in a land of chargers that would be one thing, but there wasnt even a dc charger within driving distance when I bought my car, except the one listed at the dealer which was inside the building in the show room.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tesla is the only one doing the smart thing by building a charging network.\n\nYeah, Its a major advantage.  The closest network is electrify america, which may be able to make some headway if they can get some buy in across non Tesla automakers. \n\nMost american households have multiple vehicles, and a large percentage of them have a place to charge at home.  EVs should begin to dominate the commuter car market as price comes down, used EVs come to market, and as DCFCs become more widely available.",

It seems to have a lot of problems simply because it's much popular so there are far more users than for any other scooter. On the plus side replacement parts are cheap and easy to find which I can't really say for other scooters.\n\nE-twow is also popular here but for me, the lack of a proper break is a no-go.\n\nI agree that the market is still young since most of the brands use proprietary parts so you can't mix and match. Not sure how it is for e-bikes but at least the normal bike parts are standardized so there is a much greater variety to chose from and fix something if it breaks.",

EVs have to be programmed to limit power and acceleration or they become dangerous. FWD is kind of self-limiting as the driving tires will slip when too much torque is fed to them. Then the traction control and vehicle stabilization reduces power to prevent more than a slight amount of wheelslip.\nA 1,000+ pound battery under the floor does much for lowering the CG. The Tesla layout of having the motor and gearbox down low even more improves the stability of a car.",

"comment": "We downsized from two ICE cars to one EV a little over a year ago, after realizing that it was silly to hold onto two cars when we didn't need either for commuting after I got a new job. Currently have a 2019 Chevy Bolt that I'm looking to trade for a 2020 or 2021 one due to the battery recall. I don't often charge from home since it involves using a 100ft extension cord, and I pay for 100% renewable energy in a state with higher electricity prices so the price per kilowatt is not much cheaper than using a level 2 charger. There's a chargepoint a quarter of a mile away from me. \n\nHonestly, it's been a great experience, the only thing that has bothered us has been the fast charging speed. It has a 50kw maximum, and that makes road trips difficult, and its conservative charge taper makes it difficult to get much on a cold battery. I brought it to an EVGO charger near me the other day (partner wanted to do an unplanned 90 mile round trip drive with about 40 miles of charge left, in 30F-ish weather) and was limited to a 45 minute session. It started around 15 kw and ended maybe around 30 kw by the time my session was over. We ended up finding some level 2 chargers at our destination so it wasn't a big problem, but it was something we had to think about. Not something you'd worry about to the same extent with a Tesla\n\nI have worries about the long term grid situation, but hope that in a few years when I'm ready to commit to buying a car (and a house, tbh) for the next 5+ years that there's more bidirectional charging cars on the market.",

There have been several studies posted on this. Any EV bought today will have a progressively lower carbon footprint per mile as the grid power gets greener.\n\n\nEngineering Explained has a good video on the grid and the power needed with numbers: https://youtu.be/7dfyG6FXsUU\nThe short of it is in America we're fine.

"comment": "It's not that simple because if you remove the ICE in a vehicle which splits power between the ICE and the electric motors then you need more powerful electric motors to make up for the power loss. Or you get a car that's slower, which some may be fine with, but many wouldn't be. Particularly if you are talking about regular hybrids. Some PHEV's have motors that are powerful enough for an acceptable but not very impressive standalone car. Making more powerful motors isn't that difficult though, but you can't simply remove the engine add some batteries and call it a day if you want a competitive car. There also isn't as much room for as many batteries in a platform meant for hybrids as there is in a platform meant for BEVs.",

Switching to the Crosstrek just made the same roads easier in the dark. It also let me commute on days smart people stayed home. \n\nAs for range, I’m in Texas and my mountains are in Oklahoma/Arkansas. I don’t go anywhere worth instagramming. The woods are too dense for vistas. There’s no parking lot, maybe a turnaround. I get deep enough where it’s unpopular enough my dogs can disappear for an hour without getting into trouble. I doubt I could get my payload in and out of that in winter with a 220mi nominal range.\n\nNow that we’ve discovered the awesome utility of a 12-passenger van (minus 7 seats) I expect it’ll be past 2035 before we’re driving EVs on trips.",

The Mach-E could qualify for the $7,500 tax credit if Ford were to follow the entire battery guidelines, it doesn’t disqualify it for the full credit because it’s made in Mexico however.",

It’s in their vehicle and energy storage production numbers. No other automotive company touches Tesla and BYD in terms of this. \n\nNow, when it comes to Tesla’s in-house 4680 cell production compared to your CATLs and LGESs of the world, they indeed have a long way to go for scaled production. Their last update on 4680 production implied that they were at over 5 GWh/yr. Hopefully, this will be at least 40 GWh/yr by the end of this year. Their DBE tech is extremely important for not only reducing costs (which will be passed on to consumers), but it also significantly reduces the energy needed/emmisions resulting from the production of battery cells since the need for energy-intensive drying ovens is eliminated.",

There's no secret plan here to withhold products consumers are desiring, and no incompetence-defined inability to do so.",

You are stating that the CURRENT runrate of a vehicle that is ramping up is mediocre. And yet the current runrate is already higher than a huge amount of EVs that are being produced by others. At no point am I'm saying that it is the most nor even in the top 10 (outside of Chinese EVs of course).\n\nAnd then you bring up the Nissan Frontier from some reason. Yes, its outselling the Cybertruck for the year right now. And it should be. Cybertruck literally just started ramping up a year ago. It barely sold any in Q1 due to the ramp, while Q2 was still low. But Q3 not only outsold both Q1 and Q2 for the CT, but it also outsold the Nissan Frontier and has a runrate higher than it now. And the CT is still ramping as well. It very well may outsell the Frontier this year and is basically guaranteed to next year.\n\nWe have heard numerous times this year about demand issues and demand drying up for CT. And yet each time we hear that, there end up being more sales of CT than before. It's in the middle of a production ramp up. And that ramp up is constantly growing.",

I’m lucky enough to live in the state with the 3rd highest electricity cost in the US at 22.59 cents per kWh — so that would be $240 ($813 / year). Except, I have solar panels and generate about 6200 kWh / year, and I think I figured out that at my current consumption I’m effective paying about 8 cents per kWh effectively so $84 ($288 / year).\n\nSo… I figure I’m saving about $675 / year over my Prius, not including oil changes and regular maintenance not applicable to an EV.",

Here in the PNW, we have very little light and lots of cloudy days October - March. The net metering laws allow you to bank up production between April - September, and use that bank throughout the winter. Luckily we also have lots of hydropower during the rainy season.\n\nI agree that these laws will have to change as we come across some (unknown) threshold of solar adoption. *Someone*, the power companies, or the consumer will have to store the energy in some fashion, especially in production-rich months like July, August. Otherwise, the excess energy will have to be sold off to other locales or just wasted away.",

For example: most homes (depending on where you are) use an average of 12-30 kWh per day. The Tesla Powerwall 7 kWh system (for daily use) is $3000 for just the unit itself, not installed or wired (most likely $5-6000 fully installed). So, what that means, is that if you used 10 kWh in a given day, you would need to have 2 units just to STORE the energy), not including offseting your usage for the given day. This hasn't even touched on the GENERATING electricity cost for solar fully installed. \n\nIn the future this will change but right now battery systems aren't viable for homes, at least in my experience.",

"comment": "Let me give you an example of the problem for cadmium thin-film as a retail product. It's about not being able to control the end use. \n\nRetail solar panels are often headed for the roof of a building. Buildings have lifetimes and then get old. When buildings are old and abandoned plants grow through them, windows get broken, walls start to tweak out and eventually someone comes in and decides to reuse the land and remove the structure. \n\nIt would be great if we could ensure that the people who were involved in the demolition business were all very concerned about the environment and super careful about sorting out what might be hazardous when the demolish a structure. Unfortunately, that's not usually how it works. Demolition crews are usually not the highest paid folks and they like to do things as cheaply as they can. The tendency is to come in with an excavator and just trash everything into a big pile and pull out anything that's obviously valuable and not shattered into a millions pieces so stuff like copper pipe and steel reinforcing beams can be separated with the arm of a hydraulic excavator and that tend to get put off to the side. Windows along with their frames are simply smashed into rubble. A Cd-Te solar panel is more like a window than a steel reinforcing rod. \n\nSo then the rubble is hauled off to a landfill and referred to as \"clean\" but now you have what was an encapsulated sheet that is smashed into little pieces exposing all the cadmium. Under acid conditions in particular it's likely to begin to leach out as the rain falls onto the pile of debris and leaches out the cadmium. Acidic conditions emerge easily in landfills because any kind of organic waste gives rise to an acid environment and there's always a mix of organics in construction rubble which will eventually lead to a moist, acidic environment. Over time it's going to leach out. There will be an aquifer downstream and it will be contaminated. It's not maybe, it will happen. \n\nIf you could control the entire lifecycle of the product you could avoid this but when you sell retail it's simply not possible to know where it's going to end up and eventually it's going into a landfill. That's just how it goes.",

Maybe ask your installer.  I wouldn't tell them to do anything because they are (should be at least) professionals.\n\nAlso how big is your main service panel and main breaker?  That is sometimes the limiting factor.  NEC says you can only back feed so much and this is based upon the inverter's max AC output (regardless of the amount of solar panels in the installation) which is bigger for bigger inverters. \n\nAre all the panels facing the same direction?  If you know the brand of inverter and modules you could probably find a sizing tool on the inverter's website.\n\nGood luck!",

"comment": "You are comparing apples to oranges when you compare a watt of generation *potential* of nuclear and solar.  The capacity factors of solar and nuclear determine the quantity of kilowatt hours produced over the course of a year.  Typically, the capacity factor for solar is 20% or less especially in Canada.  Typically, the capacity factor for nuclear is well over 80% for Candu reactors in Ontario (very conservatively).    So, if we make conservative estimates of 20% and 80% respectively (favoring solar), then if we have 100 kilowatts of each then the amount of energy produced over the course of a year is:\n\n* solar - 100 kilowatts * 8784 hours per year * 20% =    175,680 kilowatt hours per year  \n\n* nuclear - 100 kilowatts * 8784 hours per year * 80% =  702,720 kilowatt hours per year\n\nThis still says nothing about which one is cheaper.  It's only closer to a solution since solar in Ontario doesn't reach 20% capacity factor and nuclear is more than 80% in Ontario.   To determine the \"cheapness\" requires a lot of work and a lot of assumptions.  For instance, the value of electricity generated is part of the equation for \"cheaper\".   So, that depends on how much solar is installed already and how much solar will be installed in the future.  Any time there is too much power, the value will go down.  Any time solar generates in a time of greater need makes the value go up.  The same for nuclear.  There are other factors like decommissioning for both solar panels and nuclear power plants.  The costs are affected by how little or much there is because economies of scale are involved.  Also, refurbishment avoids decommissioning a nuclear plant (the one being refurbished), but has it's own future decommissioning costs.  It's not a simple question.\n\nInstallation costs are only one factor.  More important is the total cost to rate payers over time.",

"comment": "Ga based solar installer here.  I'm so tired of solar companies acting like their designs are intellectual property.  They are most likely not giving you a line item description of the project because if it sells, they are going to try and get the cheapest possible material and naming a specific amount of panels or inverter spec would block that.   There are tons of installers in NC that, if not local to you, would travel for a job that size. Get more quotes and stop talking to them for not showing you a real quote. If I was looking at a job of that size I would be providing drawings and super up front pricing. When is the last time a contractor from any other trade, builders, electrical, hvac,  etc tried to get a job without telling the customer what they were buying?  Rediculous behavior. Solar costs what it costs but if they are treating you like this before the sale imagine how they'll behave after the sale.  Are you handy at all?  I've seen a lot of successful grid tie ground mounts by DIYers. \n\nAlso, listen to the comments on energy conservation. I always try and get my customer to get a handle on power usage.  Most bills can easily shave $50/month.  You can PM me if you like. I used to be in the NC solar industry so I know how those boys work.",

"comment": "Thanks a bunch! \n\nSo, basically, I bought this house a year ago and the first things I did were to install a brand new roof (50-year GAF guarantee)  and re-do the houses entire electrical system and install a 200-amp service. Should I consider having the installer who put on my roof also install the brackets for the solar panels? The last thing I want to do is compromise the roof with brackets, but if it is rather unlikely that I will cause damage, I would rather do it myself.\n\nIf I had to guess the roof is about 15-20°. It's pretty easy to walk around up there. \n\nThe micro-inverter sounds like it changes the panels to a (probably more complex) parallel circuit, is that correct? So the circuit will see several different DC inputs acting individually instead of one large DC input to be converted to AC. If my assumption on how they work is correct, does it increase loss from multiple inputs being converted from DC to AC? Or is the loss relative to the nature of conversion, and it doesn't matter how many inverters are acting in a circuit? Regardless of the outcome, that solution makes way more sense for me, given the shade I will be contending with during some parts of the day.\n\nThanks a ton for your input!",

"comment": "&gt; Gee, do ya think so? Here, why don't YOU go and figure it out for each state, then. And once you've done that, please tell us what your point was. Thanks.\n\nMy point is that how clean EVs are depends what state you're in, and people aren't buying EVs in the same numbers in every state. EVs can realize far greater than 40-45% emissions reduction in states with a lot of renewables and nuclear. EVs do not need to be rolled out everywhere at once, and the grid continues to get cleaner with every passing year. \n\n&gt;\"Who says I am against it? It's fine, but it's trivial.\"\n\nA 40-45% improvement is not \"trivial\". If somebody invented a combustion engine with that kind of improvement over existing engines, it would be front page news around the world.\n\n&gt;\"Be as happy as you want.\"\n\nYou sure? You had a problem with it earlier. People being happy about doing something constructive with their lives and money really seems to irritate you. How come now you're pretending it doesn't? \n\n&gt;\"Idiots? Nah. Virtue-signaling EVangelists is more like it. Plenty of otherwise intelligent people have their fetish objects.\"\n\nEVs play an important part in achieving the future most of us want. Besides being more energy efficient and less polluting, by economies of scale they drive down the cost of large format lithium ion battery packs. This is important because many other emerging technologies like home robots and home solar energy storage will require large, energy dense batteries to be cheap if they're going to be affordable for regular people.\n\nThis is however part of a larger trend in technological development away from moving parts and towards solid state. The fewer moving parts, the more durable and reliable, the easier to manufacture, the more efficient (as you're not losing power to friction for example) which yields improvements applicable to a wide variety of technologies.\n\nBesides that, electric motors are a god damned miracle. Name me even one other way to turn stored energy into motion that can reach efficiencies in the high 90s. That is so rare that if electric motors didn't already exist and you told me about them I'd think it was an investment scam or something. Normally there's always a big catch. Solar panels max out rn at 40% efficient. Thermocouples are like 5% efficient. We have to work around those problems. But electric motors have no such problems. They really are \"that good\". \n\nThe invention of the electric motor was a turning point in human history, they are so overwhelmingly superior to combustion engines from an engineering standpoint that it's always been certain to anybody in the know that all vehicles would one day use them. We've only been waiting on a way to store power densely and with good cost efficiency. \n\nI invite you to decide whether you're pro-future or anti-future. Pro-technology or anti-technology. Pro-efficiency, or anti-efficiency. Are these not all good things? What would motivate somebody to go looking for a way to make them seem like bad things?",

Assuming no AC that's way more than a large-ish 10kW array can produce (I believe). You can use a heat pump instead, but water heating would still kill ya.\n\nAdd in a car and I'd guess you'd need 50kW array or more.",

Algae can produce oil for biodiesel.  Biodiesel will work well in jet engines.  \n\nYou have to watch out for coal fired power plants supplying electricity to solar panel manufacturers. If you then waste the electricity on an inefficient synthesis you end up with a very large carbon footprint.  \n\nThe solar panels and windmills are not zero impact.  There is land space occupied, manufacturing waste material, mines, and dead birds.  Where are the windmills and solar panels going to be dumped when the break down?  Why not take the train when there is high speed rail available?",

"comment": "Economically speaking, I'm always aiming for a 1.2-1.4 DC/AC in my location because that optimizes LCOE. \n\nBut from a design perspective, designing systems to clip is a bad thing. Always. The real question is \"how bad?\". In most cases, its not bad at all. To the point where it can be negligible. \n\nYou will always get less kWh output from a system that clips vs one that does not. Every inverter is less efficient at 100% than it would be at something like 80-90%.\n\nThe whole \"gaining more on the bell curve\" is the selling point that inverter manufactures use when your metric isn't kwh/kW-DC, but rather kWh/kW-AC. If you frame it as kwh/kW-AC, inverter clipping can almost look like a good thing. In that case, you are getting more output out of your inverter, but you're also getting less output of your solar array as a whole.\n\nThis actually made sense when inverters were $0.50-$0.75/W about ten years ago and bumping up to the next size of inverter was expensive and you could show that clipping losses would be way less than that cost. As inverters get cheaper, clipping makes even less sense.\n\nIn cases where you have AC constraints (like not being able to go over 500kW for some interconnections or bumping up to the next inverter size will require me to upsize all my conductors / breakers / etc) but have no DC constraints, that's where clipping becomes allowable. But you're never gaining anything output wise by clipping. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Anyone who was on it as it existed before the switchover will have it for the next ten years. New applicants only get the base rate of electricity returned without any consideration for distribution. I think it's somewhat unfair because most of the extra energy that's produced locally would likely end up being consumed by direct neighbors. It doesn't cost $.05 per kWh to send that power next door on the same transformer. The energy companies end up making money on the power that you are providing. IMO it should be split somewhere closer to 50/50 on distribution.",

"comment": "Or what if simply exchange coal based electricity with as cheap wind and solar power plus balancing storage? (Cheaper if you account for climate change costs.) And then we exchange petrol and diesel with electricity and hydrogen gas made using surplus electricity? And some biofuels, at least during transition, to feed the remaining old engines with.\n\nAnd then we replace oil-based plastics and much concrete with wood-based and other low-emitting materials. (Thus, there will be new economic tree plantations on redundant bushland. Which means safeguards for sufficient biodiversity protection must be put in place in all countries.) The remaining concrete production must apply carbon capture and storage to be accepted. \n\nProblem solved in 20 years if we start now. \n\n(We have actually started but will the oil lobby allow us to continue?)",

"comment": "Nobody can answer that question as it is a roll of  the dice. Seems like a really stand-up contractor to do quality work and be honest that they are not a specialist.\n\nI repair systems that were installed by contractors, electricians, and other non-solar companies. Thats not to say you have to have some special knowledge, but there are industry standards. I can tell piratically before getting on a roof if the system was installed by somebody that knew what they were doing.\n\nOverall installation is turning bolts, but there are gotchas. You could roll the dice with a general contractor, or go with a local solar installer. Another option is if you can find somebody that consults on installs. I have often worked on a consulting basis , but I have gotten away from it. I see too much go wrong and decided it is not worth having my name anywhere around it.\n\nAgain, thats not to say they wouldn't do a perfect job. They could also likely wire your house, but there is a reason you are required to be an electrician to do it. The work isnt hard, but knowing the ins and outs is what you are getting with that license.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the same way that he has a plumber for plumbing, electrician for electrical, and roofer for roofing, he should have a solar guy for solar. Even if his labor turns the bolt, you really need somebody knowledgeable on site for the design, permitting, utility interconnection, and generally just knowing the fine details of a solar install",

"comment": "Depends on what you value. Aesthetically the Sunpower module will look better than the LG, but if you cared about anesthetics, Solaria would be the best. Although from the ground I dont think the difference between Sunpower and LG will be that prominent. \n\nFrom a perspective on who will be around in 25 years, LG Electronics is a large company that will be around for sometime. Sunpower hasn't been doing well financially for many years now and it's kind of been a running joke in the industry that they still haven't BK or liquidated, but only time will tell.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't never recommend Sunpower to anyone, but if you want highest efficiency and least degredation, Sunpower will give you that. I just don't think the marginal benefit is worth going for SunPower over LG.\n\nAlso, I don't recommend SolarEdge. If you can go Enphase, do that. Inverters matter significantly more than modules and certainly fail more frequently. You should get more quotes. Hopefully one that offers Enphase and LG.",

"comment": "This is incorrect. According to their website if you max all the solar options you get 40miles/day. \nI work in the EV industry and I looked over their specs, and I have some other issues with their stuff.\n   They are pretty misleading on their website. In their more “detailed” spec sheet they list range in both kilometers and miles (confusing). I did find the claimed solar capability rate of 700Watts from the solar panels on the car. At this rate assuming perfect sun for 9.5hrs a day (average in CA) you would generate 700W x 9.5hrs = 6.65kWh of energy. At the claimed 100Wh/mi that is 66.5miles of range added.\nAll seems okay right? Well here’s where we have the problem. \n\n   The assumptions made here are just wrong. Solar doesn’t give you maximum energy all day, in California it’s around 5 hours per day of good direct sunlight, and that is assuming your panels are facing south (which on your car they all most certainly aren’t). The battery pack in this car is presumably higher voltage than the panels (350V DC pack, so the panels will lose another ~4% at best during this conversion). With these two assumptions alone we have 6.65kWh x 5hrs x 0.96 = 31.92 miles. 25% lower than what they say advertise on their website of 40miles per day.\n  One more thing before we finish, the assumption of 100Wh/mi is insane and unrealistic. The Tesla Model 3 for example is around 300Wh/mi and it is extremely efficient. The Tesla model 3 is capable of 150Wh/mi at extremely low speeds (look up hypermiling). They never indicate at what speed the 100Wh/mi is from, this is very important since it’s a squared relationship between velocity and air resistance (push back force of the air).\n\nSo the 100Wh/mi is not likely a realistic number. The other part is that that efficiency number I guarantee comes from their smallest battery pack version (25kWh). On their website they assume 100Wh/mi for all the battery pack sizes. Their large battery pack option (100kWh) will not be anywhere close to this efficiency, especially if traveling uphill even slightly.\nFor reference the 100kWh pack in the Tesla model S (best energy density of any pack on the market) weighs a whopping 1377lbs. \n  Taking all that into account if I had to guess what we would actually see here it would be the following: \n175Wh/mi seems more realistic for regular average use including some freeway driving. Maybe a bit more then that for the 100kWh model. With the solar, assuming the 5 hours of useful direct 700 watts, it takes a 20% hit for not facing south, plus our inverter efficiency loss, our new range added from solar becomes: 700W x 5hrs x 80% x 96% = 2.68 kWh generated per day in CA. This number at our new efficiency of 175Wh/mi is 15 miles per day with the largest solar array option.\n   I would love to be proved wrong here as we need EVs that are efficient, but solar just sucks for this because there’s not enough surface area. Better to have a battery at home and a large array there where you can point them south.",

"comment": "I am designing an off-grid solar installation at my get-away cabin. I have designed a purpose-built 7x10 shed where I can mount 6 panels on the roof, and to house the equipment and batteries. The shed roof is angled at 40 degrees to match my latitude, and I can orient the shed so that the roof is pointing exactly South. I have an old Honda EM600 generator and it would be nice to be able to use it to charge the batteries in an emergency.\n\nI was planning on setting up a 48 V battery bank. I have the space, and it seems to be the most efficient way to go.\n\nBut I am having difficulties deciding exactly what charge controller and inverter to buy.\n\nTo size the charge controller, 6 panels \\* 350 W/panel / 48 V \\* 1.25 (cold temp allowance) = 55 A.\n\nSome candidates for the charge controller include:\n\n* OUTBACK FLEXmax Charge Controller MPPT 60A Battery FM60-150VDC for $431\n* MORNINGSTAR Charge Controller MPPT 60A Battery TS-MPPT-60 for $599\n* AIMS Power 60 AMP Solar Charge Controller MPPT for $473\n\nThe array-to-inverter ratio of a solar panel system is the DC rating of the solar array divided by the maximum AC output of the inverter. The majority of installations will have a ratio between 1.15 to 1.25; inverter manufacturers and solar system designers typically do not recommend a ratio higher than 1.55.\n\nTo size the inverter, 350 W/panel \\* 6 panels = 2100 W, therefore I need a 1500 to 1750 W inverter.\n\nAs far as I can tell, an inverter does not have an AC generator input,but an inverter/charger does.\n\nSome candidates for the inverter/charger include:\n\n* AIMS Power 4000 Watt Pure Sine Inverter Charger 48Vdc for $1,179\n* Magnum Power MS Series 4000W for $1,660\n* Ultimate Power 4000@ Pure Sine Inverter-Charger for $2,787\n\nBut wait a second, it appears that there is such a thing as a \"hybrid inverter\", where the charge controller and inverter are combined. These seem to be **much** cheaper. So cheap that I suspect that I am missing something here. Like 1/3 the cost of a charge controller and an inverter/charger.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* PIP 3048LV-MK 48V 3kW 120V Inverter for $649\n* Growatt SPI 3000TL3-LV for $729\n* Renogy 3500W Pure Sine Wave Solar Inverter Charger for $900\n* ECO-WORTHY 3500W 48V All-in-ONE Solar Charge Inverter for $592\n\nAfter discovering the hybrid inverters, it raised the question about coordination between a charge controller and an inverter/charger. Both have \"charging profiles\" where they change the charging amperage over time to increase efficiency, battery life, and safety. But what happens when you have both a charge controller and an inverter/charger in play? This seems to be an advantage for the hybrid inverter.\n\nAre there factors I am not considering? Suggestions? Better options?",

"comment": "Our typical usage is 40-50 kWh per day.\n\nWe have a 7.2KW array, a Solaredge inverter, and three Tesla Powerwalls. With that, we generate more electricity than we use and we run on battery power between 3PM and midnight (the two most expensive times of day).\n\nWe're lucky to be in a part of the San Francisco bay area that has good weather, plus our array is oriented nearly due south and at a reasonable tilt (23-degrees).\n\nWe charge our two EVs on Level 1 (120V) chargers.\n\nOur cars average about 4 miles per kWh. We don't drive long distances so it's almost always possible to replace all the charge we use by charging overnight (when the cost is the lowest).\n\nGenerally, cutting over to batteries is perfectly seamless. But there's an issue between Solaredge and Tesla. The Tesla gateway doesn't know how to manage the Solaredge inverter other than to turn it on or turn it off. So, if the grid fails while the inverter is running and the Powerwalls are 'mostly' charged, Tesla turns off your inverter. Now you're depleting your batteries when you could be either running off of solar or at least depleting the batteries more slowly.\n\nThe Tesla gateway will turn the inverter back on at some point. But Tesla can't tell you at what level of charge it turns the inverter on/off because they have a 'Smart Algorithm' that looks at your historical data and does something or other.\n\nSolaredge has a battery backup solution that doesn't have this problem. They partner with LG for the batteries. \n\nI'm hearing stories that Tesla has changed its policy and will no longer sell their Powerwall to 3rd party installers. If that's true then if you really want a Powerwall you'll need to buy your entire system from Tesla. If you choose that option, make sure that Tesla gives you the right sized inverter. There's a post here today about a guy who bought a 10KW system from Tesla but received a 7.8KW inverter. That's called 'Oversizing'.\n\nTesla doesn't make their own inverter (yet). They've been using Solaredge inverters in their systems. Solar edge makes very good inverters. \n\nInstallers love to claim that Oversizing isn't a problem. But if you dig a bit in to the specs for Solaredge it says,\n\n&gt; Oversizing the inverter also causes the inverter to operate at high power for longer periods, thus affecting its lifetime. Operating at higher power also increases inverter heating and may heat its surroundings...",

"comment": "Mate, we'll probably have to end the discussion here. I love your enthusiasm, but you're completely ignoring the status of the supply chain if you truly believe EVs will make up 30-35% of new auto sales within a few years.\n\nEven if we ignored the fact that there's no less than 30-40% of the population that for various reasons have no interest whatsoever in pursuing EV ownership, the world does not have the battery manufacturing capability to supply 30-35% new auto sales within 3 years. Keep in mind, electric utilities across the world are purchasing literal gigawatt-hours of battery storage as well based on largely the same chemistry being used in EVs. So not only do we have to supply EV demand, we have to supply EV demand as well as the very large stationary storage demand. That requires raw materials at a level we're not even mining yet to scale up that quickly. \n\nAnd even if we ignored the fact that the battery capacity is just not there to achieve what you claim, we also do not have the charging infrastructure or the electrical grid infrastructure (remember, this is the field I've worked in for more than a decade) to support that drastic of a ramp-up in EV adoption.\n\nIt's just not in the cards, my man. Again, I love the optimism and the enthusiasm for the industry. Love it. Slap a !RemindMe on this one for three years and we can have a more rational discussion at that time. 30-35% of new auto sales by 2030 is unfortunately the trajectory we're on. There's some wiggle room in there, sure, but nowhere near the extent that you're proposing. This transition is going to take a lot more time than that.",

Saw several complaints under the previous business name they used. They were priced significantly higher and provided less system monitoring than I wanted. No access to individual panels on my roof so I could monitor them. Those are just a few of the reasons, but there were others. I opted for a local solar installer with impeccable reviews that has been in the game since 1989.  Great workmanship, warranty and a significantly lower $/watt ratio. I liked the Sunpower rep. Nothing personal.  I was just able to do a lot better.",

"comment": "I don't know.  Maybe I just can't imagine the scale here.  I could see this working with a defined route between A/B where there are three planned stations and all tractor trailers are part of this program.  But when you look out and see hundreds of truckers all going in the same direction and how big their batteries would be  (minimum 500kwh) and how much energy would be needed to fill those batteries it seems kind of mind boggling.  The battery storage linked above could charge two semis before being drained.",

"comment": "It certainly will, and while any type of suffering isn't pleasant, you can't ignore the fact that we've deeply broken the balance here on earth. Any life that breaks it's balance, be it predators, prey or even bacteria, is dooming itself to some very bad times. \n\nIt wasn't that long ago that 90% of humans had to live in the countryside and grow food in order for the other 10% to live in cities. Now we're wanting a life where 90% of people live in cities leaving the remaining 10% to grow all the food. That can't be don't without a serious amount of energy, and sadly we haven't found a way to make that energy without serious environmental consequences. Green energy isn't possible without us ripping open the ground for minerals and petroleum for plastics. I know people want to have their cake and eat it too, but the fact is most people don't want to live the country lifestyle and work the earth, most people want to live in cities and enjoy the many amenities technology has brought us, consequences be damned. \n\nWe did the opposite, we left the city to live a very low impact lifestyle in the country, raising and growing a lot of our food, we built an earthship, a passive solar home that heats and cools itself without much or any energy, we drive a plug in hybrid that we charge off a solar array I put together and we enjoy collecting old things destined for landfills and fix them up to give them more life. I'm doing my part, but what's everyone else doing ? Consuming as much as they want without much thought for where everything comes from, and there's not much I can do to change what the other 8,078,598,550 people on earth do. \n\nSo ya, I say let the chips fall where they falls. If our love of money and luxury means it will take a few thousand years of a largely inhospitable earth for shit so sort itself out, then that's what it will take. There's not much more I can do about it other than make sure my kids and their kids will inherit what we built so they can at least take care of themselves. We have enough acreage for a few generations to live a similar lifestyle of they so choose. What happens after that if up to them.",

"comment": "Ok so I can’t figure out an easy way to post a spreadsheet on Reddit, but here’s a quick back of the envelope calculation:\n\nAssumptions: \n- $0.156/kWh utility electric price (US avg)\n- 10,000 kWh yearly usage (US avg)\n- 10kW solar array\n- $3/watt install cost ($30k)\n- production of 4 hours per day (US avg)\n- 75% conversion efficiency (DC to AC)\n\nUsing the above assumptions, you get 10,950 kWh of solar production per year, so your entire electricity needs are covered by solar (great!). But you spent $30k to get there (not great). \n\nIf you had just used grid electricity, your costs for the year would have been $1,560. So you paid $30k to “save” $1,560 in year one. Your return in the first year is 5.2% (1,560/30,000). There are checking accounts right now that are paying close to that. \n\nGranted your rate of return will marginally increase each year because the grid price is assumed to always increase. But even after 20-25 years you don’t get a return that is close to what you’d earn if you had just invested that money in the stock market and paid grid price for electricity. \n\nAlso the solar panels are a depreciating asset as I mentioned before, so they lose value every year, essentially cancelling out most of any savings you’d even achieve. The above analysis also does not take into account falling solar production over time, which will make your future “returns” worse as your panels degrade.",

"comment": "All those panels are good and the various wattages don't really matter. Also, 43k is the install with micros? That's too expensive in my opinion.\n\n  \nRegarding micros, the real reason you would go with Enphase is the warranty which is 25 years, reliability and redundancy and better customer service. If for example, the inverter fails on a string inverter(aka powerwall 3 inverter), your whole system is down unlike an Enphase system where if one inverter fails, you don't lose the whole system; just that one panel.\n\nEven the batteries have redundancy built into them where each 5P battery has six inverters in it and if one fails, the whole battery doesn't fail. Enphase batteries have a 15 years warranty compared to the 10 of the Powerwall.\n\nAlso, customer service seems to be really lacking as well. There are a ton of reviews with how horrendous their customer service is. Just yesterday, I saw someone post on the Tesla Solar subreddit about their bad experience with Tesla Solar support.\n\nI also compared Enphase vs. Tesla batteries in this comment as well:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/solar/comments/1ecgppf/comment/lf1tb7v/](https://www.reddit.com/r/solar/comments/1ecgppf/comment/lf1tb7v/)\n\nIn the end, it will be more costly to go with Enphase but will have better warranties, customer support and better reliability.",

"comment": "All of these deals allow some assignment though they will probably do a credit check on the new home owner. \n\nYes mortgage bank may care. But technically if lease then the solar panels are not owned by homeowner. And if loan, the collateral is just the physical equipment of solar and not the house. Mortgage bank may still not like it or it even kills the mortgage loan. But you will know the answer to that in the closing process when the bank looks at title docs. \n\nThe problem with requiring a buyout is that the price will be crazy high early in the project’s life. It is going to be more economical to let these deals run their course.",

And while almost all CCS EVs accept that behavior, it's not a feature and the components aren't built for this usage. Making it not only a legal issue but also a safety and potential components killer.\n\nAmbibox has hinted a price in the low thousands of euros but also no product for more than a year now.\n\nAlso presuming cheap chinese LFPs are okay, you can get here in Germany 50kWh of home battery for about 12k US $ plus inverter plus installation. So no the funky cat isn't a good deal in terms of home batteries.",

"comment": "Those aren't really different definitions. The wording is different, but the meaning is the same. The second just provides a further explanation and examples of what it means in practical terms. *Because* we vegans subscribe to the idea that we should live without exploiting animals, we then *as a result* try to avoid eating them, wearing them, etc.\n\nAnd, if you'll note, both are about all animal exploitation -- as in all animals, and not just for food. \n\nMisrepresenting veganism as just a diet that excludes some animal products but not even all -- which is exactly what Vegan Outreach does -- DOES mean altering the definition of veganism. \n\nPolitely correcting people's ignorance about actual veganism isn't \"absolutist dogma\" or \"harping negatively on people for minor issues\". It is respectful and essential. If people don't even understand what veganism *is*, then how are they going to become vegans? Remember, the goal isn't to have the most people calling themselves vegans, it's to actually have more vegans.  \n\nI don't believe that we should ignore and even reinforce people's ignorance out of some fear that they will stop even what little they are doing or they might get their feelings hurt. We need to educate people instead of treating them as if they can't possibly understand or deal with the truth. To do the latter is what is truly insulting.",

"comment": "My refrigerator has no animal products in it.  I haven't eaten meat in 10 years.  Unlike ovo-lacto vegetarians, I never eat quesadillas or omelletes or milkshakes.  But if a friend bakes some cookies or muffins that have eggs in them, and they look good and I want to be polite, I'll eat one.  This may happen 4 or 5 times per year.  What does that make me?  \"Vegan\" seems like a pretty useful way to describe my diet.\n\nDo I consider these cookies to be regrettable slip-ups?  Imperfections in an otherwise perfect lifestyle?  Hell no.  They're part of the noise.  They pale in comparison to the thousands of insects I kill because I choose to drive a car, or eat vegetables sprayed with pesticides.  It's nothing compared to the environmental devastation I bring about by choosing to fly in an airplane 10-12 times per year.  \n\nFace it, manicmonty.  That last fig you ate probably had dozens of wasp larvae in it.  Should I rat you out and kick you out of your little vegan club?  Give me a break.  I appreciate your efforts to minimize unnecessary suffering.  But you need to stop taking yourself so seriously.",

My entire life before I was vegan, I could not breathe through my nose. Well, very poorly at least. I thought for a long time I had the whole \"deviated septum\" thing. At one point I was prescribed nasal spray, which did next to nothing. Imagine my surprise when, after going vegan, I could breathe through my nose for the first time in my life!",

"comment": "Yes, that was exactly what I meant. When we make claims about B12 people will read them. Some will be new to veganism and will have read nothing or little else on the topic. There is a lot of information to take in for new vegans so many will filter out information heavily. The best message to them is: take a dedicated B12 supplement from the start. Period. It is inexpensive, reliable and very easy and quick to take. The message is simple and the habit is very easy to remember and follow once it sets in after a few weeks. You can set a weekly reminder in your calendar or smartphone to take the supplement. Any other advise is worse because B12 intake from low dose B12 fortified foods are less researched and such foodstuffs have less B12 quality control. But if new vegans on top of a supplement do eat such foodstuffs and absorb the B12 within that is only a bonus and no problem. Some who go vegan already have low or deficient bodily B12 storage without knowing it. The overt symptoms from deficiency can also lag behind. That all adds up to significant risk for some new vegans of unneccessary harm through B12 deficiency. One such case is one case too many. The person is himself/herself harmed by it and the cause of animal rights is harmed because the person is likely to drop veganism and many others will get the (incorrect) impression that you can't stay healthy eating vegan.",

"comment": "I completely agree with your consequentialist position. I'm vegan so that I don't support animal abuse, so I would do things that are technically non-vegan in a situation where it doesn't contribute towards animal suffering at all.\n\nFor example, I got a veggie burger from a takeaway place and when I got home I realised it had a slice of cheese in it. I specifically asked for no cheese and saw them write it on the order slip. Making the 15 minute drive back to the restaurant to get a new burger is out of the question to me- not only is it wasteful because they'll just throw the old burger out, but it's a waste of time and petrol. So I threw the cheese slice out and ate the rest of the burger. Next time I go in I will complain about it, and they'll hopefully be more careful in future.\n\nThe damage had already been done, so deciding not to eat the burger would not have done anyone any good. (plus I would have been hungry and sad, because this place makes awesome burgers)",

"comment": "What you described would indeed be classified ethical veganism in line with what is typically considered support for animal rights. Thanks! Stick with it!\n\n---I do sort of disagree with the idea that we can control our taste-buds necessarily. If you serve human flesh to me under the guise of it being vegan, I might love it. When you tell me its a person you murdered though, I wouldn't want it. So... did the flavor *really* change? No. Human flesh probably tastes pretty good, along with other species, but that's not a good enough reason to eat it. The repulsion we feel from such things isn't really going to stop the more primitive parts of our brains from finding those things pleasant... it's our understanding of doing the right thing which stops us. It's good that you don't find animal products appealing though! I don't find them appealing either.",

"comment": "A portion of why that steak tastes so good is the psychological imprint of your social conditioning that says it's ok, and even good for the world, for you to eat that animal flesh. If you're considering an ethical veganism, you realize that it's not ok. In time, as the strength of that conviction grows, the psychological bias towards savoring that flavor of food will diminish. After all, you'd be reminiscing about how great it was eating dead flesh.\n\nSometimes I wish that I could have something with some nice barbecue flavor. So I make vegan barbecue! Sometimes I want a big ol' chicken-fried steak. So I make chicken fried seitan! Eggs, sausage, bacon and toast for breakfast? Got it covered! (tofu scramble, veggie sausage links, tempeh bacon).\n\nMinimizing my participation in the ruthless slaughter of tens of billions of animals a year? Tastes way better than any seared hunk of flesh ever could.\n\n\nAlso, check it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBqxv6r_s7I",

I just started it but hopefully it will be useful the next time I run into these conversations. \n\nOne thing I can be sure of though is I bet God granting dominion over animals probably didn't have in mind an industrialized insanely efficient system like  we have today.",

Now if I were to say to you: 'Vanilla is the best flavour ice-cream', you'd say...\n\n&gt; Joey Naylor: No, chocolate is.\n\n&gt; Nick Naylor: Exactly, but you can't win that argument... so, I'll ask you: so you think chocolate is the end all and the all of ice-cream, do you?\n\n&gt; Joey Naylor: It's the best ice-cream, I wouldn't order any other.\n\n&gt; Nick Naylor: Oh! So it's all chocolate for you is it?\n\n&gt; Joey Naylor: Yes, chocolate is all I need.\n\n&gt; Nick Naylor: Well, I need more than chocolate, and for that matter I need more than vanilla. I believe that we need freedom. And choice when it comes to our ice-cream, and that Joey Naylor, that is the defintion of liberty.\n\n&gt; Joey Naylor: But that's not what we're talking about\n\n&gt; Nick Naylor: Ah! But that's what I'm talking about.\n\n&gt; Joey Naylor: ...but you didn't prove that vanilla was the best...\n\n&gt; Nick Naylor: I didn't have to.

If you are like I was as a vegetarian, I knew that eating meat was wrong, but I didn't do too much research. My advice would be to do as much vegan research as you can, the youtube community was really influential to me, along with Forks Over Knives and Cowspiracy (documentaries)\n\nWhat really was the final tipping point for me was learning that dairy was the main cause of my bloating and stomach issues. Now that i've done it though, It was not nearly as difficult as I thought. I've gotten to a point where the thought of cheese disgusts me because I really know what it is and my brain is off of the casein. And you can still love cheese, there are some really good vegan cheeses! my favorite is cashew cheese.",

I'm sure he has some form of contact on his homepage.\n\nMy guess why it could've been harder for you on a paleo diet: maybe the vegan diet is more clear cut? As it 'allows' for no animal products whatsoever maybe that could be the difference? I have no idea, but I always feel like 'just' a diet doesn't really stop you from cheating, but with veganism it's not just your health, but also the animals and the planet that are usually motivators and that might make it easier to stick to it? Also you only eat plants and thus might not be influenced by animal products to crave other animal products.\n\nAs said, just a guess by me. I had no big issue giving up dairy/cheese. But maybe because it gave me horrible stomach cramps.",

Nothing is black and white the truth is always found in the middle and we desperately need people and channels that communicate that truth to people!   \nI do think this vegan video wasn´t up to their usual neutral standard which is something that can happen of course. They showed in the past that they really care about being neutral and they take criticism seriously. They took down videos and re made some because of innaccuracies. So I think we should try to show them where they did wrong so they can have a chance to correct themselves.   \n\n\nAlso it was to be expected that this video will not resonate well with most of the vegan subreddit since we are definetly on one extreme of the argumentation if you know what I mean. I often see that vegans have the opinion that meat is basically poison which is just not true. Most of the health issues that we see today that are related to meat are caused because people eat WAY WAY too much of it. Our body is great at handling all kinds of unhealthy stuff we put into it but the dosis makes the poison.  \n\n\nAlso calling them sellouts without any proof is stupid.",

Plus it doesn't sound like OPs bf wants to change at all, cold turkey or not.\n\nAs for your other point about cultural differences and conditioning, and your point about subjective morality, those are both irrelevant considering the bf agrees that eating meat is immoral. It would be as if you were raised colorist and discovered that was wrong but decided you didn't care about being wrong and continued to be colorist. Which imo would make you bad person.\n\nYour points about some vegans contributing to human abuse is also irrelevant. If they are doing something they think is immoral, then imo they are bad people as well. I'm not sure how that affects my original question.",

How the fuck are you out here saying blended soybeans/bananas have no nutritional content without fortification?\n\nBanana milk is hella healthy, and and almond milk is *made* to be less calorie dense, as almonds also have a lot of fatty acids for weight loss (that also lend to a better flavor)\n\nAlso, cows milk may *contain* calcium, but it also leaches it from the body. High-protein foods such as meat, eggs and dairy make excessive demands on the kidneys, which in turn leach calcium from the body. One solution, then, isn't to increase our calcium intake, but to reduce our consumption of those proteins, so our bones don't have to surrender so much calcium. Not to mention the cholesterol, with heart disease being the #1 killer of humans.",

I'm not arguing against veganism, I've been vegan for years; I'm arguing against certain practices, and trying to emphasise how morally important they are. \n\nI tried to save a stoat from a (non poisonous) trap many years ago, but I had terrible luck and the executioner turned up about 10 seconds after I freed it. It ran into a bush, I argued with the rifle-wielding guy for a while, then my sister regrettably convinced me to leave. Soon after, I heard a gunshot, and I knew that beautiful animal whose eyes I'd just looked into was dead. I think that experience made me really care about these sorts of animals, and so when I hear about them being murdered and rats being barbarically poisoned etc, I can't stand it.",
