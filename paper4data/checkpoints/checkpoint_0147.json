"comment": "In Texas, we've seen the 30 year price of electricity actually tick slightly below inflation. Generally you'll see a bump in electricity price when a new power plant is put in, or other one-time evenets such as cap-and-trade hit the market.\n\nYou may also want to look into your utility's time-of-day metering option. Sometimes those options can be very beneficial to solar array owners, sometimes not.\n\nYou may want to see if the NSERDA incentive keeps your RECs, and if so, for how long. If the NSERDA subsidy keeps your RECs, then your accountant may feel comfortable treating it as a purchase rather than a subsidy (if it walks + talks like a duck, it's a duck). Treating the NSERDA check as taxable income + claiming the full basis for the tax credit may be financially beneficial. I think NSERDA used to return the RECs to you after 3 years, and you can likely expect $0.02/kwh in REC value at that point.\n\nFinally, you may want to price out your system. Quality contractors with quality installs often hold their price high because they know their market value. However, you can usually get a quality install done for &lt;$3.50/W using decent modules and great inverters - the risk being the installation contractor may not be around 10 years from now. Personally, I'd rather keep the money, but you might feel differently.\n\nSo you can use those techniques to squeeze your return down sooner. A 9 year simple payback isn't enough to excite most people, but it's pretty good with solar. Both inverters + modules can come with 25 year performance warranties, and at $4/W, that is what I'd expect.\n\nPS. You might also want to consider adding a home energy monitor such as a TED5000 or E-gauge into your costs. Being able to see the solar production as a function of your home energy consumption can be useful for time-of-use metering or fine tuning your net-metering policy. Getting the 30% tax credit on it as part of your solar array is icing on the cake.",

"comment": "I disagree mainly because of the Volt. In many parts of the country the charging infrastructure isn't built up enough to get everywhere you need to go on electric. The Volt gets rid of range anxiety and allows you to drive as much as you can on electric before switching to gas. This allows it to be the only car that most people need. If you have something like a Leaf you can use it for most of your driving most of the time, but you will still need to own/rent/borrow a gas car occasionally for longer trips.\n\nIn fact, Volt drivers drive nearly as many electric miles as Leaf owners while only having about half of the electric range.\nhttp://evobsession.com/chevy-volt-drivers-average-nearly-as-many-electric-miles-as-nissan-leaf-drivers/\n\nI applaud the Tesla supercharger network, but most people can't afford a Tesla. As chargers continue to proliferate and battery technology continues to improve and get cheaper  hopefully we will all be able to go electric only.\n\nThe Ford Energis and Plugin Prius with their sub 20 mile range and weak performance are just barely better than their hybrid counterparts, but the Volt truly stands in a class of its own.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nEdit: The VW diesels are probably the wrong example to use if you're at all concerned about emissions. Up until the recent scandal I would have agreed that they are superior to most hybrids.",

"comment": "That's a fairly high power bill. Do you have electric heat? Or a lot of air conditioning?\n\nGenerally, you want to minimize your power consumption before sizing a solar system. That can mean installing better insulation/windows, changing heating and cooling systems, and replacing appliances with more efficient models.\n\nA grid-tie system does not require batteries - spare production is pumped back into the grid. If you're in a net-metering situation, you get a credit for power you put back on the grid. Then at night, or during the winter, you can use that credit to \"purchase\" power back from the grid. Essentially, you get to treat the grid as a 100% efficient battery that can store power between seasons (again: assuming you have that kind of net metering available - check with your utility).\n\nThe Tesla Powerwall does not include an inverter. In Tesla's ideal scenario, you would already have a compatible inverter with your solar installation.",

"comment": "Interesting analysis, but a couple things to consider.\n\nNet metering isn't quite as simple as you make it out to be. In the future, if you sell 1,000 kwh to the grid during the day, you won't get enough credits to buy 1,000 kwh back from the grid at night or on cloudy days. I would probably assume 80% return in 10-15 years, 60% in 15-25 years and 40% in 25-35 years, but of course that's just a wild guess. As this ratio decreases, the cost effectiveness of battery storage increases, but so does the overall cost of installation. I have 3,300 SF house and use an average of 50 kwh/day. I would probably need 2-3 Powerwalls and significant additional panel capacity to charge them in order to correct for future changes to net metering policies.\n\nYour estimate of $20,000 to replace asphalt roof shingles on 3,000 SF house seems high, even for southern CA.  $10,000 is probably a better number and probably closer to $7,500 for much of the US.  Maybe $20,000 includes ancillary costs such as gutters, rotted wood, etc. but those costs shouldn't be included in this analysis.  In other words, I think maybe you are using worst-case numbers for traditional roof and best case numbers for Tesla roof.\n\nWon't Powerwalls need to be replaced during the 30 year analysis period that you're looking at?  Not sure if that was factored in.",

"comment": "To be fair, the title is very valid. With the Bolt hitting the market, I don't see why anyone would pay roughly the same price for something like a Leaf, Soul EV, e-Golf, Focus Electric, Smart Electric, etc. (or more than the Bolt, with the i3) and get significantly less than half the range. The 2011-2016 wave of BEVs are, certainly, about to die off, except for used sales but even that's dubious.\n\nThis is exactly why I just bought a used Volt instead of a new Soul EV--I needed a car a few months ago, but I really want a Bolt, so I need to have a reasonable percentage resale value which I don't feel a sub-200km EV will have with a 380km one on the market.\n\nRest of the article, aside from the title, is garbage though.",

"comment": "I find it hard to fathom that for those that spent a good amount of money on an S or X, they would be so heavily concerned with saving a few dollars at the expense of inconvenience charging at a supercharger. There has to be some logic missing here, because that is a little too simplistic. Maybe they don't have a charger at home, or only have a 12a connection which doesn't work well with their car usage? I don't think \"they're just accustomed to going to gas stations\" is a fully encompassing perspective either. Saying that charging a phone at home is as convenient as charging a car at home is not a great similes if you a) don't have a plug, or b) you don't have the option of a faster charger for whatever reason.\n\nIt's clear that current owners have a vested interest in not wanting their free lifetime access feature being overburdened by the unwashed masses of M3 owners clogging it up.  And equally so, Tesla has a vested interest in not wanting to have that SC network used for anything other than distance travel, due in large part to not wanting to take on the responsibility/burden of running them like gas stations. Certainly valid perspectives all around.\n\nIt's still early days, and there's plenty of demand to offset/ignore the much avoided obstacle of home charging that many will face not being able to do.  But at some point when even more of these cars are being sold, and the expectation are that EVs should replace the ICE, this will need to be solved.  Maybe not with superchargers, but with what then?  Will condos and rentals move fast enough to meet the speed and push for EVs?\n\nI personally believe this whole supercharging question is really just dancing around that problem, and pointing to everything else instead. It was ironic that the person asking Elon the question about supercharging, also mentioned the need for multiple tire changes. That too is something that quite often gets left out in a standard Tesla discussion.",

"comment": "&gt;There are other ways to help out that aren’t just about being selfish.\n\nIt's unreal how you see people buying fruits and vegetables instead of meat and dairy as a selfish action.\n\n&gt;Why not go out and make a real difference in the world if you truly care about animals?\n\nI am. I'm doing exactly what this article recommends:\n\n[Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth)\n\n&gt;Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The new analysis shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories and 37% of protein, it uses the vast majority – 83% – of farmland and produces 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions. Other recent research shows 86% of all land mammals are now livestock or humans. The scientists also found that even the very lowest impact meat and dairy products still cause much more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable and cereal growing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The study, published in the journal Science, created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90% of all that is eaten. It assessed the full impact of these foods, from farm to fork, on land use, climate change emissions, freshwater use and water pollution (eutrophication) and air pollution (acidification).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Agriculture is a sector that spans all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”",

Combine that with all road markings in NYC are reflective and even in dry conditions you slide over them.  And the Green bike lane paint why when dry isn't that huge of an issue.  Once water is on them you'll slide all over them.  \n\n\nI would not get a T8 (Zero 8, FFR Horizion, Apollo Light) as it has one solid tire and single brake which is also that tire.  \nBut do not buy any used scooter as your first scooter.

Isn't there a 200k sales limit before the credit is phased out (I guarantee you that Ford will go way over that thanks to the F150L)?\n\nAlso, has anyone seen an option for a sunroof on the F150 Lightning? The truck displayed for the reveal (and President Biden's speech) had one, but I don't see it anywhere in the spec sheet...\n\nI know a lot of people on this sub are gonna hate me for this, but I really do appreciate how Ford is sticking with traditional controls and such for the gear shifter and the climate controls. It'll ease the transition for former ICE owners so they don't have to re-learn everything, it'll look and feel almost exactly as it did before.\n\nAnd I know people WILL hate me for this, but I've always had this idea of installing a fake exhaust and playing various engine sounds to mimic either an ICE V8 or even something sci-fi-esque like something from Star Wars (I can leave it silent for when I commute during pre-dawn hours or if I really do want some peace and quiet on my commute home). Milltek makes something like that for Teslas, so I don't have any reason to think it can't be done for the F150 Lightning.",

"comment": "&gt; But surely an ICE vehicle still requires planning for fuel stops, depending on how far you go, also loading an ice car up with luggage etc is also going to affect range.\n\nHardly. \n\nI can go 450 miles in my ICE. If it's 10 F out and I'm traveling with a car full of stuff going 80-85 MPH, I can still go 400 miles before needing to refuel.\n\nI'd need an EV with a 600-700 mile EPA rated range to perform similarly in the same circumstances. \n\nBut even then it's not going to be remotely close to the same given how rare DCFC stations are compared to gas stations.\n\nIn the real world where EVs have 250-300 EPA rated ranges, I have to stop to charge 2-3 times as often.",

This is basically just an international standard outlet for the same power line you'd use to hook up an 11kW level 2 wallbox. There are lockable outlet types for these.\n\nAnd then you buy a portable 11 kW charger with a compatible plug, and keep it in your car when not using it.",

I always knew you had to have a tax burden of at least $7,500 in order to get it, mind you, but I never put much thought into just how much money you'd have to make to have enough tax burden.  All I know is my tax burden is DEFINITELY high enough, so that was that for me.\n\nAlthough I think it is important to highlight that your source there mentions that the figure was 44% before the pandemic, and only rose to 57% in the year after the pandemic, with federal financial aid identified as a big part of the reason why it rose so much.  That clarifying point out of the way, even 44% is higher than I expected.  I suppose the \"standard deduction\" going up so much under the Trump-era shake up of the tax code probably contributes to this, too.",

Even if it had 40 miles of range when it gets cold the engine fires up (even if heat is not really needed). The engine runs for 2 minutes (not actually warming up leading to condensation and fuel dilution of the oil). Repeat this multiple times per day for 4 to 5 months and nothing good  happens.  I don't hate ICE for long distance travel, but prefer EV for my driving patterns. \n\nIf the OP is ok with 7 passengers the Kia EV9, Tesla model X and Rivian R1S could be options. The rivian with the max pack battery should get into the 300+ miles of highway range and will have supercharger network access in the next few months.",

"comment": "As a residential solar installer, we avoid these like the plague.  Installation and maintenance are terrible.  You have to tear up the roof to do the most basic things like replace a broken tile.  It might look a little nicer since it is integral to the roof, but the problem is they are also *integral to the roof*.  Ugh.  We are doing an install next week where we are just ripping up an existing 3.5kW system that was producing 1.7kW after only 4 years, and installing a regular system in its place.  \n\nI feel these systems are just only slightly better than terrible ideas like Solar Roadways.  They might be easier or better for new home builders, which is typically where you see them installed.\n\nJust my 2 cents~",

Being able to go from 16% to 19% means 18% more energy in the same space. Module efficiency has been slowly inching up - I'm expecting a pop now. And the rest of the manufacturers are going to be forced to step their game up over the next couple of years.\n\nOf course, those LG Neons are in short supply...but they're still nice products.",

The release is when it is available, even in limited amounts.  And for it to be available they have to give the specs and price.     Mush announced that the release is (currently) planned to be mid 2017, 3 quarters of a year away.\n\n&gt; in my honest opinion, this will cause people to hold off and NOT get solar. \"because that solar roof is coming out in a year or so!\".\n\nMy opinion as well.\n\n&gt; So then, they either talk to solar city and wait until the roof details come out...\n\nThis is my concern.   SolarCity sales reps has a history of giving out misleading or flat out inaccurate information.  We have many that were told by SolarCity reps that their bill was too small to go solar, or that their home was not good for solar because they had too small of a bill.   Well What they really were saying is that the bill was too small for SolarCity to make a profit.   Other installers have no problem installing smaller systems etc.",

"comment": "&gt; Outside of the major regulated utility markets like Austin and San Antonio that offer net metering, there isn't as much demand for customer-sited residential and commercial solar.\n\nThis is what I'm trying to corroborate with data. I've found some other information like ERCOT's LTSA (long term assessment) where they are considering alternates with high levels of solar over 10+ years, for example. Rooftop is a factor in a few of the scenarios. But their various analyses are predicated on a number of economic factors, such as natural gas prices.\n\nAnd other studies I have read are more uniform that for 2016 and maybe a few years following, Texas will primarily be THE boom state for utility solar. So there are mixed projections.\n\n&gt; and component costs continuing to plummet\n\nAnd I've read opinions from Bloomberg (NEF) and GTM that dropping panel and inverter (?) costs will boost sales in Texas. But that seems optimistic more than a solid conclusion because the financial incentive to save isn't strong even it a system may have a 6 month earlier ROI, or whatever.  \n\nI just wonder if Texas leads in utility scale and being deregulated mostly gives the sellers a chance to satisfy a lot of homeowners that they are buying green energy without having to invest on their roofs. For example.",

"comment": "APS is the utility that covers Phoenix and a large portion of Arizona. They basically changed the ratio so that you don't get a one-to-one exchange of power generated versus Power consumed. From what I understand existing solar customers are grandfathered in to the original net metering rules for 20 years. I don't know what the new net metering exchange rate is but it's not as generous as the one to one ratio that I and other solar customers have. The Grandfather Clause is basically part of a negotiated agreement between APS and the major solar players in Arizona. So, net metering still exists, but it's just not AZ beneficial for solar homes as it used to be",

Meaning, they benefit from the SRECs, contracted with both the original system owner and the administrator, and would be the likely party responsible for any costs associated with default, etc. So in a sane world it would be in their best interest to help you clear this up fast in the legal sense. Are they silent to your requests??  (By the way, I am not an attorney, so I'm simply guessing and using a little past experience.)",

"comment": "NY has a laundry list of programs and incentives for all types of energy systems and energy efficiency projects. And it can get complicated. I believe there is a least one rebate administered through [NYSun](http://ny-sun.ny.gov/) which is tied to NYSERDA and requires a professional installation. There may be other requirements around both the installation and location - where ground or rooftop might be qualifiers - for different programs.\n\nFor the federal tax credit you can install yourself.\n\nNormally for rooftop solar you need to check with your insurance company, too. For ground mount I would still check in with an agent to make sure you follow the requirements, especially if you want coverage. Some carriers do make distinctions.",

Battery inverters are going to become standard \\(way more competition\\) and cousin Schneider is so much bigger and already has a few years experience with a 600V charge controller. I don't think most grid\\-tied solar installers will tolerate 150V circuits. And SMA has a better lead when it comes to micro\\-grids.\n\nActually I think the best solution is one that will get you smacked across the head when you talk about it with the tech support guys... which is combining multiple battery chemistry in a baseload FLA master / dynamic Lithium Ion slave.\n\nOne could even build such a system with market\\-leading products, such as a DC\\-coupled StorEdge in demand management mode at the bottom of the busbar, combined with a 600V Schneider charge controller SHARING THE SAME DC BUS and charging an FLA battery bank connected to ANY BRAND 48V battery inverter... let's just say AIMS for now. Put that AIMS transfer switch to work even, landing at the TOP of the busbar to remain grid\\-connected until it's time to cut the shackles and free the monster from the grid entirely.\n\nYes, we're talking [Frankensolar](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdltQPzVMAEty-6.jpg:large). The concept makes SolarEdge tech support wet the bed, gets you a very stern look from u/butchdeal, and a warning about overamperage causing MPPT collapse from Schneider... but honestly, I think it would work.",

I'm just a tad leary of the microinverter route in regards to warranty fulfillment and the related Envoy system as SunPower has ditched their own microinverter production (I think); basically vendor lock-in makes me somewhat nervous on a home project this size.",

If we could engineer some sort of panel mounts that would 'float' above the trees we could have our forests and our power too. Some plants will track the sun throughout the day, and if we could connect to that mechanism, we would have tree-powered solar trackers.   \nUnfortunately, trees grow and die in unexpected ways, so I don't expect this to become widespread and practical... but it's fun to think about!",

"comment": "The Heartland institute is a [propaganda group](https://www.desmogblog.com/heartland-institute), paid for by the fossil fuel industry to oppose climate science and keep their donors in business. They used to work for tobacco companies to deny the link between smoking and cancer and delay regulations, same playbook.\n\nLook, I'm not saying that renewables and their infrastructure have zero ecological footprint, that would be absurd. It's just that fossil fuels are by far the worst option.\n\nI also see mistakes in the second article:\n\n&gt; Every solar and wind plant needs a fossil fuel plant to back them up when the sun is not shining\n\nNo. It needs dispatchable energy sources, which don't have to be powered by fossil fuels. Hydroelectricity, hydrogen, thermal storage, liquid air, batteries etc are dispatchable and can be powered by wind and solar.\n\n&gt; We briefly mentioned the toxic substances used in the manufacturing of wind plants and even more in solar panels.\n\nNot worse than coal and gas. And they can be recycled very nicely. The exception is wind blades: can't really be recycled, but at least they can be crushed and used in concrete.\n\n&gt; Even more unnerving is the enormous amounts of fossil fuels burned and CO2 emitted to construct and stand these solar and wind “green-machines.”\n\nThis is misleading. The [lifecycle emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources) of solar and wind are ridiculously low compared to coal and natural gas plants.\n\n&gt; solar/wind plants after their 15 – 20-year service life\n\nBad numbers. I remember that 25 years is typical for solar\n\n&gt; Eco-destruction: In Figure 1,[e] we see the massive amounts of materials needed by the solar and wind industry. \n\nSure, if we omit the coal and natural gas themselves, and the massive atmospheric waste they generate, they look much better.\n\nEdit: Just noticed that the second article comes from [CFACT](https://www.desmogblog.com/committee-constructive-tomorrow), which is another climate denial lobby.

"comment": "Planet of the humans is a hot mess of misinformation. See these [reviews](https://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/films-for-actions-statement-on-planet-of-the-humans/):\n\n&gt; While the film makes many important points, we are disheartened and dismayed to report that the film is also full of misinformation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) - so much so that for half a day we removed the film from the site.\n\nEverything they say about solar, wind and storage is essentially wrong. The only valid criticism was about biomass, which is indeed problematic (although not always). Also, biomass is a tiny fraction of the energy mix so people don't really care about it.\n\nBatteries can be recycled, and their cost is still plummeting.\n\nSolar+batteries only is a very naive way to power a city. Things work a lot better when other technologies are added to the mix (wind, hydro, hydrogen) and importantly when the city is connected to the rest of the continent. The variability of solar in a single city is considerable compared to the variability of solar+wind over a large region, so the isolated city needs to pay a fortune in storage.\n\nSolar panels can be recycled, and even the new ones produced with dirty coal electricity (so, the worst case scenario for solar) have a minuscule carbon footprint compared to coal or natural gas. Planet of the humans lied to the public about this point. Same thing for wind turbines.\n\nYes, car batteries [can be used](https://cleantechnica.com/2017/10/24/finland-gets-1st-public-bidirectional-v2g-charging-station/) to store electricity for the grid.",

"comment": "As far as I know, modern power electronics are able to maintain whatever grid stability is required assuming that there is sufficient power (from solar panels and/or batteries) available. 1/60th of a second is an eternity at 'electronic speeds.' People sometimes ascribe near-magical properties to the mechanical inertia provided by spinning generators which doesn't seem well justified. That being said, the difficult part with a 'solar-only' grid is is the 'sufficient power' requirement, as the sun very reliably goes down every night, and provides significantly less light during the winter months than summer months (at least in the northern parts of the USA). A straightforward (if expensive) solution would be to significantly overbuild solar capacity and couple it with an enormous number of batteries. \n\nThankfully there are many different ways of generating electrical power that can coupled together, and we need not rely on just one. Hydro, solar, wind, nuclear, geothermal and gas can be combined to generate a very low carbon grid, it's just an optimization problem of what the most economical way of achieving the desired emissions / reliability target we want. \n\nThe cell phone network is an interesting example of where we were willing to accept much worse quality and reliability because the cost and convenience of cell phones was so much better than land line phones. It's not hard to imagine heating/cooling systems that make use of 'thermal batteries' (think block of ice or tank of hot water) to much better match their demand to available power production - many power companies already do something similar with 'time-of-use' rates.",

Without question you should identify 2-3 LOCAL reputable installers and choose one of them based on perceived quality of work, then on price. All installers have equal access to pretty much every type/brand of equipment and they pay mostly the same rates regardless of volume (volume discounts for installers rarely drop by more than $0.05/W).\n\nFor string inverters you would only want SMA, for microinverters you only want Enphase, and RUN AWAY from anyone that even speaks the name SolarEdge out loud.",

"comment": "Bloomington, IN here. Wholesale would probably be about $0.03/kwh + 25% so maybe $0.05/kwh vs $0.11-$0.14/kwh. The different is significant. However, so far the courts have ruled in Indiana that when they reconciled production vs. consumption numbers, that it is done at the end of the billing period and not in real time. That means the net-metering aspects is less of a big deal, but would result in higher bills during poor solar months. As long as you send back enough power by the end of the month you would be good to go, is my understanding.\n\nI have Duke Energy as my local utility. I sent them the design they approved it, and I signed the net metering contract at that point. I had a year from that point to complete installation and obtain authority to operate. Might be worth finding out from your utility if the NM agreement needs to be signed by 6/30/22 or if the systems needs to be commissioned by 6/30/22. Hope this helps.",

"comment": "I ended up passing on solar because my specific utility net metering calculation is done every month. In the spring and fall when I overproduce, I get a credit at a wholesale price of $0.025/kWh. When I underproduce in the summer, I buy at a price of $0.12/kWh. So when my solar system was sized for 100% offset for how many kWh I use, it does not align with offsetting my electric bill because of the way my net metering works. I calculated I would offset 70% of the cost of my current electric bill, and that savings was not enough for me to justify the spend, either financed or cash.\n\nYour $26k in cash essentially pays you a return of $115/month (or whatever you monthly bill is if your bill will actually be reduced to $0). Compare that to what you could earn in the market (typically a 7% return is average).\n\nI get that electricity prices will increase 12% this year, but look at the rate prices have historically increased on average. In my area, the average was 3-4%. \n\nLastly, I approached this from a purely fiscal savings perspective. There is an intangible value of buying solar, reducing your carbon footprint, pride from producing your own energy, etc. Each individual places a different value on these items. So while it may not be a clearly less expensive option to go solar, maybe it is worth it to pay extra for one of the intangible reasons.",

With most hybrid inverters I am familiar with, there is no practical limit on the battery storage capacity which can be connected to a hybrid inverter. My IQ7 micros don't know or care how much battery capacity is connected to my hybrid inverter.\nI disagree that the concept of battery storage capacity applies to all GT inverters (non grid forming inverters). It is not purely electrical as you stated. \n\nI do agree that the maximum of AC coupled GT inverters is typically specified by most hybrid inverter manufacturers, but the ratio varies.",

I'm going to install 3-4 INSIDE cameras that is linked to a cloud or something like that so no one can mess with them... so I need to find away to power the modem for the internet and the cameras when we are not there. My thought was to have 1 or 2 batteries that is hooked to solar panels mounted on the inside of some of my window and run the modem and cameras off the batteries. If the cameras and panels are outside someone can just pull them down and the take my stuff. \n\nCameras. wireless, rechargeable with USB \n\nMost will run 6 months on one charge",

"comment": "There's significant interrow shadowing that affects both grids, especially during the winter months. It's about optimizing the system but perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to see how these inverters perform on someone else's roof (If I can find proper data). That way I can use this year to find out if they actually give the performance boost that validates the investment in the first place.\n\nAnd you're correct, I have the MOD9000-X inverter. With such a big overcapacity (I have two power meters, the main one with a contract for cheap power that I use for the house and the second one to sell all the solar power at double the price of the main meter), I can sell about 5000/6000 kWh a year so if the inverters produce 3000/4000 kWh extra over let's say 5 years, an increase of less than 5% over the total, the investment would be IMO one to execute. \n\nSince my labor is free (no rules over here other than the installation needs to be 'sound and solid') and I already have the cables the new installation requires on the roof the additional costs next to the inverters isn't too much.\n\nSo it (still) comes down to what micro inverter to use and I'm hoping that folks will share their experiences so I can make a definitive decision.",

"comment": "It's not the batteries themselves losing charge it is the power consumed by the inverters when running in standby.\n\nI have two Tesla Powerwalls, they seem to lose 3% every two days.\n\nOn the day after being charged to 100% they still show 100% then on the second day they suddenly drop to 97%. That then takes about 0.5kWh per Powerwall to recharge. This is equivalent to 250Wh per Powerwall per day or 20W.\n\nIn the winter I don't have much production and find that I can reduce the loss by a factor of two by turning off one of the Powerwalls. A single Powerwall has enough power to act as backup and during an outage I turn on the second Powerwall to provide the extra capacity.\n\nWhen turned off the Powerwall still loses some charge but is only equivalent to about 1W. I usually swap which battery is disabled every week to ensure they are both charged if needed for an outage.\n\nThe Enphase batteries have many smaller inverters so I'm not surprised the total consumption in standby is higher. \n\nDuring the summer when there is more solar available I will leave the Powerwalls enabled as it may need the extra power capability if an outage occurs while A/C is running.",

"comment": "That’s a deal so good I’m not sure I’d believe it. First, it is an 8.8 kW system (22x400w panels). Tesla Powerwall (13.5 kWh) or enphase (10 kWh) batteries would do the trick, although if you went with enphase you’d only have to use one monitoring platform (Tesla’s kind of sucks in my opinion). \nMy question would be why is that battery so cheap? And what are they planning on backing up with it? One powerwall has a 20 amp output so you can’t backup any loads larger than that, which usually excludes electric dryers, larger ac units, electric boilers, that kind of thing. So with one powerwall you’re usually wiring a critical loads panel, which is more labor for an electrician. To me it looks like they’re selling the battery at just the equipment cost excluding the labor. Suspicious.\nBut long story short, if it’s legit it’s a screaming deal.",

"comment": "I'm not sure what you mean \"have the system set up to do that\". The Hyundai, Kia, Genesis EVs all support V2L. Some other cars can, too, but I don't know exactly which ones. That means you can either [buy an adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Lectron-Adapter-Compatible-Hyundai-Ioniq/dp/B0BKL3DL5L?ref_=ast_sto_dp) that plugs into your CCS1 charging port that gives you a standard receptacle, or on the Limited/Top End model cars, there is a socket built into the car.\n\nAll I need after that is an extension cord to my fridge.  I bought the adapter ($99) so I didn't need to leave a window cracked to snake a cord thru. My fridge is a side-by-side with a freezer, 3-year old LG model, and is rated at 3.3A. It regularly draws 78W when closed, doing its thing, according to my [Leviton intelligent breaker](https://leviton.com/products/lwhem-2) that is [monitoring that circuit](https://leviton.com/products/lb115-dst).\n\nA 78W draw on continuously is 1.872 kWh per day. The Ioniq 6 has a 77.4 kWh battery, but I certainly wouldn't want to use it all on my fridge. Assuming I'm willing to use 45 kWh for V2L power, that's **24 days** of powering my refrigerator before having to recharge my car. Adding my Internet infrastructure of two wifi hotspots, cable modem, Ethernet switch, and firewall is another 75W draw, so I can just cut that in half to **12 days** of powering all of that on my car.\n\nIdeally, I'd get a whole-home battery setup with an inverter to allow all that to be ran when I want to drive away without leaving the house in the dark. If I lived somewhere where 7+ day power outages were something to expect, I'd be looking VERY hard at solar + storage to not have to deal with all that.",

"comment": "You don’t mention the solar PV size, your Ev’s battery size, what big load your home has, and if you are doing any of those things from the PV (during the day) or pulling from the grid.\n\nWith that being said, I’ve seen 2-3 solar apps (Tesla, Enphase, and others) that specifically tell you how much KWh were *pulled* from the grid. Check to see what those numbers are. The “collected” amount is not vital for this question since you could’ve used it all yourself (best scenario), or you could’ve exported it all to use at a later time with transmission charges and fees (worse scenario).\n\nThe amount you posted (if they were home use) are not even average, they are below what I see single households use.\n\nThe utility maybe cannot tell you how much or when but they can definitely tell since x date the meter measured y KWh. Where I live the water meters are checked every 8-12 weeks, over time you are charged the correct amount since the meter will be rechecked but I am not being charged the “correct” amount” for the “correct” month.\n\nCheck to see what the process is to dispute those charges if you believe they are excessive after comparing with your apps. And bring a claim against them in the forum the use with you evidence and logic.\n\nYou might learn about hidden fees and tricks they have to avoid crediting your PV 1:1 or similar.\n\nTLDR: what are your actual grid use numbers? Vs What are they saying are your grid use numbers? Is the difference in KWh/$ worth to argue over? If yes appeal the bill, if not, document and use in the future when they repeat their mistake and the amount becomes worthy of your time and money. Find out how long you have for appeals since often it’s something like 30 days so you might loose your chance if you sleep on it.\n\nGL",

"comment": "In it's entirety? The thing is less than 1200 words. What is the matter with you? 1200 words; you have typed and read more than that in explaining your refusal to actually read the link. Here, I will save you some time:\n\n&gt; This will not be an easy column to write. I am about to put down 1,200 words in support of a book that starts by attacking me and often returns to this sport. But it has persuaded me that I was wrong. More to the point, it has opened my eyes to some fascinating complexities in what seemed to be a black and white case.\n\n&gt; In the Guardian in 2002 I discussed the sharp rise in the number of the world's livestock, and the connection between their consumption of grain and human malnutrition. After reviewing the figures, I concluded that veganism \"is the only ethical response to what is arguably the world's most urgent social justice issue\". I still believe that the diversion of ever wider tracts of arable land from feeding people to feeding livestock is iniquitous and grotesque. So does the book I'm about to discuss. I no longer believe that the only ethical response is to stop eating meat.\n\n&gt; In Meat: A Benign Extravagance, Simon Fairlie pays handsome tribute to vegans for opening up the debate. He then subjects their case to the first treatment I've read that is both objective and forensic. His book is an abattoir for misleading claims and dodgy figures, on both sides of the argument.\n\n&gt; There's no doubt that the livestock system has gone horribly wrong. Fairlie describes the feedlot beef industry (in which animals are kept in pens) in the US as \"one of the biggest ecological cock-ups in modern history\". It pumps grain and forage from irrigated pastures into the farm animal species least able to process them efficiently, to produce beef fatty enough for hamburger production. Cattle are excellent converters of grass but terrible converters of concentrated feed. The feed would have been much better used to make pork.\n\n&gt; Pigs, in the meantime, have been forbidden in many parts of the rich world from doing what they do best: converting waste into meat. Until the early 1990s, only 33% of compound pig feed in the UK consisted of grains fit for human consumption: the rest was made up of crop residues and food waste. Since then the proportion of sound grain in pig feed has doubled. There are several reasons: the rules set by supermarkets; the domination of the feed industry by large corporations, which can't handle waste from many different sources; but most important the panicked over-reaction to the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises.\n\n&gt; Feeding meat and bone meal to cows was insane. Feeding it to pigs, whose natural diet incorporates a fair bit of meat, makes sense, as long as it is rendered properly. The same goes for swill. Giving sterilised scraps to pigs solves two problems at once: waste disposal and the diversion of grain. Instead we now dump or incinerate millions of tonnes of possible pig food and replace it with soya whose production trashes the Amazon. Waste food in the UK, Fairlie calculates, could make 800,000 tonnes of pork, or one sixth of our total meat consumption.\n\n&gt; But these idiocies, Fairlie shows, are not arguments against all meat eating, but arguments against the current farming model. He demonstrates that we've been using the wrong comparison to judge the efficiency of meat production. Instead of citing a simple conversion rate of feed into meat, we should be comparing the amount of land required to grow meat with the land needed to grow plant products of the same nutritional value to humans. The results are radically different.\n\n&gt; If pigs are fed on residues and waste, and cattle on straw, stovers and grass from fallows and rangelands – food for which humans don't compete – meat becomes a very efficient means of food production. Even though it is tilted by the profligate use of grain in rich countries, the global average conversion ratio of useful plant food to useful meat is not the 5:1 or 10:1 cited by almost everyone, but less than 2:1. If we stopped feeding edible grain to animals, we could still produce around half the current global meat supply with no loss to human nutrition: in fact it's a significant net gain.\n\n&gt; It's the second half – the stuffing of animals with grain to boost meat and milk consumption, mostly in the rich world – which reduces the total food supply. Cut this portion out and you would create an increase in available food which could support 1.3 billion people. Fairlie argues we could afford to use a small amount of grain for feeding livestock, allowing animals to mop up grain surpluses in good years and slaughtering them in lean ones. This would allow us to consume a bit more than half the world's current volume of animal products, which means a good deal less than in the average western diet.\n\n&gt; He goes on to butcher a herd of sacred cows. Like many greens I have thoughtlessly repeated the claim that it requires 100,000 litres of water to produce every kilogram of beef. Fairlie shows that this figure is wrong by around three orders of magnitude. It arose from the absurd assumption that every drop of water that falls on a pasture disappears into the animals that graze it, never to re-emerge. A ridiculous amount of fossil water is used to feed cattle on irrigated crops in California, but this is a stark exception.\n\n&gt; Similarly daft assumptions underlie the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's famous claim that livestock are responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, a higher proportion than transport. Fairlie shows that it made a number of basic mistakes. It attributes all deforestation that culminates in cattle ranching in the Amazon to cattle: in reality it is mostly driven by land speculation and logging. It muddles up one-off emissions from deforestation with ongoing pollution. It makes similar boobs in its nitrous oxide and methane accounts, confusing gross and net production. (Conversely, the organisation greatly underestimates fossil fuel consumption by intensive farming: its report seems to have been informed by a powerful bias against extensive livestock keeping.)\n\n&gt; Overall, Fairlie estimates that farmed animals produce about 10% of the world's emissions: still too much, but a good deal less than transport. He also shows that many vegetable oils have a bigger footprint than animal fats, and reminds us that even vegan farming necessitates the large-scale killing or ecological exclusion of animals: in this case pests. On the other hand, he slaughters the claims made by some livestock farmers about the soil carbon they can lock away.\n\n&gt; The meat-producing system Fairlie advocates differs sharply from the one now practised in the rich world: low energy, low waste, just, diverse, small-scale. But if we were to adopt it, we could eat meat, milk and eggs (albeit much less) with a clean conscience. By keeping out of the debate over how livestock should be kept, those of us who have advocated veganism have allowed the champions of cruel, destructive, famine-inducing meat farming to prevail. It's time we got stuck in.",

To a vegan, even if the animal somehow doesn’t suffer in the process, it is still wrong to use it, keep it captive, forcibly inseminate it, take parts or products of its body, or slaughter it unnecessarily.\n\nI welcome the uptake of the vegan diet for health reasons, especially because it often leads to more mindfulness of a person's relationship with food and animals. People who eat vegetables sometimes turn into vegans.",

"comment": "[There's a link on the sidebar](http://vegetus.org/honey/honey.htm). Basically it comes down to the fact that the honey is replaced by nutrient-deficient sugar water, which weakens the hive. The hives themselves are damaging to the bees (bees keep their hives at a specific temp/humidity and keep it asceptic, and when you open it all the time you ruin that environment and potentially introduce pathogens). The hives are transported all over if they're pollinators, which exposes the bees to tons of new pathogens and weakens the hive. It's also an exploitation of animals (if you recognize insects as animals) which goes against the abolitionist view of veganism.\n\nIt's a pretty debated topic in the vegan world.",

I have found that by not setting boundaries for what I can and cannot eat the lines blur and eventually end up falling apart all together.  I had the same problem for a while and I tried to blame it on friends but eventually just had to realize that I don't really give a fuck what delicious meal anyone else around me is eating.  I am a vegan for my own health and I will be alive even when all of my omnivorous friends are dead. That's good enough reason for me.",

You don't have to throw it out, what you can do is let it run out and replace it as it happens. Soy, rice, almond or oat milk when the milk goes. Tofu, beans, lentils, peas and similar as the meat goes. \n\n&gt;Where do I begin? \n\nThere are a lot of resources out there. If you want help getting started The Vegan Society is there for you, and these people know their stuff. If you take their 30 day vegan pledge you get one on one mentoring and it is an awesome way to get started. \n\nhttp://www.vegansociety.com/veganpledge/\n\n&gt; I also am sorta bulky and I love to work out my body to stay in shape. I am worried about getting enough protein to sustain my work outs. \n\nThere are a bunch of communities that can help with fitness and muscle building. \n\nhttp://www.veganbodybuilding.com/\n\nI had a stint as a vegan bodybuilder in high school and gained a good amount and stayed in shape, even as a female vegan.\n\nBreakfasts with oat porridge, lunch could be home-made meatballs made with oats, beans and tofu packs a wicked protein punch especially eaten with wholemeal pasta and broccoli sides... \n\nIf you still feel like you need to supplement with protein powders you have a myriad of them at your disposal. Rice protein, soy protein, pea protein... so many things available!\n\nBegin at the very beginning. Read the resources, study what to do and if you falter and mess up in the beginning... that's okay. We all do.\n\n&gt;Anyway , I feel lost and overwhelmed, if there is anything you guys could suggest I do to start I would appreciate it very much.\n\nVegan Society and veganbodybuilding are great resources. Cruise around this subreddit, take a look at the links provided in this thread.\n\nOnly take the supplements you feel like you need. B12 and DHA microalgae oil capsules may be the only thing you should consider unless your doctor says otherwise.\n\nWe've all been new to this and a little bit lost, but you're awesome, and you're going to get there. Don't stress out, instead see it as an adventure!\n\nGood luck, and we're all here if you have more questions!",

I did a /r/progresspics post the other day - http://i.imgur.com/FdHpPdR.jpg\n\nThen I think sharing food with them either over my house or taking stuff to parties at their house that they found to be delicious. I've also made sure to not be judgy or bring up diet in conversation.\n\nThey came to me and asked for recipes and suggestions because they're all interested in being healthier, even if animal rights never came into their thoughts. My neighbors were already vegetarian, so going vegan wasn't that big of a switch. My wife has been adapting and slowly finding out that anything non-vegan makes her feel nauseated. My other friends just went out with me to Red Robin and got nothing but boca burgers for the whole table. I had no idea that was going to happen and it made me really happy.",

I'm having trouble finding the comment because it was to someone who wasn't vegan but needed a dairy-free option, as I remember. Basically he'd done the math and figured out that a 60/40 pea protein/brown rice protein mix was ideal? Or the other way around?\n\nRegardless, it's pretty affordable to order it that way: http://truenutrition.com/p-1126-custom-mix.aspx",

They live more than a couple of years.\n\nIf either of those answers involves killing, then it's obvious why backyard eggs are not vegan. Also, it's not ethical to support the breeding of egg-laying hens, because the intensive laying takes a huge toll on their body. They lay 300 eggs a year, while wild chickens lay a dozen eggs a year. Up to 30% (depending on breed) of laying hens develop ovarian cancer. Also bone problems, metabolic problems etc. What animal sanctuaries sometimes do is place hormonal implants in the hens to stop them from laying themselves to illness.",

"comment": "I would suggest learning some Indian style recipes as they're easy to make vegan and just add meat to. [Veg Recipes of India](http://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/) is an awesome resource for learning how to cook Indian food. \n\nStir fries of all kinds will also be fairly quick to make. [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/) is a great site that breaks down cost and time for recipes really well and has a large index.\n\nOther sites I would recommend checking out are [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/) and [Two Peas and Their Pod](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/) for recipes with good quality control and a good selection. \n\nI would also recommend considering getting an Instant Pot. Do some reading on their capabilities and see if you think it would be a good fit. We love being able to just throw some dry beans in and be good to go in less than an hour, which saves us time and money. They can also be used as a slow cooker and make yogurt if you eat it.\n\nHere are just a few recipes from my bookmarks that you could try:\n\n[Crispy Baked Peanut Tofu](https://minimalistbaker.com/crispy-peanut-tofu-cauliflower-rice-stir-fry/) - She uses cauliflower rice for this, but you could just use regular if you'd prefer.\n\n[Chickpea and Potato Masala](https://www.budgetbytes.com/2016/02/chana-aloo-masala-chickpea-and-potato-masala/)\n\n[Teriyaki Cauliflower Rice Bowls](https://yupitsvegan.com/teriyaki-cauliflower-rice-bowls/) - Bowls are another great, easy recipe that is highly customizable. Just choose a grain, bean/protein and whatever veggies and dressing you have on hand.\n\n[Roasted Cauliflower and Chickpea Tacos](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/roasted-cauliflower-and-chickpea-tacos/) - This is one of our all time favorite recipes, it's wonderful with avocado, bell pepper and hot sauce on it.\n\n[Tofu Omelets](http://www.isachandra.com/2010/07/tofu-omelets/) - Endless filling options for these. Isa Chandra's recipes are incredible so definitely have a look around on her website.\n\n[Acorn Squash Stuffed with Quinoa and Roasted Almonds](http://marinmamacooks.com/2013/11/acorn-squash-stuffed-quinoa-roasted-almonds/) - Stuffed squash is easy, cheap, very healthy and you can use whatever you've got - rice, couscous, quinoa, we even use chickpeas and veggies sometimes without a grain. \n\nIt's super cool that you're so supportive of your family. I hope this helps you out!",

JusRol do vegan croissants you put in the oven at home. \n\nIn your sandwich you could have hummus and roast veggies, vegan sausages (add avocado and beetroot and it's really good), or vegan cheese. Vegan sliced ham probably also exists but I've never tried it.\n\nSpag bol is easy to veganise, just use soy mince (try the freezer section of the supermarket) or boil some lentils and add those in place of the meat. Quorn mince is not vegan (it has egg) but it would be a step in the right direction and I think they are planning to veganise their range in the future. Many of the supermarket own-brand frozen veggie minces are vegan.\n\nYou can make a cheesy sauce for pasta by mixing soy milk with cornflour and nutritional yeast. Find nutritional yeast in the dried section of a larger supermarket, health food store, or buy online. Engevita is the main brand in the UK. It comes in a round tub with a bright orange lid.\n\nFor meat-and-two-veg type meals, use vegan meat replacements. I like Linda McCartney vegetarian range, which is mostly vegan. Or branch out and cook more automatically vegan stuff, like chickpea curry, bean stew, cashew nut stirfry, bean chili, or roast butternut squash with lentils. Loads of recipes online!",

Suggesting otherwise is pretty dumb as cutting meat out of one’s diet doesn’t commit you to eating nuts for the rest of your life. Beans, super greens, and a lot of other foods can fill the roll. \n\nAs far as income goes, food deserts do exist, but by and large which is less expensive? Spaghetti with sauce and meat or spaghetti with sauce and beans or nuts or spinach?\n\nAs for the white privileged argument, I’m pretty sure the nation of India would like a word. \n\nYour friends are probably cool and good people and fine activists but they are bullshitting you and themselves in this specific case simply because they don’t want to be mildly inconvenienced. It’s actually super common in activist circles and it’s ridiculously frustrating. Personally, I think you should just call them out and if they lose their shit about it they probably weren’t that good of friends or activists to begin with.",

Then 1 year goes by. Then 5. Then 10. And you start to realise that, in reality, there aren’t enough vegans to make a difference and… there probably never will be. \n\nFaced with this you can do two things: accept that philosophically veganism is the right thing to do, and stick with it, even if the world won’t. Or you can think that there’s no point, and move onto something else to make yourself feel less bad, with the hopes that that will change something, and rinse and repeat. \n\nI, personally, was afflicted with these same thoughts after being vegan for 8 years, and seriously wondered for a while about incorporating deer into my diet. But at the end, even if the world is cruel, it doesn’t mean I have to be, and so I’ve stuck with veganism anyway.",
