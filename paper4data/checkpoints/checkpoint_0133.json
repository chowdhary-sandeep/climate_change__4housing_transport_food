The pro/con list is the same pro/con list of \"loans vs. leases\" in general. \n\nAsk yourself: if leases are good, then why do people take out car loans instead of leasing cars? The same answers should be applicable to solar power.\n\nLeases work well in the following scenarios: \n1) you don't want to hold the asset on your books \n&gt; not applicable to residential leasing\n\n2) You don't want to use the asset for a long time\n&gt;not aplicable to residential leasing \n\n3) you don't have access to conventional financing\n&gt; this is why most invididuals take out solar leases, but today many banks will finance solar if you ask them to.\n\n4) Leases work well to manipulate upfront tax credits through corporate inversion\n&gt; this is why most solar leasing companies offer solar leases\n\nI'm happy to expand if you have questions.",

What 100 kW chargers are they referring to?\n\nThe Teslas peak at 135 kW for the S85 at low SOC, which is about 65 miles per 10 minutes. Tesla claims 40 minutes for an 80% charge, which averages to about 320 miles per hour, or about 50 miles per 10 minutes.\n\nA 25 minute 80% charge for the Soul EV would indeed be nice, but if it gets 80 highway miles per charge then that's closer to 150 miles per hour average, 25 miles per 10 minutes.",

"comment": "&gt; More than half the population are skeptical.\n\nBut of course! Of course they are. I don't pay much attention to what people say, I pay more attention to what they do. And their actions speak volumes. People buy smaller cars not to save the planet, but to save money. I remember when the oil prices shot above $100 a barrel about 10 years ago, all the car dealerships moved their trucks to the rear lots and brought the small cars in front. Last year, after the oil prices took a dive, the car industry reported a record quarter fueled by truck and SUV sales. Surprise, surprise, people like big gas-guzzling cars!\n\nIn my anecdotal experience I usually see that it is rather skeptics like Anthony Watts who has solar panels on his house and drives an electric car rather than Al Gore, who put their money where their mouth is. The only guy I know personally, that has a decent (more than a 10 gallon Home Depot bucket) rain water collection system is a hard-core Republican, NRA member, avid hunter, you know, the typical *denier* kind...",

You quote-mined two articles to find a part that says if all the electricity comes from coal generation, then an EV powered in such a way would have higher emissions than an ICE vehicle.\n\nBecause that's exactly what you were disagreeing with in the comment before. Therefore, not cherry picking.\n\n&gt;  I displayed the full quote, which showed that any other power generation mix makes EVs less emissions intensive than ICE vehicles.\n\nNo not \"any other generation mix\", under two specific generation sources, namely natural gas and low carbon power. The 'Shades of Green' study shows that electricity grids with generation mixes dominated by coal generation will produce higher carbon emissions in EVs than petrol cars.\n\n&gt; No, it wouldn't. I had moved up the nuclear component before that. The tool has a bug. Live with it.\n\nThat wouldn't affect the source of additional electricity to power the EVs.\n\n&gt; That's a huge climb down from your opening argument where you argued that \"That's because without changing any of the other levers, the increase in demand for electricity generation to power those electric vehicles would be met by additional fossil fuel power plants.\"\n\n&gt; You didn't call out coal specifically. The funny thing is that you accuse me of moving the goalposts.\n\nLast time I checked, coal was a fossil fuel. I assumed that if you wanted to check the data for yourself, you'd look at the tool. As soon as you contested that point, and stated that under no circumstances would switching to EVs from ICEs increase emissions, I focussed on coal generation as a simple counter, twice stating that \"*running an electric car using electricity generated from coal power stations is more carbon intensive than running a 20mpg petrol car*\" (which you still have yet to disprove).\n\nYou were the one to move the goalposts once I showed that the sources you provided support the straightforward claims I had been making.\n\nThe questions you need to be asking yourself are: \"*what is the carbon intensity of the generation mix of additional electricity that would be needed to power the widespread adoption of EVs and hydrogen powered cars, and how does that compare to the carbon intensity of petrol cars that would be replaced?*\", and \"*what additional carbon emissions would result from building the infrastructure needed to support the widespread adoption of EVs and hydrogen powered cars?*\", and possibly also \"*what emissions would be associated with prematurely taking petrol cars off the road before the end of their useful life in order to replace them with EVs?*\".\n\nThe data is there in the tool. There is no bug.",

"comment": "&gt;The Chevy Bolt is likely to get 160 miles of EPA range, I knocked it down to 120 miles for all weather, reliable range estimate.\n\n&gt;Your Tesla, on the other hand, is at least 200 miles of EPA range, which knocks down to 150 miles of all weather, reliable range estimate. If you ran range problems with 120 miles in your Tesla, then either you simply didn't charge enough or something else is wrong. Or you have one of the rare 40's.\n\nI really think most Teslas don't really get the advertised range. For example they say 250 for the 85 but most people get like 220. The loaner 85 we had when we were in for service only got about that much (and I drive quite efficiently - [I made this trip a couple days ago!]( http://i.imgur.com/3au7aLw.jpg))\n\n&gt;As for 120 miles a day, DoT has a number of studies on driving habits in the U.S. 120 miles a day is definitely an outlier situation, given their statistics.\n\nEven if those 120 mile days are 1% of trips (keeping in mind that trips to/from work are the majority), I don't hink its unreasonable to argue that a large number of people are going to want to avoid that pain in the ass every 2-3 months.\n\n&gt;I firmly believe in 40-80 amp J1772 destination charging as being necessary for widespread BEV adoption. However, we do need to be smart about where it goes and put money in the right kinds of infrastructure to help us move to widespread BEV adoption. Putting in J1772's at Walgreens, for example, is a waste. Putting in 25 kW or even 50 kW CHAdeMO/CCS is also a waste due to the high expense and limited rate.\n\nI agree. However, I'd argue the great majority of chargers are privately funded so they can put them wherever someone is willing to pay. Highway corridors and near restaurants and shopping centers are quite reasonable places for them (locally, quite a few of the oasis rest stops have CHAdeMO chargers). Your point about the high expense and limited rate of 25/50kW L3s is basically my argument about L2s (which I think should have at least 10kW capacity).\n\nEdit: missing a word",

"comment": "Agreed. I've put about 9k on mine since I leased it in March. Optioned out with sport package and sunroof I pay $129/mo with $2500 down and got a cheque from CA for $2500 so net $0 down. It DEFINITELY helps to live in San Diego where most of my destinations include charging. I live about an hour out of the city in the far eastern mountain suburbs of San Diego. I use the level 1 charger at home over night and have a level 2 charger I installed at my office. I can get by charging at home for the regular commute and use the level 2 at the office to fill up if I do any extra driving around throughout the day. Going to hotels downtown or to the parks I am always around chargers. I get great parking everywhere and probably spend $15 a month charging at these destination chargers. It's definitely more complicated than gas but I love it. I've wanted an electric car since I was a kid and the challenge of managing my charging is actually really fun for me. I've met some cool people charging around town. All the dealerships like to let different brands charge. I charge at BMW dealers all the time. I grab some coffee and shoot the shit with the sales staff every time. The only negative experience I've had charging is at Mossy Nissan locations, they all have empty chargers but they are super crappy to you if you didn't buy your car from them. \n\nComing from my STi and JCW MINI the Fiat is actually quick. Instant tourque has corrupted me.",

Maybe i misspoke with ten years and more towards 15 yrs, every automaker thought profitable BEVs were 30+ years away which has turned out to be false. And sure everyone saw solar as the energy source of the future but based on the costs at the time and efficiencies it was assumed that it was much further away. \n\nMy point is only from the perspective of the automakers hydrogen was a safer less disruptive bet for them.  All the down sides you mention for hydrogen were already part of the status quo, and when your already one of the entrenched business there is less motivation to risk a disruption. Your suggestion of comparing the 2 technologies do not take into account where they were over ten years ago",

"comment": "1) Use dsireusa.org to learn more detail about incentives that you're eligible for, and check out the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association (2glrea.org) to learn more about what resources you have at hand (companies and people who can coach you).  \n\n2) As to incentives and DIY vs. installer:  I don't think Michigan is among the places you need to use a certified installer, but judging from how much you don't know by way of your questions, I don't think you're prepared for DIY.  You may be handy and crafty, but you do need some specialized skills and knowledge - plus, the Fed tax credit is restricted to system components that meet certain certified criteria.  Most state and local incentives do too.  \n\n3) A grid-tied system simply supplements your grid sourced power.  Assuming your installation was wired correctly (to code, etc.), you do not need to be concerned whether your power used on site is coming from the grid or your system - the inverter feeds its power in to your load center (or sometimes to the utility side) whether you're using it on premise or not - you either consume all that power on site or send surplus to the grid for others to use.  Depending on how your utility addresses metering - some fit you out with a digital meter that registers reverse flow, some still have you install a second meter to register reverse flow - your system simply displaces what you might use from the grid or it offers surplus to the utility.  \n\n4) Incremental approach seems smart for you - you need not worry about generating enough for all your needs this way.  However, if your whole goal is to lower your utility bill, you ought to work on end use efficiency first, like LEDs and Energy Star appliances, etc., either before or in conjunction with installing PV.  Every dollar you invest in more efficient use is several dollars less needed for on site generation.  More bang for the buck in efficiency than renewable, don't you know?!",

"comment": "No, actually, it's a valid point.  Tailpipe emissions are often something all the anti-electric car people (that I've talked to) seem to overlook.  Even if you're in a coal area and have tons of dirty coal-burning plants, would you rather have piles of particulates, NOx, and VOCs spread all over your home town by gas and diesel burning vehicles?  Wouldn't you rather the pollution be concentrated off someplace in the power plant areas?  It's lots easier and more efficient to add some big scrubbers to the dirty power plants than have every vehicle carry emissions gadgets and cataltyic converters (which further kill the efficiency of the ICE.)  So even if EVs were no less efficient than ICEVs, in my opinion it's still worth switching to them because they are so clean.\n\nTL;DR: EVs make less smog.",

I agree with you, flexibility was one of the biggest factors in my decision to buy a Volt.

"comment": "1. The air conditioner fan makes more noise than the engine. It is basically wind and road noise. \n\n2. Not much maintenance. No oil changes, no emission tests. The tires have to be rotated which can be easy to forget when you aren’t doing regular oil changes. Windshield wipers and wiper fluid needs to be replaced. The Chevy bolt needs the battery coolant flushed after 150,000 miles. \n\n3. Mostly maintance and the price of fuel. My wife originally leased a Honda Fit EV to replace her 13 year old Honda Accord. The lease price was less than what she was paying in gas, and it had unlimited mileage. We racked up 40,000 miles in two years. I was on the fence about EVs until we actually owned one. Now we are all EV. \nBeing able to charge at home for cheap is a big part of why we got EVs. \n\n4. The Honda Fit EV maxes out at 80 mph, but it isn’t hard to get up there. Tesla is very easy to get from 60 mph to 120 mph. My wife  routinely drive 90 mph, but that’s because the autopilot turns off above 90 mph. I haven’t driven the Chevy bolt, but I hear it is a great car as well. This is a pretty good review of the bolt here https://youtu.be/d2ogGZXmepY?t=11m30s\n\nIf you happen to be interested in a tesla(new or inventory model), I can give you my referral code for $1k off and free supercharging.",

"comment": "Sorry for the long post. TL;DR version: tesla unveil between 1.5-2 years before production so likely mid 2020 release, batteries cause too much compromise in trucks currently, but not likely in 2020 from battery improvements.\n\nI mean, if you look at the past they took about 1.25 years or so post model 3 unveil to do very limited production and 2 years after the model x until for production. Not sure about the model s, but for a truck I would expect similar time frames to the model x not the model 3. If unveil was TOMORROW the truck would likely be in production third quarter 2019. But that likely won't be unveiled tomorrow, but maybe 6 months from now. So we would likely be looking to see a tesla truck around mid 2020 to early 2021. Not bad, but not something you should see done today from other manufacturers.\n\nMy understanding is that the limitation is cost - a truck already costs around 20000 without any(?) of the extra features, and a lot of the useful features as extra costs. Then you add a 100 kwh battery (for 200 miles range due to bad truck aero) for around $15000-17500 ($150-175/kwh is reasonable when you add in battery management hardware, regulation testing, etc.) And the truck is now $35000-40000 with around 1000 lbs less towering capacity b/c the battery weight (assuming an similar engine and motor performance at higher speeds) with less range making it a hard sell.\n\nBy 2020, lithium sulfur or other energy density improvements will likely improve kwh/kg by 33%, improving both towering capacity and range. So tesla will likely be doing it RIGHT when it is possible.",

European homologation of the Model 3 is still not complete, meaning EU sales are currently impossible. As this article states - SR cannot be produced at all for at least the next year.\n\nYou're right - not everything is a conspiracy. Tesla is still FAR from being in the clear despite rosy Q3 results. They need to keep demand up as North America slows, but as I stated neither China or Europe looks likely in the near future.\n\nCorrection - Tesla has \"property secured\" in Shanghai, but no groundbreaking or actual construction has started yet. Talk is cheap, erecting a factory from ground-up is not. Unlike NUMMI, there would be no freebie plants in China.",

Even if you happen to have an I-pace, and drive slowly enough to make that whole gap, what happens if the one charger at either end is down?\n\nIn a Tesla you plug your destination in to the nav, and stop when it says for how long it says. You don't have to plan it carefully, or hope that the one charger is open and working. Maybe you have to wait for a SC stall, if it's busy, but probably not. If one is out of order, there's probably 7 other at the same station.\n\nThe CCS network is going to get there. Electrify America is a huge, and important, step. But it's not there yet, and the gaps are impossible to ignore.",

"comment": "[GM ended production of the Chevy Cruze](https://www.motor1.com/news/307674/ford-taurus-chevrolet-cruze-end-production/) which provided the platform for the Volt. Without chassis the vehicle is impossible to produce and GM can't make money on Volt without high volume production of the chassis. \n\nThe T-shaped battery in the Volt is too small to power the vehicle as a BEV, adding more batteries elsewhere in the vehicle would compromise vehicle dynamics and safety. The future of vehicles is the skateboard design so GM knew that prolonging the Volt would only delay their electrification transition.",

I don't think chargepoint has a very big presence in the UK. They are huge in the states though. Plugshare is good on both sides of the pond however. \n\n I would in any case take stock of the chargers near you and try to have as few accounts as possible. There is a huge arms race to see which network will reign supreme in the EV public charging domain. So every network has there own accounts and RFID chips and wants to keep a payment method on file for you. It's a huge pain in the ass and could be a bit of a security risk in the end if one or more get hacked or whatever. \n\nCheck out the Juice booster, they make a super slick portable charger that will make good use of the standard UK outlets and has shutco and a whole host of other EU plug adapters so you can get a charge just about anywhere. I wish they made one for the states weird industrial outlets too. \n\nAnother good bit of kit is the Jdaptor, I believe they make a type 2 to Tesla destination adaptor so you can use the 220V tesla chargers at places like hotels and attractions on your type 2 equipped car. \n\nGood, luck with the e-golf from an ungrateful colonist ;P ;P",

You can still choose to style your car like a combustion car, you just don't get as many advantages.\n\nAs for sound - this is always going to be subjective. Some like the relative lack of sound. Some like the electric sound. Some like fake-combustion sounds (not just in EVs, many combustion cars too). Some like flatplane crank V8s, others like lumpy engines that sound like they're falling apart. Oops, I mean crossplane crank V8s there, letting my preference show :D of course there will be those who are unhappy with the result, but I have no doubt that many new sound options will become available and some may be even better, too soon to tell! It's not a clean \"more options wins\" like with the design space, as you're kinda losing options too, but certainly not a clear loss either.\n\nAlso, as fosterdad observed, the weight difference isn't as great as you might imagine and is likely to trend towards parity or beyond.",

I'm all for subsidizing part of Tesla chargers nationwide as long as they charge the majority of vehicles made in the USA.  I don't believe the feds should give Tesla a ton of money for this, the majority of the benefit is still going to Tesla.  They are using the grid for their charging and they should be paying for additional infrastructure as well, which they depend on. \n\nI would be in favor of the Us government creating an electric charger standard and owning chargers.

"comment": "Myth: EV batteries are dirty and dangerous and full of rare earth metals.\r  \nExplanation: Many EV critics will portray the electric battery as toxic and dependent on a number of rare earth metals mined from conflict regions. It is true that cobalt and lithium are widely used in many EV batteries; however, neither are rare earth metals.\r  \n\r  \nThis isn’t to say they aren’t problematic — cobalt mining in particular is plagued by some very serious environmental and labor problems, as documented in in-depth reports by Amnesty International and the Washington Post. But these problems are economy-wide. Cobalt is used widely in the lithium-ion batteries that power most cell phones and laptops. There’s no question that lithium-ion battery manufacturers have to clean up their supply chains, but that’s something that Apple and Panasonic and Samsung are as responsible for as Tesla and Ford and General Motors.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, some critics will claim that EVs are dependent on cerium, most of which comes from China. In reality, only some hybrids use cerium in their nickel metal hydride batteries, but it is also dusted onto every catalytic converter fitted into any internal combustion vehicle.\r  \n\r  \nTraditional internal combustion engine vehicles—those that run on gas and diesel—actually rely on rare earths more than EVs, both in the vehicles themselves, and through the very production of the gasoline and diesel that power them.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to the Chemical Economics Handbook published by IHS Markit, the largest market for rare earths are for magnets, mostly using the so-called “technology metals,” which are used in everything from electric motors to lasers to cancer treatment to nuclear reactors to commercial lighting.\r  \n\r  \nThe second largest market by volume for rare earth minerals is for cerium oxide compounds used in polishing powders for steel production. It’s also dusted onto every catalytic converter fitted into an internal combustion vehicle. In other words, every gas-powered vehicle relies on cerium, one of the rare earths singled out by anti-EV forces as being a “dirty” feature of electric vehicles.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe next largest use of rare earth minerals is for a product used in petroleum refining, known as “fluid cracking catalysts (FCC).” According to researchers with Grace Davison Refining Technologies, “rare earth metals are a key component in fluid cracking catalyst,” a chemical process that was pioneered by Socony Mobil Oil in the 1960s. In fact, roughly 11 percent of all rare earth materials produced are used in oil refining processes, according to the Rare Earth Tech Alliance.\r  \n\r  \nThe refining of crude oil into gasoline and diesel requires the rare earth lanthanum.",

To all my friends that ask, I caution them, if you don't have at-home (or at least at-work) charging, then I don't recommend a BEV.\n\nWith at-home charging, it's so simple, and so convenient... but I can totally understand your frustration with range if you're constantly charging \"out\"... in fact, it is (arguably) worse than an ICE as the process takes longer, and with the range, you're forced to do it more often.",

A lighter rider would most likely see 20+ miles, on flat ground and in the absence of freezing cold conditions.  Absolutely if they kept it on speed mode 3 (15~18mph) instead of wide open. Can you recharge at work? It fully charges in about 5 hours. Zing it for an hour between trips if you want zero range anxiety.  I have never actually run it completely dead. I have since modified it with a booster battery and a neat little gizmo that safely manages the circuit. It now gets well over 40 miles of range and could be into the 50s for all I know. I also added twin brushless cooling fans that I run off of an external, separate lipo that velcros to the exterior of the frame. Keeps my controller nice and cool. It's ugly as sin but damn does it just go and go. And it is slightly faster when fully charged (sometimes touches 24 on the first couple of miles). \n\nAlong with Uscooters, there's another rebrand out there called the fluid Mosquito. In my opinion, this is the most refined version of the machine. \n\nChanging tires is a bitch. Way more difficult than changing tubes. But they last for thousands of miles. There is a good French how-to video in the depths of YouTube. You have to boil the new tire on the stove then quickly put it on the hub before it hardens again.  Gloves are extremely useful. Doing it bare handed smarts a bit. \n\nCustomer service is second to none. Of any company I have ever worked with for any product, they are by far the best. If something breaks unexpectedly, they'll send you free parts. If you wreck, they work with you to make sure they only send you what you need and nothing more. I blew a controller running a long trip in stupid hot weather. It overheated and a few days later,it released the magic smoke. Etwow sent me a new one and display circuitry for free and had me sending pictures back and forth to help me swap it all out correctly. I'm a big guy and in hindsight, I feel like I was asking for trouble trying to do 15 mi trips in nearly 100 degree heat. I started running the cooling fans after that. Thousands of miles later, and it's fine. \n\nAs far as commuters go, many people say that this one is the best ultra portable on the market. Having ridden one the same distance as the drive from Juneau, AK to Ket West, FL, I think they might have a point.",

My house pulls an average of around 500w when I'm not really trying to conserve but I'm somewhat smart about only keeping the necessities running all night. My 77 kwh Ioniq 5 could run my house for around 5 days if I start at 100% and go to 20% (min allowed for V2L). That is with zero charging and a constant pull of 500w which is way more than I'd need if I wanted to cut back.",

The only societal change I can see that promotes self sustainability, global resource management , real technological advantages (no planned obsolescence), no slavery to the wage and complete equality with an equal start is a resource based economy system as promoted by the zeitgeist movement (look into it, it's very interesting) or for more personal change rather than the entire society go for the whole building your own cob home, using solar panels, wind turbines, permaculture for vegan food and ground/rain water. You could easily accomplish the anarchist lifestyle (dependant on many factors like household size, years of setup etc) and probably work as little as 2 hours a day. But basically as the great Buckminster Fuller said about work that with the technological advancements now it's just as unnecessary as using animal products, well at least to the extent an average worker works in today's age of around 50 hours a week. If the technology was utilised for the good of the masses we'd be seeing vertical greenhouse skyscrapers by now, self driving cars and mag lev trains but this isn't promoted either through suppressive patents or the elite wanted to stay exactly that... Elite. It isn't just about the working week, as a fellow vegan the least we can all agree on is that this is an easily manipulated and profoundly sick society haha!",

"comment": "Don't get me wrong, I love the dream and the optimism. Just from a small (or even big) business administration standpoint, when you try to do several things at once, you tend to multiply overhead faster than you multiply revenue. Also, you'll be competing against businesses that specialize in just one. This will make doing solar particularly difficult in your case. Any solar company still alive today has learned a lot from hard times and runs pretty efficiently. This will be even more true once the ITC expires. \nBut it depends on how much you intend to do. If your energy audit results include a rudimentary analysis of costs and savings by adding solar, that would be fairly simple. Likewise with grey water, wind and permaculture. You won't beat plumbers and landscapers at their own game, but if you convince people that it's worth paying you for unified energy/comfort/water/food consulting services, then you have a niche. Work with a network of electricians, plumbers, gardeners, etc, and spend your time on brain stuff instead of insurance and payroll paperwork for a bunch of different laborers. \nJust my 2¢. Let me know if you have any questions about solar or are looking for a solar job. My company's on a hiring kick and we've got offices in several cities.",

If the panels are not actually 150w each, then I am guessing they are fairly close. \n\nI believe the existing system should still work fine to analyze how much watt capacity we need to upgrade the solar because the only costs of running the current system now is probably paying for the diesel the run the generator more. \n\nOne of my primary concerns is whether the present battery system would still work if the solar capacity were to be expanded. I know the batteries output into a 7500w inverter which is more than enough for the house, but (forgive my ignorance) would anything else need to be upgraded for an increased input of wattage to the batteries?",

Yes, most Joe progressives wouldn't stop flying even if we'd told them, but let's at least give them a chance. Yes, it won't be nearly enough, but what's the alternative? Yelling at elites until they chance their behavior?",

"comment": "A REC is the \"green attribute\" affiliated with your system production. It's akin to a \"carbon credit\", but is measured in kilowatt hours instead of tons of C02.\n\nMany solar array owners sell their RECs to utilities in exchange for a solar incentive. Legally, the solar owner can no longer claim to be powered by solar energy. The carbon-based utility company can claim to be X% solar powered, to meet state mandates.\n\nDepending on the mandate, some solar RECs can be worth $0.06-$0.20/kwh. However, the majority of states have REC markets which are too difficult and cheap to participate in (with prices from $0.001-$0.02 kwh). \n\nMy service is for solar array owners who are currently unable to receive any $ for their RECs.",

You said the owner would disconnect when the array is in operation, which means they would have to reconnect when the array is not in operation. If they have to connect to the grid, the utility company sets the rules and can force them on to TOU billing. Yes, of course they can disconnect completely from the grid and do whatever they want.  But that's not an economical or convenient alternative for most people and not really what we are talking about here.\n\n&gt;The only case where small arrays are worse off than large arrays is when the solar-specific fees are small and flat\n\nAgain, this is not true if utility forces solar owner on to TOU billing. For example, lets say electricity rates are $0.10/kwh for flat rate billing and TOU billing rates vary between $0.08 and $0.15/kwh, with the higher rate being from 2-7 PM. \n\nWith a large system, the homeowner will sell some power back to the grid at $0.15/kwh.  They also won't have to buy very much power from the grid because they generate enough to cover most of their usage.  If their system is appropriately sized, they will sell enough back to the grid to cover what they have to buy from the grid and the solar system saves them money.\n\nIf the system is too small, the homeowner will end up buying a lot of electricity from the grid at $0.15/kwh instead of the $0.10/kwh they would pay without solar.  Take an extreme example where homeowner installs a solar array that covers 5% of their electricity usage.  Do you not see how moving to TOU billing will result in a higher electricity bill than if they didn't have solar and stayed on flat rate billing?",

"comment": "Since you have an unreliable grid, and are already running your generator a few hours a day (which I would imagine isn't cheap), it may make financial sense for you to have a system with at least a small battery bank. Maybe not enough to run the AC, but enough to save your extra solar power to use later. This is called self-consumption, where you save your own solar power to use rather than sell. Since you have a generator already, that can also be part of your system to top off the batteries if needed. Look at the Outback Radian and Schneider XW+. Both of them can be configured to have inputs from both the grid and a generator, and configured to not sell any back to the grid.",

"comment": "I'm not sure what to tell you.  I do this for a living and wind-loading is a regular calculation in the design of a solar array.  We're attaching the equivalent of an actual sail, which can be quite large and often is perpendicular to wind-flow, and are asked to design it so it doesn't fly away at 110-125mph and also doesn't sink into the roof.  Part of the calculation for this is what sort of MWFRS it's attached to.  Sometimes we'll need to penetrate more if the timbers are skinny and can't take a normal sized lag or add a knee-wall or reinforce some rafters or add purlins.  \n\nI'm surprised though that you don't need to calc uplift if you plunk a half-ton AC unit with a pretty small footprint for weight distribution down without doing the math.",

The real competition will come from Chinese companies that most Americans have never heard of. With EV batteries going from $8k to $2k in the next 20 years things will be very interesting.

"comment": "No, I get where you're coming from, and appreciate your description of how well it can work in what might be considered less-than-ideal climates.  And as a fellow homeowner, I do appreciate a bit of the engineering marvel behind it, and the slow and steady ROI.  Your detailed explanation focused on financial costs, which is really what I was speaking to.  Any disagreement is not intended to devalue the claims.\n\nMy position is that the math provided to determine how workable it is, is somewhat incomplete.    If we see it as an investment, (implied by \"works\") we must compare to other investments of the same amount of capital to accurately understand the value.   Now if one doesn't see it as an investment, then there can be other, non-monetary points where it provides value.  (e.g. I enjoy the independence, etc.).  That's totally fine too!  But it is a point worth clarifying.\n\nNow, just as you point out, if the inputs were to change (such as skyrocketing cost of traditional energy generation), then it would certainly bode well for us solar owners.  But we also have to factor in that incentives can change just as quickly.  Rebates can go away in a heartbeat, and so can PUD based production incentive payments.  They don't even have to pay you for net metering.  I want this stuff to work out for everyone as much as the next guy.  But assuming even a gradually rising rate of energy costs, there still has to be a dramatic cut in manufacturing costs in order to make real financial sense for the masses.\n\nFYI.  I'm 25 miles east of Seattle, and am not served by SC&amp;L.  For the most part, the state of Washington has an average per kWh rate of around 10-11 cents.  You have counties in Eastern Wa that get power for 2.7c per kWh (which of course makes it ridiculously poor investment over there).  My 20 panel, American made, 5.6kW system has pumping out 5.3MWh per year, which is on target with the original design estimates, with about an 8 year ROI.  It works well, and enjoy it.\n\nNevertheless, a good post indeed with a lot of detail, which is always refreshing!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

"comment": "SunRun is willing to do the breaker upgrade for \"free\" because their price per watt is higher for a 15kW system the price difference is $3,750 vs local installer #2 if you go bigger then there will be more of a difference. \n\nIf you request a bigger system from any of the installers it should also lead to a lower price per watt. I would support the local guys but having Tesla price match is a solid backup option. I would wait on the battery. If you did the calculation it probably would not be at the break even point. You can always add a battery later once the cost/efficiency improves. Just make sure the inverter is the SolarEdge HD wave line. \n\nI would say also look into the price difference for higher wattage efficiency per panel, for example if you can get 335 watt panels that would only require 45 panels for a 15kW system, it would leave more room for new panels to be added on if you wanted to do down the road. For my install my local installer upgraded from 310 or 315 panels (I can't remember) to 325 panels for free and that was only for a 5.5kW system. For what you listed Sunrun has 285 watt panels, local installer #1 and #2 300 watt panels, Tesla i'm not sure about because you didn't say how many panels.",

I am not affiliated with them, and I don't want this to seem like an advertisement, so I am reluctant to mention them by name, but I am happy with their work.\n\nI had taken several bids, and theirs was not actually the cheapest, but they had a big team that seemed pretty experienced.\n\nI agree that the subsidies help a lot, but even without the subsidies solar would still be far cheaper than grid.  Much more than the federal subsidy, net metering is the main regulatory benefit that makes a system like this work.  I build up a huge credit in the summer and use it for electric heating in the winter, and that wouldn't be possible without net metering.",

"comment": "Regarding your 4.8 kW\\[h\\] system calculations:  \n\nRow 11 (your electricity bill with the PV system) should not be part of the calculation. Think of it this way, you are spending $16,960 to save a certain amount of money per month. To see if the investment is worthwhile, you should only be considering the savings and gains generated by that investment. The amount you’ll still be spending on electricity is as important to the calculations as  your cell phone bill.\n\nRow 13 should not be based upon a $15,000 number. The number should be $16,950 or $11,865.\n\nRegardless, a far simpler way to calculate this is to use internal rate of return.\n\nAssumptions: \n\n* Initial cost is $11,865\n* First year savings and gains total $2,492.20 calculated as 9000 kWh x 0.46 x $0.23 per kWh + $540 + $1000.\n* Second year savings and gains total $1,530.29 calculated as 9000 kWh x 0.46 x $0.23 per kWh x 1.04 + $540\n* Third year savings and gains total $1,569.90 calculated as 9000 kWh x 0.46 x $0.23 per kWh x 1.04\\^2 + $540\n*  etc.\n* Tenth year savings and gains total $1,895.28 calculated as 9000 kWh x 0.46 x $0.23 per kWh x 1.04\\^9 + $540\n* Eleventh year savings and gains total $1,409.49 calculated as 9000 kWh x 0.46 x $0.23 per kWh x 1.04\\^10 note: no $540 payment anymore\n* Etc. to year 25.\n* Year 26 has no savings\n\nBased upon these numbers, the internal rate of return is 14.53%.  Note that this number is significantly less than the 28.5% IRR from solar power rocks for a 5 kW system in Massachusetts (\"The internal rate of return for this investment is a stupendous 28.5%!\")  [https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/massachusetts/#solarbuy](https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/massachusetts/#solarbuy). \n\nAlso note that the 14.53% is guaranteed assuming:\n\n1. There is no additional costs for the system (like you have to replace the inverters), \n2. Electricity rates will increase 4% per year, and \n3. Production will not change.\n\nCompare that to the uncertain 7% stock market return. Also, that 7% return invested in the stock market is subject to capital gains tax while the savings from solar are not subject to any tax.",

"comment": "You seem to not understand efficiency, storage, or price nearly enough for someone who claims to be in the industry.\n\nIn a grid-tied system, total battery storage is way, way more important than PV inverter efficiency. The Powerwall 2's 45% greater total storage vs the LG's total storage more than makes up for reduced efficiencies going from light to usable electricity in the battery pack.\n\nYou also totally miscalculated inverter efficiency of a SolarEdge system because you're looking at only the inverter efficiency and not considering the efficiency of the optimizers. Once optimizer efficiency is factored in, you're actually pretty much in-line with Enphase, or within half a percent.\n\nThe reason I brought up the 7600H is because a 7600H with a Powerwall 2 is going to wind up a better system than a StorEdge + LG RESU10H. That's apples-to-apples. That we prefer Enphase is honestly unrelated to the AC vs DC-coupled debate. The 7600H+Powerwall 2 will provide more total production from solar over the course of the year and the battery capacity will be much higher than the LG, despite a similar installed cost.\n\nWith respect to oversizing and clipping, you should do more research, because you're probably undersizing systems for your clients. 1 or 2% clipping is perfectly acceptable if the corresponding increase in overall production warrants it. You wind up with a wider PV production curve even if you shave a little off the top.\n\nIn short, you're defending an inferior product based on false premise. I honestly am not sure whether I believe you're in the industry or not, since everyone I've met in solar is nicer, more knowledgeable, and more constructive in discussion than you've been in both this conversation and many others I've seen you have with others.",

A smaller bill just means lest investment for a smaller system to offset it.\n\nI assume you meant 4.7kW not kWh.  It should generate much much more than 4.7kWh over time.\nis $17.5k before incentives and tax credit? \nif so, your cost is $3.72/w.   which is not great but on par for sunpower. \n\nif you have enough roof space there is no reason to go sunpower, you could get the same power for less with panasonic or even canadian solar.",

Is there something I'm missing on that side of things?\n\nThe thing I like about the Powerwalls is the built in inverters, which makes installation easy and expansion even easier. LG Chem is dependent on another inverter which has to be sized accordingly and then adds substantial cost and more complexity. Which kills the price advantage last I checked.",

I asked them to give me a detailed breakdown and I’m still waiting.\nMeanwhile I started getting more bids from local companies and most are coming in in between $30-$33k for a comparable system with top tier panels (Silfab or Panasonic) vs the Canadian Solar pushed by Sunrun.\nI think the bottom line is they’re a big nationwide company that has massive marketing costs and you have to pay for that. They claim they will always be there for you unlike the small independent shops but I have read enough horror stories to know their track record is mixed at best.\nI decided to take my chance with an experienced local business with top reputation. I would never call Sunrun dishonest, but certainly they seem to be charging considerably more than any of their competitors.",

"comment": "&gt; More than two-thirds of those 501,000 roles would disappear in the five years before that date, according to a poll of almost 100 companies for the European Association of Automotive Suppliers, Clepa, making it difficult to mitigate the “social and economic impacts” caused by mass unemployment.\n\n&gt;But the survey by PwC also found that 226,000 new jobs would be created in the manufacturing of electric parts, reducing the net number of job losses to approximately 275,000 over the next couple of decades.\n\nSo it's only roughly half that. Yeah, one of the implications of going for a technology that is forecasted to be much cheaper in the future than any equivalents is that you pay for much less labor. But this transition has happened many many times before this in other sectors. In my opinion jobs work mostly the same way that conservation of energy works - they just like energy don't get created or destroyed, they just change. If you spend less on cars, you will unlock savings, money that can be spent elsewhere and create new jobs whereever this money is spent.\n\nAnd all of this is before accounting for the looming threat of cheap Chinese EVs flooding Europe like what happened with solar panels about a decade ago. The automakers that don't invest seriously into transitioning may be the first ones getting obliterated from the east.",

The $12k quote you stated earlier definitely didn’t have batteries included. Need to compare apples to apples.\n\nDo you have black/brown outs where you live? If so how often and for how long a year? Is your utilities net metering rules supportive of charging a battery from the grid or is that option locked out (can only charge batteries in non emergency situations from solar) like in Southern California?\n\nThe answer is in the details.",

I think more likely that we will move to a real time pricing model where buy/sell price is based on the actual market demand throughout the day.  For example....\n\nIf you sell solar to the grid at 2:00 PM, you get paid $0/kwh.  If you sell to the grid at 6:00 PM, you get paid $0.40/kwh.\n\nIf you buy from the grid at 2:00 PM, you pay $0.15/kwh.  If you buy from the grid at 6:00 PM, you pay $0.55/kwh.\n\nThe utility company gets $0.15/kwh just to handle billing and transmission.\n\nYour other point is correct, I installed solar in CA in 2013.  Back then, I could net a $0 bill at the end of the year by generating only about 65% of my usage.  Definitely not like that now.",

I always see weird and seemingly contradictory information about how long cars typically last, but let's say 10 years. That seems low, considering that the average age of a car on the road is noticeably above it, but I want to be conscious of mean vs median and some other issues, and Consumer Reports says 8 years so it might not be. (But other sources have well above.) Double that is 20 years, so right now 2001. I got rid of a 2002 Civic a couple years ago, but I'd have dumped it years earlier if I drove a more average distance. (I'm way below average.) Just on safety issues: no collision avoidance features, no side or curtain airbags, no ESC or even traction control, very probably worse performance structurally in crashes (though today's more stringent tests don't go back far enough to substantiate that). Looking down the road, there's of course self-driving that will come into the picture at *some* point that won't be standard for a while.\n\nCars are expensive and people will hold on to them longer if they can, but at the same time I think there is increasing pressure from a feature perspective as lifetimes get longer to move on even if the car is still operable.\n\nThat said, how this might play out is one of two ways (or more likely, a combination). The first is repurposing car components in other areas. For example, maybe even when the car is old you can get a good price for the battery to be put into some stationary application (think a Powerwall, grid storage, etc.) and that makes it attractive to sell your car to be stripped even if it's still plenty operable. The second is recycling components of old cars into lower-cost new cars. Tesla's talked about the million mile battery, and I don't know what their motor lifetimes are, but let's pretend that's a million miles too. They could buy cars that are 15 years old and have 250K miles on them, pull out the motors, and put them into \"new\" cars for a discount because they'll still have most of their life left.\n\nI'm theorycrafting here; it's not like I've done any deep analysis or research into what analysts expect and such.",

Just note that this gent does not have a transfer switch or a larger battery configuration that would yield whole home backup ability.\n\nIf you're looking for unbiased info, I would steer you towards Energysage. They have lots of info available about the NJ market, various storage systems and do a nice job of connecting homeowners with contractors in a way that respects your time and privacy.\n\nCheers,\n\nJeremy",

Our system still works well and generates 4,100 Mw a year. I asked Tesla if they could remove the old system for me and install a newer lager system, and they told me I would have to find another company to remove the older system. Does that sound right?  Any idea on how much that would cost?  They recommend keeping the older system and adding a second solar system, but if I go that route, won’t I be placed on the NEM 2 plan, with only 5 years left (2027), and then be place on NEM 3 at that point?",

"comment": "The problem with Tesla is with their customer/project service which is all handled at Tesla Energy HQ in California.  Their techs, the ones who actually come out to install and service the systems are top notch local employees that Tesla, for the most part, inherited when they took over Solar City.  When I got my solar, I got quotes from Tesla, SunPower and SunRun.  SunPower came in highest, and Tesla's price came in $20k less than SunRun.  Not only was it cheaper, Tesla's quote was for a larger system (14.62 kW panels versus 10 kW, and 3 Tesla powerwalls versus 2 Tesla powerwalls).  I placed the order at the end of April, signed off on the design and signed the contract at the end of May.  They originally scheduled my install for the first week in July.  That got postponed since there was a delay in getting the building permit (Tesla HQ never provided the building permit office the paperwork related to the Powerwall batteries).  Finally the batteries were installed at the end of July.  That's when I found out that Tesla HQ scheduled my battery install, but never scheduled the team to install the solar panels.  The solar panels finally got installed in September.  Inspector signed off on the system a week later.  The interconnection team at Tesla HQ never got around to submit the PTO paperwork to my utility until February.  After the PTO application kept getting rejected by the utility for being incomplete, Tesla HQ finally sent in all the necessary paperwork and I got PTO in July.  So I had to wait 10 months from the system being inspected and approved by the electrical inspector until I got PTO.  Luckily, I was able to operate the system (just couldn't send any power to the grid) for the entire time I was waiting for PTO.  I maximized my Powerwall usage to power my house after the sun went down, and the sun the next day could recharge the batteries, so I minimized my reliance on electricity from the grid.",

"comment": "Since this forum is about helping others, here is the reason for our 37KW ground array.  \n1) Yes, we have a 37.4KW pergola array. It also creates an outdoor patio space for the family, and providing a swingset and play area for my children. The area is also property tax exempt.  \n2) I work from home in IT and we have a 100% electric house. As a result we use approximately 45,000 KWH annually.  \n3) In Indiana net metering 1:1 ends in 2032. Therefore, the sizing gives us the ability to only use more power than we produce for December, and January.   \n4) Our payback is around 12 years.   \n5) We live in a subdivision that doesn't permit metal barns or ground based solar.",

"comment": "Can't speak to your local authority: here, as a home owner, you can pull the permit to install that panel or get an electrician to do it.  (Caveat: the panel is not currently approved for use in Canada without some extra hoops)\n\nI did test an Ecoflow Delta PRO with a transfer switch.  It worked well enough during outages.  It is also reasonable enough for someone that just really wants to deal with plug-and-play with some minor tweaks.\n\nI did decide to go the inverter+battery route though to make things a bit cheaper in the end and more expandable/flexible.\n\nThe Delta was way too heavy to make it truly portable.  \n\nGetting 240V required ~9k CDN for 7.2 kWh.  For 25 kWh it would be (without a panel) = 24k CDN.\n\nUsing the inverter+batteries = ~20k CDN, plus added space for up to 10kW of extra solar panels, and true UPS functionality.",

"comment": "Wind power is amazing in the sense that its output actually anti-correlates with demand.  True anti-correlation is almost never found in the wild outside of trivial observations like sunlight and nighttime.  Specifically, anyone can understand that solar power shuts down at night and really kicks up in the mid afternoon, simple function of inbound sunlight.  Which actually makes it fine, the afternoon is when people need power the most, nighttime is when they need it the least.  \n\nWind, and I really can't emphasize how amazing this is, actually anti-correlates.  Output peaks in the middle of the night and troughs in the mid afternoon.  It produces the most power precisely when it's not needed and craps out right when power is needed most.  \n\nThe first impact is on 24-hour thermal generation, combined cycle gas or nuclear power.  Because wind output flares up so much at night the spot price craps out, making the 24-hour plants basically not be able to generate any revenue for that part of the day.  The second effect is that when demand starts to peak in the afternoon and wind stops producing, the peaker plants not only have to cover peaking demand but also the crap out from wind.  \n\nWind power is effectively a kind of parasite on the system, it pushes out healthy elements like CC gas and nuclear, while straining the ability to handle the highest demand.  It's actively harmful to an electricity grid, we would literally, actually be better off if it just didn't exist.  And that is truly amazing.",

"comment": "What I mean by this is many companies (including the one I just left), sell the solar as if this was the same market 2 years ago. It’s even pitched on the doors that way. The premise and hot punchline being “we’re going to replace your electric bill with a lower or maybe equal (at least they’re starting to add this part in) solar bill”. In the deregulated utility markets of Texas, this is no longer possible, as there is not one REP who offers true 1:1 net metering in Texas anymore except Green Mountain Energy…and THAT is only if you get your solar system installed by them, and they don’t install here. That’s even a punchline used on the doors. And we’re at that sweet spot now where there’s just enough solar (even if only a couple homes in each neighborhood) where word has spread among the residents and other consumers that this is not happening anymore. Unless batteries are sold in the system and enables one to never import electricity from the grid, you’ll never see a “post solar $0 electricity bill”. But batteries are still expensive especially if you are selling them as adders. This is the case with the last several companies I was contracted with (simultaneously), so I know. \n\nFor those companies and reps who’ve gotten skittish of their own prices due to interest rates and dealer fees going through the roof, these have turned to pitching and peddling PPAs, which are for the most part complete and total garbage with the exception of a few rare circumstances.",

"comment": "Your argument however ignores that technology is not magic and is limited by what's physically achievable. Solar panels for instance are always going to be limited by their need for using rare earth metals in their creation, and always having some degree of inefficiency. You can't simply \"nerd harder\" and make solar panels magical and capable of effortlessly producing an infinite amount of electricity.\n\nAI is no different. It's worse in that it's garbage in, garbage out, with the companies that are **selling it** promoting it with highly utopian language and promising that it'll solve all life's problems, when the reality is that it will always be fraught with massive issues, and it's not going to find any magical solutions we've not thought of. The reason it's not going to find any new solutions is simple: **the main problems with climate change are implementation problems.** We know what needs to be done to address it, it's simply a problem of convincing enough people that drastic measures need to be actually implemented.\n\nUnfortunately, half the world is ignoring the problem in the hopes that it'll simply go away, and most of the other half is hoping for some kind of utopian solution to magically appear. There's no mass collective will to implement widespread controls, particularly in large scale polluting societies like China to cut down massively on industrial pollution. Our population would also benefit from being drastically reduced, and from having mass transit infrastructure be the norm, rather than having cars everywhere. Again, cars exist and car culture is so heavily entrenched, that the problem is not what to do but rather how to convince people of the need to do it and the need for immediate action. AI systems will never be able to do that unless you're fantasizing about something where robots decide to exterminate humans because they're bad for the planet.",

It helps when you think that you don't want to eat animal products, instead of that you \"can't\". And don't beat up yourself if you happen to eat that piece of cake at someone bd party, eat if you want to. The point is to reduce amount of animal products you use. It's not a diet in what you can somehow \"fail\". That's what I do - right now I am 90% vegan.",

The funny thing is... my dad only complains about the ones he knows for sure are vegan. She made a wonderful pasta y fagoli not long ago and it was amazing. Dad ate it without complaint. Next time she made it, he noticed I was eating it as well. Asked mom if she'd made a special vegan portion for me- she said, no, the whole thing is vegan. Immediately he decides that the meal isn't \"complete\" without some sort of meat and goes to heat some chicken or whatever. \n\n\nMind boggling.",

On paper, mine sounds pretty good because they say they always have labeled veg options, but in reality they're not that great because they'll usually have partially labeled vegetarian cardboard.\n\nOTOH, some schools have full vegan dining halls. The reason I suggest a dining hall is not because they're cheap or always good, but they'll always be there, convenient, and fairly regular so you'll know where you can get that top-knotch salad bar, if they have it. Nothing else I've found on campus comes close to having options amenable to weight loss.\n\nNext best option - get a place with a kitchen.",

"comment": "I butcher and hunt for my own meat. Including chickens who we butcher ourselves. We don't butcher laying hens. We get 50 new ones every year. We let the older laying hens die of old age and keep the new ones company. Same with our dairy cow. We keep a female calf and let the old lady go to pasture. Old meat is nasty meat, and you don't kill pets. I know how stupid the meAt industry is so I avoid it. Hot dogs and sandwich meat I buy though.\n\nIf we all stopped eating animal products how long until they go extinct? Deer are pests they'd be shot to save vegan crops, coyote population would go nuts. Diseases would hurt us and our pets. Moose, cougar, and wolves would be a threat to humans in  populated areas. Without control, aka hunting laws animals could seriously be hurting us and themselves.\n\nDon't say extinction is natural. Not when it's to that extent.\n\nHunting law example: too many deer and too few coyotes this year. Coyotes are hunting but some deer are diseased so a few more coyotes died. Coyotes have no pelt bounty this year so we can't hunt them. But the deer are so over populated we lost 1/5th of out harvest. So I was given 3 deer tags. If that wasn't controlled and got out of hand we'd import a few coyotes and hope they do well.\n\nIt's just my thoughts. No fight I'm just curious of the vegan point of views.",

DE is a for sure way to eliminate them, but there's never a 100% vegan way to do it. :(\n\nAs much as I love ants (keeping our biome clear from horrible predators, like poisonous spiders and snakes), they are a human enemy as well (they take no sides). I do my best to avoid them, but understand my survival is important too.",

"comment": "Well... Part of the problem there is the use of the phrase \"exchange\". By using that word, you're romanticizing a set of conditions that you're forcing on the sheep for the sake of *your* benefit, and not *theirs*.\n\nKeep in mind that those sheep didn't spontaneously arrive in the world; their mothers were explicitly and deliberately \"bred\" (i.e. usually via artificial insemination, a.k.a. \"rape\") for the purpose of creating a child that can be taken from her and whose wool could be \"harvested\" (i.e. forcibly taken) for use by a species which has other options. Sure, you, bluecado, are an extra special case. Unlike *other* wool operations, *you* take super good care those sheep, and you're there for them in to their dotage, making sure that each of their social and dietary needs are being fully met, and are sparing no expense on their veterinary care until they die peaceful and happy of extreme old age *even though* they'd long since quit producing so much wool (as happens when sheep age). Because of all this lavish care that you've decided to heap on them, you've concluded that they owe you... but *that* sort of relationship is also called \"slavery\", and it's not ethically defensible. No matter how \"gently\" you take from them, you're not doing so because you have some sort of binding agreement with them.\n\nSo why is this non-vegan, you ask? It starts with it all being an exploitation of both the male's and the female's reproductive systems, wherein their bodies are being used *against their will* for the benefit of humans (and not for their own benefit). It continues with the child being taken from his or her mother against his or her will *and* the mother's will (and would be against the father's will as well, were he allowed to participate). From there, we have the issue of pretty much every wool operation (but your own) being hugely abusive to the sheep involved (see the resources on **[Using Wool Is Not Unethical](http://yvfi.ca/wool/r)** for more on this), but even with the highly irregular level of stupendously good care you surely provide in *your* operation, it's still a situation in which the bodies of sentient individuals are being maintained for the express purpose of the benefit doing so has to the humans involved. This is no more ethically defensible than is keeping human slaves, and for all the same reasons.\n\nFinally... Can you describe what you mean by \"fundamentalist\" in this context? Keeping in mind that veganism is, at its root, the philosophy that other animals have rights to their own lives, would you call someone a \"fundamentalist\" if they believed in the philosophy that it's wrong to forcibly rape others (e.g. \"date rape\") and abstain from doing so (even if others in their culture doesn't resist doing so)? Would you considered it \"fundamentalism\" for someone to campaign against dog-fighting-rings if they were doing so based on the belief that dogs have a right not to be forced to endure pain and death for the sake of people's pleasure? In earnest, bluecado, I'm a bit confounded by the use of this word, and I could use some help understanding its meaning when used in the way you have here.\n\n------------------\n\n^(**EDIT**: *minor grammatical corrections*)",

There was an interesting article here a while back talking about how not buying animal products is only effective 1 out of 1000 times, but since stores buy in bulk when it is effective the store will reduce how much it buys by a huge amount and shift that money towards something else like vegan products.",

I'm allergic to cow milk so stopping that prior to becoming vegan was a good first step. /r/skincareaddiction has a good regemin  on their sidebar that really helped me reduce the scarring I have from over the years and keep new breakouts from occuring. They're pretty militant but they know their shit. Most of the cruel products they recommend can be subbed out with CF ones with a little research.",

"comment": "If dogs have a special place in your heart, I think that's fine. \n\n&gt; what do you make of buying dog food that contains meat\n\nNot all dogs are the same and what works for one might not work for another. You can't have a rational conversation with a dog to explain to him why he needs to eat his vegan dog food. There is, however, vegan dog food that dogs apparently thrive on. If it is within your means and your dog will eat it, I suggest giving it a try. \n\nIn the end, we have a responsibility to feed our dogs and cats a healthy diet.\n\nAlso, good luck with being vegan and figuring out where you stand. Living vegan is not always easy (though a lot easier than many think) and the more people that do it, the easier it will get! Personally, I think you've made the right choice and that is more important than following the status quo. Keep it up!",

This is a huge thing with vegheads, as I'm sure you know, that they can't go to veganism because they are *mentally attached* to cheese. There is no doubt in my mind that cheese has a mental rewarding trigger because I myself thought it was the hardest shit ever to give up. Meat, easy as all hell to let go of. Mozzarella? It was quite the dramatic departure. I hope I didn't come off as hostile, I just tend to talk colloquially a lot and I shouldn't expect everyone in the world to understand my avenue of thought. So it's my bad and I accept that I could have spoken much clearer, fartbarffart.",

Plus tons of vegan specific restaurants that are incredible. I don't know about churches, but I do know there are a ton and all sorts of varieties, so you might find yours.\n\nI love it here.

It tastes similar ISH to cheesy crackers.\n\nPopcorn. I googled. It says it's a grain but corn is a fruit but tastes like a vegetable. \n\nYou said not too strong. I want to say MAYBE dry seaweed or noodles.\n\nThere are some vegan cream cheeses, with bread you can eat :D.\n\nThere are actually ways you can make patties out of beans.\n\nCrispbread and some seeds. Certain cereals besides oatmeal you get what I mean.\n\nPlain. Are you okay with avocado? I've done wraps with avocado and tofu.

And the reason they do it is, as you guessed, \n\n&gt; Are they cheaper than alternatives? \n\nbecause eggs are so cheap compared to alternatives.  \n\nThere are other (much healthier) things you can use that have a similar consistency (like flax seed eggs or chia seed eggs in baking), but they tend to be more expensive than eggs, so they aren't used in vegetarian commercial products often.   \n\nPart of this is that in the past vegetarianism was much more common than veganism (and still is), so had a larger market and some products were made for them without really thinking about vegan consumers.",

"comment": "As far as feeling satisfied, it is definitely possible to find yourself not satisfied if you don't eat the right stuff. I recommend lots of beans, potatoes, and rice. I also snack a lot. I recommend keeping nuts and fruit on hand. It'll take a bit, but you'll readjust your portion size to your needs as well,I swear a lot of vegan recipes I have found online are for people who eat like birds, double it if you need to.\n\nAs for social situations, this will likely get some disapproval on this sub, but you'd be better off being vegan when you can and not when you can't than not at all. If you go somewhere and there is no option for you, you don't \\*have\\* to starve.\n\nWhen I first started out, my mindset was as follows:\n\nWhen eating alone and cooking for myself: cook vegan, don't buy animal products for the story\n\nWhen eating out, prioritized in this order:\n\n* intended vegan dish\n* dish made vegan with simple omission\n* vegetarian dish\n* fish\n* pork/chicken\n* beef\n\nAs a note, I refuse to exclude myself from my social life just eat 4 side salads of iceberg lettuce and still be hungry. If the place we end up has literally nothing for me, I will cheat.\n\nAs for social gatherings, I generally bring my own dish which of course is one I can eat, but I won't always turn down hospitality, especially if its special to the person. I have friends who take a lot of pride in their meat, and while I don't agree with it, I acknowledge the damage will be done with or without me in that scenario and I do it for my friend despite my personal values.\n\nI strive to be vegan in all situations, but I also acknowledge that I am surrounded by people who don't share my values, and while I happily discuss my viewpoints with my friends, I also maintain those relationships, and a lot of relationships center around food.\n\nI'm sure some people will downvote me for this take, but really you shouldn't pass up on being a vegan 99% of the time because you are worried you might have to eat a meal that isn't once in a while. In fact, its a good opportunity to start a dialogue on the topic with your peers, and in my experience, people seem to respect your stance more if you come from a more open position such as I explained above. Many of them will quickly come to respect your choice, and you'll find them being more accommodating of you over time.",

Sounds icky but its my idea of a hot breakfast quick to make. I\n\nt's not that healthy but lol but I love tofu.\n\n Made a fake take away with it tonight loads of veggies 1 cal spray garlic, fluffy rice and chow mein sauce was so good i love cauliflower rice as well and u can get vegan like 10 calorie pasta, noodles and rice in health shops to bulk up meals. And pesto with cashew nuts in pasta 😋 \n\n\nI like hummus pizza too as a treat. Mediterranean  veggies.\n\nI'm not a dessert person but I like the 99 calorie pots of alrpro coconut or carmel flavour. \n\nI did make nice peanut butter rice cocopop like round balls with a cinnamon seasoning was first dessert family got on board with making with me. My dad even ate one lol.\n\nI don't make it sound appealing but they are good! \n\nI find smoothies also really soothing esp green ones but I tried a brocoli one don't recommend it as much lol.\n\nI'm allergic to avocados but tried it once and it's not fair!",

He may have credit for coining the term, ans sure, started an organization to promote the concepts, but he did not pioneer being a strict vegetarian.  I'm quite confident that before Donald Watson, it had occurred to other people that they should eat a diet that entirely excluded animal based materials.",

It's always in response to them hitting their children because mental abuse, like being beaten by those who should love you unconditionally, fucks with your brain. It shuts down empathy, and compassion which makes people able to hurt others without guilt. \n\nOur entire society is mentally abused. We are taught greed and selfishness are good. We are taught to obey and follow both orders and \"the crowd\" with the threat of violence if we don't. \n\nI do my best to try not to be an angry vegan for exactly this reason, I am not a religious man, but the story of Jesus is filled with beautiful quotes, one of my favourite is \"father forgive them, they know not what they do.\" It so beautifully summarizes humanity. We are so sure we have to be a violent, angry, spiteful species because that's what we were taught by our abusive, but incredibly well meaning parents and less well meaning but even more abusive state.",

"comment": "The human suffering it causes is pretty problematic, too. As one of my ag professors in college said (who raises animals for meat): vertical integration creates what functions like indentured servitude for farmers, predominantly in pork and poultry. It's pretty horrific the way those farmers get treated and exploited often putting them millions into debt while shouldering all the risk with no control over their own enterprises and successes/failures.\n\n There's a lot of issues with labor trafficking regarding working on the range and in slaughterhouses. Prison labor is another issue as is child labor that's growing in the field. I remember when the female prison labor camp was built for Hickman's Egg Farm during Covid. The business said they chose female prison labor specifically because women are more compliant/easier to manage and thus less likely to rebel against the working conditions. I think you can still find that interview online. There were lawsuits related to injuries from that camp. And that's leaving aside the PTSD, PITS, and disproportionately high rates of violent crimes in areas where slaughterhouses are built. \n\nThere's a ton of social justice issues and race inequality with factory farms, see the Smithfield lawsuit from NC for nuisance and the laws that followed to prevent suing over those issues ever again. And, finally, the amount of land and resources needed by indigenous communities around the world getting decimated by animal agriculture  (Eating our way to Extinction is a good intro on that topic).\n\nOur culture around meat is so rampant and massive that loads human suffering and exploitation is almost required to uphold it, especially to keep it afforable for all but the wealthy. For me, veganism isn't only about the nonhumans. It is an insanely multifaceted and intersectional issue from environment to animals to humans ourselves that fighting against it and abstaining from it, to me, is one of the most effective ways to fight against multiple injustices at the same time.",
