{"transport":[{"comment_index":19100,"comment":"As someone who works in the motor industry that is not true at all, Tesla especially received massive government hand outs and their product is further subsidised by the tax payer ( http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113338/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-wrong-about-government-subsidies ). Tesla received several government loans one of which was $465 million at only 2.6% interest etc and even then they can't turn a profit.\n\nTesla gets $45,000 subsidy per unit sold so about 40% of its total cost is subsidised. The final vehicle is then subsidised again at sale to make it more competitive. Finally Tesla receive massive tax credit breaks as the US wants fleet co2 emissions lowered by 2025 which it can then sell to other auto manufacturers. Even with all of this they barely break even! To top it off one of its biggest markets is Norway where if you add up the subsidy and tax breaks given when you buy a Tesla it equals more than the Tesla costs so you basically earn money by getting one.\n\nI can tell you for a fact the savings from tax breaks is one of the biggest motivating factors behind big auto manufacturers wanting to build EVs and they are likely more subsidised than even oil.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.11191343267758687,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29998807536299454,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1995256412287052,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1633532445651882,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.03011590471942327,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.03607703582383692,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.009728844199950496,"ev_1":-0.10532120257984484,"ev_2":-0.24108445244248125,"ev_3":-0.1849606604684292,"ev_4":-0.10069679564898718,"ev_5":-0.03155295690521598,"ev_6":-0.19154854374937713},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed\n\nThe author expresses a factual observation about government subsidies for Tesla and other EV manufacturers, without explicitly stating a personal stance for or against EVs.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

We can choose to change that. \n\nIf you want to participate in our society, you should pay your taxes. You have undoubtedly benefited from the services our society provides.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.027410334597028907,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2367061271967636,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22512188042335776,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17479151527111855,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12878287562601745,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3187231833419298,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006881030897299449,"ev_1":-0.0567930598432819,"ev_2":-0.005838220875981885,"ev_3":-0.0006194967306025015,"ev_4":-0.0033393238263670355,"ev_5":-0.005739795121674736,"ev_6":-0.0020775984982416653},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Google AB327, or California NEM 2.0, or California NEM Successor to read more about it. Or watch what is happening in Hawaii right now with solar and figure California is probably about 1-2 years behind Hawaii.\n\nWe are reaching a situation where there is too much electricity being generated by residential solar at the wrong time of the day and changes have to be made to keep the grid viable. These changes will essentially mean that larger solar arrays with expensive battery systems will need to be installed to get the same net benefit that a current solar owner gets with a smaller array and no battery. Also, poor and elderly non-solar owners are upset that they are subsidizing wealthy solar owners, even though those wealthy solar owners were subsiding the poor and elderly for the last several decades.\n\nHard to tell exactly what this means for cost of solar.  I'm guessing that between NEM changes and the end of solar tax credit, solar in CA will go from typical 5-8 year ROI period currently to 10-15 year ROI period.  Everyone knows these changes are coming so there is a huge rush right now to get solar installed before it's too late. Those that get it installed in time will be grandfathered in under current rules for 20 years.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.11533585687472699,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21239825712008736,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2733555249514694,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27778192281458847,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20206837719755413,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21940966568316408,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11757022887468338,"ev_1":-0.19054580340337346,"ev_2":-0.24207108015473916,"ev_3":-0.0806837441579944,"ev_4":-0.0032228698595038927,"ev_5":-0.001868451004459833,"ev_6":-0.0667055048882806},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

They were making money. They were even seriously considering replacing a large part of their fleet – the largest fleet of vehicles in the nation – with electric vehicles. It would be a huge boost for the electric car, and a huge slap in the face of oil barons like the Koch Brothers.\n\nThe Post Office had to be stopped, and Republican Congressman John McHugh (NY) was the man to do it. He had been a member of the Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council or ALEC, and was deeply in the pocket of right-wing interests. In 2006, he succeeded in proposing and then watching pass the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. It was passed by a voice vote in a Republican Congress and signed by Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nWhat the law did was ram a poison pill down the throat of the Post Office. It required the USPS to pre-funding its Retiree Health Benefits Fund for more than seven decades out into the future – and do it all within ten years. With this law, Congress forced the Post Office to set aside money for the health benefits of future retirees who aren’t even born yet.\n\nIt’s an obligation that no other private business or government agency has ever had to comply with before. And it costs the Post Office $5 billion a year.\n\nSo the news media thinks ending Saturday delivery to save $2 billion a year is worth reporting on. But a Congressional requirement that sucks $5 billion out of the Post Office annually doesn’t even receive a mention.\n\nThe Post Office was regularly running surpluses prior to this poison pill legislation. But every year since, the Post Office has lost more and more money to that retirement fund for people 75 years from now. So they're now ending Saturday delivery, looking to close offices around the nation, and will likely lay off tens of thousands of unionized workers.\n\nOf course, the big winners in all of this are private mail carriers like FedEx and UPS that eventually won’t have to compete with the Post Office and its ability to send a letter from Florida to Alaska for less than 50-cents. Or its ability to offer Saturday service at no extra cost. Private mail carriers charge between 50x and 100x more than the USPS when it comes to paper mail delivery.\n\n The passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act in 2006 was the culmination of a relentless effort carried out by Conservative Koch-funded think tanks like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), CATO, and the National Taxpayers Union, that had spent years writing papers and lobbying Congress to privatize the Post Office.\n\nA common misconception is that the Post Office is a government agency funded by taxpayer dollars. That’s not true. In fact, the Post Office has largely been self-sufficient since the 1980’s and only recently has been forced to appeal to Congress for help since it swallowed that Republican poison pill in 2006. But the Post Office does have to fulfill a requirement by the government to provide universal service. It also was given a monopoly over most paper mail delivery.\"","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.043757446420689426,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2433916834128954,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24026373765450817,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16458714797100052,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2223014965829422,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2118345677717761,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013385249786855033,"ev_1":-0.230004684728976,"ev_2":-0.19041895443758353,"ev_3":-0.18596803599308867,"ev_4":-0.13775835410342552,"ev_5":-0.11243423763395792,"ev_6":-0.256383298918081},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

AWD not as important on an EV, the weight, weight distribution and extra fidelity of control from the traction control mean a FWD EV will perform better than a FWD gas car which is already perfectly acceptable in most northeast conditions.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002571271058210793,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20789184300706864,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19960441128682743,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07467907480895519,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3048794551367317,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26533399855824386,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.024506681540515274,"ev_1":-0.00933276314754039,"ev_2":-0.0006792191027974089,"ev_3":-0.05703972390620038,"ev_4":-0.001446794551156927,"ev_5":-0.0019308378687128425,"ev_6":-0.03308573718337963},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

We need to be bolstering our own.\n\n&gt; and why you think it is more of a problem with solar than say computer and tech or automobiles?\n\nPlease provide a link to me having actually said such a thing, and I'll be glad to answer.

From the perspective of the solar homeowner, net metering is a great deal. \n\nI was talking of measuring the energy flow in two directions separately, with different price policies. I don't believe net metering is what I had in mind although it technically is a special (degraded) case of it.\n\n&gt; No, simply no. The problem with that approach is that it assumes that the cost of all electricity is equal, which, in a net metered situation, it isn't. \n\nThat doesn't really contradict what I said. Even as a utility, you don't *need* to assume that the cost of electricity of equal to opt for net metering, as I've noted, as long as there are sufficiently few solar installations using it, it may simply more convenient (e.g. less costly) for a large utility than adapting their antiquated accounting systems. It's fundamentally the same reason why Tesla made the superchargers free. Not because the electricity is free but because the opportunity cost was worse, *at least for the time being.* As the proportion of solar users rises, of course the balance between costs and benefits shifts and fuller accounting better capturing the actual expenses involved most likely becomes necessary.

Tesla recommends that on a day to day basis Model S only fill your batteries to about 90% full. This prolongs the life of the battery and is something that every Tesla owner does. On the rare long trip you can fill to 100% but the car will warn you every time that you are hurting your battery. But if you have an extra 20% of battery idle like these new 60kWh configs, you can fill it to 100% every day. That’s 210 miles vs. the under 180 that a normal S 60 driver has and 30 more miles of real world usage every day.\n&gt; \n&gt; **More speed!** Acceleration and performance of the new Model S 60 and 60D is improved; the 0-60 time for Model S 60 and 60D is now 5.2 and 5.5 seconds, respectively.  That’s a very speedy base model and likely but unconfirmed power increase due to being able to access more power in the bigger pack. Top speed is also the same at the 75kWh battery, not the previous 60kWh.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Supercharging speed will increase.** Bigger packs charge quicker. That’s just math (Energy is distributed evenly throughout the pack when Supercharging so slightly higher energy density levels allow for slightly higher charging rate).  You really have a 75kWh pack so you’ll get noticeably faster times at the Supercharging stations. I can’t say for sure how much faster but it will be noticeable.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Badges?** Yes, you’ll get a stinking badge upgrade. Tesla tells us:\n&gt; \n&gt; Upon choosing to unlock the additional range, customers will receive a new badge applied to their car at their next service appointment.\n&gt; \n&gt; **You can upgrade whenever you want.**  I was on a long trip with my 40kWh and finally decided the extra range would make my drive back so much easier. I called Tesla and within a half hour they removed the barrier over the air and my car was now a 60kWh. The trip back with supercharging was much quicker and less range anxious.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Taxes/Incentives:** The cost of the car “hardware” did drop significantly here. If you purchase the upgrade even upon delivery with the $500 extra fee, you are paying for an “upgrade” to your car even if that is a $9000 line of code worth of electrons pushed over the air. That has many tax and EV incentive implications, not just in the US, for this upgrade and others.\n&gt; \n&gt;** The bad news:**\n&gt; \n&gt; **No takebacks!** The upgrade is permanent and once upgraded customers cannot downgrade back to the 60 kWh range.  I would like to do an upgrade just for long trips but Tesla tells me this is a one time only and permanent thing. Bummer, but understandable.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Title doesn’t get an upgrade.** If you upgrade, your Model S will have a new badge but on your car’s title it will say 60kWh. Most second hand buyers will realize this is an actual benefit (the battery pack wouldn’t have been pushed as hard/mile). But Telsa sales reps told me my original but upgraded S40 was worth less than a regular S60 as a trade in because the title said S40. I imagine some customer education would help in this case.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Weight (sort of).** This is a hypothetical because there is no longer a 60kWh battery pack in existence to compare it to. But if there were a 60kWh pack, it would obviously be lighter and smaller than the 75kWh in this car. Therefore you’d think the bigger battery would slow it down and use more power.  However, the 60kWh-governed 75kWh car still has a faster 0-60, top speed and range. So the point is moot. \n&gt; \n&gt; **Takeaway**\n&gt; \n&gt; The ability to buy extra battery storage that lives dormant inside your car is a big, big deal.  It has never been done before on any other vehicle though I guess you could put a gas can in your ICE car’s trunk but that’s really another thing entirely. The point here is that we have a new paradigm. Tesla makes this as easy as possible with hardly any downside.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think Tesla believes that enough people will upgrade during the life of their car that the price drop is worth it. Additionally, when most people end their lease or sell their car back to Tesla or trade it in, Tesla can simply update the car before it sells it or leases it again, recouping the additional value at that point. The $8500 drop in price point will bring a lot more people into the Tesla fold ahead of the Model 3 launch. In fact, it might pull some people out of line.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19884216537077273,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29475762668614675,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12935382081164448,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12001430771003167,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30405111867066187,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.298156329482685,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2831582583679176,"solar_1":-0.16341089984598794,"solar_2":-0.3002930422738399,"solar_3":-0.17337374621365598,"solar_4":-0.14764594845473766,"solar_5":-0.028295511455022886,"solar_6":-0.024838016205952346,"solar_7":-0.10472482276964001,"solar_8":-0.1509174007381565,"solar_9":-0.04413037158532518,"solar_10":-0.16251691611030167},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro\n\n(Note: The author expresses several benefits and advantages of the 60kWh battery option, indicating a favorable stance towards solar.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

Total install cost Vs. marginal gain, and current financial position: I live near SF, CA, USA. Loads of sun. But my wife &amp; I live pretty efficiently in a 2 bedroom bungalow which costs us &lt;$50/mo in energy bills, so the marginal gains are low. Currently we have various debts which aren't crushing us but are priority more than long-term investments which will only start to pay off many years/decades down the line due to marginal gain delta.\n\n2. Increasing the marginal gain &amp; thus incentive to solarise will be costly also. We've got our $1000 down on the Tesla3 but might not option it. We don't drive much but may do in future; until then we're planning on running our 2008 mini cooper into the ground, which'll take so many years that by the time we NEED to buy another car, people might not bother buying new cars anymore, and instead just use super cheap robo-drive Ubers. Similarly upgrading to an electric oven with induction hobs will be pricey. Getting a newer model fridge/freezer in same form factor will be an even longer time to payback.\n\n3. Foam roof. We have a foam roof which is great for keeping the house cool in summer but is more complicated for installs to the extent that every solar company I've talked to won't go anywhere near it.\n\n4. (for various reasons) The cost of solar continues to drop, and there's still a while left to exercise the rebate option (AFAIK?). So factoring in all the previous variables in order to calculate the pay-out/pay-back time horizon is complicated by falling upfront costs. And I've been putting off doing all these calculations, partly because it's a lot of work!\n\nEdit: 5. Related to 4 &amp; 3 somewhat: as well as the price, the tech continues to march forward. Powerwall feels likely to be one of a number of similar options, and a diversity of choices is likely to benefit the consumer. I watch battery tech developments like a hawk and am confident that we're long overdue a paradigm shift in this field, something that will fundamentally change the landscape. For house batteries that might simply mean smaller &amp; cheaper, but that'll still strongly impact the upfront/long-term payoff calculation. More efficient cells will mean lesser area and potentially give me more placement options than just the roof, given our low power demands.\n\nFWIW: Cool question. Hopefully lots of people air their views because it's super interesting to see how other people are navigating this process.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003562423541249397,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15780917451447748,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2626756797655181,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22074365180108727,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3070431505254163,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2258829853694783,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0683524392855664,"solar_1":-0.13820179451879183,"solar_2":-0.17123546159893896,"solar_3":-0.27255693476072573,"solar_4":-0.22488136410581597,"solar_5":-0.18185309431282803,"solar_6":-0.059453484558616765,"solar_7":-0.07815470749847009,"solar_8":-0.03488606651908184,"solar_9":-0.022293616905173508,"solar_10":-0.2763742218008822},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

A powerwall 2 is around 13kWh so really intended to run the house overnight. During the day, my solar panels can put out around 4kW which is enough to charge the car though but if I'm out that power just goes to the grid and I get a little money for it but if I'm home and the sun is shining I plug the car in and that works. There are still plenty of free chargers around but if I need to charge overnight (say for a long trip the following day) I have the car on a timer and it charges between midnight and 6am when the power is cheap and I'm on a power plan that offers cheap overnight power. Once I get the powerwall the plan is to get a charger which will only charge the car using excess solar so what will happen is the solar will generate power, some of that will be used by the house and the excess will go to the powerwall and when that is full, the excess will then go to the car and only when all batteries are full will power go out to the grid. EVs can charge at varying rates so there are chargers available which will adjust the rate just to use the excess. It means the car can take a long time to charge but you just plug in when you get home and let the software get on with it.

Getting a huge range of absolutely unknown condition/history \"junk cells,\" rating them by current capacity and IR, and then putting them into giant banks with no cooling or ability to handle a runway is idiotic.  Maybe they've been drained to zero and someone else force-charged them before recycling them - and they typically will express that displeasure as a runaway.  Which propagates in a \"DIY Powerwall\" design.\n\nI have zero way to know the history of used cells.  If I know the limits of the BMS system that ran them, and they're charged in a safe range, I'll consider using them as a backup power system, but the nonsense people on YouTube put together?  They're a fire hazard, not remotely UL listed, and will get your insurance agents laughing their assess off at you when you make a property claim.  Not worth the risks for the savings, IMO.\n\nFor stationary storage, it's really hard to beat lead acid for a blend of cost effectiveness and safety.

Building a [Super Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_grid) might cost less than a single nuclear power station like Hinkley Point C. This would make solar photovoltaic electricity into a despatchable baseload power source.\n\nThis 2005 map gives an approximation of the [solar collector area needed to generate electricity for the whole world](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/DESERTEC-Map_large.jpg).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.10646498342975974,"1.1.1_stance":-0.33310432537804563,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2506334132025811,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21740024723112583,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24796133805074938,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.014213039137151403,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04341928765643388,"solar_1":-0.13094474009315463,"solar_2":-0.1923210092507654,"solar_3":-0.03855384352937108,"solar_4":-0.022042095439246623,"solar_5":-0.048462588325492106,"solar_6":-0.002075063210213557,"solar_7":-0.0027844744909065375,"solar_8":-0.010343906930453764,"solar_9":-0.08957838454270473,"solar_10":-0.11238606735908736},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

There unfortunately isn't data about how much inviduals have reduced their Co2 footprint. But that doesn't mean there isn't visible evidence of small changes. I defer back to my comments regarding the more silent portions of the populations. In my personal life for example, I've tried to keep note of small changes that people in my life are making based on open conversations I have with them. A friend of mine switched to reusable sanitary products and got a hybrid car (they do a lot of small journeys so they basically use it in electric mode constantly), my mother in law switched to plastic free shampoo and conditioner, I personally have tried to make more sustainable purchases or none at all. I also have a 5/10 year plan to get solar panels, air sourced heating and an EV. My friend wants to start growing some of her own produce. None of us are rich. But people budget and plan every day. Yes there needs to be subsidies to make the big changes (heating and power) workable for most of the population. But it's not impossible. As I said, these changes are small, but it shows that people are willing to swap and change aspects of their lifestyle. A lot of people don't account for the changes future generations make too, who will likely become more strict. I assume as a climate conscious person, you make changes in your own life. Why do you think others like you won't follow suit? I'm unfortunately not smart enough in this area to give you answers to all your questions.

Customers can choose to receive kilowatt-hour (kWh) based credits which are applied to future bills to offset customer energy consumption. They can also choose to receive a per-kWh cash payment determined by the Average Hourly Incremental Cost of Electricity from the previous year. This rate is an average calculated from the last 50 megawatts (MW) of energy that includes the cost of fuel and transaction costs in the total price.\n\nThat sounds to me like you have an billing option where you don't need to worry about what time of day your produce/consume power.\n\nIOW, while the sun's shining the 'excess' power generation that you are exporting to the grid will be credited to you and you apply those credits to times when you're importing power.\n\nThere are some details to know about how this works but it sounds a lot like the tariff schedule that I'm one with PG&amp;E in California. My power is billed at three different $/kWh depending on what time of day I'm importing power from the grid. But all of the power that I export to the grid goes in to my account in terms of kWh. So even though I'm generating power at the time of day when energy is cheapest, my kWh credits go towards zeroing out the kWh that I use during the more expensive times of day.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16563398022524622,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3520036999941796,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1870647858574352,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27711837974339915,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.09507742786663584,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2332407938922998,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2231525024108123,"solar_1":-0.1338321996925109,"solar_2":-0.2038785768719246,"solar_3":-0.10266854277142556,"solar_4":-0.09197623450552495,"solar_5":-0.10111472792944878,"solar_6":-0.014931049995842235,"solar_7":-0.31529640333125525,"solar_8":-0.1184992248331073,"solar_9":-0.2305588282513191,"solar_10":-0.2797788413914639},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

It's already sitting at about 7-12 years for most people after the net metering and tax break. Take away the net metering and the payback period is likely to stretch to the end of the useful life of the panel, so as soon as you break even, you go in debt again. Take away the tax subsidy and it's probably a net negative.\n\nAlso, one other thing that makes net metering a big deal in FL: it's illegal to be off-grid, and there's still effectively local monopolies, so you literally have no choice but to deal with whatever rates they decide to set unless you can afford enough batteries to offset your entire nighttime usage, and enough panels to charge them during the day - both of which is difficult in a state where many people run their A/C 24/7.

I hope I'm wrong about that, because that is a bad idea, or at least will cause you to have to make many lifestyle changes while spending a lot of money for a huge system for a huge 5000 sq ft house.\n\nAssuming you want a grid tied system (on-grid), the first step is to look at your electric bills for the last 12 months. The price doesn't matter, it's the number of kilowatt hours. List out to us each month in the last year and the number of kWh you use each month.\n\nFor a house that big, you might use 25,000 kWh per year, which would necessitate about 50 solar panels on your roof. Again, this is ONLY for a grid-tied system; you will need many, many more panels than that if you want to collect enough energy on the lowest-insolation day in December to power your big house the entire day and night.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.04516653064638376,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23515118856196912,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2622352009970205,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16759869225235016,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.39688811776946775,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1576330387368296,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3346779264587288,"solar_1":-0.23358751764915184,"solar_2":-0.11628789665221165,"solar_3":-0.2976543501548197,"solar_4":-0.1382076834658316,"solar_5":-0.010027620075561572,"solar_6":-0.003792935274153327,"solar_7":-0.008929101578056967,"solar_8":-0.008637871303411279,"solar_9":-0.05421245476449599,"solar_10":-0.24236597728821607},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (the author expresses a preference for grid-tied systems over off-grid systems)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

For example, if enough people divested of fossil fuel investments, this would adopt the tactic taken against apartheid governments. So, collective action does not need to be through legislation.\n\nIt's true that an individual's actions don't matter, but if, say, a whole lot of individuals put solar panels on their roofs or weatherized their homes, then this would have an impact.

I would advocate to vote in the upcoming elections instead and thinking that we still can change things (true) is important to get people to vote.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2146907100829291,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2949611462558291,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2288223513653558,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33741619646040394,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20639952982655785,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20183867443274336,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26191907372170437,"solar_1":-0.19109851889433854,"solar_2":-0.21972956135722832,"solar_3":-0.07863689450581053,"solar_4":-0.013712514157305122,"solar_5":-0.010066148225935953,"solar_6":-0.0033425920373701956,"solar_7":-0.002588582848450945,"solar_8":-0.016188125944002724,"solar_9":-0.21103332416896592,"solar_10":-0.11719058992157978},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Follow Tesla's lead and quickly get into grid/home battery storage due to the importance of it for cell prices and vehicle margins.\n\nStorage essentially allows OEMs to make large guaranteed cell orders from battery suppliers, allowing them to negotiate much lower per cell prices.  Vehicles are the big money maker, and lower cell prices help with margins.Storage is meant to offload excess cells if the need arises.  Tesla essentially breaks even on their storage products because they were never meant to be profitable.  They only break even because they lower their prices significantly in order to ensure they get guaranteed 100% demand for their supply, ensuring they hold no excess cell inventory and the costs associated with it.  If they raised prices, their products would have to compete with other for-profit storage companies and there wouldn't be a guaranteed sell-out of inventory.\n\nYou can see this on Tesla's financial statements.  Gross vehicle margins versus Tesla Energy margin.  Their gross vehicle margin is very high, but Tesla Energy's margin is often close to break even.  In other words, Tesla lost no money by over ordering cells and using the excess in their storage products, but saw their vehicle margins and corporate profits spike as a result of the huge cell orders.  They were never concerned about over ordering cells because they always had another outlet to get rid of them for break even or higher prices.\n\nGM getting in on the action puts Tesla in a bit of a predicament though.  GM can benefit from lower cell prices from much larger orders, but more cell demand may mean cell prices increase for those companies who already have huge cell orders... namely Tesla.  BYD may not have that problem since they produce their own cells.  GM will also be producing a lot of their own cells in JV factories with LG.\n\nAlso, if GM also goes with the 'break even' strategy on their storage products and have enough excess inventory to produce a lot of these products, then Tesla's cell inventory dump is no longer guaranteed, as they now have a competitor that's willing to match them on price.  Tesla could drop prices and see less than break even revenue.\n\nIt also may mean that if there's a cell supply bottleneck, Tesla's production growth could quickly stall... whereas companies like GM, Ford, Stellantis, Honda, Toyota, BMW, etc... all have HEVs, PHEVs, and even ICEVs and FCEVs to fall back on to maintain vehicle production rates.  They're not growth companies, they're mature companies with their own piece of the global market share carved out.  They're perfectly happy with their sub $100 billion market caps.  Would Tesla investors be happy if their market cap and share price was cut by 85% to fall more in line with mature OEMs?  Probably not.\n\nNow imagine if every OEM decided to use this battery storage strategy years ago.  I imagine cell prices would have skyrocketed, which would have sucked for BEV sales and margins, but only a few companies are completely reliant on BEVs.  This goes back to my argument that a lot of the things a dedicated BEV company like Tesla has gotten away with all these years have only been possible because they were the only player really in the game.  Now that other players are entering the area, many of those strategies may get thrown out the window.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.09681160262941073,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1514807063312901,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21418989284904838,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20475447543339065,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.378461950150156,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2978496663695752,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16575423995218885,"solar_1":-0.22860208158935857,"solar_2":-0.14919357299968256,"solar_3":-0.14347050970924388,"solar_4":-0.05377638140347538,"solar_5":-0.06942197640091763,"solar_6":-0.05659413325277759,"solar_7":-0.19240252145391423,"solar_8":-0.0340654345715212,"solar_9":-0.02321859581473973,"solar_10":-0.11474266643175371},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I’m actually a Market Leader for Sunrun and can tell you in this current Market it makes absolutely no sense to buy Solar in CA. If you were planning on buying solar you should have done it before April 15th 2023. Most batteries typically have a 10 year warranty when you purchase. Best you will get is 15 years which is very uncommon and high chance you’re dealing with a battery company that isn’t even gonna be in business for the duration of your warranty. Safest battery to invest in is a Tesla battery which only has a 10 year warranty. After 10 years it’s your responsibility to pay the cost of replacing it if it ends up being less efficient or malfunctioning. Keep in mind battery prices have actually gone up over the years so chances of you paying more for a replacement in the future is high. Also, if you’re planning on getting a loan insurance rates are currently through the roof and you’d most like be paying over 40% more than what the system is worth over a 25 year period. I might get in trouble for this but the reason Sunrun can even afford to do this is because we get a whole lot more than the 30% you get if you bought the system yourselves. I won’t give you too much information on that. All in all the system almost doesn’t cost Sunrun a thing. Our real cost comes in when we have to replace stuff because we don’t get credits twice. Which is where your monthly bill comes in. To put it into perspective Sunrun Flex is typically going to be about a 30 to 40% cheaper option than you buying solar or paying the utility company (Discount varies based on how nice you are to your reps so be nice to them 🤣). On top of that Sunrun replaces everything that has to do with the system including your batteries if it malfunctions or goes below 70% efficiency. Sunrun estimates replacing your batteries at least 3 to 4 times over a 25 year period which is a cost you don’t have to pay for. If you’re still stuck on buying a system I’m sorry to tell you but you need to get with the times or you might end up like Sunpower. The reason so many Solar companies are currently going bankrupt is because it literally doesn’t make sense to buy panels anymore. Nothing is even remotely close to the Sunrun Flex program. I can only hope you all will have a chance to experience it!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"yes","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3134453559815416,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13528647144167089,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21550229116622494,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17820129656719305,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.056101190508115906,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25770956025119435,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.018523432469616335,"solar_1":-0.06239469573197348,"solar_2":-0.20598504028263656,"solar_3":-0.2883570207809676,"solar_4":-0.2417644885673473,"solar_5":-0.15826454230894646,"solar_6":-0.08043599028165653,"solar_7":-0.16300471133004488,"solar_8":-0.2038281141656791,"solar_9":-0.07399301346025311,"solar_10":-0.2958443264166514},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

About to buy 6 solar panels at 450w each. Then pair it with a 15kw home battery. The way it will then work through smart metering is that the battery will fill up when energy costs are low/negative (The Netherlands is producing more solar than the grid can handle at peak periods), and then the battery will discharge when energy rates are higher in the evening. The energy company gets paid for withholding electricity during peak periods and they pay me monthly. In essence I am being paid to host infrastructure that helps stabilize the grid. Right now this is anticipated to generate 1600+ euros annually, and the battery costs me 6000 euros. Plus the savings of me consuming energy I am generating from my solar panels. In a few years the Dutch government will stop paying us to send energy to the grid... and when this happens I will buy an electric car and charge it for free using my own power... and probably install a heat pump as well.

I live with a meat eater. We’ve been together since years before I was vegan and he loves vegan food and is open to trying new things, but for some reason, he loves animals, but has no motivation or ambition to even try to shop/eat vegan unless I do it for him. It’s REALLY frustrating! He usually eats prepackaged foods, but occasionally he’ll cook meat and our house will reek for hours! I get grossed out having meat or dairy in the same refrigerator and having to use the same pots, pans, Tupperware, and utensils makes me super uncomfortable. He’s usually very respectful of my values and hopes to be vegan himself someday, but it’s not happening fast enough for me and I’m beginning to see him as a hypocrite for claiming to have such a love for animals, but not even switching out easy things when we find substitutes he enjoys. I hate kissing him and feel like I need to wipe my mouth afterwards. There are other issues like substance abuse involved as well, so it’s not entirely the non-vegan situation, but that’s the majority of it, so I COMPLETELY understand what you’re saying and I don’t understand how vegans/non-vegans reside together in harmony under the same roof without someone being unhappy.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2726687692518484,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2895208654272895,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20306318231980003,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1816204447375253,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06766941063100944,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26321136050295246,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006985353577571611,"diet_1":-0.010714026124333031,"diet_2":-0.2458183976841255,"diet_3":-0.17922862305325302,"diet_4":-0.009709912087904135,"diet_5":-0.030675014820493136,"diet_6":-0.041838547554410375,"diet_8":-0.002487173727179955,"diet_9":-0.009980141549021937,"diet_10":-0.35922571768363315,"diet_11":-0.010692993016467275,"diet_13":-0.15359162772252224,"diet_14":-0.219250325865754,"diet_17":-0.23747457162109936},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
