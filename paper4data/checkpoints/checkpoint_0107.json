I understand if solar panels wont be able to power the whole car, but why not install it so it powers some of functions, like ac and lights or something. Or so it charges the battery while driving to improve range on an electric car or make non-electric cars use less fuel while operating.",

They spend millions researching, developing and producing the car. They put the car on the market and it sells well, so the increase production. The sales are growing and the car is doing well.\n\nYet you have this crazy notion in your head that is totally off from reality. You need everyone to fit the narrative that all car companies are evil except for Tesla, with Elon Musk as our lord and savior. \n\n\"Well, I hate to break it to you, but there is no big lie.

"comment": "In Washington State, we have a $100 surcharge on registration renewals for electric cars, which goes into the same transportation budget as gas taxes do.\n\nThe media spin I read about this was a \"it's a conservative middle finger to those rich people who shirk gas taxes\", but the sponsor was State Sen. Mary Margaret Haugen, a Democrat and longtime chair of the Transportation Committee.   She actually knows what she's doing, and was laying the groundwork for a more sensible miles-traveled tax on vehicles that proponents say would be more fair and more stable than gas tax.\n\nWhy not tires ?  Administering small taxes like this surcharge costs a lot relative to the tax revenue.    Separating out special surcharges at a tire store (or Costco, or Sears...) and collecting those might be more difficult and costly than collecting a fee from a Licensing agency office whose whole job is to collect money on behalf of State agencies.\n\nI would personally love to see a much higher gasoline tax.   With fossil fuels, price seems to be the only thing that drives behavior.\n\nThe way I see it, if you could afford $4/gallon last year, you could afford $4/gallon this year but be funding construction and maintenance too.",

[**NEMA 14**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA_connector#NEMA_14) of article  [**NEMA connector**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA%20connector): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;The NEMA 14 devices are four-wire grounding devices (hot-hot-neutral-ground) available in ratings from 15 A to 60 A. Of the straight-blade NEMA 14 devices, only the 14–30 and 14–50 are common. The 14–30 is used for electric clothes dryers and the 14–50 for electric cooking ranges. The voltage rating is 250 V. They are essentially the replacements for the NEMA 10 connectors above with the addition of a separate grounding connection.\n\n&gt;All NEMA 14 devices offer two hots, a neutral and a ground, allowing for both 120 V and 240 V (or 120 V and 208 V if the supply system is [three-phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power) rather than [split-phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-phase)). The 14–30 has a rating of 30 A and an L-shaped neutral blade. The 14–50 has a rating of 50 A and a straight neutral blade sized so that it does not fit in the slot of a 14–30.\n\n&gt;NEMA 14–50 devices are frequently found in RV parks, since they are used for shore power connections of larger recreational vehicles. Also, it was formerly common to connect mobile homes to utility power via a 14–50 device. Newer applications include [Tesla Motors's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors) Mobile Connector for vehicle charging, which recommends the installation of a 14-50 receptacle for home use. \n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^AC ^power ^plugs ^and ^sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets) ^| [^IEC ^60320](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320) ^| [^Industrial ^and ^multiphase ^power ^plugs ^and ^sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_multiphase_power_plugs_and_sockets) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckr0bas) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ckr0bas)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",

"comment": "&gt; If my leaf had a 48KWh battery, it would get 200 miles too.\n\nDoubtful. Rated miles in a leaf are very optimistic. For instance on a full charge the Leaf will show that it has 111miles of range. But the EPA rates it at 84 miles of range. The farthest I ever drove my Leaf on a full charge was 85 miles. At highway/freeway speeds the Leafs range drops precipitously. The rated range is only accurate in good weather in urban/suburban low-speed driving.\n\nOn a full charge my Tesla Model S 85D shows 272 miles of range, and the EPA rates its maximum range at 270 miles. The rated range is much more accurate even when traveling at interstate speeds.\n\nNissan needs to improve the range of the Leaf, and the accuracy of their range estimation.",

Not too surprising, since [steam reformation of natural gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_reforming) remains the preferred method for making hydrogen.\n\nOh wait, Japan has [no natural reserves](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ja) of methane?

(As reference, Tesla produced 50K vehicles last year, and hopes to hit 200-400K when the Model 3 comes online.)\n\nI'm really curious here... When major players such as VW and GM step in with their massive manufacturing power, use that capacity to drive prices down and turn EVs into a commodity, how does a much smaller company, such as Tesla, win?\n\nMaybe it would be a personal win for Musk, but how would competing with such huge manufacturers be beneficial for the stockholders of Tesla?",

Talking to normal people off the street, in passing or what have you think solar is one of 3 things; 1, a scam, 2, too expensive, 3, ugly. The overall is that people can't wrap their brain around investments, primarily the ones that need/should go solar, (technically if the roof/are fits solar sits does apply). Edit(adding on)\nIf a tax credit can be applied it's a good thing, screw it I say, not just for my own self preservation but as a whole. These sort of things are budgeted if I'm not wrong so if solar didn't get break something else that's actually not as beneficial would.",

This omission by Nissan should give them an even shorter longevity.",

"comment": "You are missing some very key details.  Mainly with the capability of your system.  Yes it is paired with solar, but that is not really how we design battery systems.  We design for worst case scenario.  What happens if the sun doesn't shine that day, and its cloudy?  That is what I am talking about with reserve capacity. \n\nTesla says it will \"run your entire home.\"  That statement is misleading.   It will help you run on mostly self consumption on a kwh basis.  Both months you have showed me, you have imported electricity.   Show me your import data from July and August if you dare.  Running electric heat with minimal sun access, I bet you are importing close to 40%.  Unless you are living extremely frugally, to the point of madness, you will be importing power during the winter.  But I don't know how cold it gets there either.  This is highly weather dependent.  \n\nNow your systems appears to be designed for self consumption rather than backup.  These are two completely different designs, and they are installed differently.  You think the battery is \"running your home.\"  That is not how the batteries act in a self consumption model.  The battery discharges directly to the electrical panel to match the wattage being consumed by the home.  This results in a net zero input from the grid.  This works for everything but peak loads.  The battery is not providing the entire load to the house at all times like it would in an off grid situation.  The power output of the powerwall is 5000 watts.  Ohms law gives us the conversion.  Your grid voltage is 230vac.  5000/230=21.7amps. \n\n That is not enough to power your home by itself.  An electric oven can draw 3800watts or more.  A clothes dryer 2500 watts.  A hair dryer 1500 watts.  A microwave oven 1200watts.   Electric heaters are the worst.  You could have 10,000watts of baseboard heating in a typical home.  A perfect example would be preparing dinner.  Running the oven cooking a turkey, and warming up something in the microwave over at the same time would easily exceed 5000watts.  (You will have other use in the home as well)\n\nWhen these turn on, the powerwall is not \"running your home.\"  You are using the grid's massive supply of current to run your home.    If you were running on the powerwall alone, and you attempted to turn on more than 5000watts at once, it would trip the breaker on the unit. \n\nNo competent building authority would allow someone to attempt to run an entire home from one of these battery packs.\n \nYou say you can go \"weeks without touching the grid.\"\nNo, you absolutely can not do that.  Go turn off the connection to the power grid on your home and get back to me.",

"comment": "I don't buy any of that.\n\n&gt; GM pretty much told European buyers to go look somewhere else and sold off Opel just as deliveries were supposed to ramp up\n\nSo selling Opel = definitive proof the Bolt is a failure?  What kind of argument is that.\n\n&gt;turn around and complain they lose money on each sale\n\nIf announcing production ramps is complaining then you have a weird idea of complaining.  I don't know of anywhere they are complaining about losing money on it.\n\n&gt;Why couldn't they make it with 75 kWh, charge at 120 kW, do under 5s from 0 to 100 km/h and start at a price of say $50000 which they could do profitably and then offer $20000 in upgrades for more performance and so on.\n\n&gt;Was it really that difficult to make a cheaper 50 kWh or 45 kWh version? They themselves said that car costs too much because of the batteries, so why not test the market with a cheaper, lower range version?\n\nSo in the same paragraph you criticize them for not making it higher performance and more expensive and then criticize them for not making it more compliance car and cheaper?  They couldn't win here.  They put out a car that was cheaper than a Tesla and performed better than literally any other sub-$100k EV on the market and they did it on time and it's being criticized for being not as good as cars it's cheaper than and being more expensive than cars it's better than.  \n\nI can't address your criticisms one by one because they're all just \"I don't like GM so I don't like the Bolt so I'm going to find fault with every part of it whether or not that stands up to how anyone else would be judged on this\".  You are determined to hate it so much that you bring it into discussions about VW.  Nothing I can say will change that.\n\nAlso I mentioned the Kona and I'll stick with it but I really wanted to say Niro because the Kona back seat is way too tight and there's no space (but I do like the Kona in theory, not complaining about performance/specs) and I'd suggest it to people.  But even then, it's not even available and launching in exactly the same way as the Bolt (late 2018 launch in CA only, rollout in 2019).  It's not a superior option right now because it literally does not exist to buy, and when it does exist it will be a slight improvement.  I'm sure that if they sell 30k in the US in 2019 it will be rightly hailed as a success for Hyundai (noting you seem to have no criticism for the fact that they sold 432 ioniQ electrics in 2017).  And if they sell 30k they should be congratulated.  That's a number to be proud of for an EV right now.  And if it outsells the Bolt then great.  Get GM moving on the next vehicles.\n\nLook, GM didn't market it well but they sold out their allotments and ramping production.  I own one.  It's fun as hell to drive, seats five comfortably, and I'm extremely happy with it.  GM did a good job on this car as someone who would have never bought a GM car before.",

It's very likely that somewhere within their daily routine offers charging (work, school, grocery, entertainment, shopping).  \n\nThis isn't to say that we're at a 100% solution, nowhere near, but the increases in battery capacity and the increasing presence of chargers is making a major dent in the \"infrastructure\" argument.  \n\nInstead, I'd say a lack of vehicle variety options is the main thing holding back EVs.",

"comment": "If you’re keeping one ICE car in the family you’re golden! That’s how we do things and it’s awesome. We barely use the gas car now. It is gathering dust.\n\nThe 500e is definitely micro. Fine if it’s just the two of you, but I wouldn’t want to drive one with kids. I’ve seen them sell as cheap as $6,000 though, which is dirt cheap :).\n\nI know the i3 is a bit more money but I’d suggest checking out a 2014-2016 BMW BEV i3 as well. I -love- mine. 170 horsepower, rear wheel drive, rear engine, it’s a BLAST to drive and they went overboard on advanced materials and design. The battery is top notch (little to no range loss), the car has 5 star safety ratings, it’s all carbon fiber and aluminum and composite, and it’s one of the most efficient EVs on the road.  It has a turn radius that can spin a circle inside a two lane, and the body panels are flexible so you don’t end up with dents and dings from city use. \n\nI got my ‘16 for 13k. I’ve seen them go a little less than that. They’re significantly nicer than the spark and have awesome room for front and rear passengers, but the spark IS cheaper if that’s what you want.\n\nI think down the road the i3 will hold pretty damn good value, while the spark will drop off, so that’s a point for the i3... but it also uses expensive tires and burns through them in 25,000-30000 miles, so that’s another downside. Worth a drive though. Cool cars :).",

Your flippant response shows how shallow your understanding is.\n\nSimply put, the EPA cycle isn't an accurate measure of efficiency, as has been proven by many independent tests. The fact that the EPA doesn't even have a single standardized test, and the fact that they only test a small percentage of vehicles themselves - instead letting manufacturers report their own numbers, means it doesn't support your claim.\n\nThe different test regimes cover a narrow range and have some strange quirks, which doesn't represent real world use in many cases. You should probably read about them, but given how little intellectual honesty you've shown so far, I doubt you will.\n\nRegardless, at highway speeds, the [Porsche Taycan consumed around ten percent more than the Tesla Model S with 21.4 kWh/100 km.](\nhttps://nextmove.de/autobahn-reichweitentest-taycan-vs-model-s/) Is 10% efficiency a worthy trade-off for a much more premium vehicle that is much more capable in performance driving aspects? \n\n&gt;NEXT QUESTION?\n\nEvery one of your claims fell flat except this one, which is dubious at best, and certainly americentric.\n\nYou are exactly what people don't like about overly zealous Tesla fans. It's a bad look and shows a profound lack of maturity.",

"comment": "I've posted on winter riding and the wide wheel back in 2019. I wanted to add an update to that post to discuss a far better stud type. So just a quick rundown here before I gotta head out the door here. \n\n\nThe Gripstuds made by Grip Stud are absolutely the way you want to go. I know I've touted the ones I had last year via Amazon. However once I tried these here Gripstuds I'm a believer. \n\n\nSo the basic pros of these things are:\n\n\nReal solid carbide steel\n\n\nTiny footprint created in the wheel when inserting\n\n\nIMO even more stable &amp; secure then last year's no name brand studs\n\n\nBetter traction\n\n\nEasy Easy EASY! Install or removal\n\n\n\nThere is I suppose one negative to these but only a minor one:\n\n\nCost\n\n\nThese run basically buck apiece vs the Chinese ones on Amazon which work out to like on average .20¢ or less each. Before you scoff at this, let me in just say these things will last you multiple seasons easily. You probably won't lose a single one, even on pavement unless you tokyo drift your rig as a general rule on your way to work on dry pavement. \n\n\nThe other thing is that makes this less so an issue then say for ebikes is that our wheel size is dramatically smaller. I used 50 total for my Rev tires. \n\n\nNo they don't leave holes in your tires, this will be my second year doing this to my wide wheel tires and they are fine, even from last year's triple the size footprint studs. They go in easy on the Rev's pneumatic tires and do not impact the airtube inside. In fact I just screw em right in. Done. \n\n\nYes they add resistance but I've not found that an issue as I drive slower in the winter anyways. Yes they make noise on pavement but no more than a car. No I have not found them to create any more or less slippage when accelerating or stopping on dry streets. \n\n\nThese don't come with the tool images there in the pic. It cost 10 bucks but they do come with that silver head piece that fits into a drill (not impact kind). The insertion tool is highly recommended. I used plyers last year and it was a process. This year it was a cinch. \n\n\nI'll let you watch any number of youtube videos on how to, dos and don'ts. Just do yourself a favor and go to gripstuds.com and get their ebike studs. They have one line for bikes and they are perfect. Oh you can get original Gripstuds on ebay so long as you are paying about 40 to 50 for 50 count sack. The minimum you have to buy on Gripstuds company site is 100 so ebay is the way to go for just one scooters worth of studs. If you see Gripstud lookalikes for 20 don't get them. They will probably add stress to your tires overall stability when inserting , fall out and if they don't they will wear down real quick. You really get what you pay for on these things. So trust me just stick with the ebay 50 count for anywhere between 40 to 50 bucks and then add the tool if you don't plan to use a drill, that's like 10 bucks more. Never you'll have them available next year and the year after most likely too . \n\n\nNothing terribly wrong with those phalange type I spoke about last year. But it was a process inserting and I was doing this to mercanes solid tires too. These work on everything . \n\n\nDid I mention the traction advantage will possibly make you arroused the first time you gun it after a fresh snow? Or while driving your kaboom to the ice fishing hole on the lake? \n\n\nDrive safe and do yourself a favor and review online videos discussing winter care for ebikes and batteries. Generally there is more on ebikes then scooters but it's all the same in the end. \n\n \n\n\n\nTally ho!",

And especially in europe the Zoe sold way more often than the leaf. (When looking at the used market, there are 3-5 times more Zoes than  leafs in Austria, Germany and France).\nModel 3 also only took a year to get past the model S.\nOverall, cool that the model 3 seems to be what people want and can afford. Next few years will be interesting,  now that VAG (VW,  Audi, seat, skoda...) also steps up its EV game. In europe it might get hard for tesla that way. Super charger network is hardly existent so its not really a plus anymore,  dealer and service network is tight for VW.\nWill get down to price and availability or tesla could bring down the prices a bit to match the prices. (Currently the model 3 is quite expensive costing 46-60k€ in germany and Austria)",

I don't have a lot of experience with any other EVs, but I have heard people say that other EVs, particularly, model 3, is nimble and handles well. The suspension and steering on the Bolt didn't feel set up for any sort of spirited driving. There are a few reports about autocrossing the Bolt, and I feel like the synopsis was \"it's capable but not enjoyable to drive quickly\" \n\nThe other thing I find disappointing is the regen paddle on the steering wheel. It was a poor way, in my opinion to do regen. But theres always single pedal, I guess. I really love the way Hyundai has done their paddle \"shift\" regen by comparison.",

Some high-mileage EVs have had multiliple battery replacements in less than ten years, and a few EVs have had battery failures below 100k miles. Someday when batteries are cheap that won't be a big deal, but today it is. \n\n&gt;The average ICE vehicle sees the scrap yard after 150k miles\n\nWhich has been improving over time. And it's not hard to figure out which ones will easily last 200k miles or more. \n\nGranted EVs appear likely to be useable for many years, but we dont have enough data yet to know what the long term average will be across all models. \n\n&gt;We're talking in 25 years. Chargers will certainly not be hundreds of miles part then.\n\nSure hope not. I'm looking forward to having public chargers be almost as common as gas stations, with all of them supporting all EVs.",

You just cherry picked a coefficient of a truck explicitly designed as a gas vehicle converted to electric to please traditional buyers. Then double down by baselessly claiming the Rivian didn't count, despite being a truck that pulls even more than that F150. This is absolutely in the same category, but your upset it has better numbers so you won't make the comparison. It's also had thousands of deliveries. But s thing you have said is true..\n\nI keep seeing this simping over Tesla in this sub. Why is that? Do your entire personalities revolve around a company? Are you desperate for the attention of their CEO? The facts don't work with your opinions. No reason to fabricate and twist the truth to fit your narrative. It's a product. \n\nWe're supposed to be excited for electric vehicles being pushed to market. I have some minor criticisms about the truck as it has been shown to date. Calm down.",

They are the most common problem for electric scooter riders. This blog is for ebikes but the rules apply to electric scooters - [https://gotrax.com/blogs/news/5-essential-tips-to-avoid-flats-on-your-electric-bike](https://gotrax.com/blogs/news/5-essential-tips-to-avoid-flats-on-your-electric-bike)\n\nI hope these blogs help. We have a ton more to read up if you have additional questions but if you have any you want to ask me don't hesitate to reach out! For brakes you can mainly tell if something is up by sound. If they squeak or hiss like they are rubbing on the brake pad you need to readjust the caliper. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to assist!",

"comment": "By selling zero emissions credits to other manufacturers.  Even in recent quarters the sale of credits are a big source of revenue for Tesla ($286 million in Q3 2022).\n\nSo while selling those credits are a small percentage of current revenue, in the past it was a much larger percentage.\n\nBut that is less my point than that Tesla pays attention to where and how it can make money using government programs.  They built never used battery swap tech so they could double how many credits they could sell per model s.  Because they have a history of very much following government incentives, they are not going to leave that charging money on the table.  Which is exactly what you want with government incentives, to have them actually change the behavior of companies for the general good of all.\n\nI will confess to a flippant turn of phrase re:teet, and it probably gave the impression that I thought it was wrong Tesla used government incentives, which I don't.  Those incentives were meant to help boost EV manufacturering and they did (I think the battery swap scheme was wrong of Tesla, since they seemed to have no desire to actually implement it for customers).",

I noticed a decent amount of wind noise in the back at high speeds (+50mph). It was hard to make out the source but seemed to be coming from behind me. Mind you, i had the sound system off at the time. I know its a EV but i dont recall hearing that level of wind noise test driving a model Y. Im wondering if the noise came from the roof or something. Did you notice this at all?",

Once they started selling their batteries a couple years ago, I looked into their solution and found that they were less expensive (and less complex) for a small battery system of 10kWh or less but once you hit the size of a single Tesla Powerwall with \\~13kWh of storage, the Tesla solution was less expensive.  I ended up with 3 Tesla Powerwalls and my solution was \\~$10K less than an equivalent 40kWh Enphase solution.  These are based on prices from a couple years ago and may have changed since then.",

"comment": "&gt;The next time your friend mentions that he or she paid a “zero” electric bill thanks to a solar array, the friend may also want to thank you.\n\nI'll hit my neighbor up as soon as the utility thanks me for involuntarily paying for their coal-based fuel services. Then I'll go demand thankyous from Tesla drivers for paying for their roads. Then I'll go throw some trash in the street and thank my neighbor for cleaning it up maybe. \n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;Net-metering is capped under current law to contain costs. \n\nOne easy solution would be to lower SREC prices and expand net-metering rights. That's sound policy that everyone should be able to get behind. But I suspect the dissent would oppose Massachusett's renewable portfolio standard.\n\n&gt; It costs the utility the same amount to service a solar customer as it does a non-solar customer. \n\nFine. Charge a fixed \"connection fee\", and reduce the price per kwh of electricity.\n\n&gt; Solar customers are never “off the grid.”\n\nMany more solar customers would be off the grid if connections fees increase. And massive gird disconnections would raise the price of electricity for the non-participant. So that's not really well thought out is it?\n\n&gt; Solar users typically pay little or nothing to maintain their share of the electric grid.\n\nWhat is the solar user's share of the grid? The fact is that utilities have grossly over-estimated this cost, and have been slapped in court for this. Utilities need to cough up definitive numbers before such statements can be made. Or are we just spit-balling numbers to serve our agenda?\n\n&gt;In a state where electricity costs are almost double the national average...\n\nThat couldn't have anything to do with living on the most densely populated electrical peninsula in the United States could it? If only there were a way for Massachusetts to generate its own electricity, one which consumers would voluntary build out themselves....",

"comment": "Both those assumptions are wrong. \n\nAnyone can determine that 1.5x24 is 36kwh a day. If you want to assume 6 hours of sun then you need 6kw of panels. But you're never going to get 6 hours of sun. The noon equivalent insolation where I live is 2.7 hours. So that means during the time that it's light I get the same amount of power as if it were noon for 2.7 hours. \n\nYou'd want at least 36kwh of storage. At average prices that's about $10k. Panels would be about $4k. And another $2k for a good(ish) inverter with enough surge capacity to start compressor loads. And another $1k for 2 MPPT units.\n\nBut my advice would be to just pay the $12 grand and buy one of these all-in-one solar power units and plug it in to your panels. http://imgur.com/x7VY0Zr",

Every year I hear net metering is going to the legislature, and they still don't have net metering yet (thought it may [come](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/mississippi-will-create-net-metering-policy-requests-public-comment/386403/) soon), and forget any sort of incentive or rebate or RECs.",

"comment": "You've asked a popular question, and it appears there's no one good answer. There's also a bit of FUD being spread around to discourage people from going electric, so watch out for biased answers.\n\nBut I think the generic answer is that it depends mostly on what type of gas car you're replacing, and how modern/efficient the local grid is. If you're replacing a 15mpg pickup truck, then going electric is a massive winner. If you're replacing a 50mpg hybrid, then going electric might be pretty much break-even, or maybe even a step backwards. \n\nThe other part of the answer is that a gas vehicle will almost never get cleaner over time, but an electric vehicle easily can. The moment you install solar panels on the roof of your house, your EV suddenly becomes much cleaner. And even if there's no utility-scale renewable planned for this year or next, falling costs will almost certainly encourage plans in the years after that.",

I'd say it's plausible but limited. It would definitely lengthen a day's charge. \n\nBut being a professional I'd say not worth the risk unless you're going for the 'green' angle. If you're not comfortable hooking up a generator, I don't think solar panels would be any easier.",

"comment": "Efficiency isn't critical when using renewable energy that would otherwise go to waste.  Bjørn Simonsen, NEL Hydrogen:    \n\n&gt;The entire efficiency question loses importance with the energy regime we’re moving into. We’re coming from a mentality where we are used to thinking about energy as a limited resource. If you have a barrel of oil, it’s extremely important to use it efficiently. However, you can use it across several days or years. Whatever you don’t use one day, you still have it for the next day.\n\n&gt;Whereas when we look at renewables, you have to use them when they’re there. We have to look at energy with new eyes. What matters is what does it cost? It’s not necessarily all about the total efficiency. Prices are low enough to make hydrogen and distribute it to fueling stations at costs that are comparable to what we’re used to today with gasoline and diesel.\n\n&gt;If you charge your car from your rooftop solar at home, it’s obviously more efficient than converting it to hydrogen first, but you won’t see people driving their electric vehicles to a solar farm far from their homes to charge whenever it’s really nice and sunny outside. That is why the two technologies will live side by side and complement each other...more https://www.pv-magazine.com/2017/08/30/future-pv-the-feasibility-of-solar-powered-hydrogen-production",

Don't find that out until you read the article.\n\nI guess I don't understand how that would be confusing. The title explicitly states \"Solar Customers\". If it referred to \"All Homeowners\" that might be confusing.\n\n&gt;  No, you don't own it. You use it under the agreement that you keep paying for it. Stop paying for it and watch how quickly it gets taken from you. \n\nIt is still in your name, and that is the point.\n\n&gt;  How do people who barely make enough money to get by afford a solar system, straight up, with no financial help? \n\nWhere is it suggested that people who cannot afford solar are getting it without financial help?  There is certainly a growing push in some states like NY to help renters and those who do not have the finances (credit scores) to participate in community solar. It is also being promoted for those whose homes just aren't physically suited (shade, no good roofing surface, etc.).",

Keep plenty of good clear space around the runways and put the panels in a corner, that's fine.  Put the panels near the runways, eeh.\n\nThere's also glare issues from panels depending on orientation.  Even flat PV panels are blinding if you fly through the reflection from the sun.

"comment": "Call around for more quotes imo..sure the north will produce but at an expensive rate. Sounds like this company just wants to sharpen their pencil on a large job.\n\nIf my maths aren't incorrect (~270 watts x 19 panels x 5 hrs / 1000 = 25.65), you'll be producing roughly 25.65 kwh per solar day from the south facing panels alone. Of course, that includes a lowball estimate of the *actual* wattage your panels will produce, as they are never 100% efficient of course. With that said,  I'd vote for more battery storage. I think another aspect of building a solar system is creating an in-depth review of your power usage and how any minor upgrades can be done to *save* energy. \n\nAnother thing to consider, as storms/weather get stronger intensity, you never know when power might get knocked out in your area, so the extra storage could come in handy. \n\nbut seriously, dont just downvote me if the math is wrong...I'm open to criticism and by no means well versed yet (just started building my own system) but I've been told this is the calc to use to find what panels are using per solar day (in socal it can be 4.5-5 hrs). I've been wrong many, many times before and I like to learn : )",

"comment": "I'm interested in residential solar, but I don't think the numbers really work out at this point.  Some Data:\n\nLast 12 months used 6382 kWh, average 532 kWh per month.\n\n2 adults, 1700 sf ranch, gas heat, hot water, stove.  Do have AC.\n\nLocation is Northwest PA, lets say zip 16502.  Half the roof is facing basically south, no shade.\n\nProject sunroof says 1371 hours of sunlight, and 1709 sq ft roof available.  It recommends a 6.75 kW system.\n\nMy generation price to compare through Penelec is $0.059 per kWh.\n\nIt's almost like we don't use too much, and don't pay enough to make it worth it.  The guy from Solar Revolution offered to come out for a free estimate, so I may take him up on that just to see.  We're looking a year or two out since the roof needs replaced.  \n\nWe have pretty reliable power, so I was not thinking of a powerwall or similar, although I think that would be cool.\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.\n\nEDIT:  Great replies, thanks!  Actual price to compare has changed, currently $.0617/kWh.  My total cost per kWh, basically everything that is charged per kWh, is $0.1518/kWh.  I called, and the guy from Solar Revolution is supposed to stop over tomorrow.",

"comment": "&gt; I need a bidirectional meter in order to sell power back to the grid.\n\nYou are not \"selling\" power back to the grid.  You are trading kWh now for kWh latter under a monthly net metering or billing type system.  this is important since if you were selling you would have to pay tax on the power sold and they would only be allowed to pay you wholesale rates instead of the full retail rate you are net metering under.\n\n&gt; My question is, where did that 14 day expectation come from on their part? Is there some deadline codified in NC law that says that the utility has to give PTO by? If so, can you point me to the regulation?\n\nThis might point you in some direction for the regulations:  http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/1246",

"comment": "20MW is something like 60 DC fast chargers. I don't envision many massive service plazas like that. EV chargers can be put in many more places. And the larger stations will likely have both supplemental solar power and large batteries for demand shifting. My point was just that the grid exists almost everywhere and you plop down a few chargers in many places without the need for underground storage tanks, a store, tanker trucks to refuel and fulltime employees. That makes it much more attractive for a more distributed network.",

You are not selling, you are trading kWh at full retail value.\nNow if you have a FiT (feed in Tariff) which are less common in the US then you might have different rates.  Many areas actually have as part of an incentive more money for kWh generated than consumed.",

"comment": "A couple of thoughts: I run the solar division for a company that primarily operates in the PNW, we do residential, commercial, micro grid, and utility scale. My experiences has been that most markets will fluctuate prices to get their clients to about 7 year ROI with a good site. Take for example Vancouver WA and Portland OR, they're right across the river from each other but Portland has a pretty good cash incentive for solar. The average price of solar in Vancouver WA is about $2.50/W and in portland it's about $3.50/W.\n\nIgnore the sunpower dealer. Sunpower is a little better but not that much better. Add to that that my company installed an 8kW sunpower array to support a telecom micro grid about eight years ago, the modules failed at year 7, the j-boxes became resistive and melted, all the covers fell off. Sunpower didn't outright refuse to honor the warranty, they simply slow rolled and ignored us for six months. Then they said that we must have done something wrong. \n\nBuy tier 1 modules, other than that don't worry about the brand and don't buy the premium module argument.",

"comment": "Most meat consumption is happening through domesticated animals on factory farms (something like 97-99%), not wild bushmeat consumption.  And that production is wasteful and polluting; it is less efficient to create food using animals than it is from plants, taking an enormous amount of land, resources, and plant material to raise those animals, for what ends up being fewer calories of food.  In fact, it is so much less efficient, that if we switched to growing plant crops, would be enough land freed up that we would be able to feed more people or even potentially rewild some and return it to natural habitat.  \n\nOne of the largest causes of biodiversity loss is habitat destruction, and habitat destruction is being driven by meat, dairy, and egg production in animal agriculture.  So, future expansions of land use (or even the land that we currently use did not always [start out](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/feie73/someone_said_a_vegan_diet_is_worse_for_the/fjoablb/?context=3) this way) into areas supporting wild species is worsened by animal agriculture, not improved by it.  \n\nFor example, the largest cause of deforestation of the Amazon rain forest is clearing land for cattle ranching using a method called \"slash and burn\" (all the trees are cut down and the land is set on fire to burn all the plant matter, and create a layer of particularly unsustainable fertilizer, which cannot be recreated for years, if ever).  \n\nThese kinds of arguments that might imply animal agriculture could be more efficient than plant based agriculture have come up many times before, and so here are some responses: \n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/7vsi0p/whats_the_deal_with_this_omnivorous_vegetarian/\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3p5h3k/is_veganism_actually_more_agriculturally_efficient/\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/c8s1o4/saw_an_article_on_facebook_that_i_tried_to_link/espdddk/?context=3\n\n-------\n\n&gt; populations of animals reach a pollution level event \n\nThe distinction between wild and domesticated animals again isn't made here.  For domesticated animals, the only reason why so many domesticated animals exist is that we are controlling and forcing their breeding to happen (through artificial insemination, for example).  And that means all that would be required to stop it happening for domesticated animals would be to stop doing it.  \n\nYou might also be interested in this basic [commentary](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ipjbv5/argument_i_dont_know_an_answer_to./g4k7352?context=3) on what might happen to domesticated animals in a vegan world.  \n\n&gt; consuming legacy foods would morally unjustifiable. The reason for this is that as 'the west' consumes more foods like Avocadoes and quinoa the prices rise so high\n\nA first step might be more awareness around the issue, so here are some perspectives on that: \n\n* https://nacla.org/news/2018/03/12/quinoa-boom-goes-bust-andes\n* http://www.alternautas.net/blog/2018/3/21/the-quinoa-boom-and-the-commoditisation-debate-critical-reflections-on-the-re-emergence-of-a-peasantry-in-the-southern-altiplano\n* http://web.colby.edu/st297-global18/2019/01/22/superfoods-dark-side-increasing-vulnerability-of-quinoa-farmers-in-bolivia/\n* https://revolucionalimentaria.org/2013/02/18/quinoa-to-buy-or-not-to-buy-is-this-the-right-question/\n\nAnd also, veganism is not incompatible \"with focus[ing] on hyper localize food production\" either.  Vegans can support local CSAs (community supported agriculture), farmer's markets, or even grow some of their own food like through gardening.  At this level or type of production, veganism is also inherently encouraged by biology, because it is often necessary or significantly easier to get sufficient calories through growing food crops than it is raising animals (which often takes a lot more land, plant material, and effort).  \n\n&gt; allow the billions of deer that have bred \n\nTaking the figure of speech literally, it's an order of magnitude lower than that, roughly 30 million deer in the US.  But, to answer the question, reintroducing predators to the ecosystem which have been removed by humans is one type of environmentalist's solution, or there are non-lethal ways we could be developing for controlling population growth, like [contraception](https://reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/fh0avd/i_have_a_honest_question_im_am_so_sorry_if_yall/fk8f5ta/) that have particular value in the suburban areas where there is going to be most interaction between human development and protected wild areas and hunting becomes less feasible anyway.  \n\n&gt; animal is to convert materials that would otherwise be poisonous to its preditor into safe and palatable consumables for its preditor\n\nThis is something which has incidentally arisen through evolution, it is not an animal's inherent purpose to be used by another for materials processing, it is just something which happens.  \n\nSome do not even do this, using naturally occurring biological toxins as a means of self defense against predation, and sometimes in response to that, their predators develop the ability to safely ingest or metabolize the compounds themselves in order to both have a novel food source or gain the defensive ability.  For example, frogs of the family Dendrobatidae (\"poison dart frogs\") get their alkaloid toxins from insects they eat, which can get their alkaloid toxins from plant origins, like the leaf litter on the forest ground.  \n\n* https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/49/12/945/247218\n\n&gt; Goats can eat all manner of poisonous vegetative matter converting an unusable form of energy into a usable form of energy for any preditor that can consume a goat.\n\nGoats are not the only animal, are an introduced species in many contexts, and do not have to be a part of a ecosystem or a land use, where it could be used in other ways.  For example, if the goal were ecosystem restoration, native herbivores could occupy the same spot in an ecosystem without having to be consumed by humans.  If the goal were to produce food, again, land on which that is done is most efficient used through cultivation of plant crops which are consumed directly by humans, as talked about above.  \n\n&gt; Ultimately all of the animals in nature have a point of diminishing returns wherein they have consumed an equal amount of energy to that which can be harvested from the body. Beyond that point, the animal fails the energy audit.\n\nThis is a bit confusingly worded, and it's not clear what you're referring to.  If I'm understanding you correctly, this is what determines whether a certain predation behavior or target is thermodynamically feasible and worth pursuing for an individual species, not what the structure of an ecosystem has to be.\n\nIn fact, speaking of energy flow, thermodynamically speaking, each tropic level in a food web loses energy to entropy the farther up you go (about 90% of the energy is lost each level), which is why one of the fundamental reasons plant agriculture is inherently a more efficient way of producing calories of food (because you get more calories of food, for the same amount of resource inputs) than animal agriculture is.",

That's more for topping off your car, rather than bringing it back from the dead.\n\nCharging a car from dead to the point where it would crank could take hours or days with just solar panels, especially if you have bad weather.  Charging your cell phone and calling someone to come give you a jump might be faster.\n\nFor \"battery dead\" situations you probably want a [portable jump-start battery](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=car+starter+jumper+power+bank).",

Unfortunately those fluctuations just come with the territory of clean energy. Why can’t energy companies use all that solar during the day time and either burn gas at night or have battery storage for all that energy produced during the daytime? Why can’t the companies have back ups for cloudy days? What would you propose to increase solar usage that doesn’t have this purported problem?",

Their customer support isn’t super attentive but so far they’ve responded to emails and they haven’t blown their schedule. I think in a lot of cases people want their solar product right now and might not believe the timelines put forth in the estimates (for me it was 8-11 weeks from ordering and so far they’re on track). As a separate example in the same space, I know people who have ordered gas generators from other companies and they can’t get them installed for several months due to supply chain issues. \n\nThere’s always a few horror stories with Tesla Solar, but it doesn’t seem to be the norm given how many installs they’re doing per quarter. That being said, Solar Roof is it’s own beast and still a prototype basically (I wouldn’t buy it yet). \n\nEdit: not sure why the downvotes, this was my experience…",

"comment": "&gt;There was no backtracking lol! I just pointed out that your \"research\" showed less than half of our articles are about Tesla which is 80% of the car market and the biggest solar installer.\n\nI don't know if you know what backtracking means, but claiming my post was wrong, then after I showed evidence of it, admitting you cover Tesla more often because they have larger market share, is what I would consider backtracking.\n\nI wouldn't consider what I just did \"research\" in any real form, just a quick example to prove the point.  The last 3 days seemed simple enough.  I imagine I could do it over any range of days randomly chosen over the past few years and get similar results.\n\nI like that you said less than half of your articles... knowing full well that 8 of those articles (31%) are related to industries that Tesla doesn't operate in.  Do you honestly believe we should be counting e-bike and wind farm articles?  Seems very apples to oranges... I thought it was pretty clear that I'm calling out biased coverage in the vehicle OEM and solar installer arenas.  Once again, 76% of your automobile coverage over the last 3 days was directed at Tesla.\n\nWait...\n\nYour site just added two more articles.  One is Tesla, and the other isn't related to vehicle OEMs, bringing vehicle OEM related content up to 82% for Tesla. Aye!\n\nI don't think that's for lack of content related to other OEMs.  Hell, just navigate the last 3 days on this subreddit... there's plenty.\n\nI'm assuming you didn't click that link related to solar.  Tesla isn't the largest solar installer in the US.  That award goes to Sunrun.  Even if Tesla were in the lead, let's say 1%-10% ahead of their next competitor, why does that preclude Electrek from covering those other companies?  You say that you cover other solar installers.  If you're confident in that, then share the counts.  How many articles have you posted about other solar installers, and how many have you posted about Tesla solar?",

"comment": "Hi, SunPower rep here, This loan payment schedule is a bit confusing. As far as high price goes, SunPower is always going to have the highest price. The M series panel we use has extremely low degradation, so in year 25 it is still performing at 92.5% of what it was 25 years ago, in year 40 it is still performing at 75% efficiency. So the reason SunPower cost more is the technology is so well designed it ultimately saves you more money because of its lower degradation. With other panels the degradation tends to be 1 to 2% per year. Which means as the years progress you ultimately pay more money back to the electric company to cover the difference. The second thing you need to look at is whether or not freedom Solar is a factory direct SunPower provider. This is where it tends to get problematic. With a factory direct install the entire warranty comes from SunPower, that covers all products on the roof and all craftsmanship and installation. If the warranty on the install is done by the company selling it, it is only as good as long as that company is in business. I work for a master dealer and we loan out at 3.99% interest which is the lowest rate right now. I’m surprised anybody can claim 0% interest when our lowest rate in January was .99% we have seen a 400% increase in interest rates this year. Overall the loan quote they gave you looks a little confusing.\n\nSunPower is number one in customer service across the going average of every installer, but I encourage you to find out if freedom solar is a factory direct install, if not you could potentially open up a can of worms.\n\nThat being said, as the shameless, self-promoting individual that I am, I will be happy to show you a quote for a factory direct install if you’re in the Southern California area, thanks",

"comment": "I used to be excited about Aptera, but I think they missed their window of opportunity.  \n\nThe car only seats two people.  It’s very wide, making it difficult to maneuver in parking lots and city traffic.  It has only three wheels, making it harder to avoid obstacles and potholes.  And it’s a startup company, meaning there’s a higher risk of defects and it would be more difficult to have repairs done.\n\nThere was a time a few years ago when some consumers might have been okay with these compromises in order to get an efficient electric vehicle with solar power.  Nowadays, I think there are much better options at similar prices.  I don’t see why anyone would rather have an Aptera instead of a Bolt, or a Niro, or an ID4.  \n\nThe one potentially big advantage is that the Aptera claims to have a range of up to 1,000 miles, but that trim will cost $45,000.  Several established companies already offer more versatile electric cars for that price, which have fast charging capabilities.",

To make matters worse, Duke Energy seems to be finding new ways to undermine our efforts.\n\nTo my utter disbelief, I discovered that all of my banked kilowatt hours were wiped clean in June. More than 3,000 kWh were snatched up by Duke Energy without compensation, due to some fine print I missed. Now, they have the audacity to propose doubling our monthly fixed rate and paying us next to nothing for the solar power we produce - power generated during peak demand hours.\n\nDuke Energy wants to have their cake and eat it too. They're eager to sell us back electricity at full retail price while crying victim, even as they rake in billions of dollars in profit. It's appalling how this corporate behemoth is actively stifling the growth of solar energy, all in the name of greed.\n\nMoreover, in the past decade, I haven't seen a single utility truck from Duke making repairs or improvements to my home or neighborhood.

"comment": "This is a peer reviewed study?  What journals was it published in?  I don't see any...\n\nIt's considering additional revenues over associated costs from plug-in EVs over a decade through 2021.  First of all, does anyone see an issue with comparing EV revenues for over a decade?  How many EVs were there in use in 2011?   How about 2014?  2018?... 20201......?\n\nApproximately 1.2%, of the cars in the country are EVs today, or about 3.3 million plug-in EVs.    In 2021 there were only 1.3 million.  In 2018, there were 500k.\n\nAnd to be clear, most of the EVs were sold in a small handful of states.  California accounting for the lion's share of adoption.  Know what else California has?  Lots of rooftop solar.\n\nThey're claiming $3.3 billion in additional revenues over associated costs.  Lets say there were 500k registered EVs on average over that decade...  That would average out to $660 in additional revenue per vehicle per year.\n\nHow plausible is that?\n\nAt 13,500 miles per year on average, and 3.5 mi / kWh on average, each car would use about 3850 kWh.  At 15 cents per kWh on average, that's $578 per car.\n\nSo in effect, they're suggesting each EV would have made the energy companies more profit than the EV paid for electricity total.\n\nInteresting....\n\nPlease let me know if you see an issue in my math.",

"comment": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/carter-white-house-solar-panel-array/  \n>The White House itself once harvested the power of the sun. On June 20, 1979, the Carter administration installed 32 panels designed to harvest the sun's rays and use them to heat water.\n\n>By 1986, the Reagan administration had gutted the research and development budgets for renewable energy at the then-fledgling U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and eliminated tax breaks for the deployment of wind turbines and solar technologies—recommitting the nation to reliance on cheap but polluting fossil fuels, often from foreign suppliers. \"The Department of Energy has a multibillion-dollar budget, in excess of $10 billion,\" Reagan said during an election debate with Carter, justifying his opposition to the latter's energy policies. \"It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy.\"\n\n>And in 1986 the Reagan administration quietly dismantled the White House solar panel installation while resurfacing the roof. \"Hey! That system is working. Why don't you keep it?\" recalls mechanical engineer Fred Morse, now of Abengoa Solar, who helped install the original solar panels as director of the solar energy program during the Carter years and then watched as they were dismantled during his tenure in the same job under Reagan. \"Hey! This whole [renewable] R&D program is working, why don't you keep it?\"\n\n>After they came down it took a soft-spoken administrator from a small environmental college in Maine to rescue the Carter panels from being a forgotten curiosity stored in the dark corner of a vast government warehouse.\n\nIn 2010 one of those panels ended up in a museum in China. In 2012 China declared war on pollution. Also,  \n\n>Then, in 2007, the industry got a significant boost when Wan Gang, an auto engineer who had worked for Audi in Germany for a decade, became China’s minister of science and technology. Wan had been a big fan of EVs and tested Tesla’s first EV model, the Roadster, in 2008, the year it was released. People now credit Wan with making the national decision to go all-in on electric vehicles. Since then, EV development has been consistently prioritized in China’s national economic planning.\n\nIt's not just a smart investment. It's a long term plan that lasts for more than 4 to 8 years at a time. Anyone can throw money in any direction and call it an investment. Look how much money GM invested in their Bolt EV, their best selling EV in USA in history, just to discontinue it. \n\nSticking to the plan is hard. Especially when 50% of USA leaders sabotage the other 50% every day for decades.",

That was very much my original idea, to provide a few vegetarian and vegan options that make them feel welcome in an otherwise meat-centric environment, not just a salad or something else that feels like a grudging afterthought.\n\nFor instance, I make a pretty bad-ass portobello burger. I tried making a \"veggie burger\" but ended up deciding that it was pointless trying to improve on nature. Also, my fries are always cooked in 100% canola oil.\n\nHowever, while I do pay strict attention to avoiding cross-contamination, I don't know that I would be able to satisfy a strict vegan who's looking for a reason to complain. But trust me, that type of customer is not exclusive to the vegan community. BBQheads like me can be just as obnoxious, lol.",

"comment": "Even if my approach would have been rather back-bitching, I take it from your information that you are not that kind of person. So why have them turn you into it?\n\nSo, here's what's to do instead: Do what they can't. Use compassion and sense to defend yourself. Tell them about how no one is made feel better by constant shaming upon, especially not for something very, very personal. Tell them to imagine jokes on them, but not for actions but for who they are and try to be. Ask them if it would be okay to constantly shame someone who got a tattoo of something symbolically important and very private for them, from the very same people in which he or she confided by telling them about it. Would it be okay to joke about a gay person, just because they don't *try* to hide their orientation?  no. Because you don't have to be gay, or vegan, or tattooed in order to feel hurt if jokes are on you. You just have to be human.\n\nFor some people, veganism is not a choice, but a part of their being. No one wants to be forced to hide their being, that's cruel. And *no, vegans will not label you a bad person for consuming animal products. But they will - and with good right, too - think of you as cruel if you can't respect their choice not to. (And especially in that manner, it takes less to ruin christmas for somebody.)*",

A study doesn't have to be government funded to be non-biased or factual. These are certified scientists with years of training that conducted these studies; not some hippies with an organic market trying to sell more food. He cites a plethora of scientific journals and academics on occasion (Harvard Medical School). And by now I would hope you've at least questioned the integrity and motives of the US government (PRISM for example). \n\nPlus, your comparison to the bible is a typical fallacy. People use the bible to prove Christianity is real, and their evidence comes from the bible. The Raw Cure talks about the benefits of being vegan by citing clinical research and scientific studies conducted by persons other than himself. I hope you realize the difference here.",

My problem with this, is that while seeking weight loss advice, all the 80/10/10ers have told me to eat 3000-4000 calories a day, and it just doesn't seem to work for me. Do you track your calories at all?",

People are starting to realize that vegans can easily eat healthy, because we cut out meat and usually replace it with thinks we're supposed to be eating anyways like nuts and seeds and beans, etc.\n\nIt just not anytime soon. Food is very intimately sewn into the world's lifestyle, and not a lot of people are comfortable with changing their diets. If they were, Americans would not be facing this obesity epidemic.",

"comment": "The most common accepted definition by vegans is: \"Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.\" Yes, non-vegans might have a different definition or misunderstanding, but this is the definition almost all vegans go by. I think it's also in the sidebar of this subreddit. Nothing is stopping you from calling yourself vegan if you're only eating plant-based food I guess, but it just will make it confusing for other people you mention it to. Especially if you have to say something like, \"I'm vegan but I only do it for health reasons, I don't avoid cruelty free hygiene products or anything like that.\" It's more accurate to say you have a plant-based diet, and saying this causes no confusion or questions from other people (especially other vegans). Like I said, it's your choice though, nothing is stopping you. I just feel like it would cause unnecessary confusion and might mislead people into thinking vegans are only about the food aspect of it. When in reality, it's so much more than that, from buying cruelty-free deodorant and shampoo, slavery-free chocolate, etc.",

"comment": "Patients aren't consumers though. Their satisfaction is based on how well they recover. If it's healthiest for the patient to eat plant foods then that's what the doctor orders. It's no different than exercise, medicine, sleep, or any other thing a doctor may prescribe that a patient may or may not want to do. You wouldn't be a good doctor if you let your patient do something that would adversely affect their recovery.\n\nAlso, plants make up the majority of food diversity. If you were to remove poultry, beef, and pork from the diet, you are only removing 3 ingredients. People tend to think there's no diversity in vegan diets because their experience with plant based foods is so limited. There are literally thousands of edible plants, each with multiple ways of preparation. Not to mention, besides pork, people don't eat meat for flavor. All the flavor that people ascribe to meat is actually plant or mineral (salt) based. Not a single seasoning comes from animals. Flavor diversity is entirely made possible because of plants.\n\nProcessed foods are also filled with fillers and are absolute murder on your digestive system. Frozen/fresh plants will always be more nutritional than processed meats.",

Until we figure out what's going on I want the bees to survive, and if commercial beekeeping is a net contributor to bee survival then I'd say it's overall better to support it at least in the short term. I agree that in the longer term your suggestions are a better way forward, but the bees need protecting right now or there won't be any left. Like I said though, it's frustratingly hard to find any information on it. \n\nFWIW, I haven't bought honey since I started eating vegan, but I'd still like to know.",

"comment": "_\n&gt;Seems to be animal worship. I see no vegans trying to understand farmers or their practices here.\n\nWell... I went vegetarian over a decade ago, and slowly made the transition over to plant-based, and then went vegan. However, I grew up on a farm in Northern California raising, killing, butchering, and eating various \"food\" animals (e.g. cows, pigs, chickens, goats, etc.) while also raising and caring for various \"non-food\" animals (e.g. horses, dogs, cats, etc.). My father was a large animal veterinarian, and tagging along with him gave me the opportunity to also see how CAFOs (i.e. \"factory farms\" ) look from the inside; I've been to many different farms in subsequent years, some large, some small, some factory level, some family level, and I am intimately familiar with what happens there, be it terms of nutrition, animal psychology, or the abuses that can and do happen throughout the system.\n\nI would also go hunting with my father several times a year, usually for deer, but occasionally for smaller game. I'd long been well versed in skinning and cleaning animals, and had shot rifles regularly at targets, so the big learning curve for me involved wrapping my head around the psychology of the deer; e.g. when and where they move, what they look at, how they react, etc. I had been involved in the training of horses and dogs for some time, but that turned out to involve a very different set of thinking skills than what is required for groking truly wild animals.\n\nAnd I'm not unusual, /u/thedroid124; there are many people on this sub with similar backgrounds who are now vegan. What ***exactly*** do you believe I/we have failed to understand about farmers or their practices?",

And that's because not everyone can choose what to eat or always have something to eat. It doesn't have anything to do specifically with veganism. It's about politics, economy, (un)enployment, and so on. Meat is more expensive and has greater costs, no matter how you analyze it, but no one says eating meat is elitist. I call BS; this is hypocrisy.\n\nIt's weird how people always criticize vegans and label them as elitist, but when we want to search and debate solutions to ensure everyone has access to proper food and information -- and therefore the right to better health and better choices --, most remain silent or use **yet another excuse**.",

"comment": "It depends. I definitely think there are ethical vegans with their heart in the right place. I am an ex vegan who went vegan in 2016 after Gary Yourofsky's speech and Earthlings. Keep in mind I have autism and learning difficulties. I met my probably now last ever girlfriend at that time, and she had a weird way of life, but her excuse for not being vegan was a defeatist argument along the lines of \"People are just going to buy animal products anyway, nothing's ever going to change.\"\n\nAs a result, I was sort of convinced by this and went back to eating meat, out of despair. I felt depressed about it, I didn't have any of the knowledge or understanding I have now about veganism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJump 2 years later, that was completely false, as new vegan products were storming the markets everywhere. And a few years after that I learnt critical thinking, a little before 2020, but I went full vegan in January 2020, finally discovering stronger ethical arguments which solidified the position I'm in now. things I hadn't known back in 2016, which I think if a lot of ethical vegans knew, there would be less ex vegans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I truly an ethical vegan? I don't know. In a way I feel I'm innocent because I didn't know any better. I'm sure that's the same for some ex-vegans. Now I do know better, and I can't ever see myself going back until a carnist can score the goal posts I set to convince me to not care about animals anymore. Such as finding there is no sentience in animals, listing all their complexities that make them a living being.",

So stay on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I will try to make things simpler. We can:\n\n* reduce 30% of CO2 release with cheap, reliable, well-known technologies\n* *hopefully* reduce 1% by machines that are not peer-reviewed, that actually produce [more CO2](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2023/01/19/direct-air-capture-climate-scam/) than they capture, and we need 250.000 of them\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo which of the 2 is better?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForget cows, scientists already work on this. Stay on topic of DAC.\n\nTo further help you:\n\nDAC **can** be implemented **after** all other, far superior, solutions are in place.\n\nBut until that is done: use prototypes to make better machines, not this useless crap.",
