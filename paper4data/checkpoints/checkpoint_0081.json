You could put the savings of your power bill/solar loan combination towards your mortgage as well as your 30% federal tax credit for the solar PV system.   \nAt the end of your solar loan, you would still have solar reducing your bill so the now greater savings can go towards your mortgage.",

What i notice is that deceit is massive amongst the media, politicians, celebrities and so on. I expect you are on the cusp of mentally retorting that SCIENTISTS say it. Well again, with any source, look at the who, what, when and why. We dont live under communism or something else, we live in a fucked up elitist capitalist society where you wont read or hear about something Ad nauseum unless very powerful people want it that way. \n\nTo come to my earlier point about how environmentalism used to be something everyone agreed on, understood and was onboard with, i should elaborate my opinion. Everyone was onboard apart from those who obviously couldnt be.. industries for example like Oil companies, vehicle manufacturers and their political pawns. Since the mass introduction of alarmist climate talk, these companies are now fully onboard, with environment PR departments. We actually see BP say its green. Its like the whole fucking world has turned upside down and you guys didnt notice. Heck go buy a quarter million dollar electric car, it doesnt matter what the industrial process involded ie, the mining of materials, fabricating, transporting and the endless list continues, its still GREEN!

Just look past the sticker price and factor in the $7500 federal tax credit (if your tax situation allows) and any state/local incentives you might be eligible for, and look for dealer specials. Or, more simply, look at the very attractive leasing options being promoted.",

So while it may be argued that a full electric car is better than a full carbon fueled bus, that standard is hardly met.",

Weight = efficiency loss. \n\n&gt;If they can supercharge the truck in 1 hour just as they can supercharge a Model S in 1 hour, and there's 1 hour of downtime, then that's exactly 0 lost time.\n\nCan they, though? Are 1 MW chargers going to be available everywhere these trucks need to go?\n\n&gt;Scaling up battery production (read: capacity) is exactly what the gigafactory is doing, not at all an impossible task or even a challenging one, just requires work &amp; time.\n\nBut energy density is the problem, not production capacity.\n\n&gt;Scaling to 100,000 long haul trucks is a different effort that will come after they've had time to advance battery tech &amp; truck range...\n\nAgain, this assumes that battery tech will advance significantly, and there's absolutely no guarantee that it will.\n\n&gt;...and after they've accomplished making a huge difference in the trucking industry by tackling &lt;300 mile trips, which are almost without a doubt the most common and least efficient trips.\n\nThis assumes that the drivers drive 300 miles and have no problem waiting for their truck to charge before moving on to their next job.\n\n&gt;You're trying to say \"a lot of power is needed\", and that's true. But progress is always held up by a single factor at any given point, then you solve that and another issue becomes the constraining factor.\n\nThat's not all I'm saying, I'm saying that there's a problem with virtually every aspect of this plan.\n\n&gt;At no point in the future do I expect lack of power supply to be a constraining factor on the roll-out of electric semis, for all of the above mentioned reasons.\n\nAs long as you don't mind using natural gas as your power source, it wont be a problem. My point is: If you're going to depend on natural gas to power these trucks, why not simply have them produce their own power? Hell, a Nissan Leaf is dirtier than a Honda Accord Hybrid in certain parts of the country.",

"comment": "Good question. So the tax credit goes to whomever owns the car. If you purchase/loan it you will get the full $7500. If you lease it you are not the owner so the leasing agent will get that $7500 but have the option to pass some of that on to the consumer. \n\nThere are very few companies outside General Motors Financial that will lease a Chevy car, it's a little more intricate than a normal loan. I can't speak for other leasing companies but at GMF they offer $2k or so back the consumer and keep the rest of the $7500.. So you miss out on a lot of money, one thing they can't do however is take state tax credits so if you lease and your state has credits available you are eligible for a portion of those.",

"comment": "I get the frustration. But where do you start? Federal funding for basic science research, as a percentage of GDP is declining: http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/RDGDP%3B.jpg\n\nThe biggest tool in our research toolbox are supercomputers. Researchers need advanced computers for modeling and simulations to push energy-saving technology ahead. The U.S. had plans to developer an exascale system in the 2018 time-frame. Lack of funding has pushed those plans to 2023. Meanwhile, China has exceeded the U.S. in the number of supercomputers on the Top500 list. https://www.top500.org/lists/2016/06/\n\nYou would think that moving to electric vehicles and alternative energy supplies is in our national interest. But you would be wrong. There's a concerted push to end all subsidies to help these nascent industries. Who benefits? Fossil fuel suppliers. \n\nAnd then there is the 2016 GOP Platform, which considers coal \"clean\" also says this: \"Climate change is far from this nation’s most pressing national security issue. This is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it.\" See page 19-20 https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL[1]-ben_1468872234.pdf\n\n\nYes, the stuff on this list is depressing but worse is the anti-science movement in this country and the lack of unified resolved to confront the climate change problem directly. \n\nThis sub is about climate change research mostly.  The solution here is to subscribe to multiple subs.  See, for instance, https://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/",

"comment": "Yeah, the argument here is not very solid. For the short term, yes. But he doesn't really take into account exponential growth trends.\n\n&gt; but despite the explosive growth in EVs the total over the same time period is only about 80,000 cars. And Norway’s explosive EV growth rate is starting to slow \n\nHe seems to say that the sales of EVs is large, and therefore should impact oil consumption, but hasn't. Then he says the market share is not really that large, and doesn't reassess his original arguments. We don't expect oil consumption to fall until the market shares of EVs grow such that the total number of sold ICEs decrease. That's just obvious.\n\nAnd there's little reason to believe that the market shares of EVs will not continue to grow exponentially in the long term.\n\nEVs in Norway does have a smaller market share this year. But the government incentives are still there. They don't start getting cut back until next year. And the benefits for those buying EVs today are still huge. Yeah, they have to start paying some toll fees, but still much less than gasoline cars. So the incentives is probably not the cause..\n\nThe slowdown in sales here is best interpreted in light of the release of new EV models. In the coming 2 years there's going to be a new Nissan Leaf, GM Bolt, Tesla Model 3, and many other with significantly more range.\n\nLast year the Kia Soul EV came to market, and was hugely successful because it was just a really good EV. This year there's no such new models yet. People are probably waiting.\n\nWhen there are just a handful of models available, of course the market is volatile.",

"comment": "The elephant in the room is Nissan which tests have shown that they have lost significant battery capacity even over fairly short periods of time/mileage.\n\nThe concern over Chevy's Bolt is completely un-warranted, Chevy is using LG Chem for their battery packs which is based on the Volt's rather stellar battery performance.  The Bolt's batteries are also LG Chem, and will be liquid heated/cooled so there is no reason to believe their battery performance will degrade significantly.  As far as cost being a factor I don't think that's really fair, at least right now Chevy is using custom batteries made specifically for them, and likely at larger volumes (at least right now) than Tesla.  Tesla is using off the shelf 18650 batteries which could easily account for the cost difference. \n\nSearch for Idaho National Laboratory's battery testing results.  They are doing the most intestine long term battery tests of anyone (at least published).\n\nLastly I don't put so much faith in this 'survey' in that it is based on the Tesla's reported range based on their software, which I'm sure puts all kinds of variables into play which will report differences based on temperature, location etc.  Idaho National Laboratory is pulling battery packs out of working cars and doing rather exhaustive testing to the batteries to get real hard numbers.  Given the sample size is smaller but the methodology is sound.",

"comment": "&gt;Chinese customers can buy the ES8 sports utility vehicle, with a range of 500 kilometers (311 miles) on a single charge, for 448,000 yuan ($67,783), the company said late Saturday in Beijing. That compares with 836,000 yuan for Tesla’s Model X, and 596,300 yuan for BMW’s gasoline-powered X5.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SZerhIG03Ow?t=4h8m29s\n\nUnder the EPA range, it will likely be around 300 km given it has a 70 kWh battery pack, surprising the NEDC is so close, maybe they confused the two standards. For the price it's acceptable, but don't expect comparable range as the Model X 100 kWh, unless they release battery upgrades which is a possibility. At 70 kWh and $60000 it's pretty much the best choice right now, the Model X 75 kWh starts at around $80000. The acceleration time is pretty good as well of 4.4 s from 0 to 100 km/h, the faster Model X starts at double the cost. They're trying to carve their own space with better interior and comfort and acceptable range for a second car. Unless I skipped over, the charging speed was not mentioned but there is battery replacement. I also don't recall if they made any announcement for manufacturing and release date, in the past they planned to release it in China first with a later global release.",

It really should be every supermarket though.\n\nThe second most useful location, especially for people who can charge at home, is at roadside fast food restaurants.

Denver has a decent if still somewhat lacking DCFC Network and there are loads of EVs everywhere already.\n\nAlso after unveiling the ID Vizzion, they talked about the soon-to-come diesel renaissance and how awesome and clean their new diesel is.

That is a $750 option (every model 3 will have this even the eventual base model).    The lowest priced Model 3 currently also comes with the premium package.   To get the same features in the Bolt you have to add the Infotainment package that is another $595.  To get the same safety features that are standard on the model 3 (collision warning, automatic braking, etc.) you have to add the Driver confidence package and that is $495.  Aluminum door sill plates (Model 3 has) $125.  They even make you pay for carpet floor mats at $140.    The Bolt price is just not very compelling for what you get.   When you add in all the extras it is very close to the price of a Model 3.   The fact that they don't include the safety features on all trim levels is just a head shaker for me.   They really need to start including all of that (and fast charging) on all models and they also need to lower the price if they want these to sell.",

"comment": "&gt;This should be, \"perceived\" affordability.\n\nOn a new car it's real, not percieved. This is for UK and may be different elswhere depending on taxes/fuel costs. The cost of going EV is about £10k more than same class ICE car ie LEAF vs Pulsar, Zoe vs Clio, Soul EV vs Soul ICE or Kona EV vs Kona ICE etc. Sure, if you were thinking of buying BMW M3 then Model 3 might be a good alternative, but the article is about small, affordable cars. Even Mercedes C-class starts at about half price of Model 3 in Germany right now. When mythical $35k version arrives that may be different, but it's not here yet and it's still not really a cheap car. Planned 2019 Skoda e-citigo is rumoured to be ~€19k. ICE versions are currrently a €10k car.\n\nThat £10k buys a lot of fuel and service. On the new car you won't be changing brake pads for 3 years at least, service every 12 months is not that expensive, BTW nissan reccomends service every 12 months/15000miles for the LEAF as well. It is cheaper than ICE car but not by that much. At average mileage of 8k miles/yr it would take about 5/6 years to break even. Most people buying new cars sell them before that. Lease is usually 3-4 years. Cheapest LEAF lease is ~£340 currently. I can get 200hp/top spec Astra for ~£165 (both 48mths/8000m).\n\nThe prices may be going down, and for luxury EVs there is case to be made. OEMs can sacrifice some profits to get EVs out (wheter it's to have halo car, meet regulations/quotas - nevermind) but on affordable cars margins are slim and batteries are still expensive.\n\nHopefully in the next few years the gap will start closing enough for EV to be viable option for budget buyer, but we're not here yet.",

"comment": "More chargers are coming all the time. When I first got an EV five years ago there were a tiny fraction of the chargers that are around now. Also, as more EVs hit the roads houses are getting more charging access. Fast charging isn't something you want to do too much even with the best batteries available and slow charging is far better for battery life. Europe has far fewer garages and a lot more on street parking and they're getting to grips with it without resorting to people using fast charging all the time. Apartment blocks need to install charging, on street charging needs installing but this is all happening. Fast chargers that take five minutes are not going to be a thing for some time because the batteries can't take that much juice and delivering the amount of power in that short amount of time is also highly demanding on infrastructure. You're talking about shifting 80kWh in five minutes which will require 1.2MW charging. Habits built up around the internal combustion engine can't apply. Also, in the case you give you would stop half way anyway, or maybe an hour away and do a quick 20 min top-up to ensure you've got enough to go on with. But whatever, I keep hearing the excuse for why EVs can't happen and whatever is done with the technology to improve it, the goal posts always move. Someone actually said to me that an EV was useless until it could do 1000 miles on a single five minute charge. No pleasing some people. Fact is, the internal combustion engine has to die, it's a filthy polluting monstrosity and we just have to be creative in how we use the new technologies to kill it off but it does mean we can't just go on like we have done. The car is a victim of its success and I'm not even sure it should be a primary means of transport in the future.",

VW could be a bit more on the case.\n\nBut hey, I'm grateful they are at last moving these OTAs out.",

"comment": "You want to ask? Do I need to upgrade my service to add a dedicated 240V circuit? Is their room in my panel for it? How many amps can a put on that circuit? If I put in a 50A circuit and we install a NEMA 14-50 outlet, does code require me to use a GFCI breaker? What if I plug an EVSE into it (which may also have a built in GFCI), will that trip it?\n\n14-50 is common, but it's just as common for people to install EVSEs (\"wall adaptors\" / \"wall chargers\") that are directly hardwired (no outlet / plug). EVSEs have the advantage that you could add a circuit with &gt;50A (they're typically configurable).\n\nYou can install smaller 240V circuits, you just need to use the appropriate outlet and adapters to go with them (or an EVSE).\n\nThe standard connector for 240V (Level 2) charing in North America is J1772. It doesn't matter what EV you buy, they will all allow accept a J1772 plug. If your circuit can supply more current than the charger in the car can use, the car will only draw what current it can. If the car can draw more current than the plug can supply, you can tell the car to decrease the number of amps that it tries to draw.",

For example use Eaton V48M34F2216 Transformer to step down from 480 Delta, to 400/237 Wye and then you have 237 Volts at the vehicle. This has the obvious benefit of increasing power for the same copper costs, but you could also save copper costs by letting three power groups take one line each from a 3ph Circuit breaker and then all share the Neutral return.   \n\nThe other thing I would do is use the hardwired method to link all the EVSEs in a power share group together.  If you are already running conduit for the power wires it would be trivial to add a shielded twisted-pair with a 600V jacket insulation (to be allowed in the same conduit as the power wires).  This will be much cheaper than a wifi install, but also more reliable.  If that wifi craps out because of some interference, every charger will need to limit power draw to 1/x of the normal total power available to the group where x is the number of EVSE in the group.\n\nhttps://support.wallbox.com/na/knowledge-base/power-sharing-installation-guide/",

"comment": "I'm gonna give a controversial opinion here - but one-pedal driving is not a feature that's all it's cracked up to be. Initially, it's very cool and feels like a different way to drive. The more you drive EVs, the more you realize that operating an EV without using one pedal actually gives you superior control and is much safer. \n\nWhy? Well - because when you use the brake pedal to decelerate in an EV it uses the electric motor(s) to regen brake/decelerate first anyways. It'll only revert to using the physical brakes to stop you if you're applying enough force or need to stop faster than you can achieve with the electric motors alone. It also means that your foot is always on the brake at a complete stop, that your brake lights are always active when fully stopped and that your brake lights are active every single time you're pressing the brakes to decelerate. \n\nI've also found one-pedal to be inconvenient for longer commutes. In most EVs, if you're using cruise control and you turn it off with one pedal mode enabled, you start to rapidly decelerate until you find the right amount of throttle to maintain the speed you need to achieve, as opposed to simply coasting.",

If you have a child EuroNCAP rates the P2 3% higher, but then ANCAP says they're equal. The biggest difference between them is the 11-12% win in Safety Assist features for Tesla. (Shout-out to a consistent 6% advantage to Polestar for Vulnerable Road Users, but then 3-4% worse Adult Occupant safety.)\n\nThe model 3 has superior phone key, a larger frunk, dashcam/sentry, dog/camp mode, supercharger network, rear wheel drive, better efficiency, faster charging, significantly more powerful infotainment processor, a superior low voltage battery, more, and all of it is standard on all trims in addition to the previously listed features.\n\nI specifically did the math without counting the tax credit. To be clear, I'm not criticizing your decision then (especially when the price was a LOT closer) or even if you had done so today; I'm a big proponent of \"let people be happy\".

"comment": "One issue is that you're adding weight to the car.  Probably with advanced thin-film solar cells this will be a good idea, but with silicon solar cells you're essentially decreasing the gas mileage, so it counteracts the energy you're picking up.\n\nThen I'm sure there are structural issues - solar cells tend to be somewhat brittle, and it might take some engineering to find a good way for them to be durable on top of a car.\n\nFinally, to a degree it requires changing consumer behavior about cars, because most cars are in garages for most of the day. As has been said, the energy you get while you're actually driving is very small compared to the energy the car uses, so the real advantage of this is charging the car while it's parked.  And so, unless you leave your car in a sunny parking space all day, you're not getting good use from the solar cell.\n\nTo be clear, I DO think most cars will EVENTUALLY have solar cells.  But a car-mounted solar cell is going to get less sunlight, decrease gas mileage, and require special design considerations.  So while roof-mounted solar cells are now often a good investment, the price of solar panels will still have to come down a bit (and they'll have to be more lightweight) for it to make good economic sense to have them on a car.",

"comment": "Klein is getting a lot of criticism for her pipe dream of immediately banning fossil fuels and converting to renewables.  A recent reason.com critique of her book described what she's advocating:\n\n&gt;\"We need a Marshall Plan for the Earth,\" Klein declares, updating one of the most tired historical metaphors for her purposes. \"It is entirely possible to rapidly switch our energy systems to 100 percent renewables,\" she asserts. As an example of \"one of several credible studies\" showing how such a vast energy transformation could be achieved, she breezily cites a 2009 Energy Policy paper by two researchers, Mark Jacobson of Stanford and Mark Delucchi of the University of California, Davis. Jacobson and Delucchi think we can replace all coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear power by 2030 with wind, solar, and hydropower while fueling a fleet of electric cars. How? By deploying 3.8 million 5-megawatt wind turbines, 5,350 100-megawatt geothermal plants, 500,000 1-megawatt tidal turbines, 720,000 0.75-megawatt wave power generators, 1.7 billion 3-kilowatt rooftop solar panels, 40,000 300-megawatt solar panel farms, and 49,000 300-megawatt concentrated solar power plants.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sound easy? Well, if the world were to begin deploying these renewable energy technologies next year that would mean erecting approximately 250,000 wind turbines each year for the next 15 years. As of the end of 2012, there were a total of 225,000 wind turbines operating around the world.\n&gt;\n&gt;Similarly, the world would have to install 113 million rooftop solar panel systems per year in order to meet the 2030 goal of 1.7 billion. In 2013, the U.S. installed a record 4,751 megawatts of solar panels, which would be roughly equivalent to 1.6 million 3-kilowatt rooftop solar panels. As of 2013, the entire world had installed 100 gigawatts (100 million kilowatts) of solar photovoltaic panels. Combining the rooftop and solar panel proposals, this hyper-solarization would mean deploying more than 10 times the current installed capacity of photovoltaic panels, not just once but every year for the next 15 years. And never mind that there are virtually no commercial wave or tidal energy production systems currently operating.\n&gt;\n&gt;Klein never ever discusses how much her solutions to the climate crisis will cost. But Delucchi and Jacobson estimate a price tag of about $100 trillion for their program. That entails spending about $6.6 trillion per year from now until 2030, more than 11 percent of the entire world's 2013 output of $75 trillion. Such a crash plan for global energy transformation might be possible, but it would be a massive shift from our current course. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projected in July 2014 that $7.7 trillion total will be invested in building new power plants between now and 2030, of which renewables will get around two-thirds. And Klein accuses the proponents of free markets of \"magical thinking\"?",

"comment": "Am I the only one that doesn't think these charges are unfair?  Imagine if every single rooftop had solar panels and didn't draw electricity off the grid at all.  Who then, would be paying for the grid?  If its not the utility companies then the government would have to pay for it (i.e., you).\n\nIMO such charges are the opposite of short-sited - they are completely fair and justifiable.  If adding to the grid costs money that would otherwise be paid by your utility bill, then you should absolutely be charged something to connect to the grid.\n\nAlso, I highly doubt this would encourage people to switch to batteries.  You're talking about 5-10k worth of batteries that go bad in maybe 5 years.  The payback cost is just not there.  $100 is a small cost to pay, imho, for the convenience of being able to connect to the grid.\n\nBesides, if you have enough panels, that $100 charge will get eaten up by the electricity you generate anyways.",

This changes some of my answer (do you have panel-level monitoring?), but know that your panels are also probably covered by 25 year warranty and should be replaced if they are the issue.\n\nThe situation here depends a good deal on your exact situation. It sounds like you have a dealer who installed solar panels that you own on your roof. It also sounds like the whole system is down the way you described it and that would put the problem as either an installation issue (wiring) or the inverter.\n\nNow hopefully the installer will get back to you and check it out, but if you have more difficulty you might try contacting customer service for the solar panels - this depends on the type of panels you have, and some better companies will work with you on getting it fixed. You might also ask to be reimbursed for the down time power cost. Make sure to get a good report so you aren't paying them to fix something they messed up the first time.\n\nThe inverter probably has a 10 year warranty, too, so if that is the issue it should be covered by the inverter company.\n\nIf you happen to lease the panels (such as a big name like solar city) then they are not holding up their end of the contract. Take that as you will, it is leverage you can use to get a tech out to check and surely there is a clause for repayment of lost energy.",

Please, please, please, can we stop trying to make things into what they're not, and use materials that are reasonable for the application?\n\nAsphalt is really good at sitting there and supporting absurd amounts of weight without any problem.  It's got good traction, it's easy to work with, and it's quite recyclable.\n\nSilicon panels are really good at soaking up the sun and creating electricity, are fairly fragile, and by the time you cover them in enough stuff to make them a poor substitute for asphalt, you've got a ton of crap added that doesn't need to be there.\n\nIf you want to put solar panels up places, put them up, elevated, in parking lots.  You can install just plain old solar panels instead of exotic stuff buried under a thick layer of glass, it helps reduce energy use by keeping cars cooler, and it gives you a great energy source for charging mid-day shopping EVs.\n\nSolar panels make bad roads.",

"comment": "Sometimes now, and more so in the future, the world is going to have so much renewable energy that the entire way of thinking about energy will have to change.  \n\nDaimler Fuel Cell Director Professor Dr. Christian Mohrdieck:\n\n&gt;A very popular argument in the public discussion is that battery electric vehicles are more efficient than hydrogen. This is true on vehicle level because the conversion of hydrogen is an extra step that is not involved in battery electric vehicles. However, this is not taking the whole picture into account.\n\n&gt;If we drive a battery vehicle today, using electricity from the European electricity mix, then the well-to-wheel energy balance of this vehicle is slightly worse than the energy balance of a fuel cell vehicle that uses hydrogen made from natural gas. This is due to the fact that electricity production is not very energy efficient in Europe. We still have a lot of coal and nuclear energy involved, which is very energy intensive...more https://medium.com/@cH2ange/prof-dr-mohrdieck-daimler-in-the-long-term-i-expect-a-diversification-of-drivetrains-and-5a6c58e94081\n\nBjørn Simonsen, [NEL Hydrogen](http://nelhydrogen.com/):\n\n&gt;The entire efficiency question loses importance with the energy regime we’re moving into. We’re coming from a mentality where we are used to thinking about energy as a limited resource. If you have a barrel of oil, it’s extremely important to use it efficiently. However, you can use it across several days or years. Whatever you don’t use one day, you still have it for the next day. Whereas when we look at renewables, you have to use them when they’re there. We have to look at energy with new eyes. What matters is what does it cost? It’s not necessarily all about the total efficiency. Prices are low enough to make hydrogen and distribute it to fueling stations at costs that are comparable to what we’re used to today with gasoline and diesel.\n\n&gt;If you charge your car from your rooftop solar at home, it’s obviously more efficient than converting it to hydrogen first, but you won’t see people driving their electric vehicles to a solar farm far from their homes to charge whenever it’s really nice and sunny outside. That is why the two technologies will live side by side and complement each other...FULL ARTICLE: https://www.pv-magazine.com/2017/08/30/future-pv-the-feasibility-of-solar-powered-hydrogen-production/\n\nFor the first time, the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell expo is part of Solar Power International in Las Vegas happening right now http://www.h2fc-fair.com/usa/",

That's why no one is building them. \n\nAnd if you don't think there is an externalized cost to tax payers for climate change you are crazy. Cheap fossil fuels from yesterday are going to cost us a LOT tomorrow. You will probably ignore this. Pro nuke market rate guys are great at compartmentalization. But if you ask any scientist and any energy sector analysts the question, \"What is the fastest cheapest way to achieve a zero carbon energy economy?\" They will tell you, massive investment into renewables, grid upgrades, battery storage, keep existing nuclear plants until they need to be retired. The economics are clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

However, the LCOE has an inherent flaw in that it does not measure grid costs, so while the LCOE of scalable renewables is much lower than the others, there is one key factor that isnt addressed: The more variable the power supply of a grid is, the more redundant supply and grid infrastructure (eg batteries for load smoothing) is needed. \n\nAs the percentage of the total capacity of the grid supplied by variable sources rises above the average [capacity factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor) of that grids variable supply, this exponential growth begins to make the grid costs of new variable supply prohibitively expensive. \n\nThis means that for grids with lots of variable power, reliable sources like nuclear (which has the highest capacity factor) actually have negative net grid level costs, and by building nuclear power we can not only replace the existing scalable reliable sources (gas and coal), we can increase the viability of new and value of existing renewable sources.\n\n&gt;environmental cost\n\nevery option available has significant environmental costs. For example, solar panels inject hazardous and environmentally harmful chemicals (cadmium compounds, silicon tetrachloride, hexafluoroethane and lead) into the atmosphere, water systems, and soil both as a byproduct of their construction and as they leech out of the damaged/expired panels filling up our landfills.",

"comment": "Yes there is a financial analysis you have to do, and it is ideal for very specific situations. I agree with you on that. All I’m saying is that the decision to get powerwalls isn’t purely about money. If you can afford powerwalls, they serve a purpose other than a ROI - they are meant to do both peak shaving and time of peak load shifting. So in addition to having backup power when needed and reducing your electricity bill through the playing of peak usage and time of use, it lowers the demand on the generation side, so it has an effect on cost for consumers as a whole as well environmental benefits. I guess I’m taking issue with your comment that they have no uses than what you listed, which isn’t entirely true. If the person can afford it, it has quite a few uses.",

"comment": "Price would depend on the car, volumes etc. It's a custom design and build, which is the price problem - you can't just use the existing mass-produced tech so it makes it more expensive, even if you are making loads of cars you're nowhere near the volumes of boring standard PV panels. You also know it'll be at a sub-optimal angle so will also need more than an equivalent rooftop array. It'll not add huge amounts of weight, though it will add some. It also adds more than trivial complexity as you can no longer disconnect your main battery when parked, unlike how all EVs currently operate, so you would see a significant change to requirements for power management otherwise you'd be suffering horrific phantom drain problems. I'm sure good designs would emerge, minimising the impact, but adding extra requirements never make things cheaper or more reliable. Equipment with a long history of working well in mostly stationary settings may work fine in a moving, vibrating one - or it may not. I'm sure it could be made to work with moderately trivial changes, but again that will be extra cost most likely.\n\nI don't need to cost it all, I'm not the one saying identifying issues is a nonsensical attack. I know that PV where I live takes about [17](https://greenbusinesswatch.co.uk/uk-domestic-solar-panel-costs-and-returns-2019#section7) years to payback for rooftop so the car would need to be significantly better to stand a chance of being positive in it's lifetime. I know my car, like many others, doesn't spend much of it's time in the sun. I don't need to calculate anything to be able to tell that not ALL CARS would benefit from being PV. Some might, it would be up to whoever thinks that to demonstrate that. You can call it a feeling if you like, there are many things that are undesirable by large margins that I don't bother to calculate so I'll just have to live with my preconceived notions I guess.\n\nI know you're not claiming to never need to plug in, though the video kinda hints that. The video itself is odd, being clearly old but only uploaded recently. I hope that in future the situation changes such that you become right and it's only people defending a viewpoint who don't see that PV cars are better, as that means better stuff for us all. I look forward to changing my mind.",

In the winter we generally stay right at 500 as we keep the house around 65f and use natural gas for heat. In the summer we only broke 2000kWh two months last year. Also while my electric company does net metering they do not buy back or allow me to carry over from month to month so we can't build a balance over the winter. That being said the installer recommended we only build a system that will produce 60% of our use. I did get him to guarantee our price if we add more panels in the future. Also the 16 are taking up the entire south facing side of my roof. We can add a few panels on the east if we want to, but I  going to try and get my house more energy efficient first. We upgraded the AC this winter and I am considering a radiant barrier to cool down our attic as the HVAC is in the attic. Also looking into an EV in the next few years. Sorry for such a long paragraph, but I am really excited about reducing our energy consumption.",

You wouldn't for example want manufacturers to label products that contains honey as vegans for obvious reasons. Its therefor best to take the simplest definition of \"veganism\". But then there is the practical consideration that someone makes regard their goals on reducing animal suffering whether you call it vegan or not. There is a real argument to make that in that line of thinking, the suffering and damage of eating honey is marginally contributing negatively to bees when compared to all other agriculture that causes suffering to them. That's not an argument to say that it's vegan or not.\nIts very often true that the amount of effort you need to take to get the last bit of the puzzle requires much more work than the 99% before it. For example, local governments in the Netherlands are now spending millions to pave bicycle lanes with solar panels while there are still homes with single glass. \n\nSomeone might point out the obvious point that not eating honey is actually no effort assuming you cook your own meals which is true.\n\nThe larger point is that the is constant suffering to the bees due to the consuming of plants too which is unavoidable. Of course adding more to that isn't vegan which is why eating honey isn't vegan.\n\nAnd while it technically is and should always be true that honey isn't vegan, i personally don't give much of a damn to buy 2 pots of honey per year from a colleague when im contrasting that with all the other suffering that im not causing by not eating meat. I don't care much about the label, i use it in restaurants to communicate my interests broadly but if you dont think im vegan im 100% fine with not being one. To me its not about the group identity or label or status but about the bulk effect. Yes i don't eat honey most of the times if it's not necessary. Now if I'm cooking some rare recipe recipe which contains honey, i might try it with first and then i can compare it with agave. If my non vegan partner makes a salad recipe ill be less inclined to ask for two separate bowls if it contains honey in the dressing when compared to cheese for example. If a restaurant has a plant based option with honey thats a struggle to take out ill be fine with it where as im not taking that stance with cheese and meat for obvious reasons",

Please.. gtfo.  EMF? If they are worried about EMF they better dump their 5G cell phones and cell towers.  I live next to 100 wind towers if they wanna star griping about noise or visual aesthetic problems.  Every one of those towers has metric tons of concrete and rebar poured to support it.  Lets talk about EMF generated by every one of those generators and the fact that all the blades are pure fibgerglass resin glue... god, I just cannot.\n  \n\"Several members of the audience expressed health concerns related to living near a solar farm. Leaching of hazardous materials such as cadmium and Teflon into aquifers, as well as potential EMF radiation exposure from inverters were two of the issues raised. One resident cited an increase in cancer cases in a West Virginia community where Teflon was present in the water. An Apex flyer discloses that there is a “rare” risk of fire, increased heat around the panels, and a humming noise from inverters.\"",

"comment": "Nothing would be harmed. This happens normally in any solar + battery setup when the battery charge approaches 100% and the charge controller slows down the charge rate below what the panels can provide, in order to prevent overcharging the battery. It will also happen if you've programmed a maximum safe charging rate. But you'd be losing out on some potential solar production; that energy would just be lost, so you'd not be getting full value for your panels and available sun.\n\nWould this actually happen though? The size of your battery bank for whole-house solar will be something like 1000 Ah for 12V batteries. At a charging rate of 1C, that means you could theoretically charge safely at 1000 amps at 12V, which is 12 kW of power. Assuming your solar array is smaller than 12 kW, you should never run into this problem.",

I have been told that solar panels don’t connect to the home. They connect to the grid. You actually only get power from the grid.  The panels just feed power into the grid.\n\nNo, generated power is used locally first, then the grid either takes the excess or supplies the deficit.\n\n&gt;As a result during power outages, the power company will disconnect your panels so that they can work on the grid safely. And moreover, homes with battery-less solar systems will not have power, even if they do have solar panels.\n\nNo. You *only* disconnect from the grid in an outage for safety reasons. While off grid, of course you now are limited to using as much as your system can make, and can not make up any deficit from the grid.\n\n&gt;In order for solar panels to generate power for an individual home during a power outage, a battery must be present so that the disconnection to the grid happens between the grid and battery, not between the grid and panels.\n\nNo. **It depends on the system.**  Some will only work when the grid is there, some need btteries to work off grid, some will work off grid with no batteries.",

"comment": "&gt; Most of the EVs being made will be one form of e-waste or another inside of 20 years with no real plan for what to do with it.\n\nWhat do you mean? Surely you know that main reason for battery recycling not being a thing is that they still are way more valuable than the constituent elements you can almost fully recover from them? Right now most of relatively low numbers of retired automotive battery packs are going straight into stationary power storage.\n\nOther than the battery, remainder of the car is just as recyclable as ICE one.\n\n&gt;I just feel like we are being handed a consumerist solution (by fortune 500s and governments) that doesn't actually solve anything in the longrun.\n\nWell, it depends what you mean by \"the long run\". Because you can easily point out that we as humanity should completely ban rural living, return most of the planet to wilderness and live in very compact mega-cities with vertical farms powered by nuclear fusion and orbital solar panels. Before that happens though we have tad more time sensitive issue of global warming action being already 40-50 years late.\n\nThere are many issues with current world and ways to improve it shouldn't be dismissed just on the basis of not being perfect.",

"comment": "The short answer, it was simple, quick, and pretty seamless. The much longer answer is… ours is a solar edge system but one of the earlier ones before they started building their own batteries.\n\nThere are positives and negatives between solar edge’s own battery and one by a third party… solar edge use a DC coupled battery so it can save energy directly from the panels.\n\nI went with an AC coupled battery, which means a separate app and some conversion losses - DC solar goes through the inverter, (high 90s efficiency) to AC… sends the energy to the battery which converts it from AC to DC (high 90s efficiency) for storage in the battery cells. Then when you need the electricity it gets converted from stored DC back to AC for usage.\n\nSE’s DC coupled battery is more expensive, requires a more recent inverter, and the battery relies on the inverter to convert stored energy to usable AC. This is more efficient, but it means if you’ve got a 5kW inverter, your maximum output from solar AND battery is still 5kW. With an AC coupled battery you could have 5kW coming in from your solar panels and have 5+kW coming from battery storage (or more depending on the battery you choose) so able to deliver considerably higher load.\n\nSorry… long answer to a short question..!!",

"comment": "They're the Elite series SIL-420 BG.\n\nOur solar program is not the best. Get moved to a time-of-use plan with a base $13/mo facilities charge. You can only offset your peak generation for peak usage and off-peak generation for off-peak usage. Rates are $0.26-$0.28 peak and $0.11 off-peak. My current rate is $0.14-0.15 flat rate. Electric bill can never go negative and you just carry your energy balance over each month, then true up is in November at a terrible rate of something like $0.04 for any leftover energy balance in November.\n\nA battery can be useful for coordinating the timing of peak/off-peak in this situation. Also I work from home and have had maybe 3 or 4 power outages over the past year during storms, but they usually only last a few hours at most. I do have an Ioniq 5 that I've used in the past to power my workstation, refrigerators, etc. during outages but I'm limited to a single 15A/120V circuit for that, so no whole-home backup option there.\n\nI was told a single Tesla Powerwall 3 would fall somewhere around $20k for one and $30k for two. At that price, I don't think the value is there for me, hence leaning toward putting it off for now.",

It is surprising reading a list of ingredients in something like a smoothie, getting to the end and so far so good, then BAM, whey for seemingly no reason right at the end. As godisagnostic says, I usually assume a lot of things aren't vegan if I don't know for sure--bread offered to me at people's houses, bagels, etc. Sourdough is--I think--almost always vegan, but anything else likely has egg, butter, or milk in it.\n\nAlso, if you want to get really picky, things with just sugar may not be vegan, as they use bone char in the refining of sugar. I think some research on google cold clarify that for you.\n\nFrench fries may not always be vegan, either, if they use tallow in the frying.\n\nAnd careful of vegan cheeses as even the soy ones will use casein I think it is... look at the soy cheeses in trader joe's, none of them are vegan :( I think it's casein, but that may not be right.\n\nDespite all that, I hope it doesn't sound like you're extremely limited... I find it very easy to be vegan. Trader joe's has been carrying more and more vegan things--vegan butter, milk (almond, soy, etc), rice krispie treats, cereal, tofurkey and other 'meats', lots of the cultural frozen foods are vegan, they have vegan sushi and depending on where you live various vegan wraps as well. Then there's all the produce, of course, and energy bars, if you like that kind of thing.\n\nLastly, happycow.net is a good source of finding vegan-friendly stores and restaurants in your area.\n\nHope that helps :)",

Luckily I was in a position to tell them otherwise and they seemed to accept it. I haven't got as far as pointing out the unhealthyness of animal products yet, but mostly that's because I haven't done research in that area (I'm mostly an ethical vegetarian who aspires to be vegan).",

"comment": "Well, the thing is that if you want to *stay* vegan, you have to do it for yourself. Else you'll just go right back to the way you were. \n\nBiggest point? You're eating something that was once alive. That thing died in a horrible way. It's no secret about the abuse; if you don't like it, go vegan. \n\nBest way? Look at the impact you'll make. Veganism is more than not eating meat. You actually have to stand up and fight for change. YOU are making a difference. That's why I stay vegan.\n\nSocial interactions? Well, the majority of my social circle are at least vegetarian. My omni friends are considerate enough to let me choose the places we eat. Every restaurant has something vegan, sometimes you just have to eat a salad. Plan ahead for picnics and family gatherings. My family is awesome and they make things vegans, like side dishes and such.  \n\nI don't feel heavy and weighed down as I did before. I cut out most processed foods and eliminated HFCS specifically. I can tell when I eat something bad (like Oreos, for example) because I just feel ...icky, for lack of a better word. I wake up early, go to bed late and I don't feel tired. I get to make some amazing food that I would have never tried if I were still eating meat. \n\nBut that's just me. If you want to go vegan, find your own reasons. No one can convince you. \n\nedit: if you want sources about the changes you can help make, I'll go look some up now.",

"comment": "Basically a cake of soybeans that was allowed to ferment. It doesn't have a strong flavor, though. Slightly mushroom-like. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempeh\n\nOne of my favorite meals is cut into thin slabs, coat with sriracha, molasses, smoke flavor and garlic powder and then fry it oil until browned and then serve with grits and some sort of vegetables (a salad would work too). I like to put fake aoli on the tempeh — basically just some veganaise mixed with smoke flavor or maybe a touch of maple syrup.\n\nYou can also use different flavors in the tempeh rub, for example curry powder to give it an indian taste. The slabs of fried tempeh are also excellent in sandwiches. I think tempeh is my favorite vegan protein source!",

They may think it's because of the treatment (which wouldn't be an issue since it's their chicks), rather than the hatchery itself.

"comment": "I'm not sure about moroccan dialect but they should be able to understand masri. ~~I'll go grab my arabic textbook later to doublecheck.~~ **Yep, Masri should be fine!** I've only taken a couple semesters of arabic but I made a point to learn this specifically (it has just been a while) and double-check with my teacher who was a native speaker.\n\nThe words written phonetically in english with translations:\n\nana = I \n\nana nabati = I am vegetarian\n\nbakulesh = do not eat\n\nmantujaat = products\n\nil-haywanaat = the animals\n\nAna la akul = I don't eat \n\nal bidu = the eggs = لبيض\n\nal la-hmu = the meat = اللحم\n\nal awsa'l = the honey = العسل\n\nas samak = the fish = السمك\n\nal bas'sa = the onions = البصل\n\nal thawma = the garlic = الثوم\n\nal kirath = the leeks = الكراث\n\nal thawm a'Muammaru = the chives = الثوم المعمر\n\nal zibda = the butter = زبدة\n\nAna la tashrib ___ = I don't drink = أنا لا تشرب\n\nal haliib = the milk = الحليب\n\nIf I were you, to be safe, I would speak the following phrase: أنا نباتي, أنا نباتي وأنا لا اكل منتجات الحيوانات\n\"It means I am vegetarian and I don't eat it the products from animals\" \nPronounced: \"Ana Nabati, wa la akul mantujaat il-haywanaat\" with emphasis on 'la akul' \n\nMy experience in cyprus (although greek culture mostly, not arabic) and jordan and qatar is that a lot of the general population is not familiar with even the term vegetarian so be prepared for them to be confused and laugh or joke with you. Don't overload with saying all of the things you don't eat, just whatever is likely to be an issue for the food you are ordering.\n\nIf you are having difficulty with a specific vendor/waiter/etc. you can point to animal products and say \"أنا لا أريد هذا\" = \"Ana la ooriid hatha\" = \"I don't want this\". And follow up with \"شكرا جزيلا\" = \"shookran jazeelan\" = \"Thank you very much\" \nSo he/she doesn't get too frustrated :)",

Lol, actually as catty as I'm being in this post, I used to not be vegan just like most other people.  I don't treat anyone like a monster for not understanding the importance of going vegan.  I take that as more opportunity to learn better approaches of teaching people that just don't get it.  Most of us were there once, right?  Even though, I know it's insanely frustrating now that I do know, it just doesn't click for everybody in the same way.",

Just be mindful of water content as it can get watered down sometimes.\n\nI'm also falling in love with this vegan, lentil artichoke stew. It is very flavorful and goes great with some oyster crackers.\n\nhttp://www.pcrm.org/health/heart/recipes/lentil-artichoke-stew",

Op is right if people would reduce their meat and dairy and fish consumption by 90% the impact on the climate and environment would be manageable. \nFish populations would regenerate we wouldn't need factory farms and could let cattle graze on grasslands that are unsuitable for crops suitable for human consumption. This would be a lot better for the animals and for the environment.\nDon't get me wrong I think there are a lot if good reasons to go vegan but saying that we can only solve the climate crisis if everyone goes vegan is not only factual wrong it also alienates people from veganism and make us look like a bunch of ideologically driven cultists. \nThe less animals we use the better for everyone and everything but we need to try and stick to facts if we want to convince people to join the movement. There is no need for exaggerations our arguments are strong and valid as they are now.",

Our philosophy is based on harm reduction which is a utilitarian approach to things, but you are acting like a deontologist where you are seeing acts as wrong in and of themselves. You don't care about harm reduction, you just care about being able to say these things are wrong and move on. \n\n&gt;No, not 0, because you just said it's justifiable to experiment on non-Aryans so that we can solve health problems created by exploiting non-Aryans.\n\nNo one justified the experiment. It is call making the best of a bad situation. The experiments are wrong. Now what? We got a cure for this. I explained 3 reasons why this is different from meat consumption and your response is to ignore and just say it is wrong still. \n\nI did see in this thread you were a communist so maybe veganism is an aesthetic to you and you actually don't care about harm reduction.",

Eating vegan is a huge start and makes you a wonderful plant based eater- but I can’t imagine how you can honestly feel like your not contributing to animal suffering with each paycheck. \n\nThis isn’t about gross margins- you can argue over Symantec’s if you choose- the issue for Me is crystal clear. \n\n\nPlease- explain to me how this works for YOU? As a VEGAN that doesn’t want to contribute to animal cruelty- I quit my CAREER as a chef and couldn’t profit off animal cruelty let alone cook it. \n\nBut this was after 2 years vegan. It’s been over 10 years now and I still can’t understand those that really think their vegan but are also part of the system. \n\nLike can you at least  acknowledge the issue I’m trying to bring up? \n\nBut sure- make fun of people for their preferences for not wanting veg on a burger (says the vegan cooking animals!)",

For me, it was the fact that i started cooking for myself at a certain age, and i found naturally that i had a preference for cooking vegeterian dishes purely naturally. \n\nI used to make a lot of potato curries and i was always shocked by how full i was after eating it, i thought it was weird how a potato curry could fill me up and give me so much energy since i was used to eating meat to get my sense of fullness and energy. \n\nEventually, i got on the rice and beans train and have been on it ever since, once i got my first taste of beans and grains, it was basically a wrap, i was an unintentional vegan from that day onward, rice and beans is just way too satisfying, filling and easy to prepare in comparison to meat, it is not greasy, there is no mess, its just boil, add some sauce, done diddly doo! \n\nA meal of rice and beans for me lasts about half a day, couldn't say the same for meat, if i ate meat i would be hungry in the next hour or so, and i felt as though my stomach felt off somehow.",

They dont keep the hens until they die of old age fore sure, and egg laying hens were selected to produce 10-30x more than wild hens so it will cause them issues as other posters pointed out. Also where do the hens come from on this farm? Probably a supplier that grind up the male chicks as it is a worldwide practice.

"comment": "In my experience, trying to force anyone to do something they're not already inclined to do is a great way to alienate them and ensure they'll never convert to your POV. Vegans who are rude or condescending to non-vegans are, and excuse my French, the *worst*.  \n\n\nA couple of grey areas:  \n\\- If you're having a meal with that vegan and they are offended by seeing you eat meat/animal products and ask you not to, establish that boundary before agreeing to share a meal  \n\\- If you're visiting the home of a vegan and they ask you not to bring meat/animal products with you, that should be respected  \n\n\nIf they're trying to force you to change your diet in any other instance, occasion, or holistically- ^(booooo)  \n\n\nRe: the tofu— tofu can be delicious and it can be awful. Try it from different restaurants. Try making your own. Try all its forms and flavors. It's incredibly versatile which means when it's done right, it's literally amazing; it just soaks up whatever its marinated in or poured on top of it. For a simple recipe to try at home:  \n\\- Take extra firm tofu out of its packaging, give it a gentle squeeze over the sink so it's not so drippy  \n\\- Cut it into cubes and lay them on top of a folded tea towel, then put another tea towel on top. Add a cutting board on top of that, and then something heavy (I use a cast iron pan or a big book)  \n\\- Wait 15-20 mins  \n\\- Add tofu cubes to a container with a lid, along with your favorite marinate. I suggest whatever you typically use for chicken, or you can make your own; just balance salt, sweet, acid, and fat. Let it marinate for an hour at a minimum  \n\\- Preheat your oven to 425º(f)  \n\\- Drain your tofu and put it on a lightly greased baking tray   \n\\- Bake for 25 minutes, giving it a little stir/shake in the middle  \n\n\nYou'll have roasty delicious tofu cubes to use in salads, with rice, in curry, on pasta, or you can become a tofu gremlin like me and just shove them in your face hole. Enjoy!",

"comment": ">Otherwise, pretty much the whole population would be unhealthy and smelly.\n\nI mean.. tbf ever since i stopped wearing a mask i noticed how awful sooo many people in public smell lol. \n\nless than 5% [of the world is perfectly healthy. ](https://www.livescience.com/51122-world-health-problems.html#:~:text=Researchers%20analyzed%20information%20on%20about,health%20problems%2C%20the%20researchers%20found.) Which is fair. It's rare to be in perfect health. Though alot of those health problems (acne, heart disease, pre/diabetes, HBP, etc.) Are exasperated by meat and dairy consumption. \n\nAnd idk where you're at, but here in the US less than 12% of Americans are [metabolically healthy](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2018/11/28/only-12-percent-of-american-adults-are-metabolically-healthy-carolina-study-finds/) i.e. having optimal levels of 5 factors: blood glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure and waist circumference (without the need for medications). All factors that can be tremendously optimized by cutting out meat and dairy and eating a well rounded plant based diet (as any good doctor who keeps up with the times will tell you too.)\n\nAnd (also in the US) less than 3% live healthy lifestyles with factors based on exercise, smoking Vs. Not smoking, diet and body fat %. And \n\nDoesn't mean there aren't unhealthy vending machine vegans playing into those stats. But ime most long-term vegans know to eat a well rounded WFPB diet. \n\nAnd as far as smell- \n\nfunny enough there's actually been some studies showing how [meat makes you smell worse](https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/31/8/747/364338) because it's harder to digest in the GI track, leaving behind residue that when released and combined with sweat, intensifies the odor. \n\n>Results of repeated measures analysis of variance showed that the odor of donors when on the nonmeat diet was judged as significantly more attractive, more pleasant, and less intense. This suggests that red meat consumption has a negative impact on perceived body odor hedonicity. \n\nTbf though, broccoli, asparagus, garlic, cauliflower and cabbage can make you stink (and fart) too. And I eat those pretty often lol. Same with processed junk food. \n\nAll in all I'm just pointing out for fun 🤷‍♂️ ofc there's non-vegans who don't smell bad (especially in eastern asia where alot of folks have genes that barely give you any body odor) and vegans who do (as a deadhead I know plenty of smelly vegans😂) but in my personal experience I do gotta agree in general, vegans and vegetarians do smell less offensive on average. You really are what you eat. Your body literally uses what you put into it to make new cells and function. I definitely feel like a body that's only breaking down plants and fungi would smell better than someone whose also processing decaying flesh and pus filled mammal milk.",

Unless you put them somewhere  where no trees can grow, then factory farming is the best way. Anything that improves cows life makes them worse for the planet. \nWhat you describe costs one thing manpower. Right now, one farmer can run a farm with 100 hectares. That's why food is so cheap in the west.\nThere is no way to make climet friendly affordable meat, especially not if you dont want to let cows suffer to such an insane degree.\nYeah, cows might be good for some bioms, but then we have so little it might as well be illegal.  \n\nBut since 90% could never imagine giving up meat to the required extent, the only hope is lapgrown.",

I think most people are plenty capable of being vegan if they actually tried in good faith, it's like a month of relearning recipes and basic nutrition (which arguably, most people do anyway). The hardest part is interacting with non-vegans. Most just haven't really thought about it, and use the excuse of having weak character as a way to justify not putting in effort to change, while simultaneously trying to make you feel bad for existing in a way that makes them feel guilty.",

I get the idea that eating meat is a belief system - although you may or may not get that ists and isms don’t denote belief systems. They denote the cultural supreme of a factor, or the willing participation in that. So everyone here ranting at me in the annoying tone that put me off in the first place, telling me that carnism is a belief system, well you’re super smart and not exactly correct either. cool. People use it here interchangeably with “meat eater” People on the outside use “carnivore” that way too. So colloquially, my OP was correct. technically we are all wrong. \nMy point was you sound like a dick when u use that word and aren not winning any converts. You’ve proved my point with your know it all know but nothing vibes. Love you though. \n\nListen I get it. I’d put money down I went vegan before anyone who down-voted me or hit me back angrily was born. Talk to me back then about what it was like to free your mind and your plate. Way different.  Its easy for you. way easy (groan.. lame old guy. I know. but true too) and you are making it spikey because that’s fun. But you sound like a jerk and I’m letting you know. I’ll tell you that this is such a popular movement now not from people being dickheads, but by people making great food, and friends, being healthy, and communicating compassion.",

But there are some vegans who insist it is immoral, insist that it is always a choice, and they are either assumed to represent the whole of vegan society and/or they are taken seriously when they insist others who do not denigrate people for using those programs are not *real* vegans and therefore do not represent a genuine vegan ideology. \n\nHope that helps.",

If your answer is \"no\", then \"food chain tho\" is not a logical justification for [carnism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnism).  If your food chain argument is not hinging itself on might-makes-right, but rather on \"well it's just natural\", then you need to take a look at [the appeal to nature fallacy.](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/36/Appeal-to-Nature)\n\nAlso, on a minor side note:\n\n&gt; I'm not comparing homophobs to vegans\n\nYes you are comparing. You're drawing a line to homophobes stating anti-gay rhetoric on a public forum and vegans stating anti-carnist rhetoric on a public forum. However, this is actually **not a bad thing.** To compare is **not** to equate, you were just drawing a harmless analogy. Just a minor correction on your choice of words here. Don't be sensitive about drawing comparisons, they're perfectly fine to draw, and one can draw comparisons between anything as long as there's a reasonable explanation for it.\n\nHowever, that being said, the specific manner in which you're using this analogy actually happens to be a false analogy anyways. Because being gay isn't a choice, whereas being a carnist (or more specifically, remaining a carnist despite being presented with arguments that debunk carnism) **is** a choice.",

You sit there all day trying to talk him out of it, but he keeps coming back with non-sequiturs and B.S. quips as to why he's going to eat you anyway.  Then a much bigger giant, a giant to the giant that's going to eat you, comes along and does the same thing to *that* giant.  \"Oh please, don't eat me, I'm sentient, I have feelings, I have a wife and kids\", the mid-sized giant says.  The huge-sized giant goes, \"weren't you just going to eat that microscopic guy who said all those same things to you?\"\n\nVeganism vs. carnism is wise empathy vs. mindless, selfish apathy.  The pic shows two people talking at cross ends.  Person A is being indignant over a perceived threat to their selfish pleasures, Person B is talking about respecting the rights of others.  Excuse me if all I just did was circle around to the point of the pic.",
