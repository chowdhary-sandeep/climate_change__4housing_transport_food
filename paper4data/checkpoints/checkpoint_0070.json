As the plan is long and time is short, here are some key elements in bullet form:\n\n- The cornerstone is advanced nuclear power. This begins with a focus on removing restrictions to R&amp;D by revamping the NRC, plus spending public funds to match private investment funds. \n\n- Fission is the focus for the first phase, particularly breeders reactors that can consume existing nuclear waste stockpiles. \n\n- Brayton Cycle research receives funding as well in order to allow advanced reactors to operate at higher temperatures (this is a good thing from a thermodynamics perspective) in order to massively reduce water requirements.\n\nAs these plants become commercialized:\n\n- Desalination plants are built near coastal cities. As their water needs are met with desalinated sea water, upstream water can be returned to previous uses, including growing forests.\n\n- Some surplus nighttime power charges EVs.\n\n- Other surplus nighttime heat and power is used to synthesize hydrocarbons as the US Navy has demonstrated (and as was done with the Fischer-Tropsch process clear back in WWII).\n\n- Waste heat runs steam plants for centralized heating of cities and towns.\n\n- PRT systems like /r/SkyTran start to replace personal vehicles.\n\n- Existing hydropower plants become huge energy storage systems as advanced nuclear displaces them for baseload. This aids intermittent sources like solar and wind.\n\nOther:\n\n- Solar and wind are built in areas of high insolation and stable winds, respectively,  *and where embraced by local residents*.\n\n- Mob grazing is used to enrich topsoil, which also sequesters carbon.\n\n- /r/Biochar is produced and used to sequester carbon in topsoil.\n\n- Fusion research is pursued at a later date.\n\nThose are the highlight. There's more, but feel free to hit me with any questions.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.024344188811179873,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26965341360616907,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18332254566657383,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3483689936996516,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17519837464420965,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22314996443485313,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1809784206494318,"ev_1":-0.09338163607768024,"ev_2":-0.07007543610929734,"ev_3":-0.08042283465291196,"ev_4":-0.07265561036666289,"ev_5":-0.06427544343013854,"ev_6":-0.049537698995114135},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

When selecting only CCS/SAE stations in the filters it clearly shows multiple stations that only support 24kW (sometimes it doesn't even go that high).  I count at least five near me.  Especially Chargepoint has a lot of 24kW chargers popping in the search.  They might all be registered as 50kW chargers in Plugshare, but they definitely are not.  Regardless they are still fast chargers and are registered as such.  \n\nThat gives exactly the expected numbers from the article I linked (Careful there was a typo in there (116 vs 1160 CCS locations)) ~1160 locations with ~1420 chargers.\n\n That was compared to ~362 locations with 2530 chargers (these Superchargers stats are from early 2017, as of last month it's closer to ~500 stations with ~6000 chargers).\n\nThe other major difference is where they are located.  Most CCS chargers are in big cities on the east and west coast, Superchargers are every where and cover a way larger area.\n\n&gt;\tIf you want to make doubly sure, you can explicitly set the filter by kW as well.\n\nI have never seen the kW filter in plugshare, where is it?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000487102481808203,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1434786038808852,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18988972112603034,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1868904241513042,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2333522046950615,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2004188615679771,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.008490932416558886,"ev_1":-0.10579407536035708,"ev_2":-0.14112193602089135,"ev_3":-0.1713992048781699,"ev_4":-0.09259800937152984,"ev_5":-0.11321013815662202,"ev_6":-0.08098676924057073},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

So Tesla has cleverly made available a, shall we say, less than compelling (crippled) version of the base Model 3 at less than $45k that I don’t think many people would want and that you can’t order on the web site.

Once I get the system fully running after the power company comes and switches the meter I’ll run a 24 hour off grid test and see.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004998086078558117,"1.1.1_stance":-0.31200367388337324,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17569012523879599,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23643861937184818,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27452170362976647,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25445631812216407,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.036140311538474634,"ev_1":-0.09016057067007448,"ev_2":-0.2435810042917607,"ev_3":-0.02669520889079043,"ev_4":-0.0023834537617707006,"ev_5":-0.0021330685509989658,"ev_6":-0.006599101606601228},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

That has the potential to cut 4bn tonnes of emissions a year by 2030, not far off double the fossil fuel emissions from the whole of Africa and South America today. Including the restoration of degraded forests adds almost 3bn tonnes. Much of this could be achieved for less than $50 per tonne – half the price polluters pay for carbon permits in Europe today.\n\n>Energy efficiency in buildings, industry, lighting and appliances remains a no-brainer – 4.5bn tonnes a year by 2030 – as does slashing methane emissions, particularly from leaky fossil fuel installations. The latter could save the equivalent of about 3bn tonnes.\n\n>There are some interesting details too. A shift to “sustainable diets” – ie eating much less red meat in rich nations – could cut 1.7bn tonnes of emissions, equivalent to all the annual pollution from fossil fuel giant Russia. A push towards public transport, bikes and e-bikes has the potential to cut emissions more than the rollout of electric cars, showing both are needed. An often overlooked option – burying charcoal in fields (biochar) – is relatively costly to implement but potentially huge. Along with avoiding the ploughing of fields, which releases carbon, biochar could save 3.4bn tonnes of CO2 a year.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.034048320104488994,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18408794380527865,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22759494835008676,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16570282301538874,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2501672606774951,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3514597818832829,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24705315767548391,"ev_1":-0.18164372675392634,"ev_2":-0.14013789246206607,"ev_3":-0.17377176338028733,"ev_4":-0.14310329438488664,"ev_5":-0.13567902504561857,"ev_6":-0.18570544232083708},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for e-bikes and public transport being more effective than EVs in cutting emissions)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present: self-reported behavior is not present, but prevalence is mentioned ('4.5bn tonnes a year by 2030' for energy efficiency in buildings, industry, lighting and appliances).

Here's what I'm thinking for you:\n\nlights - I'm assuming CFLs equivalent to a 60 W bulb, which would be 14W each (http://rewardlight.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/LightOutput_Equival_Chart1.jpg), times 6.  3 hours per day.  You could save by going to LED rope lights.\n\ncoffee maker - assuming 1,500 W, 0.5 hours per day\n\nmicrowave - assuming 1,000 W, 0.25 hours per day\n\nDC fridge - assuming 75W (e.g. http://www.whynter.com/productdetail/refrigeration/portable_freezers/308), running 50% of the time.  (I don't know your location, so I don't know if that's reasonable).  Note that this is the largest user of power in your system!  (Even though it's only 75W, it's running a lot of the time)\n\nradio - maybe 10W, 1 hour per day?\n\nrouter - I'm surprised that you found a 12V DC one!  What brand is it?  Mine uses around 4W, left on 24h per day.\n\nTotal: 2258 Watt-hours, or 188 amp-hours.  Assuming you want to go 3 cloudy days with no recharging, and only discharge to 50% (see below), that's 1128 amp-hours of batteries needed.  Buy an inverter that's large enough for the largest load that you'll run at any given time.  Assuming you don't run the microwave and coffee maker at the same time, maybe a 2kW inverter.  Use short, heavy-gauge wires to it.\n\nFor my system, I got 10 of these: http://usbattery.com/products/6-volt-batteries/us-2200-xc2-lf/\n(6V, 232 amp-hours each) and wired them in series-parallel, for 1,160 amp-hours (580 amp-hours usable).  Here's a good graph showing how long your batteries will last (number of charging cycles) based on how deeply you discharge them: http://usbattery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/usb-expected-life-cycle.pdf\n\nI'm less familiar with the solar side of the equation, but here are my thoughts:\nif you're taking out 188 amp-hours per day, on average you need to put at least that amount in.  So, you would need (500 W = 42 amps @ 12V) * 4.5 hours to get the same amp-hours in.  But, you're not going to get a sunny day every day.  If you're only getting sun every second day, then 1,000W of panels would be needed.\n\nThis doesn't allow any extra capacity for a week of rain, for someone wanting to run their 100W laptop 12 hours a day, etc.  I'd double everything, to have a safety margin.  At a minimum (if you're short of money), buy the extra batteries first, and leave the extra solar panels for later.  You shouldn't mix different ages of batteries on the same system; i.e. they should all be bought at the same time.\n\nPlease let us know what you eventually installed, and how it worked for you!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000706447948080798,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2575335770086878,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21979578888997822,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2799033289905571,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.33401500876675894,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21914501734544586,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20559084594217877,"solar_1":-0.2524131150365016,"solar_2":-0.19087790783772302,"solar_3":-0.07978726644677181,"solar_4":-0.03895906442783277,"solar_5":-0.045505916590611505,"solar_6":-0.10117405303268849,"solar_7":-0.06089178442095289,"solar_8":-0.23086267014150508,"solar_9":-0.054617289936189195,"solar_10":-0.16725618645346807},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Most inverters are designed with lead acid in mind which have very different discharge and charging cutoff voltages. There are even fewer that allow for high voltage battey (not PV) inputs.

At that rate, he expects that the system will take about 11 years to pay off completely, at which point the power it produces will effectively be free.\n\nIt's interesting to do the cost + efficiency calculations for this article (long):\n\n29.3 kWpDC = CA$23,000 \nCost = CA$0.78/Watt \n11 year simple payback\nOliver, BC, V0H 1T0\n\nAccording to PV Watts: https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php\n\nThe annual kWh produced per kWp-DC for Oliver, BC = 1,190 kWh/year.  Therefore, this 29.3 kW-pDC system produces a total of 34,887 kWh/Year.  The PV Watts calculation takes into account losses due to inefficiency. \n\nAnd, the required amount of [miles traveled per year] multiplied by the car's efficiency in [kWh per mile] equals the amount of energy he needs to power his EV per year.  Since these are EPA numbers, this calculation includes any charging losses.  \n\nhttps://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml\n\nTesla Model 3 = 0.291 kWh/mile.\n\nSo, \n\n(15,020 miles/year)*(0.291 kWh/mile) = 4,371 kWh/year\n\nAnd,\n\n(4,371 kWh/year) ÷ (1,190 kWh/year.kWp-DC) = 3.67 kWp-DC\n\nThus, a 3.67 kWp-DC solar array (in Oliver, BC) provides enough energy (4,371 kWh/year) to power his Tesla Model 3 with over 15,000 miles per year using 100% solar energy. The remainder (30,500 kWh/Year) (per 25.63 kWp-DC) is used to power his home.\n\nFurthermore, since the retail price for his entire 29.3 kWp-DC PV system was CA$23,000, the cost was only (CA$23,000 ÷ 29,300 Watt) = CA$0.78/Watt. \n\nTherefore, by extrapolation, the part of the solar system that powers his EV (3.67 kWpDC) would cost roughly CA$2,863.\n\nEven if the PV system lasted only 11 years (vs. a more typical 25 years), it would provide enough energy for the Model 3 to drive (15,020 miles/year) * (11 years) = 165,220 miles. \n\nAnd, [(cost of PV system) ÷ (total number of miles traveled) = (cost per mile)] (over the life of the system).  \n\n$2,863 ÷ 165,200 miles = $0.017 per mile.\n\nTherefore, it would cost less than $0.02 per mile (and $0.00 per mile for every year thereafter, as long as the PV system lasts longer than 11 years).\n\nAs shown, it is easy to drive 100% fossil fuel-free, and save money while you doing it.\n\nFootnote: While it is true that the electrons that he creates with his PV system, may or may not be the exact same electrons that charges his EV, for accounting purposes: solar energy in equals solar energy out.  Therefore, it may be slightly more accurate to say he offset 100% of his EV energy consumption with a very small solar system.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010447141636783879,"1.1.1_stance":-0.03895601568122705,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.04237737157347965,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.03216740985711416,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26229886944588543,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.008751143313323459,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03457667483598925,"solar_1":-0.13158848574548107,"solar_2":-0.14665030876508722,"solar_3":-0.02092890935758381,"solar_4":-0.15183045686724042,"solar_5":-0.04914930446587581,"solar_6":-0.004735996533781872,"solar_7":-0.01728625061393056,"solar_8":-0.05731632910681839,"solar_9":-0.12734737733934196,"solar_10":-0.08545052998852043},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

In 2017, coal-hungry China added 53 gigawatts of solar power, eclipsing the total solar output of most nations. Morocco, Egypt and even the oil-exporting United Arab Emirates are investing in renewable power. More than half of the world’s new capacity for making energy comes from renewable sources such as wind and solar.*\n\n*That renewable energy can also replace fossil fuel to power automobiles. There were more than three million electric cars on the road in 2017. The International Energy Agency predicts that number will balloon to 125 million by 2030. A fleet that size would keep an estimated 2.57 million barrels of oil — the amount Germany uses in a year — out of out the energy pipeline.*\n\n*Some newer studies, based largely on how quickly electric cars are catching on and how dramatically their prices are dropping, now predict a “fast adoption scenario” where electric cars could make up 90% of cars in the U.S. by the mid-2040s. One International Monetary Fund economist who studies the issue equates today’s gas and diesel cars to yesterday’s horses and buggies — transportation modes that went by the wayside as the price of the Model T dropped.*\n\n*The march toward carbon-free power and transportation is being propelled by advances in battery technology that can store power generated by the sun and wind for later use and increase the range of electric cars. The world’s largest lithium-ion battery (made by Tesla) started up this year in South Australia and is expected to earn back a third of its $65 million cost in its first year. Even more exciting game-changing battery technologies — using screen printing, graphene/cellulose or zinc — are under development.*\n\n*Of course government policies and subsidies could speed these developments even further. But the turn toward carbon-free renewable energy sources seems to have enough momentum from market forces to continue even if leaders of countries, like ours, are set against mandating the shift. For one example, look to many of the more than two dozen states that challenged President Obama’s Clean Power Plan in court in recent years; most of them — even states once heavily dependent on oil and coal such as Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas — were on track to meet the reduced emissions goals because it makes economic sense to do so.*\n\n*Climate experts say it is imperative, for the sake of the planet and its inhabitants, that every effort be made to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius rather than the 2 degrees we appear to be headed for without strong action.*\n\n*Can we decarbonize the global economy as quickly as we need to? It’s a daunting task that will likely require much more effort — from our best engineers, but also from individuals and government leaders. In the meantime, the speed at which renewables are rapidly being adopted over more traditional energy sources — think mobile phones overtaking landlines — definitely offers some hope.\"*","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.003425621427593247,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20312372808499882,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21748515777275657,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21360995571893435,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1835100956746799,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.030896720476448536,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1439351934629182,"solar_1":-0.2106412685862542,"solar_2":-0.19233863215273395,"solar_3":-0.11133172083020781,"solar_4":-0.0667475285321991,"solar_5":-0.09970543733239469,"solar_6":-0.02517060175766043,"solar_7":-0.009198256147404512,"solar_8":-0.06814809131234749,"solar_9":-0.023748911092344116,"solar_10":-0.23538233375145662},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

Deep cycle battery life is shortened when run below 50% so you need more, say 240% of your worst case scenario. It's bulky and heavy, but also cheap, forgiving of many kinds of abuse, and reasonably long lived. This is usually the smart choice for off grid stationary storage. Cranking batteries shouldn't be discharged past 80% without some reduction of life. They are designed to deliver a ton of current for a short period of time, but are not designed to be run down regularly. This is the CCA rating you were talking about, which doesn't really translate to capacity at all. Most automotive batteries are probably in the 40-100ah range though. They do not last long in the type of situation you are looking for.    ---BTW, if you want capacity numbers, go to the manufacturer's website. They often have it when retailers do not. Common group 27 or 31 deep cycle/marine batteries are my go to, usually from Walmart, but golf cart batteries are a common choice for larger installations.\n\nCharging: Pretty much all charge controllers will do lead acid or deep cycle/marine batteries just fine.  Some will do some kinds of lithium, though some lithium systems come with their own regulation systems which can help or hurt things. It's best to use their recommended equipment if buying lithium. \n\nPWM vs MPPT: PWN chargers are dirt cheap and work well in systems they are designed for. That is \"12v\" panel (usually outputs ~15-18v) -&gt; PWM controller -&gt; deep cycle battery. Most can do \"24v\" panels and 24 volt batteries. They will work with higher voltage panels, but you will lose a ton of efficiency so they are only a good choice when the panels match the batteries. MPPT charge controllers are more expensive, but are more efficient in any scenario where the panels and battery systems are not matched (note the panel voltage is *usually* still required to be above the battery voltage). This would be the right option if you were using common house sized solar panels rather than small \"12v\" panels or if your panels had to be far from the batteries forcing you to wire multiple panels in series for higher voltage. MPPT often offers more configurability if you do things in a less straight forward way, but that may or may not be relevant for you.\n\nRenogy is fine. There is so much Chinese made equipment that is all just a clone of everything else out there. Quality does vary though and some companies like Renogy have a decent reputation for being pretty consistent in what they offer. You might want to look on Craigslist as well. You might can often fine larger (250-400w) panels gently used for the price of one 100w panel from Amazon. Quality, durability, and longevity of these panels is much better, though it would mean using a more expensive MPPT controller.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.04291942845641946,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07697681041165652,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23755887390035652,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23789941209057966,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23120173154172796,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19733140302108249,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15891763909409443,"solar_1":-0.08892581222841857,"solar_2":-0.15486822740569828,"solar_3":-0.08547631923175282,"solar_4":-0.12346312401405157,"solar_5":-0.01580645119732556,"solar_6":-0.04980070698672495,"solar_7":-0.150960464469487,"solar_8":-0.04287292058324965,"solar_9":-0.041838402833299426,"solar_10":-0.1843397168067895},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Your electric company only sees the production that was sent back to the grid. First your solar panels produce energy and it's used by your home. Then the remaining is sent to the grid. So if your panels produced 10kWh of energy today and your home used 8kWh of energy, the grid is only going to record 2kWh of energy sent back. \n\nIf you have an 8 panel system, SunPower panels I believe are about 350w each (someone correct me if I'm wrong). Either way they'll be 300-375 for industry standard panels. This system should produce roughly 4200kWh per year or 350kWh per month. A little more during summer months and a little less during winter months due to day light hours. \n\nYour system seems to be under producing just based on those numbers. Based on what you're saying, 2kWh per day from your actual monitoring system then you are 100% underproducing even if the panels are only 300w panels giving you a 2.4kW system aka ~10kWh per day.\n\nGo to https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/ and fill out your system specs with your address and it will tell you what you should be producing roughly.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001835963106714189,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25390615003673894,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20070308448604127,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2834541831313438,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1883828869344639,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.33241990484543016,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12456384766846895,"solar_1":-0.20741634757174526,"solar_2":-0.1598051484059594,"solar_3":-0.03803784690292863,"solar_4":-0.11691680730296425,"solar_5":-0.05000828632425206,"solar_6":-0.0075267004770770045,"solar_7":-0.016602586101119716,"solar_8":-0.0071938419083987055,"solar_9":-0.1593349523807035,"solar_10":-0.1813386623581257},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Civilization is fundamentally based upon the harvest and consumption of energy. All energy extraction has downstream consequences. Ecological collapse, while largely related to carbon release, can be conceived of as the meta-consequence of energy extraction from so many systems on Earth. In other words, disrupt all the small systems and you end up with macro disruptions in the meta. Our demand for energy and auxiliary resources has a finite limit, and we are currently running up against it. Even if you switch off fossil fuels, you haven't solved this problem, you've only reduced the greenhouse gas problem. That's certainly not nothing, but thinking we can match the energy output of fossil fuels is somewhat ridiculous. \n\nFor example, where I live we get a large percentage of our power from hydroelectric dams. While that's technically \"renewable\", it's also a major contributor to the collapse of our salmon population. Salmon, being a keystone species here, is vital for the ecological health of this region. Additionally, damming and directing rivers has increased drought vulnerability, been ecologically disastrous, and threatens food production in the longterm. \n\nSolar panels require the extraction and shipping and refinement of rare minerals, and can only be relatively cheap in wealthy nations because of imperialism. And wind turbines require an extensive battery system (or supplemental power sources) in order to produce continually available energy. That battery system falls trap to the same problems as solar panels in terms of ecological and imperial cost. While there has been some promising research on sodium-ion batteries, there is no industrial scale for them yet, making them incredibly expensive.\n\nThis comes to my last point, which is that since civilization is based on the harvest and consumption of energy, energy is, in turn, fundamentally political. There is such an entrenched political power within the industries that extract and refine fossil fuels, the capital that funds and profits from these endeavors, and the clients that rely on them (the US Military is the largest consumer of fossil fuels), and none of them see it in their short-term interest (aka maintaining their power) to turn off the pipelines. Because of this, the transition off hydrocarbons will not happen at a rate fast enough to avoid the intensifying catastrophes of ecological collapse (that we are already living through). \n\nMoral of the story: There is no \"solution\" to ecological collapse that allows us to keep up (let alone increase) our current energy demands.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008683071573614143,"1.1.1_stance":-0.4038873116175334,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18858055162625176,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2666835769547725,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29199938640194506,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29062968989213306,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05672896473940151,"solar_1":-0.09373922091132651,"solar_2":-0.21876581407074505,"solar_3":-0.044498446260842824,"solar_4":-0.03913440485969962,"solar_5":-0.009956831995320195,"solar_6":-0.0016670437665500988,"solar_7":-0.001413324320310494,"solar_8":-0.024230023322161287,"solar_9":-0.10653335561801214,"solar_10":-0.08357680687913671,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.2591147404164076},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I sell solar in NJ, and what some say is true, solar sales people tend to be used car sales types, but not all. You need to do a little research to educate yourself. CT does have net metering, which means you get compensated for any surplus power you send back to the grid. \n\nFirst thing you need to do is figure out your annual consumption. Generally, here in the northeast, we use a lot of juice in the summers due to central air conditioning, and not so much in winter, when we burn gas or oil for heat. Hopefully you don't have electric heat, then its high all year. In NJ, we're allowed to do a load calculation if you have not been in your home for 12 months, and have a usage history, which is just a spreadsheet that multiplies out average usage of various appliances, then you add them up. I'll stick my neck out and hazard a guess that you're probably around 9,000 to 11,000 kwh per year with a bill of $125 for May. \n\nSay it's 10,000kwh. Then you divide that by the wattage of the panels, say a 340 watt panel. Residential generally fall in between 300 and 400 watts. 340 is common to some of the better companies who give 25 year warranties (shoot for that- 10, 12 year warranty panels are cheaper and not as efficient, and degrade more quickly over time). \n\nSo 10,000/340 ~ 30 panels. A company will use overhead satellite shots to produce what, in lay terms, amounts to a \"heat map\" - where you want to place panels so they get the most direct sun. That will be the southern roof in CT, followed by east and west. Avoid panels on the north roof, the sun's rays are less direct = less bang for your buck. A house well suited for solar tends to have a multiplying effect. Oops let me back up - those 30 panels times 340 watts, thats your KW. The amount they output over time is your \"kwh\". KW are expressed in units of 1000, so you'd have a 10KW system. If it outputs at 1:1, your output is 10,000kwh. Got it? Good sites for solar multiply the output - your 10KW could output, say, up to 12,500kwh (125% yield - so you wouldn't need 30 panels, maybe only 25). Homes with not much of a southern roof might be more like 100%, or even 70-80%. Not good solar sites.\n\nIs your roof more than 15 years old? You might want to re-roof prior to solar installation. It'll cost you about $2000-2500 if you need to do it later, to take them off and re-install. Most solar co's have a roofing partner.\n\nSame with trees, if you're open to taking them down, Co's have preferred tree partners. \n\nSorry for all this, didn't even get to financing the project. Let me know if you want more info. Its not so bad once you digest the basics, its just stuff you didn't know about before.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001882345507813928,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27112167118630603,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15091733275779262,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2301198814521463,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.05814835604894597,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.12938349362034038,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0626817496183018,"solar_1":-0.1128170258972167,"solar_2":-0.2091375785745872,"solar_3":-0.013297331784391039,"solar_4":-0.06788239095307598,"solar_5":-0.07763217792509229,"solar_6":-0.08952268855867497,"solar_7":-0.10603844905805697,"solar_8":-0.062038570295650665,"solar_9":-0.20981307019555573,"solar_10":-0.2784300352392342},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Good? bad? run? This bid is just about $30k for the panels and $25k for the batteries +$550 for softstart on a/c  \nalso considering a Generac PwrCell 18kw cost is about $18k\n\n  \nPower is out, no possible way to get the panels to turn on during the day with a manual transfer switch? A few residents have installed gas generators since we have NG. When power goes out, they have a manual transfer switch in their EP, the pull it down, now able to access the generator breaker, turn it on, power it up and viola they have power. IF fpl comes back on, of course they would reverse the process, but what if they didnt? How long would it take FPL to figure that out?\n\n  \nAnyway to use the panels with some type of switch to block the power from going back to the grid, (since my neighbors have panels and a generator, i could access 110v power cord, plug in the get the inverters sensing power. I am sure there is something on the panels tied directly to FPL.\n\n  \nMy big goal is to dump FPL, yes yes... I know.... I can’t do that. But there has to be a way/loophole. For example: If I installed the above system, and then sell my house the next day, what prompts athe new homeowner from never calling FPL? I find this an interesting concept. The person buying the house didnt sign the interlock agreement with FPL. My partner works for an HOA law firm, I am going to ask as the title processors if it is required to call FPL to close on a property.\n\n  \nWhat if I call FPL and say I am moving. Send my last bill to my new PO BOX yet I still live in my house. My “roommate” never calls for service. Now what?  \nHow could anyone force you to now SIGN up with FPL, especially if you have your own power source? THat would negate the city crap about needing elecricity, water and sewer to meet code.

Happy to give some additional insights into our calculator. We built a tool that analyzes the sqft of your roof, the pitch, angle, solar azimuth, shading, historic weather, etc to be able to calculate the sun that will hit the panels on an hour by hour basis over the year. We, behind the scenes, simulate panel placement and production of those panels. We default the system to as close to 100% production offset as possible, prioritizing roof planes and panels with the highest production down to the lowest. This, in combination with your stated avg utility bill cross referenced to local utility rates and avg time of use patterns of locals, determines the system size you need. \n\nSavings is a bit more complicated, and builds off the calculated system size and its hour by hour production. Savings has to factor in net metered buy back rates, time of use rates and time of use patterns, historic utility rate increases (we default nationally to 3% which is an avg but are working on making the escalation dynamic based on the utility). We get this data from multiple free gov sources and a few paid data sources. Batteries are factored as well, including the % of the battery reserved for backup vs % used for nighttime use (grid avoidance). You can change the % allocation and see the impact to savings. Selecting a consumption battery will default to up to 90% usage every night. We currently default to normal usage patterns, but we want to eventually ask users to input their usage patterns. It really only changes if you have an EV or if you work nights/have little to no night/peak usage. Areas with 1:1 net metering are orders of magnitude easier to calculate.\n\nHope this helps.

Am I understanding this correctly?\n\nNot really, unless you turn your house off at night or have batteries.  And unless you neither heat nor cool, both your production and utilization will vary by season.  100% offset averaged over an entire year is a fairly crude metric for what's really happening day-to-day, but is, IMHO, a decent place to start the sizing discussion.  Of course, there are people on this very subreddit who make a fetish out of 100% and claim anyone who doesn't install a 100% system is for some, incomprehensible to me, reason a fool.\n\nAnd if you have 1:1 net metering in Virginia, as others have pointed out, batteries make sense only if you want to pay extra to have local backup capability.  So the general suggestion is to just use the grid as a storage mechanism.\n\nExpect to send power to the grid during peak production and pull power from the grid the rest of the day.  If you have true 1:1 net metering, where a kWh sent to the grid is as valuable as one pulled from the grid, none of this is really an issue.  The people in markets, or with providers, that pay much less than they charge, or have complex peak-demand rates. have other calculations to make.\n\n\\[Owner of a \\~50% system in N.

They have a fairly normal outdoor life and are only killed when they can no longer be useful. Generally these are people/tribes that don't have a lot of access to great nutrition, so having animals is kind of a necessity and they are often very connected with the animals they are raising. I don't have a problem with that.\n\nWestern hunting though I'm still having a hard time with. I know that sometimes in order to keep populations healthy they have to be managed, and hunting licenses pay for a lot of good wildlife research and management programs, but I'm still disturbed by people that think it's normal to take an advanced weapon into nature and gun down a deer and then they post pictures of the dead carcass like they someone managed to bare handedly take down a wild animal. That mentality bothers me. I prefer hunting to industrial animal agriculture, but I have a hard time supporting the type of people that are hunters. I often get the feeling that they enjoy killing the animals which is really bizarre and upsetting to me.\n\nThat being said, its not something I would ever do myself. I'm not morally ok with killing an animal when it isn't necessary for my own survival. Other people have different feelings on that though, and while it's not something I understand, I don't know that it means they are wrong.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.003829004223613689,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23017762801990427,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20900620360508504,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16883626710125013,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21451470784341473,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.0872395510147328,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22138604894260538,"diet_1":-0.09585018319182836,"diet_2":-0.19196944860084791,"diet_3":-0.13154780348382644,"diet_4":-0.088879694518558,"diet_5":-0.017018911716756218,"diet_6":-0.0387431382593301,"diet_8":-0.011331794148948878,"diet_9":-0.02143010239888099,"diet_10":-0.10999915980452594,"diet_11":-0.024529536351716768,"diet_13":-0.03220059208251769,"diet_14":-0.10551617981418342,"diet_17":-0.06311446853457407},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Since you were vegetarian like me, the switch is probably simpler than you think! I find its helpful to try to make similar things but with simple substitutions\n\nSo for baking you can easily use flax eggs for almost anything that doesn't require whipping egg white. If you need to whip egg whites use aquafaba (the water in the can of chickpeas)\n\nFor heavy cream use coconut cream\n\nLots of companies sell vegan versions of condiments like mayonnaise (even hellman's has a vegan mayo!), as well as vegan ice cream (I'm partial to 'So delicious'), etc.\n\nI always hated eggs so cutting out omelettes and stuff was really easy for me. However that might not be the case for you. I don't know if you've tried scrambled tofu, it doesnt taste exactly like eggs (although black salt helps with that) but it is very delicious in it's own right and is certainly a worthy replacement.\n\nCheese is a tough one. Im probably gonna get flak for saying this but to me vegan cheese just sucks. I've just cut out cheese completely, I don't bother with much replacements. However, for a cheesy component in a dish nutritional yeast is an easy and healthy option. \n\nI have more things to say but don't want to make a wall of text and overwhelm you, so I'll leave it here as is.\n\nIf you're interested you can PM me with any questions or just reply to this comment :)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.013486768119037151,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10981666525670637,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.04517203010288995,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.31892952537626085,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21845262563117557,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24947684167310677,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.40700879702853854,"diet_1":-0.16688253881875426,"diet_2":-0.015839502690748002,"diet_3":-0.0754421996086118,"diet_4":-0.15822000929364904,"diet_5":-0.17503431395743974,"diet_6":-0.14350724388778724,"diet_8":-0.0005171789871383226,"diet_9":-0.05432186469746133,"diet_10":-0.15476494552432551,"diet_11":-0.017195531234998878,"diet_13":-0.010116887395270169,"diet_14":-0.17967540007157368,"diet_17":-0.0015121689793886617},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

We don't have to say anything else other than \"I don't eat animal product because I don't like killing animals.\" and that will immediately ring alarm bells in the heads of those who consume those products around us.  It is a little like being an EMT, no one has any issues with EMTs, in fact the occupation is generally very positively viewed, but when they show up it makes everyone a little concerned \"wait is someone dead?\"  \"Has someone had a heart attack?\"    \"I didn't give food poisoning to my neighbors when they were over last night did I?\"\n\nI think vegans aren't generally seen as the problem, the problem is that it naturally puts omnis on the defensive and reminds them that they might be doing something wrong or there might be something wrong with the situation they have put themselves in, particularly when you sit down to dinner with them.  This isn't helped, of course, by the fact that it is only natural (I speak from personal experience) to become frustrated and feel trapped as a vegan because no one else wants to hear about your passion on the topic, probably because it amplifies that guilt and defensiveness those people may very well carry.\n\nI think your concern is completely valid, but I wouldn't put too much thought in it or be concerned about it just like I wouldn't be worried about others being fearful when they see the ambulance come down the road.  It isn't you that is the problem, what you are doing is for the betterment of humanity.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.031672616178790726,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21727763528619715,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16093916286932794,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22681703915198645,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28922091916710996,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18400851516524444,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3420553719624877,"diet_1":-0.00748641118601275,"diet_2":-0.005350615911690208,"diet_3":-0.010080281574725328,"diet_4":-0.002791062253891141,"diet_5":-0.004057789795600304,"diet_6":-0.004815257709196885,"diet_8":-0.0010528012062422931,"diet_9":-0.0007517201714411689,"diet_10":-0.002031688254646724,"diet_11":-0.0013392489769709452,"diet_13":-0.003230559862762069,"diet_14":-0.12482144229579717,"diet_17":-0.0036731563062251857},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.
