One thing you'll find in your e-bike research is that the motor is only half of the equation. Gear ratio is a huge factor in acceleration and speed and total distance. Google \"electric motorcycle gear ratio.\" There's a few forum threads that have specs you might be looking for. I think 13:1 was the standard ratio, but I'd have to look at my notes.",

"comment": "Most families have 2 cars, so if one of those cars is an EV, it's not exactly a waste.  My other car is an SUV, 4WD, 269HP, still can get 28MPG on highway, and I find this combination works really well for me.   I believe that replacing one of the gassers with an EV is the best approach in order to make EVs succeed in a family environment.  If you live by yourself, then there is no point.\n\nAs for manufacturers not putting in bigger batteries, the main problem is cost, and the fact that there are newer/better battery chemistries, which are still in process of being tested.  There is some interesting stuff coming in the next 3 years or so, until then, we'll have to put up with this.",

In the meantime, they are just another expensive boutique. We have them all over the place. They are not unique, or different.\n\nIn fact, Tesla doesn't even meet that standard, because a super-duper clothing merchant that's really different and genuinely better, for example, will offer something truly different. Tesla isn't doing that. They're just stuffing a really big battery into a snazzy looking skin.\n\nThey won't be around as long as Nordstrom or Nieman-Marcus, much less Barney's.

FCV need at least 3x as much energy for the same distance.\nIf you need 100kWh to charge battery in e.g. Tesla, you need 300kWh for FCV.\nIf you pay electricity 10c/kWh that costs 10$ for battery, 30$ for FCV, or if you pay 35c/kWh like Hawaii, that is 35$ for battery, 105$(!) for FCV. I would not call that irrelevant.\n\nHe mentions 4c/kWh from wind, so that is 4$ vs. 12$ for FCV, but that is just a start for FCV. You need 2M$ fuel station for FCV, and cost of that station needs to be integrated into hydrogen price, while EV can practically use that electricity directly with existing infrastructure.\n\nIf that 2M$ hydrogen fuel station can handle 100 cars per day, and you want to return your investment in 10 years, that adds additional **27$** for each refueling!",

Qingdao pulled support after NEVS failed to deliver Saab EVs which Qingdao had ordered. \n\nNEVS has been in bankruptcy protection since mid-2014, nobody is interested in bailing them out (All the Chinese and Indian automakers they've courted have said no), [they lost the rights to use the Saab name a while ago](http://www.wsj.com/articles/saab-auto-owner-files-again-for-bankruptcy-protection-1409308717), and they never had the rights to use Saab's translated name (\"Shenbao\") in China, which was to be their target market. Chinese automaker SAIC bought the rights to Shenbao and Saab's IP from GM in 2009 and currently sells [cars](http://www.carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/senova-d60-china-launch-1.jpg?3b149d) in China (including EVs) built on Saab platforms with Saab technology. \n\nNEVS's business model was lunacy. They (allegedly) wanted to build electrified outdated Saab models (which could no longer be exported to the EU due to regulations) in Sweden to export to China, where they would be subject to heavy tariffs and ineligible for subsidies. NEVS's electric Saabs would be competing with more modern Chinese-made EVs (including the Leaf) with major subsidies and no tariffs. NEVS would also compete with SAIC's more modern Saab-based EVs sold under the name Saab is known as in China.  NEVS has (or had?) very little resources and couldn't even deliver their first order of 200 EVs placed by Qingdao City. \n\nGiven their unfeasible business model and inability to meet their first major order I would say NEVS was not actually a serious effort to create an electric automaker but rather an attempt to buy the Saab name, establish a new brand image of Saab being an electric car maker, then sell it onto a Chinese/Indian automaker before any widescale Saab EV production began. Obviously that idea fell apart when no major automakers were interested in them.\n\ntl;dr: The Saab brand is still dead and this project was never a feasible one",

The amount of planning going into a trip gets progressively higher as you go through that list, but that's just something you have to consider come purchase time.  Is the faster charge rate the huge selling point for a Model 3, or is the hatchback functionality of the Bolt more useful for you?  Or do you want the cheaper Leaf?  Or do you prefer the interior of the i3?  Or do you want to take a different step and get a used Leaf or Volt for even cheaper?   The big thing underlining everything in there is that no matter what you choose, you're significantly lowering your environmental impact (and hopefully running costs) versus choosing an average car in the same price bracket.  That, to me, is what electrification is about.",

"comment": "Okay I'll answer your question:\nMy original goal was to build out a sortable/searchable database of EVs, and one day have it make some money. There didn't seem to be anywhere where I could see a quick clean list of EVs currently on the market and those coming soon.\n\nSo I started that and then started to build a blog around it to try and get some traction. So I started paying a writer.   At first I ran no ads -- until someone accused the site of having an agenda AGAINST EVs. Their reason was that the site had no ads, so must be a shill for the ICE industry...  So I then put ads on the pages.\n\nThe site has been a failure really. But EVs are something I find really interesting so I'm still working on the database. Would be interested in your feedback https://evtide.com/evs",

I ain't no truck driver.\n\nIf it wasn't clear in my post there wasn't any suggestion to do that. This was just a basis for calculation.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;     So on average they probably can do more than 300km at 180km/h.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Tesla drivetrain is fairly inefficient at those speeds (generally less efficient than the Golfs actually), at 180km/h a P100 can go around 260 km without much auxiliary usage.\n\nI'm not sure I follow : there's no P100 model in either X or S form. There are 2 drivetrains in all 100kWh based cars and when cruising at high speeds only the one optimized for high speeds is used. Drivetrain resistance isn't negligible but is usually far less than the aerodynamic resistance and grows at the same rate (ie: it's proportional to the square of the speed which makes its energy usage integrated over the distance traveled proportional to the speed like aerodynamics).\n\nWhat is your source for this 260km range ? Is it from an extrapolation from other conditions or an actual test at 180km/h on a Model S 100D (didn't see one yet as the car is relatively new on the market and tests at high speeds aren't common) ?\n\n&gt; \n&gt;     The next best thing is testing with a model X which has less range but is using the same battery and motors than the S.\n&gt; \n&gt; The projected frontal area of the model X is a a lot larger which would reduce the range to around 230 km. \n\nThis is consistent with the ~12% more range for S vs X but I'm unsure where the original 260 km comes from.",

"comment": "&gt; I dunno what you're talking about, you're tethered to gas stations, that's a limitation on range. \n\nThat is definitely a first for arguments FOR an EV. I regularly drive a 1500 km round trip for my business. I have yet to see an EV that can do that 750 km one way, fill up in 5 minutes and do it again on the way back. But my 1995 Volvo 850 can. \n\nI think it's a little 'evangelistic' to call an EV untethered at this point in their life. Soon maybe but not yet. As soon as AMA starts delivering kWs to your depleted EV at roadside you might have a case, but so far, you're stuck.\n\nI don't think I was talking 'shit' about your car. I expressed my opinion and it's only that - an opinion of a stranger on the internet. I'm not saying its not a great car. It is. But it's not the only one out there.\n\nAnd yes, I'm not an owner. But I've been following and researching EVs since 2000, when the only guys doing it were using lead acid batteries and building their own cars using forklift motors and scary homebuilt controllers. I followed the Corbin Sparrow from it's rise to its demise. And the Aptera. GMs EV1. And a couple of small Canadian electric car companies that were killed off by a non supportive government (ZENN and Dynasty) and the new upstart Electro Meccanica which seems like it might actually have a shot at capturing some of the Canadian market.\n\nI've got two solar powered homes and a lot of experience in the world of batteries and using electric power. I've dabbled with electric transportation, but where I live, in northern Canada, with temps that regularly go to -40 in winter there are two things that are absolutely necessary: 4wd and heat. Neither are great attributes of an EV and thus it makes no sense to own one. Yet.",

Phone manufacturers are increasing the upper voltage limit to achieve this, which just destroys the cycle life of the cells.\n\nThey're also charged at incredible rates given they only have passive thermal management. Some modern phones are charging above 20W (5A) for a ~4Ah battery. 1.25C! \n\n\nThat's as fast as a Tesla that's cycling many litres of coolant through the pack while it's doing so...",

I mean, its nice that the AC fans don't sound like an aircraft taking off like in my Model 3, but its not ok to not cool down the car in a reasonable amount of time. The sales person said this may be because it is low on battery, it showed 59 mile range left. But assuming this car gets somewhere between 200 to 250 miles EPA rating, that is still a rather large percentage?",

It's probably not quite as bad as it was in 2018, when the moneyed interests were trying to kill demand for the Model 3 to strangle Tesla out of the market. However, it's still in the fossil fuel industry's best interest to slow the adoption of EVs as much as they possibly can. Then make several tens of millions of dollars in profit *per day*, so it makes sense to spend hundreds of thousands a day to discourage the adoption of technology that will eventually strangle their own business.",

"comment": "Only superchargers output over 250kW at 400V because they don't have to follow the CCS standard. It's not like other chargers couldn't do it if they wanted to, but CCS limits the connector to 500A. 500A x 400V = 200kW\n\nIt's not a charger issue, it's a CCS limitation. They want you to up the voltage rather than amperage to get to higher power levels. Tesla will do over 625A because they are not restricted by the CCS standard. And Tesla's vehicles have some of the highest peak charge rates, great battery longevity and their liquid cooled cables are still thinner than the ones on the CCS chargers. So it's not some technical impossibility.\n\nThe truth is that keeping amps low by upping the voltage is better on many component levels. And even Tesla is raising voltages, such as with the new Model S/X that do 450V instead of 400V. But reducing amperage is not the holy grail. There are other issues that prevent faster charging of the battery. There are also plenty of other 400V battery packs that taper less than Tesla, it's not solely an amperage thing. Plus, there are other challenges with moving cars to 800V, such as costlier parts, mismatches between cars/chargers and additional tools and even some required safety measures when it comes to servicing the cars.",

"comment": "&gt; Actually, quite a few people in here also comment in r/stocks and are mainstays over at r/teslainvestorsclub . I've been around here a long time, and have looked at plenty of peoples profiles as a quick little 'bias check'... you'd be surprised at how often it's the case that someone is in her trying to persuade people into buying a stock. One funny one was this dude who almost entirely commented in Canoo's subreddit, who was clearly a big investor in the company, who came in here posting pictures of Canoo vehicles he just happened to \"spot in the wild\"... lmao.\n\n&gt; It does make me chuckle when I get downvoted for calling people out with an agenda though. Obviously a lot of that agenda is coming from Tesla fans / shareholders. It doesn't take a genius to look at TSLA's share price and the number of cars they sold and realize that a LOT of people in the EV communities are Tesla owners and Tesla stockholders, and there is in fact a lot of intentional bias floating around.\n\n&gt; You'd also be surprised at the impact amateur investors think they can have on a market just by posting topics and commenting on posts. Actually, you can kind of make that argument for Tesla in general, as one of their claims to fame is \"we don't pay to advertise\", but when you look at the sheer amount of Tesla content being produced from their referral rewards recipients and investors, and how often that content is clicked on, you can see that there is in fact an impact being made.\n\n&gt; It's one of the reasons I'm so critical of posts like this... I know exactly what their intentions are because SO many of them have been doing it for years now.\n\nFair enough. Perhaps the the number of people who think they can pump a stock or at the very least feel like they're doing their part by promoting the company is bigger than I think. Although I think a lot of times people also own stock in companies they really like. For example, I will absolutely educate people on the benefits of EVs and Teslas in particular if I get the idea they're misinformed. Not because I own stock, but because I'm excited for EVs and Tesla as a company.\n\n&gt; Again, I have no issue if someone wants to talk simple delivery numbers and have a discussion about the market. The problem is that OP directed the conversation to \"Tesla vs the world\" with how he portrayed his graphs, went further and disclosed his stock position, and finally turned the conversation towards Tesla in his commentary he posted under his graphs.\n\nFair enough.\n\n&gt; Which explains my critique. The fact is, other OEMs ARE making an effort. What posts like OP's does is give the impression that other OEMs aren't doing anything, even though that's not the case. Those other OEMs are actively investing 10s of billions of dollars in building out supply chain. They're spending a fortune on new platform R&amp;D, new powertrains, new factories to build the powertrains, new factories to build the cells, they're funding battery companies looking to develop the next generation cell technology. Here's an example, Tesla has 4 BEV models in production. By the end of this year, BMW will have 10 BEV models in production, and 9 PHEVs in production. They're also developing plenty more, along with a new platform. It took a lot of time and money to get to where they are, but going by OP's charts, BMW has done zilch.\n\nActually I think this is part of the point OP is trying to make. Legacy OEMs are NOT making a serious effort. The amount of vehicles BMW is developing and all the \"plans\" GM has mean nothing if they're not accompanied by unit numbers. On the contrary; the more different units you're making the less serious you are about ramping up volume production as soon as possible. What companies like Tesla, Hyundai, KIA and Polestar are doing makes a lot more sense if you're serious about building good EVs and ramping up production as fast as possible.\n\n&gt; Again, there are over 30 new battery plants either in development or under construction between the US and Europe. Tesla only accounts for 2-3 of those. One in Berlin (which they've given up on for now), one in Austin that they've having problems scaling, and I'm not even sure if their pilot plant in Fremont counts... AFAIK, Tesla hasn't announced any other new battery factories yet, so the rest of the industry is working to get 30+ plants up and running within a few years time, with some of those plants already coming online like GM's Ultium plant, the Ford / SKI plant, Northvolt, and I'm sure there are plenty of others that are nearly there. BMW for example has signed contracts with Chinese suppliers (sadly)... but hey, that's not any different than how Tesla has quickly ramped up their production; almost entirely because of Chinese cell supply.\n\nThis is also a big logical flaw. You're reasoning by analogy instead of from first principles. The amount of battery plants are irrelevant. The only thing that matters is output. For example, Giga Texas can fit 33 of GM's new Ohio battery factories. Obviously not that entire area is going to be covered by factory and it includes the car plant too, but it just goes to show on how much bigger a scale Tesla is operating than these others. They are aiming at 3,000 GWh annual production by 2030. GM's two new plants that are supposedly going to power their entire EV venture for most of this decade are expected to take their entire total up to ~100 GWh per year.",

"comment": "The achievement of L3 is not the technology, it’s the underlying liability and risk management that is the true leap forward. Audi has the same technology a few years back but couldn’t get comfortable with the risk that was potentially on the table. And Mercedes’ thinks they can. \n\nTesla doesn’t want to solve parts of the puzzle. They want the whole thing. And until there’s legitimate competition, or a drop in vehicle sales, there is zero incentive or need for tesla to assume liabilities for driver. Instead they continue to advance their technology in a low risk environment where the driver is on the hook if anything goes wrong. And people are actually paying them for that access. It’s a win-win situation for them. Why change it? \n\nMercedes limits their liability by the constraints they’ve placed on their system. Geofenced pre-mapped highways, low speeds, dry and sunny weather, and the system will return the task to the driver if it doesn’t understand the situation. And that technology will reside on their limited flag ship models that many can’t afford. This is how they significantly limit their exposure while securing a potentially useful marketing campaign. It’s a logical strategy that is not unique to Mercedes’.\n\nYou don’t have to believe me or agree with me. I don’t really care. I’m enjoying the benefits of the technology today on the tesla and have been for more than two years. That’s why I chose to buy this car in 2019 instead of something else. And that decision continues to be correct in my eyes.",

"comment": "I’ve been saying for years that the tipping point will be when a company puts out cheap easy to install fast chargers that any business owner could easily install and profit from. It’s two things that are good for business. It’s an independent, passive revenue stream - you charge twice the utility rate for power through the chargers, so you’re making a profit off a parking space that otherwise is empty half the time, and you’ve got a captive audience who might spend 20 minutes at your business. \n\nGas stations already know what’s up. Sheetz and Loves are killing it with EV charger banks all over the country. Route 66 is basically covered. But restaurants will be able to get in on it soon too. Not to mention if the utilities themselves get in on it. What if the utility owns and maintains the charger, makes extra money selling power directly to travelers, and passes a portion on to the business owner as rent? Then there isn’t even a startup cost to the business. It’s already happening but as more people buy these cars the market will grow. \n\nSoon you will never have range anxiety again. You’ll be able to drive cross country in a Leaf because every fast food place in America will have at least half a dozen L2 chargers out front, along with every Dollar General and Walmart. \n\nI predict that within ten years there will be far more EV chargers in America than there ever were gas pumps. Possibly much sooner.",

"comment": "If we're looking for something more conventional while still mitigating subsidy risk + market competition, I'd look strongly at Atlanta GA. Nobody is installing much solar there, but they have very advantageous time-of-day metering rates which can eliminate the need for local subsidies for the right combination of array size + client. El Paso + Salt Lake City are also in that same class. \n\nSometimes it takes adjusting your business model. Rather than be a turnkey installer, consider offering hourly design, procurement management, and site QA/QC services to local architects + electrical contractors. It helps to take a course on engineering economics so you can do the economic modeling. Perhaps teach a solar program at a local community college. Diversifying how you make money in the market helps you weather the volitility. \n\nPersonally, I'm getting into REC sales. However, I think service panel monitoring is a killer product which shoudl be an easy sell to anyone with a solar array. It's also a very easy to sell to any commercial business on a demand-based billing system.",

"comment": "the most efficient method of transportation in my opinion is a conveyor belt (like those in airports) miles and miles long, connecting cities, with solarpanels alongside the entire system, where the vehicle is fixed and all you need to do is get on it... an alternative would be what you say but i imagine a train on tracks that has a solar panel, storage space and wheels plus motor on each section, and many sections combined to a train.\n\nbiggest problem with the expectations of the electric vehicle is the weight and speed of it. since it is all indexed to gasoline, 1500 kg cars are acceptible. but it is a waste of resources. 70 kg human in a 1500 kg car is a waste. everywhere you go, you waste resources.\n\nif you make the vehicle much much lighter, the battery and power requirements will be much less, and then it would be completely natural to have solar panels on the roof.\n\nyou can have it already probably but the cars themselves are so inefficient that in my opinion the power supplied by, say, 6 hrs of sunlight will give very little boost to a car that wastes energy all day long by transporting a mass of 1.5-2 tons of metal.\n\nin the ideal vehicle, in an ideal society, i can imagine solar panels on the roofs will be standard, unless there are even better ways..\n\nhttp://imgur.com/JWkVJCj\n\nedit: another answer: the cars are too small. if they were 5x20 meters long buses weighing only 1-2 tons i think they could be run with solar panels",

"comment": "I dont agree with this as the premium for SunPower will be significant and not justify the additional cost/production IMO. Look for higher efficiency modules, use micro inverters and expect a lower output by 10-20% than west facing mods. \n\nRun calculations based on your area between NW/SE planes and compare production levels. Put some mods on SW portion on back of the house, maybe consider a reverse pitch on N portion to add a few more. \n\nA ground mount obviously would be ideal, specially if your jurisdiction would allow for a patio cover setup with appropriate engineering for dual purpose. There are frameless modules with opaque backsheets that look pretty cool in this application.\n\nThis all depends on actual consumption, Time of Use rates, offset level, etc. Too many variables at the moment, but its doable.",

But rooftop solar has other values which beat utility-scale solar: backup power, increased property value, job creation, and consumerism.\n\nFor every utility which supports solar, you can find five times as many utilities who discriminate against solar. Utility-scale solar is the means by which the utility keeps control of the grid, but that does not mean it is the optimal policy for the public.",

"comment": "Most people can not sell back excess generation. \nNet metering allows you to on a monthly or annual bases trade KWh generated for used.   Excess Generation is any power you generate more than you consume and it is usually sold to the utility at wholesale or avoided cost prices which are between 1/3 and 1/2 retail rates and unlike net metering, tax is collected on it.  \nFurther most utilities will only allow net metering if the expected generation is no more than 110-120% of consumption (some limit to 100% even)  \nYou have to pay for all the solar modules and since the quantity that over generates is going to have very little if any return, NO you don't want as much surface area covered as possible.\nFurther the solar roof is very inefficient so if you did want to get the most production possible on the limited roof space, it would not be the way to do it.",

That compares well to the fully installed cost of Tesla's battery storage (Powewall at $5,500 / 12 kWh = $450 per kWh pre-install).  Li-ion batteries project to come down to $100 per kWh in about 3-5 years at the pack level.  Round-trip efficiency for li-Ion is much better at over 80%, whereas this CAES technology is at about 60-70% efficient.  Scalability remains the most important factor, and Li-ion is the most scalable so far.",

It takes less than  1000 kWh to make a 300 watt panel that will generate in excess of 14,000 kWh over 25 years.  \n\nChina makes and installs more renewables than anyone, and have reduced CO2 emissions for the last three years, and are investing $360 billion over the next 48 months to cut emissions by over 20 percent.\n\n&gt;Solar panels and steel are still made from coal, \n\nNope, sand and aluminum, absolutely no coal required.",

"comment": "Well Musk played a game just like Bill Gates did to Apple when he announced the Zune.  It was vapor ware and years away from market.  \nWe get lots of people that want to wait for what musk has next....\nWe have created a Powerwall ready solution and a powerwall upgradeable solution.  The first is with a StorEdge inverter (but no powerwall) and the second is with a SolarEdge SE7600 which can be upgraded to the StorEdge.   We have sold a few of these.\nFor people that want storage though, we sell OutBack solutions.   \n\nAs for Future retrofit, ANY grid tie system can be future retrofited for battery with an AC coupled solution using OutBack (or Schneider) inverters.  It will cost more, and be more complex than going with battery backup from the start as well as more $ and more complex than the StorEdge solution.   BUT you can make any system bimodal with AC coupling.  Sometimes it makes more since to just through out the original inverter and rewire to the OutBack directly in DC coupling solution though.",

"comment": "dear moreLSDplease,\n\nyou need advice from the pros - you've made a good investment in those batteries but by the sounds of it, you're going to lose them very fast. I hope they are. Here are the action steps you need to take: disconnect everything from your charge controller, now connect the batteries AND THEN THE SOLAR PANELS. Hopefully this helps and you are now reading 13.3-13.5V across your terminals, as the charge controller takes you through the first 2 hours of BULK charging. After these 120min the charge controller will go into absorption mode and then into float. given the degeneration of your battery's capacity during the trouble of the last few days, I'd suggest we repeat this \"disconnect-reconnect-test voltage\"-process over the next two days before connecting a load. It would also help if we knew what design+chemistry your batteries use (AGM or GEL?). Even the cheapest charge controllers use multistage charging, so I hope you have one of those.",

"comment": "&gt; Wouldn’t call the Hawaii solution very useful. \n\nIt's *incredibly* \"useful\".\n\nAs long as there have been AC power systems, which goes back to Tesla himself, there has been the need to maintain grid stability.  The basic law is the amount of power being generated must always exactly match the load.  Or bad stuff happens.\n\nSo, again, since Tesla's day, suppliers of electricity to the grid have been modulating their output, fraction of second by fraction of second, to ensure the generation stays balanced to the load.\n\nSolar PVs didn't used to do this, and when there weren't many of them, it was OK, because the output whatever they could, and the utilities continued to adjust their generation so that the load was matched even with the extra output of solar inverters.\n\nNow we're getting to the point where solar PV is becoming a significant contributor to some grids.  And because of this, solar inverters need to play by the same rules of the AC grid that Tesla told us about all those years ago.  Or bad things will happen.\n\nBecause Hawaii has a lot of solar, and weak grids, this had to be solved some years back for Hawaii.  There are rules that inverters need to back off when the grid is oversupplied, and have to hang in there through periods where the grid is undersupplied, to contribute to grid stability, rather than being part of the problem\n\nSo, this will come down to the owner of the solar PV inverter.  Their system has to do the right thing from the grid perspective - or else.   The right thing is reduce their output to the grid when the grid is oversupplied.  Now if they have batteries, they can choose to put that energy into batteries and that is cool, or into the swimming pool or hot tub, anywhere but export to the grid.",

"comment": "Put the money toward a proper solar array.  This thing looks like overpriced \"junque\" to me.  \n\nIt is an inverter and a battery; that's it.  $150 will get you a 1500W inverter.  Add a 100Ah battery for another $200.  Another $100 will cover your charge controller (or get an inverter with one built-in).\n\nI charge my Leaf with a large rooftop array (as well as power my office).  It is grid-tied, which isn't what you want if you are in it for backup purposes, but even at that, you're better off just buying a generator for those rare times.  Grid-tied is so much cheaper, and you're able to stay \"up\" when cloudy or at night without the need for batteries at all.",

If the world got together and rallied around some AOC inspired plan that sanctioned nations that use fossil fuels heavily, china would be SCREWED. Sure they make solar panels and batteries and would make revenue from producing those things, but they'd lose more revenue having to overhaul their whole energy infrastructure than they'd make from exporting panels/parts/etc. Thats why they have an interest in saying climate change isn't a big deal. They don't want an enforceable Paris Accords 2.0 that would cripple them by smashing their use of fossil fuels.",

We attempt to do the math. **Maybe it doesn’t matter.**\n\nHow many watts per exposed square meter do these tiles give?  To me that would be an important number as aren't solar panels the most efficient (or generate the most power over the course of a day) when they are installed facing south (in the northern hemisphere)?  So you want your south facing roof to have as much solar capacity as possible.  \n\nWith a traditional solar panel of approximately 1000mm x 1675mm and 300 watt output, you will get 179 watts per square meter.   But if you need a lot more space with the solar tiles to generate those 179 watts, you are likely to end up with tiles on east, west or even north facing exposures, which are less favorable.  \n\nDoesn't this mean that customers will need larger systems in terms of kW size to generate the same overall kWh than a smaller, more compact standard panel that can be mounted in the optimum direction?  \n\nMy current system consists of 29  - 300 watt panels that take approximately 48.5 square meters of space to give me a system of 8.7 kW capacity.  How much roof space would I need for a solar tile system of that size?",

"comment": "Many utilities will require you to sign a 20 year contract that says you agree to produce some amount of solar over the 20 year term in exchange for a upfront or production based incentive to purchase your solar energy. \n\nSome utilities will allow you to interconnect without a contract, which is what I did on my personal system. I have the benefit of NOT having any contract with the utility and I own my solar energy produced. The drawback is without a contract I am vulnerable to NET meter policy changes (usually you are protected from NET metering changes with a REC contract), and of course the utility is not buying my Renewable Energy Credits. With my utility the pay next to nothing for them anyway so that is not really a drawback.\n\nIn this case we were discussing here most homeowners do not realize that when they purchased the system (outright, lease, loan, whatever) they are also signing a 20 year contract with their utility. Most people dont understand what a REC is, where it comes from, and what they are agreeing to.\n\nIn your case I could not answer. You would need to look at your contract to see what you agreed to. When you say \"some company\", are you referring to your local electric utility? If it was upfront than there must be a term contract. If it is quarterly maybe it is paid after you produced it? I couldn't say without seeing your contract.",

Get this, here is a list of all incentives in WA four years ago. \n\n1. 30% federal tax credit\n2. $2,000 tax free incentive from our local utility that is publicly owned. \n3. No sales tax on the installed system cost.\n4. Net metering at then current cost of a KWh of electrons for life of system &amp; transferable.\n5. State production incentive of $.54/KWh produced annually for five years tax free (federal as we do not have a state income tax). I am expecting my last incentive check in November that will total $4,500, tax free cash. \n6. My system offsets 71% of our annual electron consumption, saving us over $1,000 per year in avoided electron purchases. \n\nEvery state in the union should have same or better incentives given the seriousness of human amplified global climate change. Not to get political here but a vote for Biden is for sure a step in the right direction regarding the above. The opposite vote is just not acceptable in any galaxy or universe save for the imaginary ones.",

"comment": "&gt;No, I definitely do consider that.\n\nNot when you're claiming to save the difference between peak and off peak.  You are counting the financial benefit of choosing EV2A vs. ETOU, but you are not counting the financial cost of that decision, which is you are paid significantly less for excess generation.\n\nIn other words, if you want to know the true savings, you need to subtract out how much you are losing by selling back to the grid at the discounted rate that comes with EV2A.\n\n&gt; Think of it this way, you don't 'sell' power to PG&amp;E, you null out consumption kWh.\n\nNot a good analogy since price is based on time of day.  If you \"sell\" 1 kwh at $0.10 and \"buy\" 1 kwh a $0.20, you lost $0.10.\n\n&gt; The optimal solution is to consume the fewest number of kWh at the lowest cost.\n\nYes, that we agree on.  The question is which of the following 2 scenarios would save the most money?\n\n1) Solar panels / backup generator / E-TOU\n\n2) Solar panels / battery / EV2A\n\nIt's almost impossible to answer this question since there are so many variables, but I think highly likely that option 1 will be cheaper.",

On the flip side, if you were planning to go solar anyway, taking over this lease would be an opportunity to go green with very little hassle.\n\nYou would essentially have two companies providing your electric service.\n\nYou get the first 875 kwh hours each month from SunPower at 17 cents/kwh.  This 17 cents/kwh is locked in for the next 14 years.  Clean energy straight from the sun.  \n\nAnything above 875 kwh you buy from the local electric company at their going rate.  If the figures above from Sunpower are accurate, you would pay about $71 per month to the local electric company.   \n\nEstimated average electric bill w/o solar. $225\n\nMonthly solar lease: $136\n\nMonthly electric company: $71\n\nMonthly net savings: $18\n\nAgain, not much savings vs staring with a new pv system, but if you were going to go solar anyway, I wouldn't look at it as a deal breaker.",

"comment": "I'm sorry the residential market doesn't fit into your very limited definition of \"project development\". Funny that you're taking \"ownership\" of a word that didn't even apply to solar 20 years ago. \n\nA project developer is someone who finds clients, products and financiers and ties all that together into a project that will make money and create value for everyone. It can be applied to real estate, business in general, or solar. \n\nWe don't install or sell, we structure the product and work with hundreds of installers and channel partners who do all work on the ground - a task that many utility players have tried and failed to do because of the complexity it requires. \n\nSecuring financing for residential and commercial is very similar to utility (and even to real estate). The only difference being that the off-taker is pulverized in thousands of clients. You still need to reliably produce and sell the electricity and equipment selection is key. \n\nNot everyone uses Enphase. In fact, most of the US market doesn't (although Enphase holds a strong lead in many markets). Historically, the top inverters in the US have at different times been Solaredge, SMA and Fronius, all of which are bankable because they've gone through securitizations. I've been in this business for 10 years and Enphase was absolutely hated by solar installers 8 years ago. \n\nAll I'm looking for is if anyone is using Hoymiles. If the answer is no, I got my answer. \n\nYou can learn more about structuring residential solar portfolio securitizations here:\n\nhttps://www.ca-cib.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/Project-Bond-Focus-Solar-ABS-2021.pdf",

Strange, huh?\n\n1 Minute into the video, sourced from a CNBC Aricle that GM is copying some of Tesla's business model.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/gm-energy-launches-to-connect-homes-businesses-with-ev-chargers-energy-storage.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/gm-energy-launches-to-connect-homes-businesses-with-ev-chargers-energy-storage.html)\n\n* Forming an engergy buisness, \"GM Energy\", **battery packs**, **solar panels**, ***Hydrogen fuel cells***, and **software to help optimize home charging and ride out electric grid disruptions.**\n\nThere's some commentary that this is a sign that, while this makes sense on the surface, it's a sign they may be trying to anything and everything to 'Be' like Tesla (capture similar revenue) but they haven't thought thought through the challenges and potential pitfalls.\n\n3 min in..\n\n* Also, that they haven't throught through being able to supply the volume of batteries needed for an Energy businees AND a EV business, considering they also are coming out with dozens of EV models. i.e., They will run into the same constraint that caused Tesla to throttle down battery supply to their Energy business in favor of the EV business: Battery supply Constraint.  While GM has increased the pipeline of batteries with their Single and Sole supplier, LG, it's not enough to **scale** both 30+ planned EV models and an Energy businsess. And all of this on the battery that experienced fires in both EV and Home storage batteries\n\nSource: [https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-Recalls-Home-Energy-Storage-Batteries-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-0](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-Recalls-Home-Energy-Storage-Batteries-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Including Hydrogen Fuel cells is also a sign they are having trouble focusing (not copying the focus of Tesla in this regard) and are saying 'Yes' to everything which is not how successful teams focus.\n\n6 min in...\n\n* Reference to a video where GM CEO Mary Barra claims the EV Equinox will be sub-$30K, but when pressed by the interviewer who stated other's have claimed affordbility before and didn't deliver so how could she confirm / promise this sub-$30K Equinox, Barra backed away not confirming her previous statement. What she did say, at that point, is that GM will offer 'All trim levels' and that they will have \"an entry level vehicle\".\n\nThis 'click baitey'(?) video states it may be a marketing tactic and that GM hasn't taken into account very likely increases in raw materials and other costs along the pipeline.\n\nSource : [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/08/gm-ceo-mary-barra-discusses-new-electric-chevy-equinox-and-ev-production-plans.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/08/gm-ceo-mary-barra-discusses-new-electric-chevy-equinox-and-ev-production-plans.html)\n\nThere's more but... you know.",

"comment": "Additional info:\n\nI installed the EV outlets some time ago.  I did speak with two electricians about the work and both wanted to upgrade the service to 250 - 300A with a separate sub-panel without doing any kind of load calculation.  I did not get a formal quote but it was in the thousands.  Also, as we have underground wiring in our neighborhood with 4 houses sharing 48KW transformers.  The utility told me they will not allow upgraded service because of this.\n\nThe main panel is protected by a 200A breaker so it cannot overheat and catch on fire as some have suggested.  Worst case, it trips.  Each EV outlet is protected as well by 40A breakers  a sub-panel fed by an 80A breaker.  The charge cables are limited to 32A max and therefore they cannot overload the circuits.  I used 8/3 NM-B wire which is rated at 55A for up to 100 ft of cable, de-rated to 50A for up to 104 F ambient.  So the wire is not going to melt or catch on fire.  The outlets are NEMA 14-50 rated for 50A.\n\nI have solar panels installed with Enphase micro-inverters with CTs to monitor consumption.  I looked back an the highest draw ever, with both cars charging and AC on was 19.9 KW or about 83 A.",

My house is one story and I have access from the ground to wash my 22x panels using the pole. There are only 2x panels high on the roof that require full 30ft extension. You need to be in shape for this DIY cleaning solution. I had a spring pollen season with very little rain in Texas. My panels were yellow green before washing. I left some panels unwashed for comparison. I had a 3% production increase from washing noticeably dirty panels.",

You want a local, reputable contractor that’s been around for 5-10 years minimum that’s well reviewed. Always ask for a cash price for reference and if you must finance then find your own financing via a credit union or bank. \n\nPlug these numbers into an amortization table and see what the total amount paid is over the life of the loan. That’s the real cost.",

Your pergola's ability to handle the additional load is a great start. Some solar installers specialize in these types of setups, but it might require a bit of research to find the right one.\n\n  \nI recently used this site to evaluate options for my own non-traditional solar project.

That in turn would increase the conversion of people who would like to stop eating meat but imagine it being too difficult.\n\nThe fact that they'd have weekly experience of vegetarian cooking would help as well. And the percieved image of vegetarian food as just salads and such would disappear.\n\nOf course they still wouldn't be vegan, but as you said, the vegetarians are probably our biggest recruitment group anyway!",

But milk isn’t the only, or even best, source.\"): http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/calcium-and-milk/\n\nEnriched soymilk and enriched rice and nut milks target about 300 mg of calcium per cup, equal to bovine milk. Some have more. Soybeans by themselves (when raw) have about twice the calcium of bovine milk. Here's a Silk product with 400mg/cup: http://silksoymilk.com/products/silk-wellness/dha-omega-3-and-calcium\n\nIf she's really insisting on milk (you don't indicate this, but many calcium-concerned folks have drunk the Kool-aid on cows' milk as a calcium magic bullet), here are some points to chat about: Where does a cow get its calcium? How about other vegetarian mammals with huge, strong bones, like horses and elephants? Do any other adult mammals need milk at all, let alone milk from another species? Oysters are about 75% calcium by weight; are they big on cheese and froyo?",

I kind of agree, see my next hypothesis.\n\n&gt;I've known more male vegans than female ones (although there are probably more female vegetarians than male vegetarians)\n\nMight it be that women are more easily being stuck in vegetarianism after they decide to act ethically and for men it's more often all or nothing because *some believe* they (EDIT: men) act more rationally?",

Arguably the worm thing makes more sense, but thanks, this is pretty much what I was thinking. It just seemed like the labelling was pretty deliberate (I think the TVP was called 'vegan'), so I thought there might be some vegans out there who don't consider yeast to be allowed. I think that would lead to the absurdities you mention though.",

Anything posted by me up until about a month ago was simply done primarily as an academic exercise to learn about how these insane Trump people think.  I probably should have created another username, but I have come to quite enjoy my username. \n\nI would classify myself as a left wing libertarian.  I believe in a social safety net, but I also believe that the government should stay out of our lives as much as possible.  I have voted for the NDP in most of the recent Canadian elections I have been apart of and I was a huge Bernie Sanders supporter.  I actually droved 4 hours a couple of months back to attend one of his rallies.  \n\nI am further to the right than a lot of vegans, but not by much.  \n\nRegardless, I do take your point and thank you for your input.",

At first i was nagging at him everyday for months and of course he wanted to promised he would go vegan he does but he eats meat at almost every meal still. He loves his burgers, bacon, eggs, and cheese. Seemingly its not a huge issue bit if I think about it, it affects me daily. I dread being asked to make something to ear for my boyfriend nowadays. DREAD. I also sometimes find myself totally grossed out at the fresh breath of flesh from his mouth after a meal or a piece of rotting flesh in his TEETH. Its slow but I can see it making me flip out one day.",

"comment": "My daughter went vegetarian at 9 and vegan at 12. She is successful because she has parental support. When she’s socializing with friends and they’re all eating pizza sometimes she either doesn’t eat (instead eats at home before or after) or has something else that’s vegan. It’s not easy but it’s possible. I think as a teenager when your parents are not supportive of veganism it can be really tough. Just do your best and don’t be hard on yourself. When you’re an adult I think you’ll find so many delicious alternatives to the foods you love. Good for you for being vegetarian for so long!",

"comment": "I live in America. Not a super expensive area but not cheap either. I find the vegan alternatives are about the same price as the organic/healthy/fancy things they’re trying to replicate. For example, Chao cheese, my favorite vegan cheese, it’s about $5 in my grocery store. You can usually get super processed, full of preservatives regular cheese for $1-$2 but if you were going to buy a quality cheese, it would run about the same as the vegan one.\n\nWhen products are new, they’re usually way more expensive though. There were these new vegan hotdogs I tried that were $10 for 4. You can buy a package of regular hotdogs for like $1 and there’s double the amount in the package! But the longer things are around, the cheaper they usually become. Especially if it’s a brand that becomes more popular.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed though, is even if veggie burgers are more money in the grocery store, they seem to always be the cheapest burger when eating out at restaurants/fast food.",

All of your assertions about cloning sound like speculation from someone who isn't so familiar with the process.   How exactly does a cloned organ need to 'mature' and why would that process be faster/better in a whole body?\n\nAlso, again, lab grown meat currently exists.  As in right now.  As in no hypothetical technology needed.\n\nAlso we can 'farm' filter feeders to create good growing conditions for aquatic edible plants without eating the filter feeders or turning them into implausible bio-robots.\n\nYou seem to be willing to accept a lot of convoluted things to envision a world where animal products could be considered to be ethically permissible.",

It’s down to how they’re evolved, they may have been with humans for thousands of years but the evolutionary influence over millions of years is stronger. Unlike humans, who can just drop eating meat with no problem, it’s harder for dogs who rely on it more than us. It’s still a good idea to feed them meat, and supplement it with things like beans and grains.",

I recently saw the documentary Super Size Me 2 and that put the nail in the coffin for me to switch over. I’ve lived in blissful ignorance for too long, and want to make the switch over to it. My question is: what did you guys do with any animal products in your fridge/pantry that you had when you switched? I have some cheeses and a lone pack of chicken breast left. Did you give them to friends/family who aren’t vegan? Is that not considered okay? I’ve done a decent bit of research in terms of what foods to buy at the store. I like to fancy myself a bodybuilder, so I’m pretty particular about shopping. A creature of habit, if you will, so this won’t be easy but it’s worth it to me. Thanks for the help!",

And there’s no struggle for fruit and veg, I’ve never lived far from local markets or street sellers. Especially when I’ve lived away  from the typical ‘expat neighbourhoods’.\n\nOne advantage here is vendors often specialise in just one or two dishes, so if you find good vegan friendly ones be sure to save it, I drop pins in maps and it’s useful when I find myself all over Hanoi for different job locations.",

Unfortunately, it is more likely for a bad plant-based diet (e.g. no B12 supplementation or very low fat or protein) to cause nutrient deficiencies with lifelong effects than a bad carnist diet. Most countries don't bother to consider the lifelong benefits of a good plant-based diet since those are seen much later. For that reason, many countries still continue to recommend omnivorous diets for children. \n\nAll these discussions ignore the damage to the entire planet humans' obsession with animal products is causing.

They're perfectly content thinking they are right, and I must just be a vegan weirdo who is wrong.",

And I would think... Well I'm not like that, so it kind of put me off a lot.\n\nTook me a while to realise that vegans were just normal people.\n\n>Why are you vegan?\n\nI was just looking for dairy free meals as I needed to cut it for diet reasons. Then I watched dominion. \n\nI sobbed and sobbed and sobbed. \n\nI couldn't look at animal products without remembering the horror I saw.\n\nI realised that if an alternative exists, why should I keep paying for animals to be tortured, abused, and exploited like that?\n\nI realised the pleasure of my tastebuds wasn't more important than helping the animals.\n\n>If we could kill animals for food in a way where they would not suffer, would you support it?\n\nNo.\n\nI believe we should leave animals alone and atop exploiting and killing them for our own pleasure.",

You aren’t harming an animal by continuing to wear leather you bought before you went vegan, but if you donate/sell the leather, you might prevent someone else from buying new leather and I see that as the best option. \n\nWith that said, I still haven’t finished giving all my leather items away 4+ years on. For instance I have a pair of boots that are too far gone to give away but not enough to throw away, and I don’t like the idea of wearing them so I don’t even know what to do.",

I think there's a place for us all as vegans to do some kind of activism, we don't all have to be doing the same things, just what we can. Sometimes just appearing \"normal\" can have people let their guard down and not immediately hit you with their terrible preconceived ideas of what a vegan is.\n\nIf you work on your research you would end up in a great position to talk with authority on the subject too. That could be way more effective than annoying coworkers and making work uncomfortable for you daily.",

"comment": "Comments like yours are always comparing industrial animal farming to agriculture and that is the problem. People like myself don't support industrial farming. Of course it's a terrible thing to have those poor animals cluttered and suffering and fed grain and there is so much unnecessary pollution and waste from it. Regenerative farming provides a quality life for animals, lets them just eat grass and bugs and sequesters CO2 leaving the top soil replenished. Also the water for cows comes from eating the grass so the water statement is just bait to piss you off. You've been duped into believing veganism will save the earth while ignoring the mass damages of agriculture. If you feel that bad about the environment, you might as well go forage your vegetables. If we weren't meant to eat any animals, then explain why it is that we need to supplement on a vegan diet and furthermore, how would it even be possible in nature without any technology to sustain this diet? We would go extinct. As someone who is majoring in environmental science, I'll tell you animals are just as important as plants to keep an ecosystem healthy and there is a system of organisms keeping each other in check to maintain balance, prey and predators. Cats will eat mice, predatory birds will eat pray birds, fish eat fish, etc. It is what it is even if it makes us sad, that's life. It's a constant renewal. Like I said, I'm not bashing vegan, I think it has its uses and if it's faith based, that's valid but acting like it's harmless or the solution is just ignorant. It's a giant smokescreen that distracts us from what the real major pollutants are that we should be focusing our energy on.",

Some even have so many that you can’t really eat a vegan diet.\n\nIn the end a vegan diet restricts what you can eat. If you have health conditions that already restrict what you can eat the vegan diet can of course be not feasible at some point.\n\nAlso the point with „it is named a plant-based diet“ - I kinda disagree as well. Maybe in the US. At least here in Germany it is possible to declare food „plant-based“ even though it is not vegan. Just a new term used by the industry to trick people.\nIn my eyes vegan is in fact a diet and also philosophy/lifestyle.",

My point is, if non dairy milk can mimic the nutritional value (somewhat) of regular cows milk, why not do it for ice cream? And someone who is a vegan, it would be nice to have some ice cream that isn’t just sugar and fat. Hopefully that helps my point get more across:)",

And a lot of that investment will probably be because he was doing his best as he saw it to look after you (assuming his time there overlapped with your existence). You would get defensive in his shoes, so don't let get in the way of your relationship.\n\nWhat do you intend to gain by convincing him that factory farming is wrong? Seriously, how does that improve your situation? What do you stand to lose in a fight over it? Do you actually want a fight with your Dad that attacks the root of his identity? I know that I was always spoiling for a fight to prove I knew better than my old man. It didn't do me or him much good. \n\nDon't be in such a rush. You are going to have to walk a few miles in vegan shoes and earn some respect from your parents for your ability to calmly and consistently live the vegan life. That's how things change. I never pushed anyone in my family to change or believe what I believed, but after a few years both my mum and sister went vegetarian. That was *their* decision.",

It's not minor. A small cat can kill about 150 chickens over its life from its diet\n3. It's not minor.\n4. As the moderator of /r/veganpets, I've been told to kill myself, go fuck myself, die, called insane, crazy, etc. Granted most of the vitriol is from the omnis, but a good amount has been from vegans in this sub. OP points out the hypocrisy of this and seems to be getting told he's the one with a problem. Absolutely bonkers imo.\n\nI agree that changing your own diet does more good than pets, but pet diets are not insignificant.
