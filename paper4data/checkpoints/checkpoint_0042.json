For proof of this, you need only look at how many people still think the batteries in hybrids and EVs makes them overall worse for the environment than normal cars.  That's why the best course of action here is to prevent the misinformation from spreading in the first place.",

"comment": "This is sort of basic. The big Tesla advance is their cooling system...few companies were willing to put all these little cells in close proximity to one another, as the risk of a run-away reaction (and a fire) is very high. Tesla's approach seems to be safe (at least based on the data we have), and it's because of their cooling system (which is impressive).\n\nBut it's not as if no one else thought of packing a bunch of small cells in a pack...the other automakers were concerned about fire risks and unwilling to invest in an alternate approach.\n\nWhat's more, the larger cell structure favored by Nissan, Toyota, etc. is developing nicely...we'll see better energy density from the larger cells soon enough.",

"comment": "And the comparison skateboard shot for the nissan LEAF:\n\nhttp://1-ps.googleusercontent.com/h/www.caradvice.com.au/thumb/770/382/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Nissan-Leaf-21.jpg.pagespeed.ce.Ze60R1b7B1.jpg\n\n#1 The Tesla is longer / wider than the LEAF (196\" x 77\" vs 175\" x 70\"). Their battery pack is also longer / wider / shallower; this makes it somewhat more vulnerable to side impact collisions but also allows the installation of the much larger battery and frees up room under the rear seat for the motor / inverter / reduction gearing.\n\n#2 Most of the power train of the LEAF are located under the hood; there's not much going on in the back (the 2011-2012 models located the onboard charger out back, moved up front for 2013). The Model S splits the powertrain between front (radiator) and rear (motor, inverter, reduction gearing, and I think charger)\n\n#3 There may be some ease of access considerations for Nissan in locating components under a hood rather than underneath the vehicle. Owners of a $70k car will tolerate higher service fees than owners of a $25k car.",

"comment": "wow, just a few mistakes.   \nBatteries are not part of the federal 30% tax credit.   \nYou are talking about a 6kW system for $17k which would  be a $2.83/w install, well below the grid tie average install rate of $4/w, yes you can get individual deals better than that in the low $3/w range but you are jumping to a much more complex installation with a more costly inverter etc. at below market cost.\nAlso you planned out a nice grid tie system using AVERAGE generation and AVERAGE consumption.   This works great ON grid where you can use the grid to balance out your generation and consumption.   If you go to http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php you can model this system and see that on AVERAGE it iwll produce 442kwh  in January and on AVERAGE 1052kwh in July.   You have a battery bank yes but it can't store any more than 14kwh so it is ineffectual at moving the summer production to winter use.   This means that the extra summer production is lost.  The system would need to be designed for the PEAK usage, and WORST generation!\nThe batteries are only useful for evening out the load and covering you through the night AND at least one day.   so since the home uses 20kwh/day and the battery (two of them) storage at MAX 14kwh you can't make it through a single AVERAGE day and night with no sun.\nTypically off grid would have 2.5 days of battery run time, and consumption would be greatly reduced from 20kwh/day.  \nYou also left off the cost of a generator which is required for any off-grid situation.",

ChargePoint Home, a smart and beautiful home electric vehicle (EV) charger will be available to order on Amazon later this summer. The price of the networked station ranges from $499 to $749.\n&gt; \n&gt; “ChargePoint Home delivers the same seamless charging experience ChargePoint users have come to count on at work and around town – and now it’s conveniently available in a driver’s own garage,” said ChargePoint CEO Pasquale Romano. “A Wi-Fi enabled, networked, EV charging station gives drivers freedom by allowing them to remotely start, schedule and set reminders for charging, all through their mobile app.”\n&gt; \n&gt; Introduced at CES in January, ChargePoint Home is the most advanced home EV charger on the market offering speed, convenience and intelligence all in an ultra-sleek and durable design.\n&gt; \n&gt; ChargePoint Home’s price varies based on power level, installation type and cord length. The station is available as a 32 amp station that can deliver a maximum of 25 miles of Range Per Hour (RPH), or a 16 amp station that can deliver a maximum of 12 RPH. Cords are available in 12, 18, and 25 feet. The station can be installed either indoors or outdoors, is available in a plug or hardwired version, and has a universal J1772™ connector that is compatible with all EVs on the road today.\n&gt; \n&gt; ChargePoint Home is integrated with a driver’s ChargePoint account so they can see residential, public and workplace charging via their mobile app. Drivers can also view their energy usage and how many miles they’ve added during a charging session depending on their car. Plus ChargePoint Home works with Nest so drivers can save on energy costs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier this year, ChargePoint announced the Multi-Family Home Service which gives apartment and condominium residents convenient charging at home. \n&gt; Drivers can learn more about ChargePoint Home and get on the waitlist at www.chargepoint.com/home.\n\nPhoto\n\nhttp://www.chargepoint.com/img/pr/070715.jpg",

"comment": "Well, considering that Tesla has a &gt;20% gross margin per car before selling ZEV credits, that means that the business of selling the cars is sound even if Tesla stops being able to make money off of ZEV credits.\n\nAlso, while US Americans benefit from the substantial EV incentives, there are many countries in the world where such subsidies don't exist. Yet Tesla still sells cars in these countries. Admittedly, they sell a lot more cars in countries which do have subsidies, but it's not like the cars are useless inventory without them. They are luxury vehicles in the first place, and for those, price generally matters a lot less than you'd think. Additionally, the Model 3 is affordable enough to compete with the Mercedes E-class and similar cars even without subsidies, and those have plenty of volume.\n\nTesla is also partially a software company, which often makes additional sales of software-activated features to people who already bought the car.\n\nFinally, Tesla is rapidly expanding outside the automotive sector, with growing involvement in both residential and utility scale energy. That business will be unaffected by changes to car subsidies.",

So in that regard the article is somewhat right (it starts decreasing after around 60) but also very wrong (it's as high as it gets around 60).",

Nissan is also launching their electric pickup, the Dongfeng Rich 6, in China this year so the technology is already out there. \n\nI don't think Rivian is a scam intended to take investor money but whether it's a good EV and becomes a good company to do business with remains to be seen.",

Its not difficult to add $5-$10k worth of upgrades to a car, especially since the typical configuration isnt the base model. $50k is probably an okay number, though $60k would be better. I can see the perspective of not wanting to give tax credits to rich people, but this isnt about helping lower income people as much as it is about getting EVs on the road. At $60k+ you may still be swaying someone into buying a BMW i4 instead of a 3 series or buying a Model Y instead of a BMW SUV.",

The Sync UI was ok but the UX was very good imo. \n\nFrom what I’ve seen on the Ford forums and reading elsewhere Ford has been very proactive getting OTAs out. Meaningful OTAs and not just generic “house cleaning” updates. \n\nI don’t like how 2022 MachEs and Lightnings aren’t getting the new Android Automotive. I would be pissed if I received my late 2022 Lightening and Ford isn’t doing any upgrade for it. \n\nFor a legacy automaker, Ford seems to be bridging the gap between car and tech. Tesla is mainly tech and lousy auto. VW/Audi is great car and lousy tech.",

When you put an EV drivetrain in an ICE platform, you end up with an expensive and underperforming vehicle.  The whole process and assembly line needs to change.  There's a reason that Tesla is selling cheaper and still making +20% margins.",

Im concerned, but i feel like everyone has simplistic answers that dont address the problem, like “stop using oil”, or “just go electric”……Economic efficiency dictates energy use, thats why it went human power, animal power, wind power, steam power, etc…. Each change happened because it made more economic sense to do so over the past 5000 years civilization. Non-fossil fuel use has to get kore economically competitive for us to switch over.  End subsidies for oul producers sure, but i as a dad of 2 kids and a massive mortgage have no money to throw down on a 35-50k electric vehicle that is only good for getting around town. I live in BC, and the disparity between city dwelling tesla owning hipsters is contrasted pretty severely in the interior, where owning a truck is a necessity for a pot of people. I believe recent video has shown the cybertruck is a of a cyberflop.",

Companies like Ford, Hyundai, Kia are currently competing with Tesla either getting a reduced credit or no credit at all. I cannot see how Elon getting $7,500 less per vehicle compared to competitors who are basically getting nothing right now is good for Tesla and bad for EVs. I would think if its that big of an advantage cost wise then Ford/Hyundai/Kia would just follow suit.",

"comment": "The [Sharp 121W solar panel](http://files.sharpusa.com/Downloads/Solar/Products/sol_dow_NA_V121HR.pdf) is currently [selling at about $0.32/watt retail](http://sunelec.com/solar-panels/sharp-121w.html), while official [NREL US government projections from just two months ago](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf) state that photovoltaic solar power is expected to remain above $1/watt at least through the end of 2016. \n\nAdvances in solar panel manufacture based on inkjet printing (I am not making this up) are expected to result in at least another order of magnitude cost reduction in the next few years.\n\nHere is the naive exponential extrapolation of solar (orange) and wind (blue) power, shown with 95% prediction confidence intervals and &gt;99% adjusted r^2: http://i.imgur.com/cmSHv9k.jpg Note that those extrapolations match the two corresponding curves in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Energy-trends.png exactly. \n\nWhat this means is that photovoltaic solar will completely dominate and undercut all other form of energy production, including fossil fuels, in less than ten years time, without any subsidies or carbon taxes. I think this will actually happen slightly sooner than the projections suggest.",

Anyone serious about the greatest threat of our time -- CO^2 pollution -- cannot cry about the dangers of nuclear power.

You have reduced your personal emissions, you have engaged with family and friends, you only vote for politicians who say they will introduce legislation.\n\nNot being frustrated that you can do it all, be content with that and accept it.\n\nClimate change is a symptom of living unsustainably, like a sore thumb is the result of it being hit by a hammer.\n\nSustainable living = consumption x population, both multipliers need to be addressed \n\nWhat else can you do, build some resilience into your home and your life.  We have 50 acres off the grid in rural Australia.  Generate our own solar power, collect rain water in tanks, grow lots of our own fruit and veg, I gave up work and live of my meagre savings, enforced penury limits consumption :)\n\nWe're a looong way from having an honest conversation on climate change let alone sustainability.  Even amongst those who want emissions mitigation, there are still people that think electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels and nothing much has to change or that nuclear offers and option.   We have a troika of people aligned against emissions mitigation: deniers, luke warmers and hypocrites (those who want emissions reduction but not for themselves eg they don't reduce their emissions and/or they vote for politicians who won't do anything effective eg the likes of Naomi Klien, your gf and her friend etal))  That's &gt; 90% of the population who don't really give a shit and why we are where we are.  They're going to fly to a meeting in Paris to talk about limiting emissions, that's like fucking for virginity.  We're a loooong way from having an honest conversation about what needs to be done.\n\ntr;dr You can't solve climate change, limit your own emissions, engage with friends and family and vote for politicians with strong climate policies.  Going down any other path is dangerous road to depression.",

"comment": "All battery systems are more costly than non-battery systems.   The SMA TL-22 is a bit more costly and limited, and the capabilities are very limited.   \nAs for worth it, that is entirely up to the homeowner.   How often do you have outages, how long are they, do you have public water or a well, Do you live in an area without net metering?   I have a small backup system (3kW, OutBack power) because we are rural, with a well and have pretty frequent outages.   It will likely never break even on the investment, where a cheaper non-battery grid tie would in 12 years.   But the convenience of having some power was the main reason for my purchase.   \nMany people shine off from the added costs of battery and get swayed to the lower tech SMA lines.   It is a marketing toy that will do little more than charge a laptop and cell phones.   I did more than that with my truck and a portable inverter before I purchased my OutBack system.    With the OutBack Bimodal system we now have though, we have not even noticed outages ;)",

"comment": "Solar panels aren't going to get more than 4 or 5x at the very most, that's the physical limit to the amount of power in sunlight. But pocket calculators can run on a very small solar panel. Maybe the question is more about 'will smartphone power consumption ever get that low?' Every generation of processors improves efficiency so I don't see why not, though we may opt to increase processing power within the same power envelope instead of decreasing power usage. Maybe we'll get to choose between top of the line phones with more processing power or simpler phones which run on milliwatts and never needs plugged in because they have a solar panel on the back.",

I found when looking around that solar installers locally demanded a steep premium because they can.\n\n2.  The panels and inverter are less important to the overall cost than one would expect initially.  Labor and expertise are also important and should be compensated.\n\n3. communitydotsolar is great to work with if you need help with your planning/design.\n\n4.  Use your network.  I have at least 2 electricians and 3 contractors in my circle of contacts that were interested in the work.  Get(buy) a set of plans and take it to a general, then to an electrician.  Ask if they want the work.  I'm sure I got a bit lucky, but I didn't even get a bid and my 19kW system was just under $3k for my electrician. \n\n5. If your conditions (soil and local suppliers) are good, you may think about driving I/H beams instead of pipe/concrete.  All the kids around here are doing it.\n\nGood luck!",

"comment": "Most miners do not mine bitcoin. Most miners mine litecoin or monero or whathaveyou and convert it to bitcoin. \n\nBut regardless of that, there are a fuck load of markets with very low cost of entry and zero net metering options. The more money you save the more miners you can buy. These are machines that cost several thousand each at high levels and you need as much as physically possible. A 30kw unmetered system is probably saving a pretty penny by not dealing with interconnection delays and allowing the owner to begin mining with cheap electricity ASAP. If he had to invest directly then he still has to wait for value to accrue rather than just profiting off the mining. Break even point for using the electric savings would be years from now and the coin would then have to grow in value. A 30kw unmetered could be up and mining within a month or two before the big adoption waves so he’d be even more profitable. \n\nThe economics are just not as cut and dry, and definitely not as less profitable as you’re making it to be.",

"comment": "Exactly.  Powerwall 2's should ship later this year. There are other promising up and coming technologies also. Now that there is such a huge demand for batteries there is a lot of R&amp;D money being spent on them.\n\nI live in Texas where I can get my electricity from over 100 companies. Part of deregulation or something. My Transmission charge is 4 cents a kilowatt and the electricity is anywhere from 4.25 to 7 cents.  (mine is 9 cents, 4 for transmission 5 for power) I didn't get the cheapest because I chose one that gets its power from 11% renewable.  It made me aware of the cost of the infrastructure.  So if I sell back to them, obviously I am not going to get the first 4 cents back.\n\nI don't have solar. I have new new house, the south roof has no obstructions.  It's very tight and well insulated and my electric use is very consistent summer and winter   I use between 30 and 40 kwh's a day.  I am waiting for affordable storage.  I am not mad that the most I would get is 4.25 cents a kwh for electricity, but I want 100kwh of storage as an ideal. 30kwh minimum. I am patient. I have waited a long time for the solar revolution, I can wait a bit longer.  Basically 5 Powerwall 2's.  Except like most, I don't want to spend more then 10k for storage.\n\nAttached is a spec sheet I found.

"comment": "&gt; I've kind of settled in on sunpower, but it's a lot of money. I'd get 50 360AC sunpower panels. I got a copy of their contract (haven't signed yet) and am concerned that it's all about protecting them and not about protecting me. Not surprising, but that won't work.\n\n\nNot sure if you mean 360W panels.\n\nAlso, contracts are negotiable. You can tell them that you want to change it.\n\n\n&gt; I'm also in the process of getting a quote from wholesalesolar.com. My idea there is to try to replicate what sunpower would do but at a much lower cost. So I'd get 55 Panasonic 330w panels, microinverters and so on. Then I'd have to find a local contractor to install it. Seems like most of the people who do this sort of thing also want to sell you panels, but maybe I can find someone to do the install.\n\n\nFrom what I have read, local installers work and are much cheaper.\n\n&gt; First, some questions re sunpower. 1) Is there a \"trick\" to getting them to reduce their price? I get that it's a premium system but it's far more expensive as a package deal than to just buy the components separately. \n\nYou can source the component separately at a much cheaper value.  \n\n&gt; 2) What assurances should I ask of them (since the contract doesn't provide any)? I was thinking (a) some sort of warranty/guarantee that my actual production is within a certain percentage of their projections (b) the standard warranties on the hardware and installation (c) some sort of warranty against my roof leaking anywhere they drill holes in it.\n\nYou are getting a lease, you should ask to put that in the contract.\n\n&gt; One other thing that surprised me. All of these companies will not touch any existing vents. Solarcity vaguely mentioned a feature that they can redirect the vents but the proposal doesn't mention that. I get that not all vents can be moved but most of these are bathroom vents that it seems could be rerouted pretty easily. I may have a plumber do it for me. Primarily to maximize the number of panels in the prime spots on my roof, but also because it looks better. Seems like a value-add that the solar companies could do.\n\n\nAre you talking about HVAC vents? Those systems are expensive and hard to repair. \n\n\n&gt; One last thing, just as an FYI in case anyone has any thoughts on this: I have a gas heater for my pool and it doesn't work. I am planning to replace it with an electric heat pump and supplement that with an electric heater for my built-in spa. I building out the solar project to include the expected added capacity for heating the pool/spa.\n\nYou should size the system with the new piece, I assume you are getting net-metered not btm and off-grid. It should be fine. Make sure of your electricity rate.\n\n\n&gt;  In addition, my house has some old thermal pool panels on the roof that leak. My plan is to replace them with new panels and relocate them to the front part of my roof. It's hard to tell how much the thermal panels help, but they clearly help. So they'd be going to the north side of my house, but my roof isn't very steep so they'd still get sun.\n\nI dont know what those panels are. Put panels south facing for maximizing yield in the Northern Hemisphere.",

"comment": "Here is a different design that could work well with pillow blocks and a linear actuator. http://www.sat-energy.com/pst-1ax6-single-axis-solar-tracker/\n\nTough call but I think you really want the production on the overcast days right? Then again, on an overcast day, might not a module facing straight up provide more power than 1-2 modules facing 60 degrees e/w?  But if that is mostly true, then then why not just do a double-sized low profile flat array? But then why not make it tracking, since trackers can face straight up on overcast days and show a faster ROI? And if it is a site/application specific answer. You may be able to \"win\" with a tracking solution for a site-specific case, but a simpler \"virtual tracking\" solution might be the better business solution.  Latitude may play a role, and even the import tariff messes with this one.  Still, it certainly seems like the utility-scale trackers could be kitting out some of their parts to the residential market if they wanted. It might be that they don't want people scaling that knowledge curve.\n\nI'm actually in a similar boat with an off-grid home where the solar array is actually on a rough edge of a golf course adjacent to the client's backyard.  We're probably going to go with the flat, low profile, oversized solution because of aesthetics and perimeter trees which would negate some of the evening and morning tracking benefit. Might even try to home brew some fake \"curved\" modules to smooth out the edges of the array so aesthetically it looks kinda like a black, floating lake with a low profile white picket fence perimeter.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with. Rent a motorized trencher. For the love of god. Usually can fit along with any other heavy equipment (motorized concrete mixer, bobcat, etc.)",

"comment": "County typically has legislation protecting utilities when in a residential zoned area. Basically, if you have utility service you can't completely disconnect. If going solar you HAVE to be grid-tied so plan accordingly or move to a rural area. Grid connection admin is a function of the inverter, one of the cheapest parts of the system so it doesn't really pay to save there. The nearest thing to grid independence you can legally attain is a battery array (ESS). Google DYI PowerWall.",

So they had to do it at some point. \n\n&gt;Subsidies work in increasing adoption rate, your argument is invalid.  \n\nno it is not. It's about public perception and if you wan't to get elected you're better not \"funding the rich\"\n\nThe 37k leafs were only in this quater. So while it isn't world changing it is more than a drop in the ocean.  \n\n&gt;Other companies have not taken energy storage as seriously.\n\nJust because Tesla batteries are all the hype doesn't mean that other companies don't take energy storage seriously.  \nThere are dozens of home batterie storage solutions on the marked right now and you can actually buy them unlike the Tesla Powerwall.  \n&gt;Because it's been a blue ocean for Tesla in the past decade.\n\nAre you serious? Tesla had so many problems with money and quality that most people stopped counting. I would't call that blue ocean.",

Do you know if your actual system is 35 of the Canadian Solar panels that are in this initial bid, connected to the Solaredge inverter? That would give you a 35x265W = 9,275W system, which seems reasonable.",

Summer is great, but in winter we get snow and the solar panels don't help much.  Over 12 months though, it's a noticeable amount of production.  It really does help with an EV.   The important part is sizing the system correctly!  You are supplementing gasoline with your solar. \n\nI am still very happy that I did solar, since I paid them off the first year with cash I saved up.   The tax breaks were excellent as well, making them almost 1/3 the initial pricing.   A $22k system ended up costing around $8k out of pocket.",

We have 80,000 cars on the road here, but the Island itself is only 225km long, almost all those vehicles are close to the city, so close that even low range EVs make sense. To make matters even more favorable, 100% of the electricity the Island generates is from wind, electricity we don't generate comes from NB and is 76% from sources other than coal/petroleum. We also have generous solar subsidies right now and land outside the city tends to be cheap, houses are on big lots, so you can even compliment your EV with rooftop or land based solar panels.",

"comment": "As a PV designer these Sunpower modules are not worth their much higher price tag and the big headache they cause for the electrical design. You see the headline of 400W and your SP rep will sell you it's efficiency but there isn't much product support for these monster panels (worked for a SP installer and have designed over 4MW of their stuff). Solaredge does not have the capability to support them (Voc is too high) and you end up with really short strings on a residential string inverter. It's much more cost effective to go with your conventional 60/72 cell modules, for the savings on mods but also BOS.",

"comment": "So this is a good start when comparing solar. But here are some steps to help compare them apples to apples\n\n1. Make sure to compare the system sizes instead of the number of panels. The installers should provide this in writing on a proposal, but if not it’s equal to (the number of panels x the wattage per panel)\n\n2. Make sure to get prices on the solar equipment and installation without any extra add ons such as efficiency upgrades. That way you can compare the solar deal more evenly. You can then decide if you want the add ons.\n\n3. Compare price per watt. This will be (the total cost of the system divided by the system size in watts). Typical $/W can range greatly, from $2/W up to $4.5/W. Depends on your market, installation conditions, and also equipment. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n4. Compare solar panels and inverters for their efficiency and warranties. It may be worth paying a bit more for a better product, especially with inverters which tend to be the most common fail point. Panel efficiency will help you save roof space and reduce penetrations.\n\n5. Compare installation companies for their track record as well as any extra offers they may have such as production guarantees. Also make sure they are NABCEP certified and have a solar license.\n\nThis might be a lot, but given my certification in NABCEP PV Technical Sales, I wouldn’t buy without taking all of those steps. If you need help, I’d be happy to help you with the leg work of comparing your offers evenly. And of no charge just in case that was a concern. I just care and hope that solar is a beneficial investment for you 😊.\n\nMy LinkedIn Page- www.linkedin.com/in/desmondpressey",

Twice the time, not to mention lots of other weather variables and you would need some place to store the solar power at night for use. Solar and Wind has it's place but so does nuclear. With the new Fusion power plant starting construction, we may be able to get rid of coal and natural gas plants eventually and phase out the old nuclear fission plants.",

"comment": "Different net metering programs work in different ways. Some roll over in a yearly period, some are only within the month, some have a fixed payback rate set yearly, some are true TOU. For instance, if you can only offset within the month then 100% offset is not a good idea for you.  \n\n\nAs far as panel quality, degradation rates can vary wildly between the panels. For instance an LG Neon Panel should be producing from 85-92% of nameplate at the end of it's lifetime, but a non-premium quality might be anywhere from 70-80% of nameplate. This doesn't seem like much, but over the course of 20-30 years it can add up. There are also factors like low light production. Will  you make money on some chinese garbage? Probably. Will you make as much as you would on a premium system? Definitely not. It's a complicated balance of initial price vrs payback.  \n\n\nI recommend plugging any prospective system into  [https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/), but honestly, as long as you don't have shading issues and the panels aren't north facing, your production is going to be fine.",

"comment": "If we are going to argue about who is more hyperbolic you’ll will note I said “nearly”.  Not everyone.  I’m not sure what your motivation is here. Is it to discredit those in a discussion or to clarify a situation more clearly.  Rooftop solar is often perceived as some sort of hobby and not very effective at accomplishing anything that helps this climate situation.  You imply in your postings that this is very likely true. That at least was my perception. It certainly CAN be true for certain cases. However in many cases the opposite is true. If my utility let me I could probably produce 200% of my present demand. I know dozens of people, mostly engineers, that have not only installed solar but augmented their systems again and again as. costs have fallen. \n\ni have no idea where you live but in vast areas of the US solar is economically viable.  If you live in California and are paying a lot for gas then an EV and a bigger solar system is even more compelling.  If you are a competent DIYer the case is overwhelming. \n\nmy intent here was to show that even in non-ideal  conditions solar is not marginal but very effective.  Perhaps more effective than people assume who aren’t looking at real data like we are. Was I suggesting that you put solar up in super adverse conditions?  No.   \n\n\nive looked at your very extensive po sting history. With your background why not say solar on rooftops is economically effective in 69% (or whatever the number is) of satellite identified residences in the US. Inform us more.  Just acting in pedantic way is scarcely convincing or helpful.",

Looks pricy, but they're the only company that I saw that had a 25-year warranty/guarantee on literally **everything** including power output guarantee.\n\nPlus I have a 3-story home with a roof even I don't feel comfortable going on without a harness.\n\nMy only gripe is that they used external conduit, so as you pull up in the driveway you can't see the panels on the far side of the roof but you see the metal conduit pipe slicing the front side of the roof in half.  Looks tacky.  But my thinking is, in 10-15 years I'm going to need a new roof before I sell (roof is currently about 10 years old), since I'll need them to take the solar system off to do the roof, at that time I can make sure it's reinstalled with conduit inside the small attic space before I sell the house.",

"comment": "The main error in your question is use of the term \"efficiency\" where you mean \"output\". Efficiency is the ratio of output/input, and if the input goes down the output goes down. A rough analogy is that a water pipe lets all the input water come out that goes in (100% efficient) but if no water goes in... surprise... no water comes out. It is far more likely that reduced input is your problem since PV efficiency is actually known to  improve when modules are cold.\n\nInput tends to go down in winter in the northern hemisphere because the sunlight gets spread out more when the sun is low in the sky. However, if the modules are covered in snow the input can be drastically reduced and it is possible that pushing the snow off can solve that directly.\n\nUnfortunately, there is often partial melting that accumulates ice on the modules, so cleaning them may risk damage.\n\nTo your question of more modules, yes, that works up to a point. If you have a 5kW inverter it may be reasonable to have up to 7-9kWp of modules connected in a northern location. More than that may work just fine even in summer until a fault occurs in the inverter, at which point the overcurrent protection may not work and the resulting damage may burn nearby structures like your house down. Ask your local solar installer to help you read the inverter specifications to be more precise for your equipment.\n\nOne thing about snow \"soiling\" ... the reductions can be so dramatic that an additional 10-20% of modules may not make a noticeable difference. Off-grid systems usually include an alternate source like diesel or micro-hydro as a backup for these very difficult periods... grid-connected systems obviously fall back on the grid.",

"comment": "Hyundai is aiming the newly launched Ioniq 5 full-electric crossover as a direct competitor to the Volkswagen ID4, although the two vehicles are in different segments, the automaker’s Europe chief, Michael Cole, said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, the Ioniq 5 could also appeal to buyers of premium full-electric crossovers such as the Audi e-tron, Tesla Model Y and BMW iX3 because positioning, competition and even pricing are difficult to define in the still-developing electric vehicle market. \n\n\"It feels like any electric vehicle probably is a competitor right now, within a reasonable scale,\" Cole, who is president and CEO of Hyundai Europe, told Automotive News Europe.\n\nNonetheless, the ID4 remains the main target of the Ioniq 5, the first vehicle from Hyundai’s electric subbrand. \n\n\"Hyundai is still a mainstream brand, and if you are positioning yourself like that, you always have to look at who is the market leader; and VW is inevitably going to be your benchmark,\" he said.\n\nHybrid and electric models from Hyundai have used the Ioniq name, but last August the automaker announced it was launching a global battery-electric subbrand using the Ioniq name. Ioniq plans to release two more full-electric vehicles in the next three years.\n\nCole said that Hyundai had no plans to move Ioniq upmarket to premium or near-premium status. Hyundai's Genesis brand already competes in those segments, although it’s not yet available in Europe. \n\nHyundai describes the Ioniq 5 as a midsize crossover, while VW considers the ID4 a compact. At 4635 mm (182.5 inches) the Ioniq 5 is shorter than other midsize crossovers (the Audi e-tron is 4901 mm long, and the BMW iX3 is 4734 mm long), but slightly longer than the ID4, at 4585 mm. \n\nHyundai says the Ioniq 5 has the interior space of a larger midsize vehicle because its dedicated E-GMP electric vehicle platform allows for a longer wheelbase. \n\nThe price of the Ioniq 5 has not been announced. Autocar magazine has reported that the price of a higher-trim launch edition, called Project 45, will be 45,000 pounds (53,200 euros or $63,450) in the UK. In comparison, the ID4 launch edition costs 49,950 euros, with a base model listed at 36,950 euros in Germany. \n\nThe Model Y starts at 58,620 euros, the e-tron starts at 71,900 euros and the iX3 at 69,950 euros.\n\nThe Project 45, which has options such as a solar roof and 20-inch wheels, can be ordered in France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Norway. Deliveries will begin in the second quarter. \n2 Ioniq launches planned\n\nHyundai expects to sell 70,000 Ioniq 5s globally this year and 100,000 annually starting in 2022, CEO Jaehoon Chang has said. About 40 percent of sales will come from Europe and 30 percent from North America. That would mean sales of 28,000 units in Europe in 2021 and 40,000 a year starting next year. \n\nVW has said that it expects ID4 global output to hit half a million units annually by 2025.\n\nThe Ioniq 5 will be followed in 2022 by the Ioniq 6, a midsize sedan that will take inspiration from the Prophecy concept shown in March 2020. It will be followed in early 2024 by the Ioniq 7, a large SUV.\n\nCole said Ioniq will be run as a part of the Hyundai brand. \"We see this opportunity with the new E-GMP platform to establish a family of vehicles, but within the broader Hyundai family,\" he said. \n\nHyundai's current full-electric vehicles, the Kona subcompact crossover and Ioniq compact sedan, share platforms with gasoline and hybrid vehicles and are front-wheel drive.",

"comment": "You would effectively have two separate power sources... your off-grid system, and the grid. So for each circuit in your house, you will need to decide, do you connect that to the grid, or your off-grid system? For me, this would be a pretty significant compromise, but I can't speak for your use case, perhaps this is totally workable. There are techniques to make it a little more convenient... transfer switches etc... but it's probably going to be a compromise compared to a grid-tie system, *unless* you can build a system large enough for your energy needs.\n\n(In theory, you could move most of your house onto an off-grid system, and then have your grid *only* supply power to a single circuit that charges your batteries... this might work if the solar array + battery storage is sufficiently large.)\n\nHope this helps... I'm not saying that off-grid isn't right for you.... maybe it is the perfect solution. It all comes down to what are your energy needs, and what size off-grid system will you need to meet those needs.",

The GEM analysis did not include projects that had failed to advance its development in the last two years, classifying these separately as shelved.\n\nI would love to see a comparison between the increases here and what would need to be reduced to cancel it out (for example, how many cars taken off the road, solar panels installed, coal plants decomissioned)",

"comment": "&gt;... this is what stops me from getting an EV.\n\nThis particular question was handled about a year ago by the guy who runs Engineering Explained - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dfyG6FXsUU\n\nTL ; DR - I  agree with The Thing aka /u/Benjamin_Grimm. Except in a way, an EV might be easier in Texas. It's like a portable powerwall. It will charge when/if power is on &amp; keep the house going. If the power comes on for 4 hours at 1am and your car is plugged in, there you go; that doesn't happen with gas. And if you know where there's a public fast/super charging station that has power and you don't? Run out to charge up, come back and power your house. That's what Nikki of Transport Evolved did a few years ago, and it was with a Leaf (!) IIRC.\n\nPlus recall, gas pumps use electricity.\n\n&gt;I really hope something like fuel cells, which could fill up much quicker than an EV, become a more realistic option.\n\nAs much as I'm a tech nerd, FCEVs are about 10 years out... and have been for 10+ years. There's a crapton of reasons why they haven't taken off despite Toyota putting not  insignificant energy into trying to make them work, but even if they did they've been a boondoggle for the fossil fuel industry as all methods commonly used aren't all that green - and in fact some 90%+ come from fossil fuels (possibly some wood or other source but *still* not 'green'). If we get to a point where we have buttloads of extra power and need a way to store it, sure, electrolysis maybe, but that's only solving one of hydrogen's problems.\n\n&gt;will an EV car basically be junked at 10 years due to the decreased capacity of the battery and/or it failing?\n\nAlmost certainly not. As a data point, one reason people repeat this is the Lizard batteries in Leafs and their not-so-great BMS. That is, they degraded faster than you'd like and with their already small range of the older models, that hurt. So Nissan looked into doing their own powerwall type implementation, using old Leaf batteries. Thing is, not enough people were getting their batteries swapped for this to work (caveat, might be related to Nissan not making it financially attractive) so not enough batteries were being dumped. Add to this recycling, which is just gearing up en masse but IIRC Tesla already does and... not a problem. And 10 years? Not likely. I do not intend to get rid of my Bolt, but others might and that will become the cheap used car you send your kid to college with. My brother is doing this with my niece. She's getting his old Focus EV for college, and he bought a model 3.\n\nSo to all your questions, good to ask but very likely not concerns. I've been watching &amp; asking some version of these questions myself since at least the mid 2000s, arguably since the EV-1 days, and IMO although good to ask them the answers are heading in the directions people here talk about. You might see some incredible, easy breakthrough tech that makes the comparison between our now current EVs and future EVs look somewhat like Aging Wheel's [Trabant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhpIgM6TpwA) versus a modern car, but that's a leap and his car is still usable *as* a car.\n\nAs a note there are a bunch of borderline hit pieces out lately, and this looks at least a little like one. Maybe it's a desire for sensational headlines driving hits, maybe it's the usual researcher/scientist making an off-hand comment that gets blown out of proportion or distorted in one direction only... or maybe it's just to make people feel better about buying their RAM2500 despite the $200 fillup. Dunno, but it's always good to look at these articles with the questions you ask, as well as to recognize when there are legit answers.\n\nEdit: Interestingly &amp; according to https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.html, Hawaii gets most (65%) of it's electricity from oil. I'm guessing that's imported to the islands, and definitely an interesting difference from the lower 48.",

"comment": "It’s true that the production of EV batteries generates greenhouse gasses. Here are a few other things that generate GHG:\n\nManufacturing of cell phone and laptop batteries, \nProduction of hamburgers, \nGrowing corn and soy, \nBurning candles, \nComposting food waste\n\nIt’s important to pay attention to the quantity of GHG produced by each. From everything I’ve read, it sounds like worst case scenario you break even somewhere in the 20-30k miles range. This is assuming that you only charge in areas where the utility company does not use any renewable energy to generate electricity.\n\nBy far, the least efficient way to convert hydrocarbon fuel to kinetic energy is using an internal combustion engine under transient load. The constant changes in engine speed, fuel rate, temperatures and pressures are extremely wasteful.\n\nAdditionally ~20% of electricity produced in the United States is from renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric. Personally, I charge my vehicle using the solar panels on my roof whenever there is enough sunlight to do so. \n\nEven if you’re utility doesn’t utilize any renewable energy, burning coal to generate electricity and delivering that electricity to your vehicle, then using battery power to spin electric motors to propel the vehicle is far more efficient than injecting gasoline or diesel fuel into your cylinder or intake manifold at varying rates matching your throttle pedal position in real time.",

Net metering depends on the utility. \n\nYour sales rep can contact the design team for more information on which attachments will be used, but it will depend on exactly which roofing material was used (TPO/EPDM/rolled comp/etc.). \n\nThe long warranties are indeed through the manufacturer, but the install does include a 10 year workmanship warranty as well.

In Virginia it's kWh for kWh net metering.\n\nIf I were able to produce more with IQ8A vs IQ8M, the benefit would be that I might need fewer panels to offset my consumption. Fewer panels means smaller DC size which means less system cost which means better ROI. With each panel making about 500-520 kWh per year, and people saying I'm only losing 1.5kWh per day, assuming 200 days of sun, I'd have annual 300 kWh of energy gained from no clipping, so net annual 200kWh less for the whole system with 1 fewer panel an inverter. With the greedy pricing in solar, each panel and inverter is, installed, over 1300$, which is substantial. Am I wrong? The question is... would higher capacity inverter actually produce more with the different DC AC ratio so it's not running at peak efficiency for as long?\n\nAnyhow... it's the past, but can't help but wonder a little bit.",

"comment": "Thanks for your response. \nThe TOU for Lakeland Electric has a hefty \"Demand Charge\" that I explained in another response. They require all solar customers to have this plan. My concern is having a low production day during the summer and losing any savings from solar. (6.29 per kilowatt on your highest demand time for the month - 1-8pm weekdays during summer) So if you have a rainy day (we have afternoon storms a lot during summer) and use 10kw (extreme example) one day that month during the 7 hours of peak time, it's a $63 charge on top of any grid use (like 2 or 3 cents per kw) and their \"you're our customer, pay us\" fee, of course.\n\nThey also only seem to allow the interconnected program/hardware (I think this is their net metering) on Tier 1 systems, so if I want any benefit for overproduction, I have to stay small.",

Definitions are meant to explain and people understand what you eat when you say \"I'm vegan\" (when all you mean is diet) and there isn't another word for it.  \"Why aren't you eating ___\", \"I'm vegan\" is a satisfying exchange.  Sure you could say \"I don't eat animal products\" but it's clumsier when explaining yourself isn't a priority. Definitions are not useful if their only use is to designate an achievement at the cost of making communication more difficult.\n\nDepending on how much information is required a better option might be to say \"I eat a vegan diet\", which is correct - just as \"I recite the Christian bible\" is meaningful for a non-Christian.  Likewise \"I'm an ethical vegan\" or \"I'm part of the vegan movement\" makes sense for true vegans. \n\nI mean, seriously.  Even in mathematics which is completely anal and absolutely dependent on clear definitions people take already well defined terms and tweak them for their needs.

I found this dark chocolate with no milk.\n\nMaybe it's cabin fever, it's so hot outside I barely ever leave the room. It can't be healthy, right? I'm just trying to rule things out. I'll have to go to the doctor eventually, if the headaches persist.",

Even fellow vegans see fit to tell me that I'm \"doing it wrong\" because I like foods that they do not.\n\nAnimal products were never a big part of my diet, but going vegan forced me to learn to cook and to diversify my diet; as a result, I'm healthier than ever.

If there was anything within 45 minutes I would make a point to go once a month or so.\n\nLive music couldn't hurt, see how it goes over.

"comment": "Immoral depends on what philosophy one prescribes to. On an anthropocentric utilitarian philosophy this act would hardly be considered immoral. The moral agent would weigh the interests of humans, see that said act is beneficial and deem it moral. (At this point I want to note that although the animals are being used as a means to an end, it is being done in a more compassionate fashion than that of factory farming). Plenty of other philosophies are in stark contrast and would state it's immoral. In my opinion none of these have determined an objective morality that would answer your question.\n\nSo I will answer empirically. Historically humans needed non-human animals to survive, develop cognitively, and to use for tools in everyday life. Almost all other animals do this in some form and I doubt anyone would argue this is wrong. At a certain point in history we stopped needing animals, and later began questioning whether we should continue to use animals as a means to an end. Clearly the people Heifer are aiding are in desperate need of help, and don't have the means to fend for themselves. In cases of survival beings will do what is necessary to survive, which for the people Heifer is aiding, is by accepting the products Heifer aids them with. So I don’t think the people Heifer are aiding are committing an immoral act. What then about the actions of Heifer and the people choosing (economically) to support that organization?\n\nI don’t know enough about the situation to know if there are other means available that Heifer could employ to help these people. IF there are other readily available means that Heifer could employ to help these people but are consciously choosing to not use for whatever reasons, then what they are doing is immoral. IF there aren’t other methods that could be used by Heifer I think that what they are doing is right or wrong depending on the value one confers to humans and animals. If one thinks that humans have more value than animals, the act is moral. If one thinks animals contain more or equal value to humans, then the action would be immoral.",

They told him before he left he would have to start incorporating animal products into his diet. He started slowly going into eating meat in the months before his departure. The way they made it seem to him, he really didn't have a choice. At the same time, it's two years that you will be doing a lot of good, if you must, eating meat isn't the ultimate evil for this kind of opportunity.",

It's got a lot of recipes covering a wide range of different foods, like Chocolate-Chip Brownie Waffles, Seitanic Red and White Bean Jambalaya, and Baja-Style Grilled Tempeh Tacos.  If you're missing a particular dish like Mac and Cheese or Sloppy Joes, there's probably something in there that scratches that particular itch (like the Mac Daddy and the Snobby Joes).\n\nAs for nutrition, as long as you're eating a varied diet, the only thing you really need to worry about is B12.  There's a lot of foods fortified with B12 (like soy milk and flour) so you can meet the requirements that way.  I take a vegan multivitamin, just so I don't need to worry about it.",

Personally, I enjoy eating the non-instant kind more, but the instant stuff (without sugar) is still vegan and really good for you and even quicker to make.  Many think of it as a breakfast meal but, because of how easy it is, it's pretty good to make whenever you're short on time.  Have some fruit and/or nuts/seeds with it and you're pretty set!  Also a really great source of nutrients like iron, protein, and many others!\n**EDIT:** check out [this site](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/breakfast-cereals/1597/2) for some nutritional deets!",

Lifestyle vegans don't want to defend our habits, our lifestyle or our food. Some of us choose to be more thorough than others and that's awesome. Personally I didn't *want* to be vegan, it just became my only option when I felt so bad about what I was eating I just lost appetite for it. Do I want to yell at other people about how veganism is the best and throw blood at people who still drink milk? Fuck no, I am tired of people constantly attacking **me** just let me eat my food and you eat yours. I might wrinkle my nose and insist it isn't in my home but if you didn't smoke pot I wouldn't take it into your home either. Just lifestyles man.\n\nTL;DR the vegans you are looking for are lurkers.",

"comment": "One things before we start, you can only convince yourself.\n\n&gt; are they really suffering?\n\nAnimals do no only suffer in death. Many animals are what you can label \"factory farmed\". The conditions of such farming processes are typically appalling. There are loads of videos on the subject if you want to look more into it. While all farms may not operate under these conditions, a majority do, well at least in the U.S.\n\n&gt; i mean they can kill the animals fast and without suffering and is it unnecessary?\n\nYes, they *can* kill them with relatively little suffering, but this is not *always* the case. The most cost-effective and efficient way to kill an animal is, more often than not, not the most humane way. The fact of the matter is that most animals do suffer when being brought to death. And while an animal *can* be killed quickly, that does not mean it won't be scary as shit for it.\n\n&gt; people eat animal products in order to live\n\nYou say this as if eating meat is \"necessary\" for optimal nutrition. Such an argument is problematic because it aims to reinforce the dominant (carnist) norm instead of making a reasonable claim. Humans can thrive on plant-based diets and with all of the options available it is easier than ever before.\n\n&gt; why do you consider eggs a cause of animal sufferings?\n\nAgain, most eggs come from factory farmed hens. The \"cage-free\" label is also problematic since it evokes an image of a hen roaming around free in the grass. While they might not be in a cage, the conditions are not that much better. Home grown eggs are also controversial since many hens come from breeders of similar standards. Finally, eating eggs gives off the idea that it is *okay* to use hens for their eggs. Until we can do it ethically and symbiotically, it emits a sense of exploitation.",

"comment": "I posed different questions relating to whether there's a correlation between vegan longevity and certain held beliefs. For instance, there's a lot of varying tolerance here for others consumption of animal products. Whether vegans decide to be in a relationship with non-vegans, or those who claim we shouldn't support fast food's vegan options (Wendy's new veggie burger, taco bell, or even those who lamented that Amy's wasn't vegan enough). Also, in general if you think being vegan makes you better than others solely by virtue of being vegan. \n\nThe reason I ask is because as a new vegan, I'm still uncertain about a lot of these ideas, and I'm just kind of testing them out still. Like, I would imagine that the longer someone is vegan, the more alien and evil animal agriculture seems. And if that's true, I wonder if that causes less tolerance toward consumers of animal products. But my question in general was if your experience has proved wrong any of your previously held beliefs. i.e. what you're not naive about anymore. All of the above is just a few hypotheticals. \n\nAnd I probably should've avoided the word radical, considering in most cases it's used as an epithet to discredit valid arguments. I wasn't using it in that context.",

But the thing is, I detest tucking into something like that. I would much rather just have a tray of cut fruits than have to spoon that slop into my mouth, especially with chunks of coconut.

I have NEVER told him that he should switch to a vegan alternative of something he loves.\n\nBut he is conscious of my choices when choosing restaurants, he has snacks for me when i come over, and he's open to trying lots of new things without me pushing.

I haven't ever came across \"omnis\" (note that we all are omnivore as it simply &gt;refers to what we can eat), that didn't use the same things as I do ON TOP OF killing &gt;70 billion land animals a year for pleasure.\n\nYes just because you're being \"better\" than an omni by helping out on the animal part it still makes you an hypocrite in other areas of life, like supporting what we're doing towards 3rd world countries\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Or does it? Based on what? You're experience of having talked to 1 person?\n\nIf you ask a meat-eater which vegan activist they like the most, it'll most likely be the ones with the kinder approaches. You'd understand watching the video I linked\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Again baseless assumptions on what is efficient and what isn't,\n\nHumans are emotional creatures which responds better to encouragement. You'd know this if you understood how the brain worked. Also, go visit PETA's twitter and see how many people are encouraged by their means of activism (spoiler: Most people think they're a joke which in turn makes vegans into a joke)",

The iron leaches out of the pot and into the food. \n\nWorks like a charm, and I haven't been anemic in years. \n\nI've seen some research that vitamin A deficiency is common in children who grow up vegan. I'm not sure why, but like iron, I suspect the kind found in plants doesn't absorb as well as the kind found in animal products such as eggs and salmon.",

"comment": "If you want a decent book to get started, and really the only one I can truly recommend, it would be The Art of Plant Based Cheesemaking by Karen McAthy. Like me, she prefers kefir and doesn't give you a book that tries to cut corners. She has some techniques on how to make quick cheeses for beginners, but most of it is dedicated to proper cheesemaking. Though there is not many cheeses to make from the book, the book is more of a manual on how to make nut cheese. There are some things I disagree with, but that is personal preference. Overall, she goes beyond merely giving recipes like the other vegan cheese books do. She actually teaches you. I'd also recommend the Art of Fermentation by Sandor Katz. It's the best book how to get into fermenting and culturing. Other than that, buy regular dairy cheese cookbooks. Sure, they are not 100% applicable, but they will teach you some skills that you can use and or modify. Most of what I learned cooking wise come from non-vegan cookbooks.\n\nAnd no I do not sell. Just for my own use. I do a lot of experimental fermenting/culturing, and I'd prefer to keep it a hobby. Making money off a hobby would make the hobby no longer enjoyable.\n\nJust remember, fermenting/culturing is all about experimenting. There will be failures along the way. Like right now, I am trying to find a better culture than coconut kefir since coconut milk is not healthy with it being saturated fat without the intact fiber.",

This is not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nFinally, one thing I find many people don't emphasize enough is the POTENTIAL for their choices. I don't know any of the details on the examples you're giving so indeed sourcesplz but I would say that if humanity starts to devote their attention to producing more vegan things the cost would go down, and also the 'humanity' and 'sustainability' would conceivably go up.
