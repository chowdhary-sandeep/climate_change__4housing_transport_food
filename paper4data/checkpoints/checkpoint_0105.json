"comment": "Unfortunately GM uses the sae+combo fast charging standard which plugshare shows there are only 10 public chargers in the US. And they are all currently limited to 50kW charging which doesn't really provide quick charging of large battery packs.\n\nLet's say GM uses a 50kW battery, that would mean that you would need to charge for over an hour to fill the battery(can't charge at the max rate for the last 20%). So 200 miles of range would let you drive for 2 hours, charge for an hour, drive for 2 hours, charge for an hour, etc. Your 5 hour road trip just became 7 hours. Whereas with a Tesla you can charge at 120kW and dramatically reduce the time needed to charge.",

That makes it roughly $2500 less than the Chevy.   The tesla three is supposed to be competition for the a4 and 3 series.  Does anyone think the bolt will be as nice as an entry level Audi? I don't see how it's even a real contender especially if it costs more than the upcoming model three. \n\nI realize we don't have a production model three to compre to, let alone a concept car.  But elon was emphatic that he wouldn't make a mass market car until it was under $35k and had over 200 mile range so the basics will compete or beat the bolt.  He may not be great with schedules but he delivers as promised otherwise.",

Luxury's not really their thing, but luxury (i.e. expensive) cars are the only way to generate the small-quantity profit margins they need to grow to the point where they can compete in the mass market.\n\nIt's probably a wise move by the likes of Porsche to get serious about competing in the luxury space, since as Tesla shifts its focus to the mass market the high end Model S might get left behind. Already I've heard of some complaints by luxury buyers that the Model S doesn't really have the \"finer touches\" that those buyers are accustomed to - really I think most buy it for the \"cool factor\" of being electric.\n\nSupposing Porsche can at least match Tesla with the drivetrain (by no means a given but certainly doable), it's quite possible they'll be able to outcompete Tesla in other ways. However, the truly big challenge they face is in infrastructure: Tesla has a huge head start with their Superchargers, and the CCS system Porsche has selected is currently a pitiful joke. If Porsche (and others) are serious about making their car competitive with Tesla, they'll need to bring some serious money to the table to build out a new-and-improved DC infrastructure supporting their cars.",

I live this way deliberately to see what it's like to live a comparatively low impact, low emissions lifestyle, gave up my job live off my meagre savings etc   but it's no solution for 7 Billion and growing.\n\nI smile at those suggesting renewables are some sort of drop in alternative for baseload power that can keep things going \"as they are\" and we'll just all drive Teslas.  These will be people who don't live off the grid :) They can provide you with an LED light or two at night but then that's my definition of civilisation.",

I'm salivating over the Tesla 3, but at the same time I want to be fair to the other manufacturers and see if their offerings are worth my time at looking at.  So far, the Ford Focus electric is the only thing that is a blip on my radar because it doesn't look like a kid's toy.  But, the places I frequent I don't typically have the ability to either charge, or leave the car there for four hours to recharge.  The absolute minimum range I can live with is about 150 miles.  That's enough to get me from the house to the nearby cruise ship port, and then to a charger afterwards.  I could technically get a 100mi range car, there's a couple of charge points between here and there, but that means losing about 3-4 hours to get a \"full charge\", which I would prefer not to lose that time.\n\nMostly I am weighing the options and making sure this is the right choice.

The 76 mile range of the Ford Focus is a non-starter IMO; remember that this is measured in ideal conditions, you can expect to get around 20-30% less than that on typical driving. Even fully charged that car has less range than my old Mercedes had when the 'empty' light started blinking..\n\nI'm pretty sure the Model 3 will come with a bigger battery option than the promised minimum 215 miles version, combined with supercharging and the rate that network is extended; there is no competition IMO.\n\nI've been driving an electric car for a while now, and I would not consider a car with less than 200 miles of range, no matter how short my commute was etc. It makes the car pretty much useless for so many things, i.e. you still need an ICE, and driving it is always going to be nerve wrecking..",

Now a lot of folks in the industry are asking them if they know what they are doing(no), so this kind of attack comes out.\nThis attack is not going to end well for Mobileye, because it can be quite easily debunked, and my guess is that it will be debunked, probably by Elon himself. \n\nAlso, the whole thing about \"safety concerns\" is total and utter BS. Tesla's autopilot is already around 50% safer than humans. Even if we just assume it is 10% safer, that would be 120,000 lives saved per year given that 1.2 million people die every year. \n\nThe Mobileye guys know that. The reason why they are flinging shit is because their product is not up to snuff, period. Good riddance. Shit company.",

"comment": "There's really two questions here.\nFirst, I expect Trump to screw up so badly that he doesn't even survive one full term. A huge number of elected Republicans despise him, he's already got the lowest initial approval rating in recent history, and it may not be hard to form a coalition with the Democrats for impeachment as soon as he does something outrageous. However, while Trump has no real policy ambitions, Pence does. So we may get the same changes in federal law/regulations from President Pence as we would from President Trump.\n\nHowever, the next question is really about how much federal changes can hurt the EV market. The bad news is that the $30k price point is a big barrier for a huge number of consumers, and the Bolt and Tesla 3 can only reach that point with the $7,500 federal tax credit in place. So losing that credit in the near future will clearly slow things down. On the other hand, reaching that price point will be much easier in 3-4 years, so it may not be a big pause, and recovery is likely. Other changes, like removal of CAFE targets, will allow the carmakers to put their focus back onto gas vehicles, slowing down the developments of EVs. But CARB won't go away, and foreign sales will still be around, so that impact may be smaller, again just a slowdown of a few years.\n\nLonger term, maybe 10 years out, EVs should start to dominate the market, but they will still be a few years behind where they could have been.",

I’m going full in, electric cars, solar panels, the whole shibang.  Wait, wait, hear me out.  Here the thing, yes, I work for an oil major,  but if you look at the economics it really make sense, even for oil companies.  Here is what will happen,  we won’t be allowed anymore to burn fuel in small cars, so the energy production will be consolidated to power plants.  Some is renewalables of course, but burning natural gas will play a large part.  We might even burn oil here.  We can carbon capture and store it in the ground and make money in this way from the whole carbon tax credit system.  That’s just the small bit.  The real win for oil companies is the loss of energy through wire lines. It just naturally takes more energy to transmit, so we will still need fossil fuels.  So, my job is not at risk, it never was.  We all get cleaner air, which is great.  So I’m here with,  “If you can beat them, join them” I mean, honestly, this is the most sad subreddit ever.  Like, 21 people are here now.  We are losing.  So anyway, pretty soon the data will be irrefutable, a new group of scientists will be raised up to kill the AGW story.  I want to be the one to say,  “I told you so.” But I’m just giving up.  The best way to influence opinion is to let other people think it was their idea.  Harvard don’t let me down!",

"comment": "I drive a 2010 Renault Twingo II in Germany. The fuel usage for it is my own personal realworld driving result. The fuel price has been oscillating around this value for the past one and a half years.\n\nI don't drive an EV (yet), but lets take one of the best and worst performing EVs each, for comparison's sake. Using EPA ratings because honestly those are by far the easiest to look up, even for Europeans. The electricity price is what my family currently pays, on the bottomline (the utility company quotes less per kWh but adds various extra charges on the side). We do not have rooftop solar.\n\nTwingo II:\n\n* 5.4 liters/100 km at 1.30€/liter = 7,02€/100km\n\nTesla Model X P90D:\n\n* 24.0 kWh/100km at 0.27€/kWh = 6,48€/100km\n\nHyundai IONIQ Electric:\n\n* 15.7 kWh/100km at 0.27€/kWh = 4,24€/100km\n\nMy yearly driving distance is about 16,000km. So - with the disclaimer that the EV figures use EPA ratings, not realworld numbers - depending on which electric car I bought, I could save between ~86€ and ~445€ per year. Additionally, I would save vehicle tax, which EVs don't have to pay.\n\nThe problem with that? My Twingo cost me 6,150€ when I bought it used in 2011, at six months old with 7,000km on the clock (in other words, practically new). It costs only 24€ in tax per year because it is so frugal. And given its low value, insurance is dirt cheap, too. Meanwhile, the cheapest locally available EV I would feel comfortable with, a Zoe ZE 40, starts at 27,200€ after subsidies, and is significantly more costly to insure. You can probably see the reason why I am not driving an EV right now. ;)\n\nBut I'll get there, eventually. Sometime between 2020 and 2022 looks like a good point to retire my current car.",

I checked the Model S and Model 3 owners manuals, and Tesla recommends coolant changes after 8 years/100k miles and 4 years/50k miles respectively. \n\nI checked the coolant replacement schedule for other vehicles, and BMW recommends every 10k miles for the M3. Honda recommends every 40k miles for the Accord. Based on this it seems like Tesla is somewhere between 2x to 10x less coolant changes than a gas car. Am I missing anything obvious?\n\nEdit: see below, my conclusion was not quite right.",

But it will require much more work, and supports by users, manufucturers, resellers to convince EU. We hope other users unions in other countries are interested too, but not many signs for the moment. You'll need to organize users groups in each country to push it ;)",

I think exterior is better than the 3 and Y too...For me, Its not about the specs, its about living with it everyday for 10 years and personal preference. \n\nAlso, I don't know why but all the Tesla owners Ive met in person have been kind of dickish with a chip on their shoulder...

That way a model 3 is quite desirable.\nWould many buy a model Y LR at 65k€ over an ID.4/Enyaq costing 50k and qualifying for more subsidies because of the charging network- rather no, its for power / tech or whatever.

We could quite possibly end up needing charging stations, cables, and connectors that transfer cooling liquid to meet / surpass ICE speeds. We don’t know yet because nobody’s doing it in real world situations.\n\nI’m confident, though, that if we regulate Tesla to use what seems like is reasonable today, it’ll guarantee they focus resources on other areas, and ensure ICE vehicles stick around decades longer because we stepped in too early and mandated the use of dial up before broadband had a chance.\n\nRight now, they have every incentive to improve what they can until it’s the ICE cars that are slower to fill up. Let’s keep it that way so EVs end up on top.",

"comment": "Doesn't matter what they're counting, they're extremely wrong.  Thus, \"no.\"\n\nZEV credits are not worth that much per vehicle, more like $1,300 (139mil regulatory revenue for Tesla in the last quarter on 100k cars), and these have nothing to do with taxpayers.  The money from ZEV credits comes from other manufacturers buying them from Tesla.  It is not taxpayer money.  The link you just posted is also not taxpayer money, that's Fiat's money.  And that's in Europe, not in the US, and this conversation is about the US.\n\nBesides Tesla doesn't get 7500 per vehicle fed, they get zero as of this month.  And that's a tax credit, not a cash rebate, and not all buyers qualify for the full thing (in fact a surprising number don't file for these credits).  The state credits are generally rebates and happen only in some states.  California's is $2,000 now, not $2,500.\n\nEven if Tesla still did still get 7500 per vehicle fed, the number would still be off by more than double.\n\nMeanwhile, gas cars get way more subsidy over the lifetime of the vehicle due to ignored environmental and health costs.  Electric cars are *less* subsidized than gas cars are when these are taken into account, as they should be, and as [every economist says they should be](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2011/09/19/do-economists-all-favour-a-carbon-tax).",

Those massive BEVs like a model X, Li One, NIO ES9 etc have giant batteries take up a lot of space and are filled with luxury features all of which is eating up a lot of resources. For people who live in either inner cities or rural areas where no highway driving is required, a tiny car like the Hongguang that don't need a lot of space to park, can be easily charged by household outlet, and still gets you 70 to 100 miles of range on a relatively tiny battery makes so much more sense.\n\nIf hundreds of millions of new drivers in China want to get a car, we better hope it is mostly small EVs like the Hongguang, or else the environment will be in big trouble.",

And if the recycling of batteries adds more new batteries to the supply chain then there would have been we should be doing that anyway at least in the short term.    Putting an EV on the road is mostly about removing the higher operational emissions of ICE vehicles.   So if we could increase the number we can make by recycling it might be reasonable to take the extra hit on the recycling to get less operational emissions.    EVs already have a higher manufacturing footprint then an ICE vehicle.   So this will eat into the lifetime emissions number a bit but likely would be much better then that person buying an ICE instead because there are not enough BEVs to purchase.",

The cost component of gross margins includes a lot of fixed expenses like facilities, tooling, robots, etc.  I believe some R&amp;D gets lumped into that, but I haven't dug into the details of Ford's accounting.  \n\nIf you have an assembly line that is eventually capable of building 500k vehicles per year, but only building 50k per year, you end up with about 10x the overhead allocated to each vehicle.  This is exactly the problem Rivian is having now.\n\nTesla isn't a good comparison point.  In the early days of Tesla, they excluded a lot of expenses from gross margin (like R&amp;D) that other car makers include.  I believe they've since updating accounting policy to make it more comparable.  But the early years of Tesla margins are not meaningfully comparable to other car makers.\n\nSource: I work in finance/accounting and hate doing cost accounting.",

And also has an 8 year warranty.\n\nMy dad's ev is 7 years old, and has lost about 8% of it's capacity. So not exactly close to the 30% loss needed to trigger a warranty claim on year 8.\n\nI'm not worried about my battery. If it only lasts the 1k cycles that lithium batteries get with 0-100% cycles and bad temp management it's still going to last 350k km, which is more than the average ice car. And since i'm mostly doing like 50-80% cycles with my normal driving it's more likely to just straight up last longer than the frame of the car which will rust in about 20 years because that's what happens to cars used in coastal areas with snow.\n\nEdit: what's up with going through a 7 month old thread posting inflammatory questions that show clearly you have no insight in how EVs work? Just baiting downvotes or something? 😅",

"comment": "There is probably no greater democratising invention than the car. It goes a long way to explain the hatred of certain section of the middle classes to it. The car enables travel by the working class, a section of society that can’t afford the luxuries of the train and connecting taxis.\n\nI have leafletted at various trade union and labour events and posted many times on social media that the climate delusion will make attacks-of-the-past on working class people – the Miners’ Strike and the Poll Tax – seem like small beer. \n\n&gt;This time they are coming for your Sunday dinner, your holiday abroad, your freedom of movement and your family car.\n\nMost people regarded this as hyperbolic or thought I have bought into conspiracy theories about the WEF (World Economic Forum).\n\nBut conspiracy is unnecessary when there is a common belief, lack of scientific understanding, political naiveite, improperly thought through and rushed legislation, irrational prejudices, and distain for ordinary people. All of these are demonstrably evident in the UK’s Establishment.\n\nAcross the country with very little coverage and no analysis in the press, there is a huge anti-car movement growing. Nearly every major city and region has stealthily implemented, or plans to implement, restrictions on car and van use. \n\nThese attacks are variously the implementation of LTNs (Low Traffic Neighbourhoods), CAZs (Clear Air Zones), ZEZs (Zero Emission Zone) and ULEZs (Ultra Low Emission Zone) together with decreased road space for cars and vastly underused cycling lanes.",

"comment": "I think people are just trying to figure out what they need. \n\nI had to bring my daughter to school when she missed the bus last week. The car was not preheated. My 2018 Tesla model 3 was showing 600+ wh/mi, mostly due to heating the car and battery. I can take a road through town to the school (technically the shortest route) or the expressway over 1 exit to get to the other side of town where her school is. On the way there I was going 40 across town and traffic was nuts. On the way back I decided to take the expressway. It’s only 1.5 miles. My wh/mi dropped considerably because I was covering more distance and your heating loads don’t change as much compared to your speed increase. \n\nBottom line, is folks don’t understand fully how the different conditions affect the operational range of the battery. At 600+ wh/mi that’s a significant reduction in distance, but that’s only for those peak heatups and it’s more a restriction on operating time than distance. Once I got up to speed the wh/mi was accurate for distance. \n\nHow do we break this down for the average consumer? Also if you have access to a home charger and can pre-heat the car, you get some substantial improvements on distance because you aren’t heating the car with the battery. \n\nI don’t know the answer.",

This is true of other EVs that are efficient or have big batteries.  Adding the 65% to 80% takes Tesla's average charging speed from 180kW average to 160kW average.  It should be the average charge rate to add 180 miles of range or something.  That would take into account the efficiency and a reasonable number of miles given that the Ioniq5 from 10% to 80% only adds 160 miles of range.",

But I do think that in 5 years we'll have the technology to create an EV semi that can pull 80k lbs 500 miles a day without much issue.  We're already 80% of the way there.  Just a couple percent improvement each year for 5 years will close the gap.\n\n> Every ton battery is a ton of lost cargo.\n\nNope.  EV semis have an increased weight limit -- so you get some of that back.  But also batteries are going to get more energy dense / lighter per kWh so this will trend off / down some.\n\n> There are many better uses for our constrained battery supplies.\n\nWe have over 300 battery factories \\*in build\\* now that will supply over 6TWh a year of \\*extra\\* battery supplies.  In 2022 we were at 700GWh.  Yea, some of those battery plants won't be realized, but other new ones are still being planned.  We're going to have 10x the yearly battery supplies than we currently have in under 5 years.  That's dramatically going to change the calculus here.  People don't understand latency -- supply lags demand spikes.  We're going to be in a different place once the supply catches up to the demand spike.  We have enough minerals and everything secured; it's just building up the industry.",

That should always be the top priority of a comprehensive energy plan, as you don't have to build, install, or fuel anything to generate energy that you don't wind up using.\n\nBut I am curious about your motivation for posting that here. It seems like you are trying to poo-poo the idea of using solar power to generate electricity. Bear in mind that even once every light bulb is a LED, there will still need to be electricity generated. LEDs do consume some energy. So do refrigerators, air conditioners, TVs, computers, fans, electric cars, stoves, etc. I, and I would guess most people here went to high efficiency lighting years ago. That is the low hanging fruit and it absolutely should be done. But the point of this sub is to promote the use of solar power for generating the electricity that will need to be generated, to the greatest extent possible.

"comment": "Thanks for info.  I ran some numbers on my system (which is pretty typical 5.8 kw).  Last year I fed 5,000 kwh back to the grid. If I assume I got credited an average of $0.20/kwh, that's $1,000 credit I got last year, or about $85/month, half of which would be $42/month.  Add to that the $10/month fee and looking at about an extra $40-60/month for my system.  Plus the solar tax credit ends, which would be the equivalent of about $90/month assuming 15 year financing @7%.\n\nAdd it up and the cost for my system is going from $225/month to somewhere around $375/month.  In terms of ROI, that would extend the ROI period from 6-8 years to 13-15 years.  Ouch.\n\nAnd that's assuming installation cost stays the same, but install costs could easily go up if the solar installers go out of business and there is less competition.\n\nI have a feeling the utilities are going to figure out a way to keep battery systems too expensive to compete.  For example, to use battery, you'd have to go on TOU billing correct?  But TOU billing could easily end up costing more than the battery saves if the person isn't willing to shift most of their electricity use to late at night.  I'm not even sure TOU billing will make sense for solar owners after all these changes kick into effect.",

"comment": "They should be ashamed telling them such bullshit. Climate change can be solved and life (high consumption) can more or less continue with low density alt energies that cannot be created (mined, transported, manufactured and installed) without fossil fuels? It's simply a matter of political will? Ya, physics doesn't count. The pin on the AGW grenade has been pulled and it will go off no matter what. \n\nSolar is at a whopping 1% of global electricity generation after 40 years or so. Is there any mining for the needed raw materials that is done with non carbon solutions? Nope, all diesel. How much heavy transport is solar? Every manufactured piece of hardware and/or all raw materials from overseas are delivered via bunker fuel – the dirtiest on the planet, then there are diesel powered trains and tractors. How much manufacturing is solar? Do solar panels, the accompanying hardware and the workers get transported to the site in electric vehicles?\nHow can something that cannot be produced without fossil fuels be called a solution to fossil fuels? Maybe for a shrinking portion of privileged westerners and only for some of their residential electricity demands. Certainly not for any of the electrical energy embedded in their never ending piles of consumer crap. Then there is the fact that all this tech generates a waste stream that is an environmental holocaust all of it’s own. Attempting to replace massive amounts of infrastructure with low energy density solar and wind will continue to destroy more habitat and speed up the 6th mass extinction. There is no such thing as a green, eco friendly industrial consumer civilization. Prue fantasy. Pure fucking horseshit. This was written by and for people who wish to retain their status and privilege and do not care about the truth. Use anyone.",

You say your roof is tall but how big is your system? What does it produce in a few good days when it would normally be covered during the winter season? If you're not returning your time invested let alone the cost to make this type of thing then to me its not worth the time. Nor is it likely worth the risk of falling or other bad outcomes...ie: hotter panels in the summer which means less production. \n\nI have looked and thought of ideas for this exact purpose but after much thought I just came to the realization that its not worth the money or time investment to do this. Just wait and let them melt. \n\nHopefully you have a MLPE solution too (SolarEdge or Enphase or other microinverter). That will help you make what you can from what panels are clear vs. Nothing or near nothing in a standard string inverter",

"comment": "Is this article serious? Their whole thesis is that solar is not growing exponentially, yet the first sentence of the Wikipedia \"Growth of Photovoltaics\" article is [\"Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has been fitting an exponential curve for more than two decades.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics)\n\nIt is easy to see why solar grows exponentially. Just as an example, consider a company that builds the machines that make the panels. If every year this company builds one solar panel machine, and if every year that machine can produce 1000 panels, then the total number of solar panels manufactured will be exponential in time. \n\nYear 1: 1st machine\n\nYear 2: 2nd machine + 1000 panels from the 1st machine\n\nYear 3: 3rd machine + 1000 panels from the 1st machine + 1000 panels from the 2nd machine\n\nYear 4: 4th machine + 1000 panels from the 1st machine + 1000 panels from the 2nd machine + 1000 panels from the 3rd machine\n\netc..\n\nTo be more precise, the function that describes the total number of panels manufactured is the integral of the function that describes the total number of machines. Since the total number of machines manufactured is linear, one per year, and the integral of a linear function is exponential, then so is the total number of panels. A fancy way of saying the rate of change of the total number of panels is proportional to the number of machines. Put another way the rate of accumulation of panels is increasing.\n\nI suspect it is even better than this. The number of machines built per year and the number of panels built per machine per year are themselves increasing. So now we must take the integral of an exponential function, which has an even larger exponent. Great news for solar!",

"comment": "Every solar array is going to be retrofitted with batteries in a few years time. The good news is that battery prices are about to drop off a cliff - like solar in 2010. I'd like to think these demand charges are going to hilariously backfire on the utility, allowing the array to save the owner during the day and at night too. \n\nIt's the meter fees that are the killers. Come on! Digitally administering a demand charge or bi-directional meter surely costs less than physically reading an analog meter one by one? So why a 100% increase in meter fees?\n\nA few years ago utilities told us that above-retail solar raises electricity prices. Now they tell us retail solar raises electricity prices. Soon they'll tell us that below-retail solar raised electricity prices? What about policies which optimize value for the greatest public benefit? What about supply/demand fundamentals?\n\nThe utility market is shrinking and regulated utilities are the most at risk. They need to adapt, not obstruct. Big Tobacco was allowed to continue operating when it turned out they were selling cancer sticks, but constraints were put into place. Likewise, carbon polluters shouldn't be forced out of business, but should rightly take their lumps of the head! Net-metering policies or value-of-solar equivalents are to the benefit of public health and environmental safety!",

Still, its a good \"first time setup\" and in a few years when it comes time to replace the batteries, there will be better options.\n\nYou don't want the batteries to freeze. But you should be able to bring in a floor heater and have it run on a time during the day. Keeping the batteries topped up and heated will be fine. FLA can go below freezing if charged.\n\nDon't worry about scalability. You can always do more later with new components. Just keep things cost-effective for now. Purchase ~3 solar panels from your local installer to reduce price. Local residential installers should have \"extras\" from pallet orders which will keep things cheap.",

"comment": "Yes, I did my own battery storage work with the 12vdc Sealed Lead Acid type of battery.   I have 400 AH worth of storage, but those seem inflated numbers.  In reality you would not run your batteries that low (I read 11.8v) to avoid damaging them.  I don't like seeing mine below 12V, so a rough guess is that i actually have 200AH\n\nI use a Schnieder/Xantrex charge controller between my panels and my batteries.  Like you, I have an electrical background.  Everything is well protected with fuses, disconnects.  I used the automotive blade type ATC fuses.  \nI have grid power, it's pretty reliable where I live.  But I get upset when it goes out.  Now that I have 12vdc  I've been retrofitting my lighting systems to 12volt LED lighting.  Also retired my old PC for a laptop that runs from an automotive 12v adaptor.  Still working on my setup, but love it so far.  I have dropped my power bill for sure, and no more blackouts (got the DSL modem running on 12V too.)\nI have not run too low on power yet, but December was very cloudy and I ran the battery charger a bit.  (I read to top off the batteries every two weeks, so I do that.)\n\nhope that helps a bit!",

You'll want to run heavy loads whenever electricity is the cheapest, probably at night. It doesn't matter too much if you run appliances at the same time as when you are generating electricity. There are some nuances with SCE's NEM 2.0 rules, but overall you'll save the most money by watching your energy usage and not running pumps and AC during the peak hours.",

"comment": "Check out what programs the electrical service provider offers.\n\nHere in Austin, they use VOST, Value of Solar Tariff.  They purchase the power from you at a set rate, $0.097/kwh, and apply it to your bill.  Any overage gets added to the next bill.  If they use this system you find the total cost of electricity for the year, and build a system that produces that much worth of electricity at a $.097/kwh rate.  For example, if they used $200 worth of electricity annually, they would build a system that produced 2062kwh a year to compensate for this.\n\nIn nearby Bluebonnet Electrical, they use straight net-metering with a tru-up every October.  That means they measure the amount of electricity produced throughout the month, and subtract it from the amount of electricity used.  Any excess is simply rolled over to the next month, in a straight 1-for-1 kwh trade.  Every October, any excess is purchased by the electric company at current ERCOT wholesale rates.  To use this system on your parent's house, you calculate the total annual amount of kwh needed, and build a system to match that.\n\nJust north of Austin, in Pedernales Co-op territory, they use net-metering and buyback.  PEC measures the amount of electricity produced vs the amount of electricity used and you pay the difference or they buy the excess from you at wholesale rates.  Currently, PEC costs $.0992/kwh, and they buy back the electricity at $0.465/kwh.  Because Texas is so hot, most of the electrical usage is during the summer.  Fortunately, this is when the most solar power is harvested too.  In order to capitalize on this, I design my systems to cover about 80-85% of the annual usage.  This maximizes the amount of \"retail\" cost avoidance in the system, and minimizes the amount of \"wholesale\" buyback.\n\nLook up the net-metering policy for the electrical company they are using, this will help you decide both if solar is useful and how to design your system.",

It is however a heck of a workout. Also the permits are so dull. I'm surprised no one has put together an automatic opensource print creation tool yet. But you can use FreeCad to do it yourself. Once you got a print, your neighbor can copy the same print, change a few things and have a system installed too. It's not like suddenly all the calculations are off because you moved 50 feet west.",

That is called cheating.\n\nIt is also in my mind,  rather than doing things that are logical and reasoned out. \n\nAll of the solutions are a  No Nuke placard waving , vegan announcing, bicycle riding, PETA donating, hippy's wet dream. \n\nThat again is not statistically or scientifically possible.\n\nEven when it goes against the narrative *Super storms and increased tornadoes, unpredictable weather !!* \n\nSo we have to spend billions subsidizing windmills and solar panels that are easily damaged in all the things I just told you **And NOT** the Nuclear power plant that has 6 foot concrete and steel re-enforced walls that can survive locomotives thrown at it .",

I recommend to tesla with actual their measurements.",

"comment": "Unless you have regular power outages or your utility pays horrible rates for solar energy added to the grid home battery systems don't pay for themselves. An EV can save quite a bit more in reduced fuel costs. \n\nUnfortunately not many EVs are setup to provide much power output. Using a simple inverter I can only use 150watts from my Tesla's 12V outlet. If I wired up a more powerful inverter directly to the 12V system I could pull as much as 2kW maximum which would be enough to run a refrigerator and a few other small appliances.\n\nRivian, HummerEV and Cybertruck should be able to provide both 120V and 240V power output which should make them much more useful in emergencies, but still not as easy/foolproof as a home battery system.",

"comment": "You don't say where in the Bay area you are. As most people who live here know, there are lots of microclimates. Far east bay or north bay, like discovery bay or around those parts, summer is really hot and ac is run frequently. Closer to the bay or peninsula, won't need to run ac very much. From personal experience, ac is the electricity hog. If you aren't going to run it often, a smaller system might be ok. \n\nAnother consideration would be if you think you will be getting an EV, pool or hot tub soon. All requires a lot of electricity. Then this system is way undersized. \n\nLook at your current electricity bills and estimate it out for 12 months, but taking into account new house might be bigger but better insulated. Then increase it a bit based on the parameters above. \n\nAs you'll see, nothing is exact. If you will have PGE as your utility, you don't want to oversize too much , as you don't get much (.03/kwh) for feeding the grid after net metering.",

You have picked up an argumentation style that reaches for hyperbole and paints everything as extreme.  This is something I urge you to calm and find a way to think more sensibly. You have made many mistakes here and it does not help anyone, lest of all you.\n\n&gt;They note that \"a liot of things will die\" but we will survive, which is not only an understatement, but outright evil, since billion will die, but it's mostly the poor south, at first. They somehow conclude that a 3C hotter world will be still fine and habitable, that's a lie, nothing more.\n\nAt 2:30 of the Kurzgesagts states that ecosystems will collapse and there will be widespread famine. Your statement is wrong that this is their opinion.\n\nThey say exactly your fair point about warming being bad.\n\n&gt;Anything short of degrowth, deglobalization and back to local is a scam.\n\nI think you should go and take a look at the scenarios given by the IPCC.\n\nThey also say that we need to consume less, shop locally, and make improvements of that direction.\n\n&gt;Kurzgesagts video essentially promotes climate apocalypse\n\nAre we watching the same video? They are directly attributing the modern economy as causing this. That's hardly a flattering light or something out of the denialism playbook. The closest that the video comes is embracing carbon capture, but the video is pretty steadfast in saying that there are some improvements, which is true (although we need more).\n\nI'm worried that your need to paint everything as binary is forcing you to assume that you can not see nuance. I'm not happy with everything in this video, but the viciousness of your critiques is better saved for pure climate denialists, not someone trying to reach people. I fear that your harshness is no better than an iron fisted eco-fascist. Just change out the issue. And I'll tell you something: the people who want hte status quo want a war and want extremists on the pro-clean energy side so that they can use the arguments against use that we use against them. They'll try this anyway, but you are making it real easy for them.  This is the same sort of thing that white supremacists love. Moderates and action are their biggest enemies, not some equally opposing force. They know that getting a lot of people like you make it easier for them to erode support for the position that you supposedly care about.\n\n&gt;'do nothing' just built some solar panels and windmills and we will be fine\n\nThis is hardly doing nothing. See the IPCC report on this.\n\n&gt;The whole video is like anti climate action propaganda.\n\nBy discounting good things that can be done, I might venture that your extreme critique here is doing more of that...\n\n&gt;At the end of the video(min. 53), \n\nI watched this video: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxgMdjyw8uw&amp;t=1s\n\nIt's 16 minutes. Are we talking about the same video? Is there another channel named Kurzgesagt out there that I should have watched?\n\n&gt;they admit they got money from bill gates.\n\nWho's paying you? Or is this just a controversial take for attention? Either way, I felt the need to say something.",

"comment": "That article is pretty spot on. Your lender is wrong. The UCC-1 is not a lien. It is a notification of something that might be a lien. So it puts your potential lender on notice to check into if there is a lien. Which would checking the loan documents. \n\nExample, I could file a UCC-1 right now on my neighbor's house or your house if you gave me your address. Or I could just go through the phone book and start filing UCCs. (This would all be illegal, but let's set that aside because none of these people have authorized me to file UCCs against them.) The Secretary of State administrators that record the UCC is certainly not going to check if there is a lien. Would I now have a lien on my neighbor's house or your house? Nope. Filing a UCC doesn't create a lien. The loan document creates the lien, you in fact grant the lien somewhere in the documents. I'm sure your loan documents say that the lien is only on the solar equipment. But if it says something different, then you've got an issue with the solar installer and their lender. \n\nThe collateral description in the UCC could be written correctly (making it clear that the only lien that exists under the loan documents is a lien on the solar equipment) or it could be written incorrectly or just sloppy and broad. You could get your lender to file a clearer amendment to the UCC. But your real problem is probably the lender and the clearest UCC in the world might not get her over this issue. \n\nSide note: that is an enormous solar project for a residential home! Good lord. I can imagine that the loan against it is pretty big.",

Almost every comment ITT misses the points Elon and the world [should] care about most. \n\nElon wanted to make battery manufacturing mimic can/bottling lines and it's gotten impressively close while reducing warehouse footprint needs, raw materials, wastewater and a bunch of other boring but critical cost metrics for reaching global scale electrification capacity. \n\nSolar adoption is driving battery storage as much as the auto industry if not more, additionally.\n\nIt's all about manufacturing. The engineering benefits at the vehicle performance level are just icing on the cake. 4680 is what allowed the giga castings to be possible which is insanely huge to manufacturing efficiency, safety and reliability.\n\nWith the ability to now make the battery floor structural, the front and rear castings simply bolt to each end of the battery floor like a LeMans prototype as three main structural part chassis. It's insane. Seen it in person at GigaTX for the 2022 shareholders meeting in August.\n\n4680 manufacturing line teaser: https://youtu.be/zB8_HbrxUi8",

"comment": "I've put up solar panels, installed a heat pump, which is used significantly more than the high efficiency boiler installed.  I replaced my ten year old vehicle with a phev, and bought a Leaf, which have run pretty much 100% on solar as does my entire house.  We added a crap ton of new insulation to our house and more efficient windows where needed.   For health and sustainable reasons, I've committed to a vegan-lite lifestyle.  And I take public transportation when practical.  I've also planted probably 50 to 75 shrubs and trees.  But then people say I'm grandstanding and rolling in money (even though we took out loans to make a number of these changes...essentially trading bill payments for solar panel payments).\n\nI also travel,  which probably ruins these efforts, but I'm trying.  I'm never going to live in a cave licking moss off the walls.   I doubt highly you could convince people to turn back the technological clock.  We need to research solutions that are practical enough that people will be willing and able to adopt them.  \n\nThe all or none argument is tone deaf.  If we really want to 100% put the fire out,  we should all just drown ourselves in the ocean as the mere fact of being born is worth a couple of gallons of kerosene.  Is that a 100% solution palatable to you?",

The electric providers are the ultimate regulatory issue here in many places as they can deny your solar approval. I guess they feel they would end up owing you money under the net metering scheme. Regardless, I have a friend who powers his home and two Teslas from a solar array who indicated it paid off in less than five years and was one the best decision of his life, so go for it.",

The support is appalling especially first line tech support. Completely useless. The chat people are wildly undertrained and follow cookie cutter scripts. Example: I had a failing inverter that your team tried to blame on SCE so I took it to SolarEdge directly who finally levered you guys to come replace it. \n\n2. Then theres the lies. Example: \"noone asks for direct SolarEdge app access and we dont know how to do it\" - which btw everyone wants bc your app is so bad and its usually provisioned quite easily with a call escalated to 2nd level support. \n\n3. You guys put us on a month to month plan with SCE instead of annual. Wtf?? And why recommend tou-d-prime when its the worst for NEM credits?\n\n4. We asked to spec the system for EV charging. Except we have found theres not remotely enough capacity for EV charging...Id need to fill the roof with panels for that. \n\nAnd you wonder why people are frustrated...you should be trying to make your customers your advocates and fans which you are actively getting in the way of. You make it harder than it needs to be. Be part of the solution, not the problem. \n\nWhen it comes battery time, you will be the last company I will call.",

Make sure you look up that limit, because you do **NOT** want to switch over to net metering 3.0. \n\nDo the math vs a battery for your circumstances but in my case, adding extra solar capacity to cover your additional usage was much cheaper than getting a battery.

Also sometimes other things bird's acidic poops. The panels will last for at least 10 years before they start having short outs on them. But the wiring, aheshive, nuts, bolts, and mico inverters will have problems before the 10th year. It is just nature doing it's things. So that is why both the warranty and the insurance are are necessary. Because each visit by someone from a solar installer company that does not own your warranty could cost you up to $1000 per visit. Also, often time an installer company would not touch a system that was installed by other installer companys. Because they will have to pay for any damages done on the panels to the original installer company or worse they will have to assume the warranty payouts.",

"comment": "Building a Sustainable Future with Solar and Hydrogen\n\n1. Urgent Action Needed Climate Crisis: Our reliance on fossil fuels is driving climate change and environmental degradation. Immediate action is crucial to shift to cleaner energy sources.\n\n2. Why Focus on Solar and Hydrogen? Solar Potential: Deserts like the Sahara have enormous solar energy potential. Utilizing this can provide a clean, abundant energy source.Hydrogen Benefits: Hydrogen, produced from solar power, can serve as a clean fuel, especially for sectors hard to electrify, and has the potential to transform global energy systems.\n\n3. Ensuring Equity and Public Good \nGlobal Public Good: It is essential that this energy project remains a global public good. It should serve all people equitably, ensuring that the benefits are widely distributed and not controlled by private interests. Avoiding Privatization: To prevent failure and ensure the project's success, it must stay out of private hands. Maintaining public ownership will help avoid issues of inequity and prioritize the common good.\n\n4. Benefits and Potential Economic and Social Impact: \nSuch a project could stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and support sustainable development, particularly in developing regions like Africa. \n\nSocioecological Flourishing: Done right, this initiative could be the foundation for a truly sustainable socioecological system, reducing poverty and inequity and allowing humanity to thrive.\n\n5. Technological and Infrastructure Considerations Automated Systems: As technology advances, much of the production and infrastructure can be automated, improving efficiency and reducing costs.\n\n6. Call to Global Action Citizen Advocacy: Global citizens must advocate for political support and ensure this project remains a public good. Your involvement is crucial in driving the necessary changes.\n\n7. A Vision for the FutureSustainable and Equitable Growth: This initiative has the potential to lay the groundwork for a more equitable and sustainable future. It can help create a foundation where everyone benefits, and our planet is protected. \n\nLet’s unite in pushing for a solar and hydrogen future that remains a global public good. With collective action and commitment, we can build a foundation for a just, sustainable, and flourishing world for all.",

"comment": "You will need a motorized mirror set up to track the reflected sun onto your entrance point. I suppose you could set it up with its own solar power, just enough to run the tracking system. Very SciFi fantasy world stuff. I like to visualize a tracking system using focused sun onto actuators, either Nitinol or pisons. SiFy. \n\nUofM campus has a light tube for getting sunlight into an underground building. I do not know if it is still running. Far beyond what a single home could do, too. Back to SciFi, you could make a thing like that, a giant light pipe 5 meters in diameter, with solar lining it at the bottom. \n\nI have seen pictures of folk in apartments with no direct sun having reflectors set outside to catch a bit of sunlight. \n\nYou could get like, a few dozen large mirrors, and each one in turn, as the sun tracks across the sky, reflects a square meter of light to your window. You would have to venture out each week to adjust them for the season. Or, hiding in your bunker with no electric cables going outside, have some ropes or something to pull on to adjust them. \n\nWell, it has been fun. Enjoy the sun.",

"comment": "I had SunRun come by our place after we moved in and they tried to sell the PPA deal like you have there. The whole \"power rates will go up exponentially soon, but you are guaranteed to not exceed with us..\" was the schtick too. I looked here on Reddit, just like you haha. I found out a few things, I believe these are true.. \n\n1. They are allowed to use the battery as they please, they will sell it back to the grid whenever they want, not up to you to control. \n2. Their clause allows them to up the rates x% each year, or month.. whatever it is, with a cap on it, regardless of if the power company actually raises theirs. \n3. They are essentially selling you the lowest rate from the power company , so you cannot ever gain the maximum value out of solar. \n4. The deal may or may not be attractive for future buyers of the home. You may be asked to outright buy the contract, as a new buyer may not want to take that on. \n5. The buyout price for the system far exceeded anyone else's quote. It was something like $40,000.. for a maybe a 4,000 Watt system \n\nTo give you some ideas of other quotes\n\n1. Tesla was by far the best priced\n2. Local installers were 60% - 80% less (for the buyout price vs just leasing it) \n\nWhat I decided to do because I'm a DIY type of person who is fine sweating like a pig to do the work, It's like a workout for me. \n\n1. Self-install an Enphase system. For a 3200 watt ground-mount (4000 watts in panels) + a single 5kWh battery, my system will cost $7,500 - $8,000 for all materials because I shop around for parts. After tax incentives, more like $5,500 plus or minus a few. My ROI is 2-3 years. My ROI bar chart looked the best! And I am not dependent on a solar company who may be out of business next year in case there are issues.\n2. If you can't DIY, perhaps a Tesla system is worth looking into with their PowerWall 3.",

"comment": "There are certain periods of the time where a combination of cold weather, regional and local albedo an excellent solar irradiance just come together to produce high volumes of energy.  When solar panels are cold not only are they more efficient overall but they actually have increased sensitivity to the light that's hitting them in the first place, so they can produce the same or higher electrical output in lower light levels.\n\n\nThe highest period of output that I've *ever* personally experienced was during a clear and very cold February morning where there was a huge but light area haze of fog covering everything for the first few hundred feet above the ground.  The sky above was otherwise sharp and clear, but the filtered direct sunlight in addition to the massive area of light being diffused everywhere around my panels was sufficient to bring the panels production up to 120% of their normall production.  This lasted for about 3 hours until the fog cleared.\n\n\n\nI've never had perfect conditions line up like that since, and I can only wonder what kind of output I would have received on bifacial panels.",

"comment": "I don't think the answer is as simple as eating alkaline or acidic foods as being vegan your intake should be fairly balanced in this respect. \n\n\nYou first have to discover whether your body is producing too much or too little digestive acids when you eat as both scenarios can produce similar outcomes. Obviously if your body produces too much acid you will get reflux, heartburn etc but on the flipside if it isn't producing enough, your food can start to ferment in your stomach from not digesting properly and produce a fairly similar result.\n\n\nHow to tell? Eat a food that produces the acid symptom you speak of and drink half a glass of apple cider vinegar straight after. If it makes the situation worse, you have to much acid but if it calms your stomach right down then you aren't producing enough.\n\n\nToo much acid - Try taking the following in capsule form (not pill) just before your meal ... licorice root, slippery elm, marshmallow root or even lemon juice. \nToo little acid - Take digestive enzymes or herbal capsules containing ginger, gentian root or Paul D'arco to assist with acid production. \n\n\nI've personally tried the above methods and recommended them to others with fairly positive results. I urge you to do your own research before taking my word for it.",

In addition, the fact that the author still thinks vegans can't get all their amino acids is laughable. Also, he cites another dentist...and the link goes to another page on the website. WTF?\n\nGeez, this guy isn't even a dentist. Look at his credentials. \n\n&gt;Nagel has a BA from the University of California and has ten years of training in emotional health care. Nagel is a member of the Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation and the Weston A.

"comment": "I've been with an omnivore for three years and I really haven't had much of a problem, although I have to admit that I am only with an omnivore because I became vegetarian soon after we had started dating, and that eventually progressed into veganism. If I became single and was looking for a partner, I would definitely be looking for a vegan/vegetarian. \n\nMy boyfriend is very respectful and accepting of my eating habits. He has agreed to go vegetarian once we move in together when we are older, of his own choice. I must admit, though, if he did not alter his eating habits by a certain point, I would most likely leave him. He is vegan/vegetarian a lot of the time, because we go to vegan restaurants when we eat out, and I only cook vegan food. \n\nSometimes I feel conflicted about dating an omnivore because the longer I am vegan, the more passionate about it I become. But I never feel so conflicted that it makes my relationship awkward or uncomfortable. He is very considerate and hardly ever eats meat in front of me. As long as your non-vegan boyfriend not only respects but has some understanding of your veganism, I don't think that you will have a problem.",

"comment": "Efmac pretty much hit the nail on the head. But as someone who has had to put on weight in the past, may I also suggest that the method of ingestion helps a lot. For instance, a PB sandwich can give you ~400 calories depending on bread and amount of PB. But I find PB sandwiches to be filling and take awhile to eat. Instead, maybe try shakes. A shake made of PB, vegan milk, and oats can also be ~400 calories and I find it much easier to get down. I also have heard some people over in /r/fitness talk about adding just pure olive oil to shakes to up the calories but I'm not sure how healthy that is, but I guess it's something to ask a doctor about. \n\nWell wishes to your friend!",

Saving my life qualifies as an exception.\n\nPills are a common issue, a lot of use gelatin as well. If its a simple vitamin or pain reliever, there are alternatives. Prescriptions for more serious illness might not have an alternative, so it comes down to how realistic it would be to take gelatin-based pills or alternative medicine that can offer comparable results. \n\nI recently needed a prescription (first time in probably a decade) that came in gelatin-based pills. I was hesitant at first, but the alternative was to use a different treatment that would take significantly more effort and had a significantly lower effectiveness, so I was willing to settle for a handful of gelatin-based pills. It crossed my threshold for not being **practiceable**. That threshold varies between people.",

I've been vegan over 8 years without a need for juicers, but if you want to invest in such a thing, that's cool.\n\nB12; yes, it would be advisable to take a supplement. I order Deva brand multivitamins online. Allegedly we can get enough B12 from fortified foods, but I'd still recommend supplementing. (Taking a multivitamin isn't a huge chore, &amp; doctors recommend them to omnivores too.)\n\nMeal plans. I don't know; the things we need are carbs, protein, fruit, veg, &amp; I'd recommend almond milk. There are also soy, oat, hemp seed, coconut, quinoa, &amp; rice milks. Brands vary, so perhaps see which  you prefer the flavor of. I like potato, lentils, &amp; spinach salad for a meal... Gardein is my favorite brand of faux meat (available in the US &amp; Canada). Maybe I could assume from the word 'cheers' you're in the UK, &amp; there are plenty of good vegan meats there too; I know Linda McCartney Shepard's pie &amp; chili are great. Here's a simple rundown of what you need in your diet to be healthy, http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx\n\nAnd taking off from work: no! No way. I went from a being a hardcore meat eater who would order rare cow flesh at nearly every restaurant I went to, to being vegan in the course of a single afternoon &amp; I never had a noticeable health change... some people say you'll have more energy as a vegan, or you can sleep better, or have better skin. I don't know about that, honestly I don't, but I didn't notice, nor did I notice anything remotely bad... certainly no diarrhea. \n\nThis video, Meet Your Meat, had a big impact on me, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykTH_b-cXyE\n\nEat well, keep fit, &amp; enjoy it! ---Feel free to ask any other questions you have here.",

It IS possible to live without it. :) \n\nFollow Your Heart brand for Mozzerella and Monterey Jack cheese is really good. Almond milk cheddar cheese is great for snacking on with some crackers and vegan pepperoni. \n\nChao cheeses are good too, but I haven't used many of them. \n\nI would suggest writing down your favorite meals and what you are good at cooking and then start to veganize the meals from there. Pinterest is amazing for recipes. Branch out a bit! If you have always wanted to make something but you are unsure how, there are so many videos and articles available online to help you. Cooking is fun, and learning how to make delicious meals can be very easy. Just take it one step at a time. Good luck!",

"comment": "Siiigh... Unfortunately it is the vegan's eternal dilemma to deal with these kinds of conversations. People ask me all the time, \"what was the hardest part of going vegan for you? Giving up cheese? Giving up bacon?\" The real answer is that giving up eating these animal products was the easy part! The hardest part for me, and for many, is dealing with intentionally argumentative people on a daily basis and having these kinds of conversations.\n\nI can't count the times I've been asked \"where do you get your protein?\" and \"But you know plants feel pain, right?\" These conversations wear me down. But I see it as a small price to pay for living an ethical lifestyle that makes me feel emotionally, mentally, and spiritually fulfilled in life. :)\n\nSo what I do, is usually feel out the person. If they start bringing up the conversation and I can tell they're coming from a mean-spirited place with it, I'll just end the conversation somehow, change the topic, or evade. If I get the sense they're coming from a place of genuine curiosity, I'll take the time to have an actual conversation about veganism with them. You learn to read the person you're talking to, and know if they actually want to talk, or if they just want to make fun of you. The person who starts this conversation with the intent of being a jerk, I have learned there's no changing their mind. They're not having the conversation to be open minded, they're having the conversation to play \"gotchya!\" with a vegan. So I avoid talking to these people, or avoid the topic of veganism with these people.",

"comment": "In America, where my vote and actions count, lgbt, women, the religious, and every race, have the right to not be stabed in the neck. We are still working on that for animals. The death penalty takes away the right to life needlessly(not self defense). Euthanasia certainly, if consent is given, within reason. Abortion is fine until sentience, or about third trimester. And of course science will always trump religion.\n\nI definitely don't subscribe to intersectionality. Feminism, lgbt, race, and religion have little to do with the ethics of veganism.  \n\nI also believe that humans are part of the sentient animals included in the definition of veganism.",

I trust you understood what I meant ;)\n\n&gt;jeans or jackets often have small patches of leather\n\nIn the store it's as easy as turning them around. Online pictures usually cover the full waist circumference, which is where leather is sewn, if there's any at all. In any case, if in doubt it won't hurt sending an email to the seller asking, if it is not already specified.\n\n&gt;So if you know of any vegan base layer material, that would be great.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not aware of any, as I hardly ever buy clothes (something like once every 2 years, and it's really just a few things that wore off). I was looking into this topic not so long ago ([even posted a question on Reddit about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/comments/envluk/patagonia_imports_from_thailand_but_i_cant_find/)), however, and got some people telling me that Patagonia is quite ethical.",

In the future i think that lab meat could replace the animal meat in cat food.

It covers history and presents perspectives from vegan survivors of the Holocaust, and is an extremely heavy book, but it was also a very good read.\n\nAnimal Liberation in the Global Capitalist Era by Sarat Colling was another good one, it read kind of like a \"feel good\" book about the ways in which animal liberation has happened and especially the way in which animals have liberated themselves, and the public perspective of these things. It can be a bit heavy in certain parts naturally, but I found it highly positive overall.",

"comment": "I've been going to the gym consistently for a while and have gained visible muscle and strength whilst being vegan. Am i a vegan gymbro? I don't do bulking or anything, nor do I track my weight, I just stay consistent in a slight calorie excess. Idk how useful this info will be since it's very unconventional and might be quite time-consuming, but I also have a plant-based gymbro friend who does something similar. \n\nItsJchnny had a good list of stuff. I've heard good things about TVP but I haven't tried it myself. Heard it goes really well in chilis.\r\n\nIt is definitely possible to be vegan and still make really good progress in the gym. People have this weird idea that only like meat contains protein, and they forget to count the protein that's added up through stuff like rice and bread and so on. If he was to track it all, he'd probably find that he's eating more protein than he thinks. \n\nAlso, there is a misunderstanding on how much protein you need. To my knowledge, anything about 1.5g of protein per kg of bodyweight is diminishing returns, so when bodybuilders are eating like 200g of protein per day that's just because they're at such an elite level, they're cutting and don't want to lose muscle. I'm about 62kg (5foot 7/8, low body fat) and I aim for about 90g (so about 1.5g per kg) but usually get like 100g and maybe even up to 130g on a good day. However, huge progress can still be made from like 1.2g per kg. My plant-based friend gets like 1.2g per kg (80g) and he's stronger than me because he's been going for longer. \n\nIt depends how conscious about health he is. I've always very conscious of my health, even before I went vegan so what I eat will sound a bit weird but I love it because I know I'm getting all my nutrients and no animals have to be harmed. I probably have OCPD. But hopefully it gives some inspiration. You don't need to have these every day, but maybe just a few times a week will really help.\n\nAlso, even IF my diet is only like 90% optimal for muscle building, I would not care to eat animal products for just a marginal difference because (1) there is much more to health than muscle (e.g. cardio) and (2) there is more to life than health, e.g. ethics and not causing harm to others. And I think, if it does translate to more prep time, I don't care if it means I have to think about my food more if it means less animals are harmed. \n\nNut smoothie\n\n. A bunch of nuts and seeds with fruit, [protein powder](https://amzn.eu/d/iI13MXT) (my favourite, so tasty and loads of nutrients like amino acids)  \n. Can also add stuff like chocolate cacao or cinnamon powder for taste  \n. Examples: almonds, cashews pumpkin seeds, walnuts, chia, flax, oats, banana, blueberries, peanut butter and some protein powder, cacao powder. I top it up with soya milk.  \n. Can also add creatine if desired. I haven't but I have still gotten gains I'm very happy with.  \n. If you really wanna make the smoothie big you can get like 60g+ or protein, 30g+ fibre, with 1000+ calories, and like 2+ servings of fruit in one smoothie.\n\n. Mine has about 65g of protein, 37g fibre, \\~1200 calories at its biggest. It's a bit unwieldy and sometimes it can take me over an hour to eat, so I very often reduce the amount on how I'm feeling or save a bit for later as a snack. And you can get used to being able to eat it quicker.  \n. Super healthy, loads of complex carbs, omega-3, healthy fats and great mix of nutrients. Fills me up for hours, usually eat it earlier in day.   \n. Been eating it almost every day for \\~18 months, even before I began consistently training and before I went vegan 7 months ago. \n\n. Start small, play around with ingredients and gradually add more as you see fit\n\nI've also been trying out a veggie smoothie from Bryan Johnson Blueprint (who is apparently vegan) since I wanted to eat more cruciferous veg, and realised that is conveniently filled up the holes in my diet like choline and whatever. I've been enjoying it for the last 3 months or so. Again it's a bit weird (and slightly culty) but if your bf is really into health he might be interested, but it's not to everyone's taste, **nor is it necessary to do all of this to make progress at the gym**. I don't like telling people what I do because I feel like it makes people think you have to do everything which I'm doing which can sound a bit insane and put people off veganism and stuff, so I just want to reiterate that you do NOT have to do everything that I've outlined above to a T. It's just what I do because it's what I prioritise (health AND veganism), and you can just pick out what you like the sound of (see 80/20 rule). It might be just something like adding a spoonful of seeds to cereal, that simple. \n\nIt sounds weird but I really enjoy having these two smoothies most days, since it puts my mind at ease knowing I'm getting loads of nutrients and gives me room to have fun with the third meal. I usually make my nut smoothie on an evening and put it in the fridge. The veggie smoothie I make a couple of batches at once and refrigerate them.\n\nTofu\n\n. I eat tofu most weeks, I haven't got anything tested but as everyone has said the whole soya and testosterone thing is very much be a myth. However, I know that poor sleep and poor diet in general can affect testosterone, but I'm not too well-versed in the specifics. If your bf is currently eating a lot of (ultra) processed food then that might not be the healthiest thing.\n\n. If it's the texture he dislikes, it might be worth exploring different ways of cooking tofu. I really like breaking up firm tofu into chunks, mixing it with cornflour and oil, and baking in the oven. They get nice and crispy, they're really tasty in stir fries! I'll throw them in gochujang udon noodles with some veg, or just like a katsu curry sauce. Solid 30g of protein meal and can cook a few batches at once.   \n. Fried panko-breaded tofu also goes really well for a katsu curry  \n. Tempeh (never tried but heard great things)\n\nYou can't go wrong with lentil dahls w/ rice and naan. Probably like 30g of protein? I made this [Red Lentil Dahl](https://biancazapatka.com/en/red-lentil-dahl/) the other week and it is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. \n\nI also buy tinned bean chilis and lentil/chickpea dahls for quick dinners, and will serve them with either a jacket potato or rice and naan or whatever. You can usually get about 30g of protein from that too. \n\nI really hope you bf doesn't give up on veganism. It's totally possible to eat enough protein for significant muscle growth on a wholefoods vegan diet. I hope any of what I've said has been of help/inspiration, or helps to change his perspective. It's easy to be misinformed by meat-eaters, since if you think about it about 95% of people are gonna have their own biases towards eating animal products because it's what they do and people don't bother to learn about nutrition for vegans because they have no reason to. Like, people claim you can be deficient in iodine if you don't eat meat but fail to realise that the single most concentrated source of iodine is seaweed (I sprinkle a tiny bit on my veggie smoothie or dinner as a seasoning).",

"comment": "I definitely recommend putting your vegan status on your profile, even if you are open to dating omnivores. Saying \"I am seeking someone kind to me who understands/supports my veganism, whatever your own dietary preferences\" would be a great way of doing this.\n\n\nThe reason for this is indeed that some people don't want to date vegans. It's a dealbreaker for me also, as an ex-vegetarian who was briefly vegan.\n\n\nIt is better to filter those people out early -- and attract people who are open to or looking for vegans! If you don't, you will be in the position of getting rejected by those people in the messaging or early dating stages, when it has much more emotional impact.\n\n\nRegarding travel and top restaurants -- there is no response, because your date is right. There are some places it is impossible to travel and some restaurants that are impossible to experience while remaining vegan.",

"comment": "It’s strange because you just inserted a bunch of scenarios that I didn’t describe? I didn’t say “let them starve until they submit to eating vegan” but rather commit to setting up opportunities where they’ll expand their palette. I was a picky eater too. I ate very little but fast food and unhealthy snacks, no healthy meals. I was abused into changing the way I ate, I was presented with more healthier options and over a long period of time my diet slowly shifted to a healthier one. Is it child abuse to eat nothing but fast food? I sure wasn’t healthy at the period in my life, I ate no vegetables, there’s the other end of that spectrum where you are also doing your kids a disservice if you only feed them unhealthy options because they’ve tunneled their palette to a point of eating nothing nutritious.",

In the first place *you* are the one who drew the comparison to grave robbing, so I thought up of a relevant scenario where grave robbing *may* take place but wouldn't *need* to, because that's along the lines we have been arguing. I did so to better try and illustrate the point I was making. Instead of answering my very relevant question of \"do you think it would be wrong to rob a grave even if it doesn't effect anybody\", which I illustrated for the purpose of making the circumstances clear, you just dodged it and compared me to a non-vegan. If you'd rather run away from the discussion rather than engage with it then you're free to do so but I find it frustrating that people are so unwilling to have their beliefs challenged.",

"comment": "if you are vegan for compassion reasons, being vegan forever is easier than being vegan strictly for health reasons - as it is possible to eat some animal products and be very healthy = that's a losing argument - or one that can't be 'won.' \n\nI'm an ethical vegan and I'd remain vegan even if it turned out that plants caused obesity, heart disease and cancer - but lucky me - they don't.\n\nZero doubt I'll be vegan for the rest of my life.  I also have a vegan tattoo.  VEGAN:  Never  compromise",
