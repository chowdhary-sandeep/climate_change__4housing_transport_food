"comment": "Ok that sounds kind of feasible, so this is for a school project I presented on yeasterday, The idea was that if your moving a fabricated shipping container home via pickup truck you actually have alot of hollow space inside the container so for the trip to the site you could stuff the container with batteries and then tow them back for the return journey. Idea being that since your towing something anyway you might as well try and make the process fully electric.",

So while Washington's power is extremely low in carbon emissions and may have factored into Inman's decision to buy a Tesla, it's also extremely out of character from the rest of the United States and the entire planet.\n\nI was going to say the author is a desperate dishonest cretin, but he was honest enough to add this edit.\n\nNot honest enough to re-name his shitty article though.",

Removing it would be going back on their promises. \n\nIn the end it's a pretty bad situation, which I don't know how to politically improve without waiting for the incentives to run out.

While I was in Seattle, I used only public charging stations, but now that I'm in Dallas, I almost exclusively charge using the 110v charger plugged into a power strip. Most days I'm not running the battery down to empty. I have a couple of times rolled in with about 10 miles left and those days it did take about 20 hours to fully charge, but every time I get home, I plug in. I almost never have to use public charging, but if I do, I have a couple of level 2 chargers in walking distance, so I can jack in there and top off in about 4-5 hours. I've only done that once.",

The volt can charge overnight from a normal outlet using the included cord and you'll have a full charge every morning. Relying on public chargers is going to be a bit difficult. The Volt takes hours to charge, which means you'll need to park it at a charger and leave it there for a portion of the day every time you want a full battery, unless you can find an outlet to charge it off overnight. Your apartment manager might be willing to work out a deal with you for an outdoor outlet.",

Even a full day test would be great. \n\nI appreciate the feedback on the ford, I wasn't feeling it on the reviews and I've seen a few reviews where people mention getting pushed towards a gas vehicle. Granted the Ford dealer near here only has 1, so we'll see what happens. \n\nI'll look at the others too, but I'm wanting a mid/fuller size sedan and a smaller car isn't ideal. I might even stop by the Tesla store here and see what CPO cars they have in stock. I'd be all over a 60Kw Model S if I can get it below 40k. \n\nThanks!",

You will have no power bill, but will need a lot more modules and a bunch of batteries and other equipment.  \n\n2 have grid tied solar and deal with your power company as people here have recommended.  You would not be \"selling 100% of your power\"  You would be selling the power you are not using back to the grid.  You can load shift some of your loads to day time.  \n\n3 If you went with some sort of combination battery grid tied thing you would still be dealing with this program.  You would minimize the night time power draw from the grid with the daily cycling of the battery.  The Tesla Powerwall isn't really out yet, but there are more options coming this way as power companies do away with net metering.  As a back up system this will not last more than a day.",

While the base price of Tesla's Powerwall is US$3000 (AU$4300), that doesn't include an inverter (another few thousand dollars), and hiring professionals to install it for you. Meanwhile the $12,000 touted by AllGrid is for the full set up, I believe.",

I'm telling you about Rive because I know people that work at Tesla Energy. The entire sector is down, but it's still a huge growth market and it's only the uniformed public (you) who are freaking out for no reason. \n\nTesla is usually one step ahead of the industry. Musk outlined leaving behind the door to door model in the Tesla/SolarCity merger call and in subsequent earnings- go back and listen to them. The plan was cut down or eliminate customer acquisition costs by selling energy products in store and online. The bet is that most people are going to seek out their products on the merit of innovation, performance, and aesthetics. Tesla motors has never taken out advert for their cars... the same philosophy applies here regardless if you agree or not...that's what their going to do.  The flux you're seeing is just the restructuring of the business approach and organization. As usual, they're positioning themselves LONG-TERM so relax.\n\nRive's services aren't needed any longer, NOR is he interested in being head of Tesla Energy... he's just not that into it. He's into creating startups. So, no- the sky isn't falling.. \"dude\".",

"comment": "I think so too, the AC outlets rated at up to 1500W is an excellent feature, making the 12kWh battery capacity available for auxiliary purposes such as camping and all sorts of events.  Since the vehicle is a PHEV, the combustion engine can function as a fairly quiet generator to keep energy buffered up in the 12kWh battery as well.  I wonder if the sound level rating of the running vehicle would be lower than most generators including Honda generators (e.g. 53-59dB for EU2000i).  The 12 kWh battery storage could eliminate the need to run a noisy generator at all at night, such as when camping.\n\nUnfortunately the gasoline fuel tank capacity in the Outlander PHEV is rather low, just 11.9 gallons in the PHEV model, as I understand (ref: http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/en/showroom/phev/specifications/).  The capacity of the tank in my Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk is twice that!  That's one of the few specs where this Outlander PHEV seems to be lacking, although it may be understandable given the space required for the battery.  I would still like to see a PHEV SUV like the Outlander but perhaps with the additional size to accomodate a 25-gallon gas tank for very long range up over 600 miles.  Maybe even 800 miles given high efficiency!",

"comment": "&gt;This is why Tesla made their own standard for Supercharging (in 2012, when the first Supercharging station was deployed) and didn't wait around for death by committee.\n\nIt's going to be their biggest roadblock. They are already behind on charging power output - both in theory and practise (EA has 350kW dispensers deployed and Proterra has 500kW dispensers deployed for their busses, and Porsche showed a preprod taycan charging at 400kW all using CCS). Tesla laid out a decent playbook on what the future would look like, in the same way the Mac laid out the future of computers. Tesla should shift to CCS now and open their Network up to anyone who wants to pay (the argument was this standard not being available to enable billing). Priority to Tesla cars, of course.",

That's where the error bars I mentioned in my other comment come into play.\n\nJust like [this](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-model-s-achieves-best-safety-rating-any-car-ever-tested) turned out to be marketing puffery (not to mention displaying some combination on Tesla's part of incompetence with interpreting statistics and having no particular compunction to be honest), as illustrated when crash test agencies other than the NHTSA got their hands on the Model S. Tesla was studying to the test, and got caught.\n\n(Note that I'm not exactly criticizing the S's crash test results -- they're actually very good regardless. But they were still outperformed by half a dozen other sedans on the IIHS tests. What I'm criticizing is Tesla's propensity to state or heavily imply conclusions that are invalid to draw because the error bars are way too big.)\n\nI expect the 3 to do better on the IIHS tests, but the same general principle applies -- crash tests test a very very small number of crash configurations, and Car A performing on those tests better than Car B doesn't *necessarily* mean that Car A is safer on the road than Car B. The error bars are too big to draw that conclusion.",

In contrast to other electric vehicles, FCEVs produce electricity using a [fuel cell](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/fuel_cell.html) powered by hydrogen, rather than drawing electricity from only a battery. During the vehicle design process, the vehicle manufacturer defines the power of the vehicle by the size of the electric motor(s) that receive electric power from the appropriately sized fuel cell and battery combination. Although automakers could design an FCEV with plug-in capabilities to charge the battery, most FCEVs today use the battery for recapturing braking energy, providing extra power during short acceleration events and to smooth out the power delivered from the fuel cell with the option to idle or turn off the fuel cell during low power needs. The amount of energy stored onboard is determined by the size of the hydrogen fuel tank. This is different from an all-electric vehicle, where the amount of power and energy available are both closely related to the battery's size.\n\n[https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-fuel-cell-electric-cars-work](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-fuel-cell-electric-cars-work)\n\nIt is important to distinguish between Green Hydrogen from renewable energy and blue hydrogen from natural gas and gray/brown hydrogen from coal. They are not the same thing and Green hydrogen uses no fossil fuels and is not burned and produces no CO2 in the manufacturing or use of that fuel.\n\nWhen that hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources like solar and wind it is Green Hydrogen and does not come from fossil fuels and when used in an FCEV it is converted to electricity and the only emissions is water vapor.\n\nThere are major projects and lots of investment in green hydrogen all over the world right now:\n\n**Explainer: Why green hydrogen is finally getting its day in the sun \"More than $150 billion worth of green hydrogen projects have been announced globally in the past nine months. In total, more than 70 gigawatts of such projects are in development\"**\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/energy-hydrogen/explainer-why-green-hydrogen-is-finally-getting-its-day-in-the-sun-idUSL4N2II1O2](https://www.reuters.com/article/energy-hydrogen/explainer-why-green-hydrogen-is-finally-getting-its-day-in-the-sun-idUSL4N2II1O2)\n\nGreen Hydrogen is being promoted because it can replace natural gas and diesel for many uses including for big rigs, trains, busses, heavy equipment, planes, ships, home heating, making steel, construction and manufacturing of many products like glass.\n\nSo when you see an article about \"hydrogen\" make sure you understand if they are talking about Green Hydrogen from renewables or hydrogen made from fossil fuels as the fossil fuel industry and people promoting other agendas are intentionally trying to confuse people that they are the same thing and are actively using social networks like Reddit subs to spread that disinformation.\n\nGreen hydrogen is not likely to replace EV light duty cars because those can be charged at home and they are cheaper to build than an FCEV but for heavier duty vehicles and other uses that green hydrogen will be very useful in getting us off natural gas and diesel and it is important that we get off fossil fuels as an energy source for all uses.\n\nWhere is that power coming from to recharge your EV and power your homes?\n\nIf it comes from renewables it is clean energy and that excess renewable energy is also used to produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen production will greatly increase the expansion of renewable energy meaning your EVs will have more access to clean renewable energy for charging EVs and powering homes.\n\nIf your EV and home is being powered by a fossil fuel coal or NG plant it is NOT clean energy and you are still supporting the fossil fuel industry.\n\n**How is green hydrogen transported?**\n\nGreen hydrogen does not compete with renewables and it compliments renewable energy as it gives renewable energy power producers a way to store excess energy and sell that as a product for many uses and it can also be converted to electricity, ammonia and fertilizer.\n\nWhen Green Hydrogen is converted to liquid ammonia it is very safe to transport and that is how they will be transporting it between countries.\n\nThe trucks transporting liquid hydrogen will also be powered by that same green hydrogen or batteries and we transport fuel every day to where it is needed.\n\nElectricity also has to be transported unless produced on site and with millions of new EVS and homes wanting clean energy that will require a massive build out of infrastructure that can cost billions and takes many years.\n\n**The Science Behind Using Ammonia as a Fuel**\n\n[https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1092](https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1092)\n\nGreen hydrogen can also be used to replace NG in appliances and that would allow countries to continue to have a backup energy source if electricity sources are at low production or not widely available:\n\n**Scottish homes to be first in world to use 100% green hydrogen**\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/30/scottish-green-hydrogen-fife](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/30/scottish-green-hydrogen-fife)\n\n**Summary or TLDR:**\n\nBatteries rely on mining of materials already in short supply and has serous human rights issues that will quickly become a serious bottleneck slowing down the transition to renewable energy if we rely on batteries for applications where green renewable hydrogen would be better suited. It is not a threat to EVs for light duty transportation and it is another form of electrical energy storage.\n\nThat is the reality we face and it is coming at us like a green hydrogen freight train!",

"comment": "This is still not true. Noone was calcing the infrastructure to move the Fossil Fuels, refine them, or extract them which is all done for Fossil Fuels as well. \n\nFor example, whats the total CO2 impact of Petrol refinement? [Well in 2008 a shortsheet came out](http://www.afteroilev.com/Pub/CO2_Emissions_from_Refining_Gasoline.pdf) which says we should add more than 1 kg of CO2 to every liter of petrol just in refining from Crude, and thats excluding the processes that do the refining. That wasnt even 20 years ago and that is needed to even *begin* to make an apples to apples comparison to the math you just added to the EVs. \n\nThis is why your argument is beyond misleading. You are adding numbers to EVs while ignoreing the equivalent for petrol cars. \n\nSure not moving has a lower CO2 footprint, and moving less far is even better. You may even be onto a paper about how moving less uses less energy! But equivalent distance calcs are how we tend to convey things as equivalents. So when we discuss bus' vs cars we are still having an ICE/EV discussion so we should continue to discuss ICE/EV comparisons.",

"comment": "When will the human brain finally become flexible enough to understand that\n\n* just because there is coal-based electricity in the grid today doesn't mean that it will stay like that eternally (hint: it's changing rapidly)\n* I get to control (in my country, Germany) the source of the electricity I consume in my house. On a personal scale, we consume 100% green energy despite sharing the grid with electricity from non-renewable sources\n* combustion engines don't have that option to switch to renewables, ever (as in: almost)\n\nAt the risk of being annoying, I'm gonna explain it like you're 5, or actually, like you're my 80-year-old dad (edit: who for added complication used to engineer Diesel engines in former socialist Eastern Germany): Look dad, if you have a bucket full of 10 liters of water that you share with other people, and you consume 1 liter of that water, then pay someone specific to replenish the water in the bucket from his own source, could you then argue that you have complete control over the source of the part of the water in the bucket that you yourself consumed?\n\nSo the electricity source argument is simply invalid in my opinion. It's just the never-ending regurgitation of the narrative spread by the retarded automobile industry over here, oh but look at where that electricity is coming from, it's dirty. Wrong! And even if that was true, that is still not a valid argument for the ICE (internal combustion engine), but plain and simply whataboutism.\n\nHere are the facts: On a Joule level, the electric motor is roughly four times as efficient as the ICE, meaning that the ICE wastes around 80% of energy as heat, whereas the electric motor wastes only around 20% (feel free to correct me on the precise numbers). The electric drivetrain has virtually no moving parts except the one central axle in the motor and its extension into the wheels, compared to the hundreds or whatever how many moving parts the ICE has that keep breaking all the time. All of the really expensive repair costs I had with my ICE car over its 14 years were all drivetrain-related (diesel pump, clutch, starter motor). That shit simply ceases to exist because it's inferior technology. Yes, batteries are a problem awaiting increasingly better solutions.\n\nSo even if you had renewable fuel for ICEs, which is possible and also a reality, does not make the ICE a better technology simply because it's not. It's still noisy, it's still polluting the inner cities, and it's still fragile for all its moving parts.\n\nThe amount of peace that hectic hilly cities (think Marseille, Lisboa etc) will learn once noisy ICE engines have been replaced by the whispering of electric motors is unfathomable for people today. It's so obviously a superior technology.",

I’m sorry to say, 99.9% of people and businesses go solar only if it makes financial sense and this bill introduces such a large risk to the finances, no lawyer, CPA, or accountant is going to advise their client to take the risk on a system who’s entire net metering contract can be revoked after the install for a mistake that isn’t on the customer’s end. \n\nAlso, how can it be a public works project without state funding, instead based on a fairly common tax credit? That will destroy business in the state and it just part of a larger anti-distributed solar push by utility company dark money groups. Don’t be fooled by the name, when has a large corporation ever donated millions of dollars to a group that advocates for their workers?\n\nAlso, not a salesperson. I’m a policy expert.",

I haven't actually found anyone who's done an inverter replacement out of warranty (which makes sense as Tesla Solar is only 6 years old). Did Tesla tell you how much their inverters cost to replace out of warranty? I'm curious myself.\n\nFor research purposes prior to purchase, I used the Solar Edge SE7600H for comparison, and that costs $1600-2000, so I would expect Tesla's to be similar.",

"comment": "Untrue.  EA is a legal mandate over dieselgate.\n\nThe auto manufacturers are purposely holding EVs back.  Tesla knew from day one that you cannot sell EVs without chargers and built them in tandem. Right now, not one legacy auto company is investing in any chargers. not even VW.  VW is the reason working chargers is not a priority for EA because VW still controls EA, despite it being a legal mandate in a settlement.\n\nIf dieselgate never happened, CCS charging above 50kw wouldn't exist at all.\n\nI cannot wait until a legacy company figures this out and actually invests in chargers at the scale of tesla.  I would expect them to switch to NACS too because it has better usability for the consumer and doesn't have the pin separation issues CCS has experienced on EA's network due to the heft of the connector.  Customers also don't want to use CCS tips over NACS tips once they experienced both.\n\nAt any time, EA could swap the 2nd CCS cable on all their chargers to NACS. The whole point of supporting two cables was to support two different charging tips, EA put on two CCS cables to avoid hElPiNg TeSlA.  NACS can use any protocol, it is the same exact wires as CCS, but in a more compact arrangement.  Tesla cars have a universal charging circuit that supports any charging protocol globally.  The protocol of the charger does not matter.  A tesla can plug into a CCS charger with a NACS cable or a CCS cable with a NACS adapter and work just fine using the CCS protocol.  Other car manufacturers should be using similar universal charging circuits that they standardize for all their cars in all markets, it just makes sense to reduce cost.\n\nNACS also supports up to 1000kw, CCS is only 350kw.  A new version of CCS coming out in 2025, only supports 500kw.  It still requires swapping out every charger which no one is going to do.  \n\nThe current upper charging speed limit on the tesla v4 chargers isn't even known publicly.  No one knows what tesla plans to do, but it is likely that the charging hardware all supports high wattages, even if they initially use smaller grid connections and offer around 300-350kw.  Upgrading the speed in the future will likely be an electrical service upgrade without changing the charger hardware out.",

"comment": "> But legitimately EVs are over-tech'd with remote-brickable software. \n\nThere is zero evidence that this makes it more likely to brick an EV compared to gas cars.  If anything it appears better with software defined cars like Tesla, but the jury is still out for now if that holds in the very long term.  Tesla will rent their software by the day and you can do nearly anything.",

I figured i would throw a go-pro on whatever helmet i end up getting (when i can afford one that is) and just throw rides up on YT to maybe hopefully get a little extra cash-flow but i dont think that will be anytime soon.\n\nany help at all would be super crazy appreciated. please please be kind and dont hate on me for this question. i just really need something. thank you all in advance!\n\nI do live in a hilly suburban area that makes my pedal bike super impractical for work and renting a bike just is not a reliable option in my area. i understand the hills will kill the bike battery much faster but the longest commute i might have is 15 miles and i would charge my bike while im on shift.",

"comment": "I'll take a stab:\n\nYour 25kW system at a nominal $4/W gets you a 30% (30k) tax credit for the owner (business or individual) at the end of this tax season. The corporate tax credit is up to 25% of the cost of the system (25k) which would come back to in checks up to $3,500 per annum ( for ~7 years) Since there is Net Metering you would save $4-5k on your electric bills every year. Bonus depreciation is no longer in effect so the system will depreciate as typical (5 years) a net of $6k off your tax liability (assuming 30% tax rate) for the depreciation term. \n\nSo- Net out of pocket at the end of year 1= 100,000-30,000-3,500-5,000-6,000= 55.5k\n\nNet at year 5= 100,000-30,000-17,500-25,000-30,000= (2.5k)\n\nso it looks like you would be profitable in 5 years. \n\nIf you qualify for the Plametto Clean Energy program you would get back $7k each year for your RECs in addition, accelerating your payback time significantly.\n\nI hope this helps.

"comment": "Individuals buying a solar array are eligible for a 30% federal tax credit. A solar array to offset a home's electrical usage will cost $20k-40k (depending on energy needs / installation / climate) before incentives. This means that you need to have at least $7k - $13k of federal tax liability to get the full rebate. \n\nAs Mitt Romney once pointed out 47% of Americans don't pay ANY federal income tax so they aren't eligible for any federal tax credit.\n\nNow, consider that solar city gets the 30% tax credit in addition to a special tax deduction system for businesses known as MACRS, which means they can write off the full value of the solar array over 5 years. Depending on tax liability this could be an additional 30% tax credit - the higher your tax liability (often correlated with income) the quicker the payback period.\n\nMoral of the story: Politicians are corrupt and if they really wanted to level the playing field they'd do away with subsidies (which disproportionately benefit the rich), and use a steadily increasing tax on fossil fuels to make renewable energy cost effective for all without needing confusing tax forms and fly by night subsidies. \n\nTLDR: Solar city is a great workaround to get the people eligible for the subsidies to finance solar for those who are not eligible / can't afford initial expenses. Annually increasing Pigovian taxes would create a much more stable solution than subsidies for financial backers.",

"comment": "Well, only one of those claims is verifiable (ie not a prediction). The global installed PV capacity has been more or less doubling every 2 years since about 2003, except for 2010 and 2011 when it close to doubled EACH YEAR. You can take a look at [reports put out by the EPIA](http://www.epia.org/news/publications/global-market-outlook-for-photovoltaics-2013-2017), (the EU PV industry group), or just check out this [post on Cleantechnia]( (somehow they got their hands on graphs with 2013 data already). Other good sources to look to are different agencies and organizations that provide energy statistics, like the IEA, and the EIA in the US. I've been looking for a good recent peer reviewed article that I could maybe break out from behind a paywall for you, but nothing is coming up.\n\nRegarding costs, what is most interesting is [LCOE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source) ($ per kWh). [According to the DEA](http://energy.gov/articles/progress-report-advancing-solar-energy-across-america) the LCOE of utility scale solar PV in the US has dropped from 210$/MWh in 2010 to 110$/MWh last year. Also, [LLNL put out a nice report last year](http://emp.lbl.gov/publications/utility-scale-solar-2012-empirical-analysis-project-cost-performance-and-pricing-trends) tracking solar electricity prices (note, price is not cost) and the cool thing is that they show that most recent big utility solar fields going into the SW US are selling electricity at 50$ a MWh (but this includes subsidies, most importantly a 30% tax credit, that probably put real costs in order to mke a decent return on that price back up in the 100$/MWh range.  But what does fossil fuel electricity cost (by the way, we want to look at coal and natural gas, almost no petroleum is used for electricity). Well if [trust the EIA](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf), the LCOE for a new coal plant entering into service in 5 years would produce electricity at 100$/MWh and that goes up to 135$/MWh if we try to sequester the carbon. Natural gas is cheaper, with dropping to about 65$/MWh for an advanced combined-cylce plant. SO it is clear new solar is on the verge of being cheaper than new fossil electricity which is amazing. 2017 sounds reasonable to me. Of course new solar actually has to compete with fossil fuel plants that area already built and the variable (fuel) cost of coal for instance is only about 30$/MWh. So it depends how you define things.\n\nAll that said, and being a solar guy myself, I don't think the world will ever be 100% anything. IN 2029 I hope that we will have retired all the coal plants (although given that they are still building them in china, this is a stretch) but I can't imagine we'd have retired all the CC plants built in the last few years. And even if we were at all renewables, it seems to make sense to use different types depening on the area, wind espetially will surely continue to play a role, even if at some point solar starts to beat it in price. And of course we will never be able to go 100% renewable without a breakthrough in storage. But genuine progress is being made.",

"comment": "In U.S. dollars, a range of roughly 30 cents up to $2 per watt is typical.  http://sunelec.com/  As already noted, panels with higher rated efficiency or greater reliability/durability cost more.  There are significant volume discounts which means the more you buy the less it costs down to a minimum.  The \"sweet spot\" currently is running between 50 cents and 70 cents per watt.  These are the panels that will be used most often for solar power applications.  Keep in mind that taxes can add significantly to the final price!\n\nThe problem is that purchasing a panel or even 3 or 4 is not the end of the story.  A solar system also needs an inverter if AC output is desired, Charge Controller if batteries are to be charged, cables for interconnections and to connect to a power sink (whether your home electricity supply or to the grid), protection in the form of fuses/breakers, and mounting hardware to support the panel.\n\nLets say you wanted to build a 6000 watt system, you could purchase the panels for as little as $2000.  Adding the inverter, cables, mounting hardware, and other odds and ends will cost you about $10,000.",

"comment": "Its a fun idea, /u/mrCloggy is, as usual, on point in his response but is actually optimistic about the efficiency you couldd expect. Looking at  the [specs] (http://www.himawari-net.co.jp/e_page-index01.html) the big version has 2.5m2 input area, and so recieves about 250000 lumens in direct sunlight (100000 lux, 1 lux = 1 lumen/m2) but only produces 11000 lumens at the other end. In other words its about 4% efficient in transfering the light from outdoors to indoors. Ok for lighting but not so much for  solar power. Light through fibers sustains multiple internal reflections. The loss in each bounce is low but over more than a meter or two these hundresds of bounces add up to real losses.\n\nYou say\n\n&gt;The smaller footprint on my roof would be great\n\nEven with an ideal system (100% efficient) you would need the same amount as capture area as solar panel area to get the same power as you would just sticking the panels on the roof. With a real system it would be 20x more area based on the above.\n\nSo its really a non starter but good on you for thinking outside the box.",

"comment": "Public benefit funds (PBF)based on a small charge per kWh provide money for low income assistance, cost effective efficiency, renewable energy and research and development. Utilities in California are required to collect and spend PBF by statute so that these beneficial programs received funding based on charges that are tied to high energy consumption. Well designed programs help low income customers save energy and reduce their bills by providing more efficiency such as LED lighting, weatherization, efficient refrigerators, air conditioning and cooling and energy education. Funds also provide discounts and assistance with paying bills for senior citizens and low income customers. Energy efficiency programs also assist other residents, commercial, institutional and industrial customers. The renewable energy allocation is a small percentage and was created with a provision that the rebates would decline annually to insure that real prices would drop so the market would not depend on subsidies as mass production made systems more affordable. The rebate have declined from as much as four dollars a Watt to only pennies. \nThe claim that customer installed solar or for that matter any efficiency measure \"hurts the poor\" comes from the massive portion of the cost of debt from billions invested in Nuclear power plants, aging coal generators, and all the new gas combustion turbines that commit rate payers to subsidize these projects whether they use or don't use the power. So anything that promotes less power sales can be claimed to drive up the unit price. Utilities have also changed the rate structure to have much higher monthly connection  charges to pay for the fixed expenses from debt service for capital investments. This is what utilities profits are based on: guaranteed return on investments paid by the ratepayers. The enormous 30+ year prepaid power contracts and shares of coal power plants made in the 1970s and 1980s are responsible for the high cost of energy and and the discouragement of renewable energy and optimized energy efficiency. But utilities love to claim that the very small solar  power industry are responsible for high rates and hurting and \"harming the poor\"",

"comment": "Moron, you also used 10 hrs a day of sunlight, when there is only 5hrs of good light to be used, and that is if your not up north real far or it's winter.  So yes, YOU MORON, your math is still wrong!!!\n\n7 Reasons why Solar Power is not Ready.. \n\nFrom [here](http://tinhatranch.com/7-reasons-why-solar-power-is-not-the-answer/#.VyQVFzF_wg4)\n\n\n\n\n **The Sun** delivers 1,000 watts per square meter of energy to the earth. While great from an individual’s perspective, when you put it into the context of the generating capacity of the United States the problem becomes enormous. The electrical generating capacity of the United States is 1.2 Terawatts. At face value it would require a solar panel 463 square miles in area, but things can’t be taken at face value.\n\n**Efficiency** Even the best solar panels, the very best, are 40% efficient. Most commercial grade solar panels convert less than 25% of the sun’s energy to electricity. For the sake of this article, let’s say the panels we install are 40% efficient. The 463 square mile solar array just jumped to 1157 square miles, or just about the size of Rhode Island\n  \n\n**The Sun doesn’t shine 24 hours per day**. Not only does the sun not shine 24 hours per day but we receive less energy at different times of the year. Typical Coal, Gas, and Nuclear generation has to work all day, every day. In the American Southwest (southern California and Arizona) where the sun’s energy most abundantly reaches the surface, each square meter receives an average of 6.8Kwh per square meter of sunlight every day. Again, assuming that we need to replace the current generating capacity of the United States over a 24 hour period (28.8TW/day) we would now need an array 4088 square miles in area, roughly 80% the size of Connecticut.\n\n\n\n**Cost**. The current cost of 1 watt of solar power generation purchased in industrial quantities is about $0.60USD (2013). That one dollar accounts for just the panel. There is no infrastructure behind that number, no land purchases, no tracking mounts to aim the panels at the sun, no wiring, no transmission, and no labor. There are no numbers available on the cost of such a large scale installation. Again, for the sake of this article let’s assume economies of scale would bring the cost down to $.60USD per watt installed. This number is a staggering $2.541 trillion dollars or $8,094 for every man, woman, and child in the United States.\n\n\n\n**Storage**. We have accounted for the generation of electricity, but remember, the sun doesn’t shine 24 hours a day. We would need to store this energy for when the sun isn’t shining. There is currently no feasible method to store this much energy. The closest method that is technologically feasible is pumped storage. During the day when the arrays are generating extra capacity the electricity is used to pump water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation, typically a reservoir. When the power is needed the potential energy of the stored water is converted using hydroelectric turbines. Using a current pumped storage facility like the Ludington Pumped Storage Facility in Ludinton, MI, some simple math shows us 1 gallon of water can provide .95 watts of electricity. Using a generalization that we have to store half of the electricity generated for later use we would need to store just over 15 trillion gallons of water. Since we need an elevated point to start with, maybe we could drain and refill a third of Lake Tahoe every day?\n  \n\n\n**Transmission**. If we installed our array in the Southwest we would still need part of this electricity to travel all of the way to Maine. While not impossible it would require us to generate even more electricity due to typical line losses.\n   \n\n\n**Environmental Impact**. Ah, the law of unintended consequences. What happens when you take 40% of the Sun’s energy and suck it out of the atmosphere over a 4000 square mile area? I don’t think anyone knows. One thing I can tell you is that the general area would be much colder, the air denser, and any moisture in it would condense. Maybe there would be a vicious fog/sun cycle over the array? What would happen to all of the desert animals, plants, etc?\n\n ( I don't agree with the last statement of their 7 setbacks, but a huge solar plant is not good on the eyes for sure)",

"comment": "&gt;  Non solar consumers do not subsidize any aspect of solar\n\nIt's a fact they do. Me, I'm glad they do. It's imperative to get renewables off the ground, and if subsidies are gonna do it because the market has a hard time pricing in effects of climate change in 100 years, then I'm all for solar subsidies. But to deny they exist is silly. Subsidies on solar are absolutely gigantic on a per energy unit basis.\n\nBuffet has a point. Subsidising solar should happen through the government, e.g. through taxes or different laws, not as a charity from private businesses, you can't expect that from them, such an economic system sadly has no basis in reality. Why should you be able to generate electricity and force a utility to buy it at retail rate, through their infrastructure, when the utility company itself could sell it for half the cost, who is forced under net metering to pay twice their own cost? Imagine you run a business and you're forced to buy your own product at twice your own cost, and buy it through infrastructure you may even own and maintain (not the case everywhere). That's crazy.\n\nWhat's the solution? Remove net metering's credit to the retail rate, down at least to the cost rate. Then you're competing with utilities on a level playing field, like a normal marketplace. Then increase subsidies for solar across the board, both for home owners and utilities, to get solar off the ground at an even faster pace than today.\n\nIs that politically realistic? I'm not sure. Me, I'd have kept the net metering as it is, don't get me wrong. But I get Buffet's point, in an ideal world, you don't have net metering at the retail rate which unduly affects a utility company, and handle subsidies through taxes and credits if you want to subsidise solar. \n\nEven then, there's still the issue of the way the hand was dealt, the timing etc, was completely shitty, and screws over people's investments. It's like letting people apply for a loan with a variable rent that's always been at a sensible 5%, and then hiking it to 15% after extending a whole bunch of loans while pretending it's all cool. However, the scheme now does phase out the net metering in 12 years, it screws over existing home owners still but at least it's not overnight or in the same magnitude as you may think.",

"comment": "All inverters do is change DC into AC, that's it.  It doesn't store energy, it doesn't hook up to loads, it's just there to make the electricity usable.  If you have a stand alone system, all of your electricity is stored as DC, in a battery bank.  If you want to use that electricity, you have to take it back out of the battery, through the inverter, and into the main service panel of the house.  If your battery storage is full, a charge controller shuts the whole system down so you don't ruin your batteries.  So in this case, there is no \"excess electricity\" being made.  \n\nIf you are feeding into the grid, you have gone through the proper channels, (your energy company and the Authority Having Jurisdiction), to properly tie to the grid so that if you are making surplus energy, you are safely and securely transferring it into the grid.  Tapping into an energy providers equipment without telling them is extremely illegal and dangerous.",

Depending on your winter usage, you may even need to store seasonal overproduction and draw it down during the winter.\n\nIf your energy to power ratio is low, batteries make a lot of sense now (i.e. typically 4:1 or less).\n\nIf your energy to power ratio is very high - for example, if you needed to store seasonal overproduction - then building out additional solar and storing as hydrogen can make sense. You might even want a hybrid setup, i.e. a single Powerwall 2 combined with a fuel cell / electrolysis setup of only a couple kW.",

"comment": "That's a good summary of the a few of the common counterpoints from a utility perspective.\n\nAnd the opposing perspective highlights how residential solar is nearly all subtractive. Rooftop solar to date reduces the net demand for power, while shifting or changing the demand curve. In rare instances it is combined with new demand for power. Perhaps as much as 98% of the residential solar energy supplied to the grid is located where demand existed prior.\n\nSome studies conclude that within certain levels or proportions - say 0% to 15% of grid energy demand - there is a parity of costs. Meaning the nominal impact of things like peak demand reduction, demand shifting, lowering grid stress, etc., values distributed solar at retail rates or near retail rates. I forget, but I think there was press about that in the early stages of the AZ debate a few years back.\n\nSo, it has less to do with \"more money to solar\". Solar advocates will argue that utilities worry about the bottom line of lost revenue as distributed solar reaches a certain level. Both sides tend to accept debate about net metering rates above actual demand.\n\nThere is a reason why some states and utilities have primarily developed a number of solar farms (IN, GA, FL is growing) where rooftop solar is mostly stagnant. It gives them control and the ability to supply the power and contain within fees all of the associated costs. Behind the meter solar is invisible and shifts much of the costs directly to the homeowner (hardware).\n\nRather than the current approach for many states' public commissions to discourage distributed solar, the debate should shift more towards how to better integrate it. Already CA is addressing that.",

This is certainly the case with the vehicle batteries which are the same modules used in the Pw2.\n\n - Despite all this, the Tesla is one of the cheapest battery on the market on a price per watt basis even before you factor in the superior depth of discharge and the inverter compatibility advantage. \n\n- The Tesla phone app and monitoring software is the best I have seen to date. \n\n- The Tesla app and battery integrates with Tesla motor vehicles. \n\n- Poly-phase gateway for 2 and 3 phase systems is imminent. \n\nSource - Work with a company that has sold several hundred Powerwall 2 batteries since release. Also sell the others, but based on an objective analysis every other manufacturer is playing catch up. \n\nEdit - some important feature updates.  \n\n-  New gateway is poly-phase so fully three phase compatible. .\n\n- battery now receives meteorological information so it can store additional power if a serious storm is coming and power loss possible.\n\n- time of use tariffs available.",

"comment": "Banking on utility companies reducing their rates as electricity demand goes up does not seem like it’s based in rational thought. The beauty of consumer owned solar is to take advantage of your local net metering laws ( if you have them in your area). This allows you to produce your own electricity while benefiting from the consistency of the grid. When you go solar on your own you are prepaying your electricity bill for 25 years at a fixed rate. Utility owned solar is just a cleaner way for the utility to generate power, do not expect to see any cost savings on your bill. Utility rates go up an average of 5% a year so be sure to compare those future utility costs against your prepaid 25year value in your solar (or however long you plan on staying g in that home)",

"comment": "I realize Fuel Cell Vehicles are hit or miss in this subreddit. Personally, I'm excited. Even if Fuel Cells lack some potential in achieving carbon neutrality, it represents a technology that can break into markets for larger vehicles, reducing significantly the carbon footprint of some of our larger individual contributors. This is also neglecting the fact that *just because the primary method of hydrogen collection right now* is bad, doesn't mean it always could be or would be. That's like pointing to coal power plants and saying that BEVs are doomed to pollute.\n\nBatteries are expensive, and the technology, while advancing, is challenging to make breakthroughs in. Fuel Cell technology does away with the biggest concern by giving you an easily scalable, low tech solution to energy density. If you want more energy storage, make a bigger tank. The square-cube law comes in perfectly in a way that it doesn't for conventional battery storage. And on top of that, a conventional battery big enough to move a bus any appreciable distance would doubtless take forever to recharge, which makes fleet applications a nightmare.\n\nLarger vehicles like busses and pickup trucks could benefit from that scalability, and rapidity of refueling. Fleets would get the benefit of low down time, and similar levels of range performance compared to ICE vehicles. Something else I've lately been feeling needs to be championed is the effect things have on rural communities. Urban, and to a lesser extent suburban, communities are well on their way already in terms of developing a network of infrastructure to promote electric vehicles as options. Rural communities are suffering from a lack of options that cater to their needs. These people need things that are larger, able to move more at once, and able to go the distance while doing so. They chug gas like nobody's business, but so far the best I've heard is the *promise* of a *PHEV* truck. I think FCVs stand a chance at punching through into the rural markets. At the very least, even if you can't build a pickup that can tow a ton, you can at least have a pickup with a nice bed that goes just as far on hydrogen as you can with gasoline. That makes an amazing entry point.",

"comment": "&gt;bluea\n\nI looked into this a little bit. The general consensus seems to be that most owners will:\n\n* year 1: look at it almost every day\n* year 2: look at it 1x/2x a month or so\n* year 3+: go on with their lives\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think these days, solar monitoring seems to be marketed/sold as a platform or all-in-one-service. Some articles that are a good intro into comparing them are:\n\n* [Everything You Need to Know About Solar Monitoring](https://understandsolar.com/solar-monitoring/) — lists pros/cons of some systems\n* [Which inverter monitoring platform is best for you, and your customers?](https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2017/05/inverter-monitoring-platform-best-customers/)\n* [Top Solar Monitoring Systems](https://blog.pickmysolar.com/top-solar-monitoring-systems)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy takeaway is that every solar *installer* will push the solar monitoring platform that they own and operate. Most of it is dependent on the inverter/power-optimizer used, where some of them will be compatible with multiple monitoring software stacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can take a look at a few online demos or example dashboards to compare, at least visually:\n\n* [SolarEdge](https://monitoringpublic.solaredge.com/solaredge-web/p/home/public?locale=en_US)\n* [SunPower](https://monitor.us.sunpower.com/#/dashboard) — allows demo account\n* [Enphase Enlighten](https://enphase.com/map)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince you asked about how SunPower's suite stacks up to others, from what I've read, the PVS5x/PVS6 when paired with Enphase inverters *can* allow for module-level monitoring, but their online website doesn't show it (yet?). I've confirmed this on my end — the PVS6 monitoring box exposes an internal web server that displays each inverter module's stats, which then gets pushed to SunPower's servers. I'm putting something together that will allow me to keep/display that data for my own purposes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince newer SunPower installs come with Enphase micro-inverters (SunPower sold the Equinox line to Enphase), *theoretically* you could have your installer replace the PVS5x/PVS6 box with that of Enphase Envoy (hardware) + Enlighten (software), but I don't know if that's something they're allowed/willing to do. I'd certainly hope they give you the option, at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think you *need* any of the other home-based monitoring extras (Sense, OpenEnergyMonitor, Smappee, Curb, etc). If you're already getting one from the installer, it'll do that job for you. The rest would be duplicating functionality for added cost.",

Firstly, the savings are over 20 years, not 3, and there were also an unspecified number of energy efficiency upgrades that would have provided immediate benefits, possibly more than the solar savings. I expect it’s true that they did see immediate savings enough to divert money from the energy budget to the salary budget, but the article is lacking an actual breakdown of the numbers.",

"comment": "The claim is not suspect at all. It produces zero CO2 at the point of emission, and its lifecycle CO2 emissions are as low as any 'renewable' power source - which frankly, is a shit term anyway because wind turbines and solar panels being made without a solid plan and program in place to recycle them is hardly 'renewable'.\n\nI have to ask - without fail, EVERY nuclear article attracts comments like yours that spread FUD - fear, uncertainty, and doubt about nuclear. Why won't you actually educate yourself on the topic? Why do you have such a visceral reaction to something that the IPCC and James Hansen - one of the leading minds in climate science - says is VITAL to stopping global warming?\n\nWhen you fight against nuclear, you support the fossil-fuel agenda. \n\nZero Emissions at point of generation:\nhttps://www.c2es.org/2018/10/promising-solutions-for-zero-emission-nuclear-power/\n\nSustainable and Renewable (older article):\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/03/24/is-nuclear-power-a-renewable-or-a-sustainable-energy-source/#1fd18111656e\n\nNuclear is vital to defeating global warming:\nhttps://grist.org/article/its-time-to-go-nuclear-in-the-fight-against-climate-change/\n\nNuclear displaces fossil fuels faster than any other source:\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-world-really-could-go-nuclear/",

In CA the utilities are using the CPUC to discourage rooftop solar so they can justify building remote solar plants with long distance transmission.\nAs far as nuclear goes I don't think it is the environmentalists that want to shut plants ahead of schedule. The problem is economic. As long as gas plants do not have to pay for the externalized cost of their pollution some nuclear plants cannot even recover their operating costs so in a capitalist system they are not viable.",

"comment": "50kWh per day average is an insane amount of energy for a home, are you sure that's correct? For reference that's enough energy to move a 5000lb hunk of metal 200 miles every single day (based on a model S).\n\nWhen I lived in Florida, even in the peak of summer we'd only use about 30-40kWh per day with the AC running all the time. And that was at the absolute peak, I'd say our yearly average was something like 15-20kWh per day. Unless you have some heavy duty electrical appliances AND electric vehicles AND you like your big house to stay at 68 degrees, I doubt you'd average 50kWh for multiple days at a time.\n\nThe reason I'm pointing this out is because your requirement of 50kWh per day for 3-5 days is gonna cost you a lot of money in batteries. Like a couple hundred grand. You'd need at least 200kWh in batteries for cloudy winter days when you solar array is producing 10-20% of its rated output.\n\nIt'd be much more feasible if you could bring your usage down to 20-30kWh, especially in winter where your solar production will be lowest.  That will reduce your battery requirements significantly since your solar array would be able to handle a much greater proportion of your energy needs.",

"comment": "Tesla is consistently one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest, options for solar (and especially solar + battery). SunPower, on the other hand, is consistently one of the most expensive. Most installers will fall in-between the two. Part of what makes Tesla so cheap is that they automate, or attempt to automate, as much of the process as possible. They don't allow you to choose your own panels, inverters, etc. which you can do with many other installers. They basically decide what they think is best and do it. I think they also use \"string inverters\" which are cheaper than \"microinverters,\" but which don't allow for panel level monitoring. I wouldn't call Tesla a \"franken system\" more than any other option, but you are going to get a fairly one-size-fits-all approach to the entire process which may or may not work well for you. Ironically, SunPower also use their own hardware and don't give you many options, so Tesla and SunPower are similar in that regard.",

"comment": "NEM 3 removes all solar incentives for everyone except low income families and replaces it with a series of disincentives that penalize people for large systems and for not adding batteries. Their  stated goal is to increase the payback period from the current 3-5 years under NEM 2 to 10+ years. The utilities originally asked for a 17-20 year payback period. \n\nThis was about reducing competition and the threat rooftop solar posed to their outdated business model. There was no goal of raising x amount of money to improve grid infrastructure, add utility scale storage, or accelerate the pace towards hitting renewable energy goals that needed to have the costs spread out over all rate payers. Which would have been fair and understandable, everyone should share in the cost of building out a reliable, green, resilient grid. But they wanted to get the payoff period over 7 years which studies show is the tipping point between a homeowner wanting to go solar and deciding not to.",

"comment": "We’re spending a ton of money this year between installing solar panels, spraying our attic with foam insulation, installing a ducted heat pump system to reduce our heating oil usage and lastly, getting an EV. I have no idea what our ROI timeline is but I can’t get these projects done fast enough. The less fossil fuels we use as a family the better we’ll feel. Our ONLY regret is that we didn’t do these things sooner. If you combine solar with heat pumps and EV’s you drastically reduce the strain on your budget from these extreme market fluctuations as well. We’ll be retiring in the near future and predictability for our utilities is important for our budget. Solar helps reduce electric, oil and auto fuel if done right. Our oil bills from last winter were crazy high (we live in the north east). Reduce fossil fuel usage + budget stability = win/win",

There’s local fire code, NEC regulations, the BOS that is so commonly neglected by even experienced companies... The only guy I know that installed his own system said it was cheaper but he would never do it himself again because it took over 12 months to get the approvals and inspections completed, and had to go back to the drawing board over and over again. And he’s an inspector for the county he lives in. Lol.",

"comment": "It's a bit too early for solar panels on EVs to make much sense, but wouldn't be surprised if the next several years does make it sensible for some regions as vehicles become more efficient and solar panels get both more efficient and cheaper. \n\nSolar panels don't need to be the sole energy source for the EVs they are on, but rather a substantial enough portion versus the price of the option and the price for what solar panel additions there have been thus far are quite low and likely will remain such since integrating solar panels into vehicles don't incur the kind of soft and variable costs of regulations, siting, permits, etc. that solar panel on buildings and land incur. What's missing is that the panels need to generate more power and the vehicle needs to use less in order for this to roundly make sense.\n\nIn a sense, they're a bit analogous to getting the hybrid option for a traditional ICE powertrain where for a bit of extra cost, they provide a bit more overall efficiency in a sense or extend the time between needing to charge a vehicle or the amount of time and money spent on charging especially for people without access to charging at home.\n\nThe advantages of solar panels potentially go beyond that of the power they generate for a bit of extra miles / longer time between charging sessions, but potentially in a hedge of sorts against draining batteries down to 0% from parasitic losses and the like and thus damaging the battery, and potentially eating less into the duty cycles of the battery if some of the power generated and used never goes through the battery.",

"comment": "You're right (almost?)\n\n1. I confirmed with our local solar alliance in San Diego that monthly True-Up is a bad deal.  SDCP and most likely all of CalCCAs have awful default plans for solar owners that have offset a majority of their use.\n2. About prices, did you read [https://voiceofsandiego.org/2022/08/15/community-power-leaders-steaming-about-sdge-price-cut-right-before-consumers-compare-rates/](https://voiceofsandiego.org/2022/08/15/community-power-leaders-steaming-about-sdge-price-cut-right-before-consumers-compare-rates/) ?  I don't track this too often but can I be frank here?  Why isn't the CCA competitive on price? (because they don't have to!)\n3. As to renewables, last I checked into this, the default SDCP plan is 50% renewable and SDGE was 40%.  You can opt and pay for more renewables but as a rooftop solar owner with 140% offset with an EV and more, I think I'm doing fine.\n\nMy take on CalCCAs is they missed the mark as they are solar unfriendly and aren't always cheaper.",

Solar panels should be good for 25 years+, but failures do happen, and if you aren't closely monitoring the output (and even if you are), you might not notice the problems (e.g. failed bypass diodes, cracks, etc).\n\nSolar panels sold today are going to be larger and more efficient than the ones you installed in 2006 - by quite a bit. Whether it's a good financial decision to replace them if they are still working as expected depends on a few details - including whether or not you would need a new permit or interconnection agreement to do this, can you use your existing inverter or do you need to upgrade that as well, and if it would impact your net metering deal with your utility. Depending on all this - it might not be that much cheaper to your replace your system than to buy one new.",

"comment": "TL;DR of the whole thing...\n\n&gt; In this new report, we show that with the right societal choices these three disruptions can eliminate the overwhelming majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide within 15 years, and that market forces can be leveraged to do the bulk of the mitigation work because the technologies required are either already commercially available and competitive today, or can be deployed to market before 2025. This also means we can fight climate change while simultaneously saving trillions of dollars and fostering prosperity worldwide. Furthermore, these very same technologies will also make the cost of carbon withdrawal affordable, meaning that moonshot breakthrough technologies are not required to go beyond net zero from 2035 onwards. Regions, nations, cities, communities, businesses, and investors that choose to embrace and lead the disruptions will reap enormous economic and social rewards as well as environmental benefits, allowing less-developed areas to level the playing field and leapfrog over previous barriers to human development. Therefore, the greatest barrier to fighting climate change is our mindset. It is up to us to decide whether or not we deploy these technologies worldwide rapidly enough to avoid dangerous climate change.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWe already have the energy, transportation and food technologies needed to reduce over 90 percent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide in the next 15 years. With the right societal choices, we can stop climate pollution at the levels needed to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nTechnology disruptions over the course of history – including automobiles, cameras and smartphones – have happened quickly and exponentially, making legacy industries obsolete within 10 to 15 years. Adopting a technology disruption mindset will allow policymakers to recognize the speed of the most critical disruptions, making more informed choices about where to focus action for maximum impact.\n\nWe can achieve a net zero future – affordably, on time, and opening up huge opportunities for carbon-free prosperity – if policymakers make smart choices to enable these highest impact technologies and stop supporting legacy industries that are getting in the way. If they are not decisive in this regard, we’ll lose precious time in responding to this crisis which will mean far larger planetary risks and trillions of dollars worth of losses that are otherwise avoidable.\n\nPolicymaker choices should strategically target and support the highest impact technologies and avoid other “scattershot” climate approaches that are far more costly and unfeasible, such as clean coal and carbon capture, as well as remove barriers that are stymying disruptive technologies. This approach can allow markets to do the bulk of the deployment work.\n\n**Highest impact technology sector opportunities include:**\n\nENERGY: The largest, most immediate opportunity is in the energy sector (57.6 percent of GHGs) which is rapidly being transformed by affordable, scalable low-carbon technologies in the form of solar PVs, wind power and lithium-ion storage batteries.\n\nTRANSPORTATION: The transportation sector (16.2 percent of GHGs) will face dramatic disruptions as electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous EVs enable transportation-as-a-service and bring an end to internal combustion engines and private vehicle ownership.\n\nFOOD: Rapidly advancing technologies will drive disruption in the food sector (18 percent of GHGs) from precision fermentation and cellular agriculture, which will eventually replace meat and animal-based food products – freeing up the 2.7 billion hectares of land they rely on.\n\nEach of these energy, transportation and food technologies will achieve significant GHG reductions within their own sectors, but when factoring in the impact of various feedback loops between these sectors their potential is exponentially larger. For example: global virgin steel production, which accounts for 7 percent of global GHGs, will fall dramatically as transportation reductions reduce the number of vehicles on the road, as energy disruptions reduce the number of cargo ships needed to transport coal and oil in all parts of the world, and as scrap from obsolete combustion vehicles and oil industry infrastructure makes large volumes of recycled steel cheaply available.\n\nDisruptive technologies can help close the wealth and technology gaps between rich and poor countries. For example: rapidly scaling solar, wind and batteries would help deliver electricity to billions of people who have no electricity today.\n\n**The report outlines three different scenarios for policymakers:**\n\nTHE ‘GET SERIOUS’ SCENARIO: This most ambitious response, where policymakers proactively accelerate the disruption of energy, transportation and food technologies over the 2020s and reforest just 20 percent of land freed up by food sector disruptions, would enable a GHG emission decline of over 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent before 2035. The disruptions would also dramatically bring down the costs of carbon sequestration. By 2040, carbon emissions would be 20 percent below ‘net zero’ – good news indeed.\n\nTHE ‘BE SENSIBLE’ SCENARIO: By choosing to deploy and scale only those core technologies available today with positive economic impacts, humanity can achieve the GHG emissions reductions well within the timeline needed to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, as called for under the international Paris Climate Agreement. By removing barriers to deployment and support for incumbent monopolies, 90% GHG reductions can be achieved by 2035. We can then reach net zero by 2040 through passive reforestation on land freed up by the food disruptions, and can continue to drawdown carbon from the atmosphere below ‘net zero’ from there onwards. \n\nTHE ‘GET STUCK’ SCENARIO: Policymakers might unwittingly or otherwise delay the disruptions, an approach with some of the markings of our situation today, such as subsidies and financial support for fossil fuels, utility monopolies and the livestock sector, resulting in emissions rising for another five years and global temperatures exceeding 2 degrees – placing us squarely in the “climate danger zone.”\n\nThe report provides a decision-making framework to help policymakers evaluate the ‘mitigation-readiness’ of climate solution technologies. This will help them effectively target technologies that are commercially available and competitive today to achieve the largest, fastest emissions reductions.",

"comment": "Hi! First off, it's important to know the definition of veganism. Here's the definition from The Vegan Society (the founders of veganism):\n\n&gt;Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.\n\nAs you can see, the point of veganism isn't to abstain from animal products just for the sake of abstaining. Rather, it is the result of our beliefs that it is wrong to exploit animals, seeing as they (at least for the most part) can feel things like pain and pleasure. After all, you wouldn't want someone to breed and kill you just to eat and wear you, correct? So why is it o.k. to do that to someone else just because they are a different species?  \n\nWhile there is a chance that some of the material that is now the oil we use was originally part of animals (and the same goes for so much matter, not just oil!), the animals were dead many millions of years ago. It does not harm them in any way to use it, nor does it directly contribute to exploiting other animals as it does not encourage companies to breed more animals to be used for oil. Furthermore, avoiding using anything that might have ever been part of an animal even millions of years ago would be not only impractical, but impossible.   \n\nOf course, there are effects on other animals (ourselves included) whenever we use oil. And vegans are certainly aware of that. For that reason, we -- as well as non-vegans -- should try to limit our use of oil and our environmental impacts in general. But such indirect and usually unintentional damages are not unvegan in the same way that killing a cow to eat or wear is. \n\nOne thing that is often said is that, while there is ALWAYS more that we can and should do, veganism is the moral *baseline*. That is, the *least* we should try to do is to try our bests to avoid intentionally and unnecessarily contributing to animal exploitation.   \n\nI hope that answers your question!",

When I give someone this kind of answer I don't care very much if it sounds very impressive. In fact, I think it makes me sound stupid, but that is even better, because they will probably pity me for being so stupid and they will leave me alone.\n\nOf course, if someone is genuinely interested and open minded I'll give them as vivid a description of factory farming as I can manage in less than a minute.",

I don't see the connection, sorry.\n\nAs others have stated here, caring for animals involves time and effort (and money!) and if you don't do it right then it's likely the animals will die or fall ill, as seems to be the case in this article. Agreeing to rescue chickens should be a well thought out decision, not something that is jumped into without any education on how to properly care for chickens. This should hold for any animal. I wouldn't take in an animal that I did not know how to provide for or have enough money to care for. It's just common sense.",

"comment": "When I'm trying to get a good handle on a complex subject, I find a lot of value in repetition, in having the same info repackaged/re-articulated from a new perspective, so I'm finding a lot of value in this book. It's also a nearly point-for-point rebuttal of [The Obesity Myth](http://www.amazon.com/Obesity-Myth-Americas-Obsession-Hazardous/dp/1592400663), which I found fascinating and still highly recommend (maybe it's totally wrong; it's still interesting).\n\nI guess it just depends on your learning style/preference. For me, rolling around in information like a pig in mud seems to work (I have no idea where that analogy came from...).\n\nHere's my reading list from the last two years of food and food-related topics (no particular order, but with a couple favorites in bold):\n\n* **What to Eat - Marion Nestle**\n* The Omivore's Dilema - Michael Pollan\n* Animal, Vegetable, Miracle - Barbara Kingsolver\n* In Defense of Food - Michael Pollan\n* Food Matters - Mark Bittman\n* The End of Overeating - David Kessler\n* **Food Politics - Marion Nestle**\n* Mindless Eating - Brian Wansink\n* Real Food - Nina Planck\n* Last Chance to Eat - Gina Mallet\n* The Primal Feast - Susan Allport\n* The Queen of Fats - Susan Allport\n* Diet for a New America - J Robbins (I only started this, didn't finish it)\n* An Apple a Day - Joe Schwarcz\n* Fast Food Nation - Eric Schlosser\n* The Gospel of Food - Barry Glassner\n* The Obesity Myth - Paul Campos\n* The End of Food - Paul Roberts\n* **The Way We Eat - Peter Singer**\n* Ocean's End - Colin Woodard\n* **Eating Animals - Jonathan Safran Foer**\n* Skinny Bitch - Rory Freedman &amp; Kim Barnouin (I have to note, **I can't put into words how deeply I HATE this book**... but I read it. I even found a few parts motivating/reinforcing, despite overall just really, really, really hating this book. Sometimes I think there's value in reading a book you hate - helps you figure out what your own beliefs/values really are, helps you reexamine them.)\n\nThese books include a variety of perspectives, only a few really advocate veganism. I just found (and continue to find) it really valuable/interesting to keep reading, keep getting new perspectives. Our food system, environmental impact, sociology of food, human nutrition in general are all simply fascinating subjects to me.\n\nIf anyone has any other reading to recommend, please do share!!",

But sometimes now all I can get is a salad. I like looking up meal options before going out, so I know what I'm getting into (and if I should eat a snack before leaving, because all they have are salads!)\n\nI also recommend offering to bring a dish to family functions / parties. Websites like [VegWeb](http://vegweb.com) and [the Post Punk Kitchen](http://www.theppk.com/recipes/) have good recipes. Bringing a dish whenever the fam gets together takes pressure off the cook, and you're sure you'll have something to eat. Always tell the cook ahead of time, though so it doesn't look like you're being snooty (e.g. Hey, I can bring a special vegan side dish, to help out.)",

Nope.\nOk good that makes sense\nThen you follow that up with\nIf the animals you are responsible for become sick on vegan food, the best we can do for them is to have them euthanised, unless you consider it acceptable to release them into the wild, which I don't, but it's up for debate.\nRight there you state that the best we can do for them is to kill them which is not true. If you take a meat eating animal and decide to be hopelessly cruel and only throw lettuce and lentils at it and it gets sick your brilliant stand is to euthanize them! FYI encase your unclear euthanization is still killing something especially if the answer to make them \"better\" is to give them what they naturally eat. You are obviously either being contrary on purpose, dont understand your own view point or are simply to small minded to see how stupid you sound. Either way it appears that you are just one of the many veggie fags that isnt interested in actually trying to make a difference and I have nothing more to say to someone like that.\n\nYou entire second paragraph can only result from a failure to read/comprehend my second sentence: \"It's morally wrong to kill many (or even one) animal to feed another animal.\"\n\nFuck off and die, you worthless, illiterate, homophobic cunt.

Discussions here, disagreements there... and essentially me just being fed-up.\n\nI think we've gotten to a point where being passionate about something to any degree is bad, and I disagree with that. I find it odd that we are conditioned by fellow vegans to stand back and let people turn something we are passionate and feel so strongly about into a fad diet. I don't understand why those who this is important for are should stand back while those who couldn't care less are left free reign.\n\nMostly I am sick and tired of having to back away, be quiet and accept the bastardization of the things I feel most strongly about.\n\nFor me this isn't about being more vegan than someone else, it's about being vegan period. If you care about the ethical philosophy and you follow that as far as possible and practicable then that's where it is at. My main gripe is with those who don't care about ethics at all calling themselves vegan and those who say we should sit down and let them.",

I'm not going to be biased against vegan and vegetarian lifestyle, although I still believe that we are omnivores and are supposed to be eating other species, but there isn't really any point in battling pests when all they do is parasite on your home, at the very least. I am not really aware of effective pro-nature methods of repelling roaches, mosquitos, termites etc. which will at the same time let you live in peace with your surroundings. I, for one, cannot stand of the fact that I'm too sweet for mosquitos so they always bite me first, and I try to protect myself as much as possible.\n\nSo yeah, just trying to express my point, however if you disagree with me we can argue.",

I'm sorry that you've been downvoted and that everyone is throwing these questions at you, but I supposed that's to be expected when you post about eating animal products in a vegan subreddit. You were brave to do that, and I respect you for being honest and open. I am genuinely interested in your point of view and your habits. So, thank you for sharing your thoughts and responding here. \n\nThank you. I appreciate that, quite a lot. No need to sympathize about the downvotes; my point of view is something folks here find offensive. As you say, it's to be expected.\n\nI very much appreciate both your approach, and your interest in giving me more information. Thank you. More information is always good. Do you believe there are no farms producing meat from animals that have been *well treated throughout their lives? If so, why do you think so?\n\n*Fed, watered, given mostly free choice about shelter vs. outside, clean, uncrowded shelters, etc. [Leave poultry out of the mix, please; I'd like to do some more research on debeaking first..]",

Most vegans want to be able to buy all vegan products at the grocery store/farmers market, so they hope that their refusal to buy animal products creates the demand for more vegan products (which is already happening whether people are doing it for ethical, environmental, or health reasons).",

"comment": "&gt; Before the change I could get any cut I wanted, I could ask the butcher would go back and cut me a special size of roast or a few thicker steaks\n\nI've been cutting meat for 6 years now. We don't like to do stuff like this anymore because it's usually not the best use of our time just to cut one special order for one customer(if you do it for one you have to do it for everyone) just because it's precut doesn't mean the quality sucks, just use your eyes and pick a nice pack. And typically vacuum packed meat is brown and dark, not bright and red. It blooms when you open the package because myoglobim can bind to oxygen again. Tonnes of food is vacuum packed, I don't know why meat is an issue. Tofu comes vacuum packed and I eat a lot of it and you probably do as well.\n\n&gt;This is when I was told by my friendly butcher who was about to lose his job about the \"meat glue\" that they use\n\nThis isn't really a thing, It's more efficient to just turn scraps in to ground beef. \n\n&gt;but you start realise that everything you are putting into your body is produced in a factory, and has a commercial and marketing attached to it...and it no longer seems like \"real\" food anymore.\n\nWell, you shouldn't probably romanticize food so much",

If not, I highly suggest you watch is, it's very informative, down-to-earth, and speaks about veganism in a very truthful way.\n\nIf you're looking to lose weight, I'd suggest you eat a Whole-foods vegan diet, which includes: whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and seeds. \n\nExamples of legumes are lentils, beans, chikpeas and peas. They are high in protein, high in iron, and many other important nutrients.\n\nTry [Challenge22.com](https://Challenge22.com).

And that the average person in my department who starts lasts 12 days. \n\nAnd I know a lot of it is ignorance as to what a vegan diet is and food preparation and all of that, but that’s a separate issue that, again, isn’t really relevant to the fact that there are millions of people who say “veganism is too hard” or “too expensive” when the truth is they have zero desire to look into pursuing it. Of course there are people who can’t help it. This meme wasn’t targeted to them. That’s all I made this for. Not for people who legitimately have deeper issues relating to why they can’t or “can’t” eat plant-based.",

"comment": "This makes me so happy! I was 10 when I made the connection between animals being killed and meat, but I went vegetarian first, and vegan some time later.\n\nLuckily my parents had previously been vegetarian so they were familiar with the nutritional principles and many great recipes, and I was supported by my parents.\n\nI would recommend checking out Ginny Messina (books and website) for vegan nutritional information. The main principles are: lots of variety, lots of greens, think about Vit D, Calcium in particular, and supplement B12. \n\nFor food I would recommend finding some staple recipes that work for the whole family. Why not have all the kids eat lentils/beans/tofu a couple of times a week? \n\nSome recipes that come to mind:\n\n* Spaghetti with red lentil sauce [https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/1446352/spaghetti-with-lentil-and-tomato](https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/1446352/spaghetti-with-lentil-and-tomato) (use nutritional yeast or vegan cheese in place of the cheese, or just skip it). \n* Shepherdess pie with lentils (lots of recipes online)\n* Mung dahl and rice (wonderful comfort food)\n* Chestnut/nut loaf for festive occasions\n* Ratatouille lasagne [https://vegancocotte.com/vegan-ratatouille-lasagna/](https://vegancocotte.com/vegan-ratatouille-lasagna/) \n\n  \nI would also recommend:\n\n* Finding vegan treats so that your child is not left out when there is ice cream etc. There are LOADS of things available now. It is super easy to veganise a lot of baked goods by using vegan recipes [https://www.instructables.com/The-BEST-chococlate-cake-ever...that-happens-to-be/](https://www.instructables.com/The-BEST-chococlate-cake-ever...that-happens-to-be/) or using aqua faba in place of eggs and soy/nut milk and vegan margarine. I saw that you're in Canada so I will also recommend Dreena Burton's recipes. \n* Not allowing jokes about veganism. This of course depends on your family and the level of jokes and what kind of person your child is, but for myself I was always hurt when people joked about cooking my food with meat or contaminating it somehow, or why couldn't I pick things off my food. Also this is a moral choice so don't ask your child to have non-vegan food at their birthday party or whatever.\n* Finding good school lunch options and talking to your kid's school. My experience was a long time ago but one of the worst things about it was meals on school trips where we (veggies) were a total afterthought and the food we were given was totally inedible sometimes. I think the world has changed quite a bit but still it's something you might want to get ahead of. \n* Talking to your child's friend's parents and maybe even giving them recipe ideas for sleepovers etc (maybe these aren't happening right now because of the pandemic, but when they do). \n* Involving your child in cooking a simple meal, like pasta and sauce, or vegan cookies, so that they start to develop confidence and tools in the kitchen. \n* It might also be worth finding a family doctor who is supportive. Again I think things will be better now than 30 years ago, but still you don't want to be fighting your GP, you want to be getting sensible advice if any issues arise (I am not saying there are health issues when going vegan but some doctors are quite anti-veganism and might attribute any health issues to a vegan diet).   \n\n\nThis is all I can think of right now but feel free to message with questions if you like!",

You don't say 'live and let live' to a murderer. Or a rapist. Or even a mugger. If someone is doing something unethical and causing harm to another we as a society generally do something about that. It should be no different with animals. \n\nRegardless you cannot say you love something if you pay to have it killed so that you can eat it.\n\n&gt;There's no difference between you and t_d. \n\nYep. No difference between 'don't hurt others' and 'hurt all the others.' Very clear. \n\n&gt;It's not an ethics conversation\n\nIt is. Veganism is about ethics.\n\n&gt;I just wish you'd do a little self reflecting\n\nIn fact, I'd wager I've done a lot more self-reflecting about my personal ethics, and especially how they relate to diet. Because I chose to resist the indoctrination to treat sentient beings as a commodity. You can do the same, with a bit of reflection. We'd all be happy to help you.\n\n&gt;People can love babies and be pro-choice\n\nPeople can't say they love babies if they pay people to kill babies so that they can eat their corpses. Abortion can be necessary. Fetuses are not sentient for the majority of their development. It's wrong to harm animals because they are sentient beings. This comparison is absurd.\n\n&gt;I can't even with vegans.\n\nThen maybe don't come on a vegan subreddit and spout a bunch of tired carnist lines that were no more insightful today than they were in the 40s.",
