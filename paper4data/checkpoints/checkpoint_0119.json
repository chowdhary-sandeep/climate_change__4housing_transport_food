"comment": "Yay, a question I can answer! More or less...\n\n\nSo, first things first, it looks like you've got yourself a DC motor there, which is cheaper and simpler to set up than an AC motor.  It does have the downside that it doesn't easily allow for regenerative braking.  That said, there are modifications you can add (which you might be able to add later) that will allow for it, so let's go with that.\n\nNext is the question of battery capacity.  First thing to consider is the voltage of battery packs.  The two factors when it comes to performance of an electric motor seems to be Voltage and Amperage.  Voltage translates to the \"knee\" of the motor's performance, where the torque curve drops off.  Amperage, on the other hand, seems to translate to how much torque you have access to.  So in order to have decent torque at higher than, say, 2000 rpm, you're going to want more than just 12v, as your Litium Iron battery you linked has.  In fact, you should always try to match your battery pack voltage to your motor/controller as best you can.  So given your choice of motor, you're going to want the nominal voltage of your battery pack to be 48v.  Can't find a 48 volt battery pack?  No problem, get 4 battery packs at 12v each and wire them in series.\n\nYou asked about range, as well. When it comes to electric motors, the rule of thumb seems to be that it takes 0.1 Wh to move 1 pound of vehicle 1 mile.  So, put another way, your triumph is going to get about 5 miles per kWh.   That means that in order to get your desired 40mi range, you're going to want 8kWh of battery.  For optimal battery health, you'd probably do well to give it a bit of a buffer, so you're not looking at draining from 100% down to 0% capacity to get that range.  So let's call it about 9-10kWh.  Given your 48v system, that translates to about 200 ah, for a 9.6kWh system.  That'd do you nicely, but to achieve that with the battery pack you selected, you would need 4 of them, which is almost your entire budget right there.  Instead, I recommend you buy salvaged [Leaf batteries,](http://hybridautocenter.com/HAC4/index.php?option=com_hikashop&amp;ctrl=category&amp;task=listing&amp;cid=14&amp;name=lithium-batteries-and-packs&amp;Itemid=605) which, when wired as a 45v system at 240ah, will allow you about twice the range-per-dollar that the battery pack you've listed would. \n\n\nAnother question is whether you're going to be happy with that charger you've got there.  That thing's rated at 60v 20a, which means that if you *do* use a full 8kWh in a given day (which is much more likely to happen in the winter), it's going to take somewhere around 6h40m to charge you back up.  Is that enough for you?  If all you're doing is commuting less than 15 miles to and from work, sure.  Especially if you're allowed to charge while at work and/or have an alternate vehicle while you're charging.  But if it gets particularly cold where you are, I'd probably want a beefier charger, so that you could hit up one of the [L2 charging stations in your area](http://www.plugshare.com/#) and be able to top off from nearly empty to completely full in less than an hour.\n\nThere are a few questions about your design that your prospective purchases don't answer.\n\n* What you're planning to do about transmission?  Are you going direct drive, or is there going to be a transmission between the motor and the drive axle?  That's another potential cost, there.  \n* Have you planned on a DC/DC converter, to run all the things in your 12v system (lights, radio, etc)?\n* What are you going to do about climate control?  ICE's bleed heat like nothing which is normally used to heat the cabin.  EV's don't have that source of heat, and any heater will directly cut into range.\n* Are you planning to include a maintenance switch, so that you can cut the circuit without having to manually remove one of the cables?\n* How about an Big Red Button (emergency disconnect)?\n* What's your plan for charging connection?  Standard wall plug?  Or do you want to have a J1772 plug so that you can us the various charging stations around?\n* Are you planning on using a battery monitoring system, or doing the battery leveling trick?\n\n\nSo, all told, you're a low in the cost of batteries (though high in the cost per kWh), you look like you might not have considered everything you're going to need, and you don't really have any \"fudge factor\" in your $6k budget, but for an absolute minimum \"this will get me on the road\" **I would probably factor in an additional $2-3k.**   I'm working on an AC motor version myself and my budget (assuming about twice the battery capacity, and using the more expensive AC system, with better performance than I'd expect out of your DC system), my calculations come out to roughly $15k, so I'm budgeting $20k.\n\n\nIncidentally, where are you based?  Because a number of cities have Electric Vehicle associations, with lots of folks who are even more knowledgeable about this sort of thing than I am.",

"comment": "Note: I am not a tax expert, but I play one on TV\n\nThe 30% federal tax credit takes the gross cost of your Solar Installation (Equipment + Labor + Permitting + Tax + Change Orders) and gives 30% of that to you as a Tax Refund. At the end of the year you (your installer will help) file a form with the IRS and they will credit you back that amount in taxes. If your tax liability is less than the tax credit, you can carry over the remainder for (I believe) 5 years.\n\nTax credit as a 'down payment' is really a trick of accounting. Essentially, you would need to have the Solar Installer buy the system, install it on your house, take the tax credit for themselves, and charge you the remainder. I have never seen this type of transaction outside of a Solar PPA (think Solar City) type of deal, where the Installer owns the system and sells you the electricity.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Solar Incentives, the Dsire website is a great resource: http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/",

In terms of % of worldwide vehicle production, it's not even a distinguishable \"blip\" on any scale. Do any analysis of the total money invested, versus the actual output and it's a grotesque \"cash burning\" and entirely impractical, non-profit making company.\n\n&gt;And they are also a privately traded company, are they not? \n\nAs far as being a \"successful STOCK\", well yes it has been that, but many other firms -- say Enron, WorldCom, etc -- have likewise been high-flying investment \"successes\"...\n\n&gt;So then how is that an ignorant statement?\n\nThe ignorance is in regard to imagining that it exists in anything LIKE a \"free market\". Without a whole array of rather substantial subsidies and \"eco-credit\" systems (not to mention the massive \"thumb on the scale\" of the Fed in terms of the stock market), the company would have gone bankrupt long ago.\n\nTesla isn't an \"exception\" to the stupidity of governments subsidizing so called \"alternate energy\"... in fact it's sort of the poster boy for it.",

It looks a bit like a Nissan [Versa Note](http://www.kansascity.com/cars/d27ps0/picture774032/ALTERNATES/FREE_640/19Note.jpg) or a Prius C. \n\nIt's practical and not as small as the Spark, but it has a look that screams \"budget car\". I have no idea how Tesla plans to get to the same price point with the 3 without just bleeding money but if they stick to a more standard sedan look I would definitely be more inclined to lean more towards the 3 even if it costs a bit more.",

And there isn't a supercharger network from the US to China.\n\nSo while I like the engineering of the Tesla, I really think GM has something with the Bolt.\n\n\nThey are projecting 30k Bolt Builds at the end of the year (and they have the knowitall/equipment etc. to do this) The Bolt is being build on the same Assy line as the regular cars so need more? Add more.\n\nI think the Bolt will cause some Tesla $1000 deposits to be refunded.",

I think one avenue to solving that is to make 220/240v receptacles required in garages for new construction (it would be best if a versatile type was made standard here).  Then EV manufacturers could include a 110v/220v charger instead.\n\nObviously most people don't live in brand new homes, but it would be a step in the right direction.\n\nEVs already come with a 110v trickle charger, which is how I charged my Leaf for the better part of a year before getting L2 installed in the garage.

The five-door technology study is 4.88 metres (16.0 ft) long, 1.93 metres (6.3 ft) wide and just 1.54 metres (5.1 ft) high. Its coupé-like silhouette with the extremely flat greenhouse that tapers strongly toward the rear lends it a very dynamic appearance.\"\n\nEdit: Also says it  has 300 miles range, but I think thats the annoying WLTP number. Real world is probably 250 miles\n\nEdit2: Yup, they even confirmed it. 250 miles range. https://electrek.co/2018/04/20/audi-e-tron-quattro-realistic-range-of-250-miles-faraday-cage/",

There is a reasonably significant difference here.\n\n* The Model 3 will not cost close to £27k, I assume you've directly converted from USD, but UK car prices always work out more. I'd suggest using a car with a known price, versus a similar car\n E.g. Nissan Leaf vs VW Golf, or Renault Zoe vs Clio\n\n* As others have mentions, consider residuals, this negatively impacts EVs. One option here is to use monthly cost from finance agreements (i.e. lease, PCP, HP). It'll be easier to calculate the TCO for a given period, and is representative of how many people buy new cars.\n\n* Electricity cost. Is it really that high? Highest I saw in my area (SW England), was 14.6p/kWh, and significantly cheaper at night. Consider that a lot of people charge at night with cheaper electricity. Also consider free public charging - a lot of people have free to use chargers at work.\n\n* Servicing. Generally EV service intervals are far longer than ICEs\n\n* Not to do with your calculations, but maybe link is to a read only Google Sheets. It would make it easier to play around and read than a big screenshot",

"comment": "I think the general premise is that they could have done better, and they got so close but so far. With the resources they have they *should* have done better, especially with the benefit of hindsight from other manufacturers.\n\n* The car is really inefficient, with its 90kWh battery it should be pushing 300 miles of range instead of not much over 200.\n\n* It has no 3 phase charging, so in Europe its slow to charge when not using a rapid charger. If you plugged one into an 11kW type 2 charger it'd only charge at 3.6kW and take an age.\n\n* Jaguar haven't invested in any kind of supplementary charging network, and while we're still at the early adopter stage for EVs this is really important. In a lot of places the fastest you can charge one is 50kW because faster stations outside of Teslas supercharger network don't exist. They could/should have bought in to get access to the Tesla network or built/invested in another network.",

"comment": "Fuel cells must be warmed up to be used before they will produce power. This can range from a few hundred to a few thousand degrees depending on the type of cell. Every fuel cell application in a vehicle would therefore require a battery because nobody is going to sit around for a couple of minutes waiting for their engine to start. It also makes it hard to throttle the engine off or on like a hybrid. Add to this that fuel cells require a lot of platinum to work, making them pretty expensive. For the added expense and complexity, you could add a much bigger battery to the application before the cost is the same. The benefit of fuel cell only comes in situations where power is not available at the destination or in transit, but that kind of kills one of the main arguments of hydrogen, that being it can be made anywhere there is electricity and water. \n\nBattery tech will only get better, and I look to the next gen roadster for where the industry will be in a decade... reportedly 600 miles on a single charge. The practical limit of either technology has not been found yet but hydrogen is definitely falling behind. It's economic viability is already a hard sell, with 27% of the energy into the system devoted to making the vehicle go as opposed to something like 86% for BEVs.",

"comment": "&gt;Rivian R1T\n\nProbably my biggest issue with the truck is that a lot of infrastructure of chargers right now are limited to 6.6 or 7.2 kW. The 180kW pack will take a day or more to charge up completely. It makes them ineffective for longer trips to areas where fast charging infrastructure doesn't exist, part of what I find appealing about an electric vehicle that can go 400 miles on one charge.  \n\n\nA trip I'd like to take is around 580 miles from home with the only fast charger anywhere near the route being about 50 miles in. I'd have to stop for 12 hours minimum at a slow charger to even make it to my destination with no battery left, as the only slow charging infrastructure on the way is very limited as well. Then another 24 hours charging there, and another 12 to get home. Really a hard pill to swallow. Hopefully the infrastructure on this route will improve.",

Plus can you imagine a Bolt owner charging at a Supercharger and realizing that their car gets no where near the charge as even a standard range plus Model 3 which —- I believe —- is the Tesla with the lowest charge rate? Even the new Ford Mustang is going to get only about 100 kW. And the upcoming VW ID.4...only 125 kW. These companies aren’t even building new cars that are putting in specs to “future proof” themselves. Say what you want about Tesla but paying attention to the future is one of its key assets.",

"comment": "If it's based on EV only platform or shared platform has very little to do with efficiency. Hyundai and Kia EVs are very efficient and so is Mini Cooper SE.\n\nMagna made a I-Pace prototype with 367 mi WLTP range with the same battery pack. Normal I-Pace has WLTP range of  292 miles.\n\n[https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127584\\_prototype-drive-magna-e4-ev-is-a-300-mile-jaguar-i-pace-with-reworked-dynamics](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127584_prototype-drive-magna-e4-ev-is-a-300-mile-jaguar-i-pace-with-reworked-dynamics)\n\nI-Pace is based on ground up EV plaform but it doesn't have a fantastic efficiency. What's hurting its efficiency is that it has two PMS motors. Correct me if I'm wrong but a PMS motor can't freewheel without significant losses in efficiency  like an induction motor. I think that's why Polestar 2 and I-Pace are inefficient. That's also Bjorn's theory. Some AWD EVs use combination of PMS motors and induction motors. PMS motor at the rear and an induction motor at the front so the car can mostly drive on a more efficient PMS motor when cruising.\n\n&gt;It is interesting that Audi has opted for a blend of motor types in the Q4. The rear motor is a permanent magnet unit, while the front is an asynchronous induction type. With the front motor only in use some of the time, an induction motor means there will be no associated losses due to magnets in the unused motor.\n\n[https://www.enginetechnologyinternational.com/news/new-engine/audi-equips-q4-sportback-e-tron-with-pm-and-induction-motors.html](https://www.enginetechnologyinternational.com/news/new-engine/audi-equips-q4-sportback-e-tron-with-pm-and-induction-motors.html)\n\nTeslas and VW's MEB platform use this configuration.\n\n[Great article on this topic](https://cutt.ly/ogw1gtn)\n\nAudi E-Tron and Mercedes EQC use an induction motor at the rear and at the front. They could improve the efficiency by swaping the rear induction motor with a PMS motor.\n\nThere is maybe even more efficient configuration but it's more expensive. Two PMS motors but one can be deactivated with a clutch. That's the configuration that Magna's I-Pace prototype used. It looks like future Mercedes EVs might also use this configuration because they have a 2-speed gearbox. They can deactivate/decouple one motor with a clutch.\n\nAnd of course efficiency can be improved with more efficient inverters, BMS, tires and so on.\n\nWe don't know yet if EQA and EQB have the same configuration as EQC.",

"comment": "I have a deposit on both the Model Y and the ID4 AWD. Tesla gave me an overnight loaner test drive on the Model Y, which may have inadvertently pushed me towards the ID4 based on one thing alone, the suspension. The Model Y suspension is harsh. You feel both the bump and the car’s reaction to the bump, kind of a strange feedback loop where it jerks backwards after each bump. Not a problem on nice roads but on secondary roads it was brutal. The ID4 suspension is much nicer in comparison. All the other very cool things about the Model Y starts to fade away if you hate the ride quality. \r  \n\r  \nImpressions of both cars:\r  \n\r  \n\\-Model Y: \r  \n•\tAcceleration is crazy fast, could get in trouble if you lack impulse control\r  \n•\tHas much greater range AND a heat pump, useful for Colorado winters\r  \n•\tSoftware better hands down, and the autopilot and FSD modes are both incredible. It was driving itself through a very curvy Colorado canyon road (but I wouldn’t be in the backseat lol). However, autopilot has been known to stop at shadows under bridges. Nothing like slamming on brakes on an interstate for no reason. That’s a big issue IMO. I didn’t experience this though. \r  \n•\tTouchscreen is obviously better, more responsive. Think Ipad vs. Garmin touchscreen.\r  \n•\tMissed touch controls. Hard to find things, even after driving it for a day. Not a deal killer, but I like seeing speed, etc. directly in front of me. There is a reason this is a feature on the Model X and S --- people prefer it. \r  \n•\tCounterintuitive to look at the screen, then the mirrors for lane change. ID.4 lights on mirrors (big orange warning flash) is way better and safer IMO. It’s cool looking at the Tesla screen to see cars around you, but not as safe for actually making a lane change. Perhaps that takes training but looking at two spots for one action is less safe and takes more time. \r  \n•\tSound system is really, really, really good. Let me repeat – better than anything I’ve ever heard. \r  \n•\tGames, etc. in car is an overrated feature. I played a couple but I’m not really a gamer. I’d probably be on my phone while charging up. \r  \n•\tI like the frunk, useful for take-out or locking stuff up securely. The back also has a deeper storage space, also very useful. \r  \n•\tMore noise from back without a cargo cover. \r  \n•\tSeats are comfy but narrow, and I like the center arm rest much better than the fold down arm-rest in the ID.4, which is too narrow in my opinion (who keeps their arms that close to the seat?)\r  \n•\tI much prefer the interior aesthetics, storage, chargers (which worked on my iphone with apple mag-connect case)\r, compared to ID4  \n•\tDidn’t feel a difference between the 19 and 20 inch wheels, suspension very harsh regardless. \r  \n•\tNo radar. Do cameras really work better than radar? Yes, evidently. Do I trust it though? Not sure. Radar better if no visibility. \r  \n•\tLower suspension compared to ID4 (by 1.3 inches approx.) is less good in deep snow (Colorado gets some big snows on occasion).\r  \n\r  \n\\-ID.4:\r  \n•\tAcceleration anemic unless AWD version (which is what I would get, plus need AWD for snow). AWD version is quick (6 seconds 0-60 is plenty fast for 99.9% of driving, and faster than my 2018 GTI).\r  \n•\tLess range. Yes, it’s a big deal, and Electrify America has a lot of work to catch up to the supercharger network. Check out the maps for both and you’ll understand. Also, while there is a rumor (Elon confirmed) that the superchargers will be opened up to non-Teslas, this is going to be years away. Why? 1) software and 2) the superchargers charge at a much higher rate than the VW can currently accept. So not holding my breath on that. \r  \n•\tSuspension is much better. I can’t really overstate this enough. I was actively swearing at the Tesla for it’s bumpy ride.\r  \n•\tHas radar – better for low visibility areas that cameras can’t see through. \r  \n•\tSoftware not as good, and touchscreen not great either, BUT: if you use Tesla navigation, it doesn’t crowdsource traffic info the way Apple maps does, so it will route you to high traffic situations and not show red on the mapping software. That’s a big fail IMO. Tesla navigation shows blue lines in traffic that is completely stopped. I think I prefer Apple Carplay.   \n•\tSound system not as good as Telsa, which is best in class. But it hardly sounds bad. Also, Tesla requires a cell signal for both navigation and radio (that’s a problem in places I drive sometimes). Apple maps can continue on GPS alone if needed. Sirius radio is satellite based, so no need for LTE. \r  \n•\tPro S Gradient rims are way sexier than the Model Y rims (IMO)\r  \n•\tBrakes are squishy. I think there is a kitchen sponge between the pedal and the actual brakes, which you need a lot more often than Model Y since there is not 100% regen, even in regen mode. However, one pedal driving is overrated, because while you don’t have to switch your foot back and forth, you do have to keep constant pressure to avoid being jerked around quite a bit. Tesla rep confirmed to me yesterday that there is no longer different regen modes, only the strongest mode, which can make passengers feel sick (my girlfriend last night, for example, after a couple hours in the Tesla, did feel bad with the jerking, although in fairness I’m not a one-pedal expert lol). \r  \n•\tDo you really have to reset the ID.4 each time you get in to turn off the auto lane departure feature that shakes the steering wheel when you get in? That sucks. In the GTI I could turn off and leave off, and I only ever turned it on for long highway trips. That said, the Tesla also shakes the wheel a bit when you lane change without a signal, and can’t turn off there either. \r  \n•\tBrown dash for black interior: WTF? Beyond ugly, and the only other option is white seats. This alone was almost a deal killer. But I swore at it less than the Tesla suspension, which is THE WORST. Turns out there are quite a few Model Y owners trying to change their suspension.\r  \n•\t$: For 10K less plus free charging you don’t have to swear over every bump. ID4 it is for me.",

"comment": "Yea, so I think a lot of people would say $3/W cash is reasonable. So $15k **pre tax credit**. Many installers will add say 20% for financing and give you a 2.99% loan. That would be $18,252 total, $12,776.40 financed (you pay the $5.5k tax credit). And you'd have something like $88/mo for 15 years, not 25, over the lifetime that's over $14k less paid for the same system.\n\nThat SunRun deal works out to basically $23.5k if you bought it out immediately (understanding they pay the tax credit)",

While the public mistakenly presumes that this federal agency is hard at work conducting complicated tests on every new model of truck, van, car, and SUV, in reality, just 18 of the EPA’s 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in Ann Arbor, Michigan, examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year, or roughly 15 percent of new models. As to that other 85 percent, the EPA takes automakers at their word—without any testing—accepting submitted results as accurate.",

So I've almost 100% supercharged for the last 6 years, which isn't great on the batteries. While the EcoFlow unit has a pretty massive capacity by power station standards (4096 wh) with expandability up to 12 kwh with expansion batteries, that's still far less than most EV's battery capacity. It's more useful for emergency charging. I used it just to finally give my Tesla some slow charging after almost never slow charging. It can do with 120v or 240v.",

I understand the DC logic that there are no conversion losses but I thought they charged on AC?  Or does the level 2 charger convert it to DC before charging the the EV.  Sorry, don't have one yet, but I am getting a 14.4 kw system now.  Just curious",

I had thousands of dollars of solar panels sitting on my roof that I couldn't turn on.\n\n* That they'd need access to a couple other areas inside my house: a spot on a wall near an outlet to install the monitoring system (about as big as a shoebox) and then an outlet near my router and a router port for online system monitoring.\n\n* A better explanation of the inefficiencies in the sytem - ex: when they say you have a 3.0 kW system, how much that will really produce (not 3.0 kWh).",

Put simply, people should install solar now so they qualify for net metering.  Mark my words, in the future, most states will do away with net metering for new customers.  In fact, at least one state, Hawaii, has already done that.\n\nThree years ago, I purchased my PV system for $40,000 (well actually $43,582.42).  After state and federal tax incentives, that amount came down to about $20,000. \n\nIf I were to purchase the same system today, it would cost about $10,000 after the state and federal incentives.  \n\nOver the three years, I probably have not saved more than $10,000 in electricity.  However, purchasing solar was still a great decision because I qualified for net metering.  \n\nSee, after I installed my system, my state did away with net metering for new solar customers.  If I waited, as you have proposed, I would not have qualified for net metering.  And that would have been a disaster. \n\nIn addition, certain neighborhoods were already reaching capacity for PV systems and the electric company was preventing new people from getting PV.  So, waiting for prices to drop would also have been a bad idea under that scenario.",

Which meant no matter how cheap panels are, the battery cost will always inhibit it.\n\nBattery production and R&amp;D has been astronomical in the last 10 years. If we can solve batteries, we can fix 60% of the world's problems. We just need to get the price vs weight vs capacity metric to move the ways. That being said, a 100kwh battery pack in your 2002 Prius would have been the size of a Uhaul. Now it slides under a Model S in the same footprint that used to max out at 75, 85, then 90 kwh.

"comment": "That's an interesting idea that being alive is inherently harmful, let's go along with that for the sake of a discussion. If being alive is inherently harmful then suffering and destruction is unavoidable to a certain degree. The key is that degree. The destructive impact that humans have on this world is not black and white. It's not whether you are destructive or you are not, it's to which degree you are destructive. There are ways to reduce that degree and just because you can not eliminate it completely doesn't mean you shouldn't try. It is not all or nothing because it would be impossible to not cause harm to this planet unless you are dead. Even then that is debatable. \nBeing vegan could be a way to inflate our ego and pretend that we are good people, but even if that is the case being vegan still helps reduce our ecological footprint.  It's actually agreed upon by most scientists that reducing the amount of factory farmed animals reduces the ecological footprint of humanity. On the other hand, people who are vegan because they want to reduce their footprint generally care about other ways in which we can reduce the destructive impact that humanity has on the world.  \nBeing vegan is a way of addressing the destructive impact of humanity on the world. It is actually one of the most direct ways. It is important to help in anyway you can. So eat less animals products, garden, install solar panels on your home, and eat organic food;  but don't discredit one solution out of many because they all help.",

You would have to have less than 40 amps of load on it though, which is unlikely.    \nEmergency panels usually have things like lights, fridge a few outlets on them, but not heatpumps, water heaters, stoves, laundry etc.",

Spend millions in propaganda and political donations to save billions in taxes. It's simple.” \n\nI just saw this and I have to answer. You are obviously too young and ignorant to understand the complexity of reality. Big oil won’t be affected by carbon tax. They won’t be the ones paying it and you are still be using your vehicles, smartphones, fridges. You have no alternatives as we speak for most of your energy needs. Costs are going to befall on the citizenry not oil producers. Have you seen airplanes, trains or ships powered by renewables lately? \n\nHaving said that even current renewable energy solutions are produced by using fossil fuels. At this point only nuclear is a feasible alternative source of energy at the grid level and at the grand scale that’s needed. One nuclear plant produces energy that’s the equivalent of an area of solar panels carpeting a state as large as Maine. \n\nMoreover renewables can’t be stored easily. They have to be supplied right away in real time or it’s “game over”. It’s like you never produced it. Reality is unimaginably more complex than you think. It’s a more plausible scenario to assume that big oil and governments go hand-to-hand in this than the latter fighting the former. In any case I literally put my money where my mouth is.",

The difference? I live like that and I don't need to sign a sub just to participate on cycle jerking.",

So you basically multiply wind, snow and earthquake loads when designing the support system. This makes them more expensive than equivalent commercial solar arrays on say, a dog food warehouse, and might mean that the school building itself can’t support the system, especially for an older school.",

My EV is charged 100% on renewables from either my own solar power or our 100% certified carbon zero grid supplier.

"comment": "&gt;There are countless ways to rationalize why somebody is already doing enough. \"I drive a hybrid\", \"I recycle and compost\", \"I have solar panels\", etc.\n\nThis is why more people need to do a little, rather than a few people doing a lot.  Eventually people look around and realize that they really aren't doing anything special by recycling or composting or whatever if everybody else is also doing that.  So they try to be more environmentally friendly, this cycle repeats and eventually drastically reduces the harm done to both animals and the environment.  At least that's my hypothetical anyway.\n\n&gt; What *is* motivating you to do so is recognizing animal cruelty for what it is, and recognizing this is a moral imperative every time you have a choice of food to eat\n\nWell, sort of, the primary driving factor for me has always been the environment, and as far as I'm aware veganism is the most environmentally friendly diet.  My point was more that it's easy to look and see that something's messed up if you don't participate in it.\n\n&gt; it is not very effective at motivating veganism \n\nWhile I disagree, i think it is more effective than telling people that cows feel pain, or recording videos of slaughterhouses, or showing cute pig videos on the internet\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

"comment": "So you need to run at least a 36V battery in order for that 40A charge controller to handle the full peak panel output, right? Since 48V inverters are more common than 36V, go with a 48V battery bank and run your panels in series-parallel, 2X2.\n\nYour 660W air conditioner requires 17A at 48V assuming 80% overall efficiency from battery to AC. Most of the time the solar panels will be providing more charging current than the AC draws, so the batteries will remain fully charged. When clouds come over, the batteries pick up the slack. If you plan for one hour of runtime on battery, you will use 17AH from your batteries. That's not a lot. A battery of 80-100AH would be plenty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to propose something crazy: Use four car batteries in series. This is totally nuts, of course, because car batteries are not deep-cycle batteries and they need to remain mostly-to-fully charged most of the time to stay happy. But that's exactly what you're doing! Your batteries will stay charged almost all the time, except when they are handling a brief heavy load. That's what car batteries are good at. I think they will work well for this (unlike almost every other solar application), and they are certainly cheaper.",

"comment": "Here's a way I like to think of it, but first you have to differentiate two similar but different concepts: kW vs kWh.\n\nA kilowatt is a unit of power, sort of like horsepower.  Imagine a solar array as a big engine, and instead of being rated in horsepower it's rated in kilowatts.  Your school just installed a 50 kW sized system (which is about 2x as big as the biggest single home system, fyi)\n\nNow kilowatt-hours is a unit of measurement for energy.  Imagine a kWh as like a block of (electric) fuel.  Your school's array will be producing so many kWh's every day, and the school will consume them by running the lights, powering the fridges, etc.\n\nAs for how much energy your school's array will produce during cloudy days, etc. the answer really depends on HOW cloudy are we talking?  On a bright, yet overcast day, you might still see 70-80% of total production, but if it's dark and gray like during a rain storm, you might see 10-20% or less.\n\nHope this helps!",

You just install it in the main breaker.\n\nDid the solar installer say there were going to install a sub panel?  \nThat would require a double breaker to power the sub but they might be planning to move other circuits to the sub panel, to free up spots on the MSP (Main service panel).\n\n&gt; My panels will have microinverters, so there won't be an inverter anywhere. \n\nThere will actually be a lot of inverters.  each micro inverter is an inverter...\n\n&gt; What I don't understand is how the solar panels are connected to the meter/panel.\n\nEach PV module will have a micro-inverter.  The micro-inverters will be chained along in a circuit, and that circuit will generally go to a sub panel to combine them (unless there is a small number), an external AC disconnect, and then land on your MSP with a double breaker.  \n\n&gt; Will the solar panels connect directly to my breaker or will they connect to the net meter first?\n\nIf you have a LOT of solar then it may be required to land them BETWEEN the meter and MSP in what is called a line side tap.  This is less common with micro-inverters.\n\n&gt; My main concern is that the solar array will be wired in a way that sense can only detect the solar production being used while the excess flows down into the meter and out to the grid. \n\nWith solar almost all monitoring systems will need two sets of CTs to monitor production and net.  You then can mathematically get consumption.   In your case you might be able to combine the enphase micro generation monitoring and the sense net data on pvoutput.org to get your combined monitoring.\n\n&gt; Or will all the power produced by the solar panels come down into my breaker panel, with my home consuming whatever it needs, and then the excess flowing from the breaker back out to the meter?\n\nThis is the most common set up.",

There are multiple hack ways to get your data and I'm damn glad I did.  Like others one of my panels has failed and sunpower doesn't have any sort of alerting.  u/dveech123 why on earth would we want to call our installer every time we wanted to get data?  That limits how often we can see it and ties up your dealers.  In a 20 panel system a single panel failure is fairly hard to spot by eye but is obviously a 5% loss.  This really feels like Sunpower is hoping we don't notice.  Ideally \\*you\\* should be alerting \\*us\\*.\n\nAnyhow, for those that have the tools here are the things I use:[https://github.com/krbaker/sunpower/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/krbaker/sunpower/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\\-- Two tools here,[sunpower.py](https://sunpower.py) uses the sunpower API that backs their web interface.  It \\*happens\\* to contain per-panel data!  Their webapi has had massive data integrity problems so I don't trust it a lot.  Also, this API can and does change, this is my second incarnation of these scripts.  This scripting is pretty easy for anyone with PVS5/6 monitor to get running.  (there is also a diamon wrapper to push these metrics into graphite)sunpower\\_management.py uses the local management port.  The data can be slow (1+minute) to extract for some unknown reason but it works.  I suspect this is slightly less likely to break and doesn't rely on some crappy backend to be working well.  However you do have to setup the management interface which requires networking knowledge (it runs DHCP, so plugging it into your home network would cause a mess!).  My router has three interfaces and one isolates the PVS management system so that script can work\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-- I also integrated the management api with home-assistant (its web scraping so its only available via HACS) [https://github.com/krbaker/hass-sunpower](https://github.com/krbaker/hass-sunpower) .  This requires the networking setup I mentioned above.\n\nNone of this is any substitute for a proper local API.  Extremely unimpressed with Sunpower.",

We have become so accustomed to gas/diesel fueled vehicles that we hardly notice that they have MUCH greater energy density than solar panels and batteries can ever provide.\n\neg.

I have run out of net metered power a few times in Feb/March and got like a $50 bill. It resets in April. \n\nNo issues with the heat pump water heater or mini splits. I self installed both. These mini splits are incredible and have had no issues keeping up during cold snaps here. Combined with solar panels its basically free heat and hot water. \n\nNot sure how new construction works but on existing homes they dont let you go more than 110% of your last year's usage.

"comment": "Background\r  \nIn 2012, the previous owners of our home entered into an agreement with Kilowatt Systems, LLC for a 20-year power purchase agreement where the homeowner would first buy the power produced from the solar panels at $0.095 per KWH (this is important for later) and then would get to resell any excess power generated to Xcel Energy at a $0.09 per KWH credit on the monthly bill.  \r  \n\r  \nWe purchased the home in March 2014 and the agreement was signed over to us at closing.  We could not negotiate the removal of the solar panels because it was a seller’s market and the agreement came with the home sale.\r  \n\r  \nAlso during this time, Kilowatt Systems became Spruce Power.\r  \n\r  \nAll went well and we were set-up on autopay for most of the agreement until January 1st, 2021.\r  \n\r  \nProblem Start\r  \nIn January 2021, Spruce Power moved to a new financial system and all the auto-pay details were lost and needed to be reestablished.  \r  \n\r  \nCustomer Service Contacts\r  \nOn January 10, I called with basic questions about my bill, the switching over to new account system, and accessing the web portal to establish the autopay.  I was placed on hold through the automated system for 55 minutes to no answer.  I requested through the customer service email address a call back but no one called.\r  \n\r  \nOn April 28, after receiving multiple bills requesting payments and standard apology letters for the issues related to the billing transfer that were sent out to all customers, I emailed asking my questions and the issues related to poor customer communication to no reply.  I followed up on May 10 and May 18 in email to request a follow-up.  \r  \n\r  \nOn May 25, I received a response that MW in customer support reviewed my account and that Spruce Power “applied incorrect fees” to my account and they are requesting immediate proof of payment because my account was passed due.  On May 26, I further requested a detailed invoice and stated that I do not agree with any of the charges associated with my account because every month the bill details were changing.  I requested a call back but no one called. \r  \n\r  \nOn June 23, I sent an email requesting a detailed breakdown of my account.  On June 24, MW replied back with a detailed excel sheet breakdown of my account via email but no explanation and asked if there was anything else he could assist with.  I replied back requesting help in interpreting my bill and the charges.  No response was given.  \r  \n\r  \nOn July 6, I followed up due to no response.  On July 13, JS from the billing team provided my payment history which answered none of my previous questions.  \r  \n\r  \nOn Aug 24, I started receiving calls from the asset recovery department at Spruce Power.  I had a 51min phone call from Myri in collections who was unable to provide information on my  account and provided confusing and conflicting information as we tried to review the details of my account and the billing breakdown.  I asked to speak to a manager and she said managers do not receive calls and they I would have to talk to her.  I requested documents for my contract and power usage and she was unable to provide.  I was then transferred to Lexi from the billing department and more conflicting information ensued on the status of my account.  Also, during the call with Lexi, she put in a request to grant me access to the solar production website for my property and an automated response says I should have access within 3 business days.  Lexi said she would do research and call me back on 8/25 but no one called.  I provided an email on this call to Spruce Power to no reply on 8/24.  On 8/25 after no phone call was received, I followed up with yet another email that was received by Spruce Power but no response was provided.  \r  \n\r  \nOn 8/30, I received a 5min call from collections regarding status of my payment.  I requested an audio recording of my call with Myri and Lexi but was told that could only be provided if I have a subpoena for the records!\r  \n\r  \nOn 9/7, I had a 47 minute phone call with Alejandra C, team lead for Asset Recovery.  I highlighted all the issues I was having and the lack of customer support.  I requested access to the production portal and was finally given access.  I requested my billing contract and data regarding my bill.  I offered to settle my bill at a discount given the customer service issues I was experiencing but this was denied by her management.  I also stated that I requested access to the power production reports on the 8/24 call and she escalated the issue and I was eventually granted access later that evening, a full 9 days after the original request.  Later that evening, I received a call from Alejandra but was unable to answer it at 710pm local time due to dinner with the family.  I called back but was placed on hold for 10min to no response from customer service.  I followed-up via email on 9/7 and received a response on 9/14 stating that Alejandra would call me back in 2-4 business days.  \r  \n\r  \nHere is the potential for fraud and deceit.  On 9/8, I had another 14-minute conversation with Alejandra about my account based on the data she provided.  Earlier that day, I received a copy of my power purchase agreement which highlights a $0.095 per KWH billing rate.  After reviewing the bills and data, on January 1st, Spruce Power increased the billing rate to $0.10 per KWH without notice.  Either done fraudulently or in error, I believe that when they entered the rate into the new billing system, all agreements with a third decimal in the rate were copied over and rounded to the next two decimal rate.  I highlighted this in an email to Alejandra at Spruce Power on the afternoon on 9/8.  I further emphasized that this proves my point that Spruce Power is not providing accurate billing information to the customer in the form of monthly bills which are not detailed or provide a clear breakdown of costs incurred to the customer.  I requested a follow-up via email.  \r  \n\r  \nI followed-up on 9/8 with more details via email and provided an invoice for my services in finding a bug in the accounting system. \r  \n\r  \nAfter no response, I followed-up on 9/13 requesting a response.  \r  \n\r  \nOn 9/15, I requested another follow-up and escalation to Alejandra’s manager.\r  \n\r  \nOn 9/15, I had another 9 minute conversation with her about the issues I am having but no resolution or answer to my questions were provided.  Alejandra acknowledged the billing issue and assured it was fixed and my account was credited.  In the latest bill, there is no adjustment noted in my account.  \r  \n\r  \nOn 9/16, another 9min conversation ensued with customer service whom said Alejandra was out of the office.  I also contact Xcel Energy in this process to see how much energy the solar panels have sold back to Xcel Energy during the time the solar panels have been installed.  The answer: no power has ever been sold back to Xcel Energy from the excess generation.  \r  \n\r  \nOn 10/8, I followed-up in another email to Alejandra but no response. \r  \n\r  \nOn 10/29, I followed-up in another email to Alejandra but no response and copied the billing team.  The billing team’s automated response stated that the email was assigned to a solar specialists. No one contacted me.\r  \n\r  \nOn 11/8, I followed up with another email with the same automated response this time saying someone will contact me in 7-10 business days but no one has contacted me.  \r  \n\r  \nI have multiple questions regarding billing, power production, and efficiencies that were highlighted in the original proposal to previous homeowners that is not reflected in the current account.  The bill that Spruce Power provides is inadequate to interpret and does not reflect the contract terms.",

"comment": "I think it’s gonna be really hard to do. There are so many factors that differ. If you use electric heating, your electricity costs will be triple those without and so you probably need a much bigger system, which means greater cost. \n\nProbably the best way to do it is look at the consumption on your bill. Let’s assume 1kW DC produces 1200kWh annually. So if your bill is 12,000kWh annually you’ll need a system size of approximately 10kW DC. Then you should basically be ready to spend $2.5-3.5/W. \n\nEnd of the day, cash price is probably $25k+\n\nMy recommendation for someone that knows nothing is to inundate yourself in quotes. Listen to the sales pitches but sign nothing. Read all the proposals, do some research on the products and understand your local utility buy back or net metering program, as well as any tax or other rebates that are available.",

Distributed solar doesn't do jack to help at night. If your wind power is offline then, too, you'd better have a big enough battery to handle the entire grid's off peak demand. We literally don't have the factory capacity or the mining capacity to build that many batteries in the foreseeable future.   \n\n\nRenewables are absolutely an essential part of the grid in the future, and so is energy storage. However, running current nuclear reactors and building new ones to provide a large portion of the needed base load generation capacity is far more environmentally friendly than building the vast fields of batteries and solar panels you'd need to do the same job, that won't last a fifth as long as a gen III/gen IV reactor.",

I live in a marina at 48 North, and this car with the full solar option will still cover my daily driving needs without ever having to plug into a grid source.  If I go on trips, it will gain range at least twice as fast as other EVs, including Teslas, when plugged into the same charger.  Winter will give a range hit, as it does with all EVs, but the Aptera range will still be sufficient for almost any need, with options from 250 to 1000 miles at EPA highway test cycle speeds.\n\nFor the needs of many commuters and retired people it is the most practical offering out there.  It is not intended to be mass market, but even the 1% early adopter #s are more than enough for this to be a huge success, and this will only grow when people get the crash test ratings and see the running costs from their friends who have them.",

Is the main panel legally allowed to be claimed for the 30% tax credit if it was done to support solar? Not “bundled in” to hide it. Legitimately claim it. Also I can’t claim my solar panels for this year. Can I claim my main panel upgrade this year and my solar panels next year?",

Then there's the 26% federal tax credit. The federal credit is going down before going away, and the state incentives could also be lessened in the future.\n\nI pay a fee to National Grid for net metering that people who got it installed prior to January of this year don't have to pay. Future fees may be added that I will be grandfathered out of.\n\nBasically, the best time to install solar in NY was last year, and it gets a little worse every year. I highly advise anyone interested to do it sooner rather than later.",

I’m just trying to figure out if it’s worth the extra $10k to get the heat pump option instead of the standard AC. \n\nI guess the biggest benefit is that you can use the heat pump with solar and not rely on a furnace. \n\nLike you said though, you’ll need to increase the solar panels as well to cover the extra usage. So probably another $15k-20k total. Not sure I can justify.\n\nEdit: I’m in the Bay Area so very few 40 degree days. Pretty moderate year round.",

In fact you want to to \"backup\" your big loads as much as possible and put A/C on backup, because again, you want to maximize self consumption and never export anything to the grid.",

I like EV's and I think they are much better, but having a HUGE house and a Tesla does not make a person \"green\" or very environmentally savvy.  Having a properly sized solar system and battery, PLUS the EV is better, but for me.................a small house is fine.  For any of you living in the Sacramento region, you will notice that so much of the new construction is HUGE houses.  That is not environmentally friendly.  And the contractors only put the bare minimum, as required by law, of solar panels on each house.  Roughly 2.4KW systems which are not going to do much for that size of house.  Glad to hear EV sales are picking up....not that I can afford one right now, though I would, if I could.",

"comment": "I'd start by looking into a home energy audit and then probably insulation.  If you don't have double-pane low-E windows already look at getting them.  Same for wall and roof/ceiling insulation.  Insulation is one of those technologies that's improved dramatically in the last 40/50 years, so if the house is old in particular, you could get major savings there.  And it works great in conjunction with heat pumps, which do best when the house doesn't lose much energy when they're not running.\n\nUnless you're up against a deadline like California's NEM 3.0 proceedings, solar should be one of your last steps.  The order is typically home energy audit -&gt; insulation -&gt; windows -&gt; HVAC -&gt; solar.",

Maybe maybe you can order directly and they’ll just ship you PowerWalls without installing them. Doubt it.\n\nThe way the Tesla website works is that to get a quote, you click “Order” or something like that and pay a $100 deposit that essentially qualifies you as someone that wants to buy something and is willing to let go of $100 to have an appointment with a salesperson so they’ll set up a phone/video call. \n\nThey will then build an estimate and come up with a real price. If you go ahead and sign a contract, Tesla keeps the $100, otherwise they refund the $100.\n\nLike I said, it costs about $25,000 with labor and parts, permits, design etc for two PowerWalls and maybe about $35,000 for three.\n\nIf you do order from Tesla, you wait about a year, then Tesla comes back and gives you the real real price. If you then are still committed to the changed contract, you’ll get a system.",

And the number one issue stems from customers who are left high and dry by an install company (usually 3rd party) and get no help or support when service is needed. Instead of making head over heels on customers and under sizing their systems, I chose to be directly w the company who sells it. That means less pay and commissions for me, but more service and customer support for customer. \n\nAnyone who works directly for their company is doing a very honorable service that’s customer focused, hence working directly with Sunrun.

"comment": "A PPA will have a price per kWh (kilowatt-hour), which is per unit of energy produced. This is also how your electric utility bills you - on a price per kWh\n\nWhen you hear about a price per watt - that is generally when someone is purchasing a system (not getting a PPA). A system will have a rated power (watts) based on the size and number of solar panels - so maybe 5,000 watts, or 5 kilowatts. If that system costs $15,000 to purchase, then the cost per watt is $3/W ($15,000/5000).\n\nThere is a correlation between cost per watt of a system, and cost per kWh of a PPA. But, it's a bit of a complex calculation with lots of assumptions. They are different metrics.",

It would be a pretty good burger if they didn't nuke them.  The bun is a little too chewy because of that.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjXWv42sSYA\n\nNot last time I rode, but the time before they ran out on me. There was another vegan on board and I think she and her daughter ate all of **my** burgers.

This doesn't mean that it is impossible, though, especially with the help of a simple B12 supplement. \n\nAnd, as blargh9001 points out, we don't want to get caught up in the same naturalistic fallacy crap that has been thrown at us.

"comment": "I never tried my hand at vegan aioli. I always shy away of food that relies heavily on eggs, since I imagine taking away that distinct aroma of eggs will probably produce a great dish, but it will be to far off aromatically from the original thing to still call it like that. But you inspired me to actually google the recipe and I *just* found out that egg is optional in aioli!!! I'll try it tomorrow. Thank you so much! That's the revelation of the year for me!!",

She said all of her family was really annoyed with her for trying to turn them all vegan.

Instead he said this: \n\n&gt;I guess I don't think that cows being kept by the dairy industry to be relentlessly lactating and having their babies stolen from them to be slaughtered is in any way humane, and then I don't think it is at all acceptable to cut a hole in a cow's side, no matter how \"well-cared for\" that cow is (before said cow ceases to produce enough milk, and is sent to be killed). The sight of a hole cut in the side of a cow by a human being for our own disgusting diets is abhorrent to me, no matter how likely or not that cow is to get infected.\n\n&gt;fly off the fucking handle and moan about being preached at on a vegan subreddit like a little girl.\n\nBruh, I'm not even mad. I expected a subreddit full of vegans to behave exactly the way you all have. You've proven me right about the stereotype 100%.",

I'm crying the whole time and the cat won't die.  \nI'm wondering if this is normal for sensitive people who watch violent slaughterhouse videos before going vegan?  I don't know about you, but my process of becoming vegan included forcing myself to watch some pretty hardcore slaughterhouse videos which left me emotionally drained/devastated.  This has got to create some dichotomy within us... we want to save animals but we're surrounded by people who want to destroy them, and we must find a way to relate to those people without upsetting them.  It's a fucked up position to be in.  Witness holocaust: stay friendly with the Nazis.  It's no wonder we have nightmares.",

However, we found another place that has been accommodating. The owner listed all of the things they could make vegan when I called on the phone. We haven't gone there often - only twice so far since I feel like I'm inconveniencing them when I call. At least we have a city nearby with some vegan-friendly Indian restaurants. \nHopefully you find a good place sometime soon!",

The worst offender is my daughter's friend.  My daughter made a Google slide show the night before we were to leave outlining all the reasons this friend should come with us.  Since I unfortunately had to bring a lot of work and the rest of the house was okay with it, we brought her along.  One of the selling points was that she'd 'eat vegan food.'  \n\nYesterday, she told us she was a carnivore.  Today she decided to eat what the others were eating (the previously mentioned pork chops) and then proceeded to list all of her favorite meat food while I was eating.  Like, I get it; you like meat.  Maybe look at my face and STFU.  That's the worst I have to deal with, but just having to be around so much animal products is depression.  Like I know so many people eat meat but I don't have to watch it.  And honestly, I just want to eat my Field Roast sausage in peace and not be grilled (pun intended) about my habits. Because I know it just will lead to some joke or excuse and I'm working hardcore through my vacation (I've already pulled one all-nighter and another tonight.)\n\nSorry to rant on your rant, but I do know how you feel.  Sounds like you had it worse than me.",

It (might) keep them alive with enough intervention and monitoring, but is it enough for not only avoiding death but good health?\n\nIt is well known in humans that with multivitamins etc we only absorb so much. I would assume that cats/dogs are the same. \nAAFCO guidelines are a starting point, but arguably as long as your sample contains the recommended protein etc it could be boiled shoes with a multivitamin so is only one part of assuring 'quality'/proper nutrition at best. \n\nBio availability is one concern yes, but also we need to address that a cat does not have the necessary system for processing the heavy carb load seen in plant food. Occasional blades of grass etc may be one thing but they are not soy, legumes, corn or grains. Essentially you are stressing the pancreas as well as the whole body (given what we know about diabetic creatures and people---high levels of insulin and rapid increases in blood sugar etc are no good). \n\nIt's a bit like saying 'well cows can eat only hay and survive, so so can people because it has protein etc too!' while completely neglecting that we cannot break down and absorb cellulose like ruminants can. At least however we have the necessary equipment to make use of starch and dietary carbohydrates.\n\nMost of the time these filler/grains are used for the same reason they are used in livestock regardless that cows cannot eat grain effectively---they're cheap. They also provide binding/thickening for holding together kibble etc.\n\nIf you look at the diet of most small wild cats (rodents, birds, insects. lizard, fish etc) would be eating these are at least 80% (on a dry matter basis) protein and fat and if you add in things like ash % the total carb load in a prey item is 10% (or less!).\n\nI couldn't even find a nutritional analysis for the Vegepet but the few mentioned protein/fat ratios on the homemade recipes puts the carb content at at least 50%\n\nYour Evolution cat formulas again...EDIT: found the analysis! 47% dry matter carbohydrates. \n\nBoth websites frankly just made me more suspicious. \n\nEven Ami Cat comes in at 39% \n\nAs for the study it was the VegeCat KibbleMix and the Evolution Gourmet Vegetable Stew Entree.  \n\nI'm not one of those 'but it's not natural!' people, I swear. It's really because 'hey! your macronutrient ratios (amongst other things) are completely against the diet your pet evolved and was designed to eat'. Again, if we could find a more 'vegan' cat food option that the cat was able to process properly and was designed with that minimal/no carb aspect to respect the cats needs I'd be all for it, even if designed in a lab or something.",

I excessive regularly and did not eat junk food often and took pride in cooking “healthy”. Well, around the Christmas holiday my partner and I watched a few documentaries on having a whole non meet diet and decided to go vegan. Any since the change I have lost close to 35 pounds but 0 muscle mass. It is the best decision I have made in my 52  years of eating I will never go back and alas as I always tell family and friends if you are a vegan and decide to eat a steak or sushi go for it and hope back on the life of  a vegan you won’t be judged. For me though, I don’t think I’ll ever eat meet again but don’t want to judge others for there life choices.",

I went to college where seeing trucks loaded with caged chickens and turkeys was a daily occurrence, and I never grew accustomed to it. But... Privilege extends beyond viewing industrial farming as a food source to also recognizing it as a large employer of the otherwise unlikely-to-be-employed (due to education, citizenship status, and just plain lack of alternatives). I'm not pretending to have an answer, and I know the answer isn't factor farming. I'm just explaining that my comment about privilege wasn't necessarily targeting things like hunting. Our entire way of life is messed up, and only compassion will allow us to communicate and create a society that's not built on the backs of large-scale animal agriculture.",

"comment": "None claimed being vegan makes you a good person and that others would be evil. Where did you get that from? And yes of course, the more vegan food someone would consume, the better. The point we’re trying to make is that just because you eat a vegan meal once in a while doesn’t mean that you are a vegan. You can eat plant based everyday, but if you keep contributing to animal abuse in other ways (clothing, cosmetics etc) you really can’t call yourself a vegan either. The term is important, because people will misunderstand what the movement is about: animal rights.\nNone claims to be perfect. And also, while veganism also has an positive impact on the environment, it’s first and foremost about the animals. If anyone feels offended to not fall in the category of being ”vegan”, then I suggest they look up what it means and starts living by it. It’s as simple as that.",

"comment": "When I was still eating the Standard American Diet (ironically -SAD) , my vegan sister refused to taste the clam chowder I had made one day. I made fun of her for caring about clams. Now I have been vegan for 15 years or so and I reflect on that a lot when I get the same reaction from people. I realize it is this fierce reaction to protecting what is their perfectly engrained cultural norm that was passed down to them from generations without any thought into how that meat actually gets to the grocery store, to the table. Questioning diet can put them into a bit of flight or flight (argue/bully/dominate or hide the truth from yourself).  Just keep doing you, be skeptical and question - it's awesome. Also there are loads of excellent books. I did a lot of reading on the subject and it really helped me learn how to articulate the issues when people actually want to talk with me about my food choices instead of stay defensive and walk away. I read all about clams, the depleting and massacred ocean dead zones and the special lives of sea creatures and I would not dream of ever eating another mollusk and I like to explain why no one should.",

"comment": "I guess I’m confused about the unfortunate reality part. If you don’t think something vegan is achievable, should we not aim for it anyway? I don’t think animal agriculture will ever reduce let alone be stopped, until human civilization starts collapsing, and even then humans will still be eating and using animal parts because they want to and then also out of necessity at that point. Should I stop eating vegan because animal agriculture is clearly winning? Or should I keep practicing my ideals and morals and ethics because that’s what I believe? I don’t think humans will ever stop riding horses. I’m still against it for the multiple obvious reasons. That’s just the reality, being vegan means being against human exploitation of use and animals even though it’s never going to end, and most humans are going to willingly keep participating. If you aren’t comfortable sticking to vegan ideals unless it results in some big change, I don’t really understand that thinking, or maybe I’m not understanding something else about how you are viewing the fact the healthcare system being deliberately set up by some humans to not take care of most humans. This doesn’t equate an argument in favor of breeding a service species without their consent, imo.",

Supporting grass fed beef wouldn't make any sense from their perspective, because then they themselves would become rights violators. \n\nMost (if not all) of the people you're talking about are  threshold deontologists, which means that they are against committing rights violations unless the consequences of not committing them will lead to the suffering or death of a great many beings. I can fully see why you think that this would commit them to supporting grass fed beef, as it involves committing a rights violation which could save many being from predation, due to the fact that it sometimes involves killing foxes etc. But the numbers are just nowhere near high enough; those YouTubers would analogize it to a human context, and conclude that of course they wouldn't support using innocent humans as sacrifices in order to prevent some kinds of people from preying on other kinds of people. If sacrificing a human in such a way was going to save the lives of ten million people, I'm sure that they would sign off on it, but as the number reduces, their likelihood of endorsing such a thing decreases. \n\nI hope that helps you understand their position a bit better. I actually think that it has weak spots, and I certainly do not support murdering predators. I'm primarily an emotional person. If vegan gains killed my cat, that dude would not see another day, and if I saw him aiming a gun at a wolf, I would at least have a desire to wrestle it off him.",

For me I feel like consuming food that’s “free” undermines the moral argument that animal products are not okay. I feel like non-vegans see that and are fine living with their cognitive dissonance. \n\nSo I won’t beat myself up if it’s a mistake but I won’t consciously eat any amount of animal product.",
