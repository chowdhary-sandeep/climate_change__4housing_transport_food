"comment": "I once made a trip to Saskatoon for business and noticed that every parking spot there had an electrical outlet installed. Just a plain old outlet like you'd find on your deck at home. After inquiring about these things to a local, she explained that they were for people's cars. (Not electric cars, but to power a special heating element that keeps their vehicles' engines from freezing and not being able to start.) Being a new Volt owner at the time, it occurred to me. Why not just do this for EVs back home? Nothing fancy required.",

"comment": "BMW made the i3 with less range to keep weight down and make it more affordable. The batteries cost a lot and most people do not drive more than eighty miles a day. They put the gas range extender in as an option for those that go further in a day. For a carbon fiber plastic car it is pretty cheap. BMW might be losing money on each one they sell. It took two billion dollars to develop the car. The car handles much better and is faster than a leaf or volt. The i3 was designed as a city car with less range than the model S but thirty k cheaper or more. Battery prices need to drop more before we see affordable longer range electric cars",

This is VERY good for those of us waiting for a good deal to purchase an EV. Because we all know oil will rise again once they choke back supply to inflate the price. I just hope for a temporary lull to get a nice lease deal on a Leaf for ~$200 a month. :) Let's hope it works out for us.",

"comment": "Yes nice idea! Also on Renault Zoe (available only in Europe AFAIK) they were already this kind of option but you can choose only 3 different sounds installed from factory. However it would be easy to propose other sound to download because on the Renault Clio (the gas model the more similar to the Zoe) you can download sounds to cover the sounds of the engine (like Formula 1 sound for example).\nIf we think about it, it looks fun now but imagine having a lot of electric cars in a city, you think you will get more quiet neighborhood but finally you will just replace the engines sound with annoying sounds that every car owner have set to \"alert pedestrians\". That's why in my opinion there must be an off button, at least to turn it off at night went you drive down your private way or park into your garage.",

"comment": "No, not just L1.  \n\nLong answer: Generic 240V outlets can give 3-10kW (depending on wiring spec).  Half the J1772 \"stations\" installed in houses are just plugged into a generic socket.  It's the same wiring.  Is there some sort of special magic in that box? (No.) Think of a home charging station as a bigger and stupidly more expensive version of the brick on your 120V cord.  That's all it is.  They sell 240V versions of the cords.  In Britain, the cord they give you with the car *IS* an L2 cord.  Tesla gives you an L2 cord also.  All OEMs should ship with an L2 cord that plugs into a normal 240V socket.",

The prius plug-in currently has an edge on extended range mileage due to the volt's sub-optimal gasoline range extender. If GM can offer a 5th seat, decent EV range, a better range extender and a low price it could win its market segment. \n\nToyota has only made minor improvements to its prius for the last 10 years and really needs an EV platform if they are going to remain a dominant manufacturer.",

CAGW is almost all crap. The catastrophes are massively overrated, and are outweighed by CO2's benefits (like better plant growth and a shrinkage of deserts). PCAGW1 (the P stands for \"policies\") are the \"Carbon Credits\", \"Carbon taxes\" truly stupid. they are a) vicious to the poor b) corrupt c) worthless unless every country does them. PCAGW2 are the subsidies for \"Green Energy\". the topic of this thread.  \n\nPCAGW2 is not as stupid as PGAGW1 in that those industries are just another thing government pimps. The worst part about them is that they are what the \"progressives\" call \"regressive\", eg a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich. A \"Hood Robin\" thing.\n\nregular citizens in California are helping pay for the Teslas of much more affluent people.",

It looks like it's not out until September, but I've pre-ordered it.  \n\n[Via Motors](http://www.viamotors.com/powertrain/) with [Bob Lutz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5STy6HRZEQ) is doing something interesting for the commercial fleet market.  I think they're going to succeed too.  They are partnering with GM to provide Volt style plug-in hybrid trucks and vans.  They use GM vehicles and will install their own hybrid drive train.  The trucks are a little more expensive than stock, but they save enough on fuel, brakes, and general wear and tear on the gas engine that they quickly pay for themselves.\n\nThey've been working on this for a few years now, and the video I linked to was their first prototype.

That was the issue, running them that low on a car that lowers without having extra protection. Tesla fixed it by removing the automatic lowering system in the 5.8 firmware update plus adding a titanium plate and aluminium tube deflector thing but the fact this was not tested or spotted was a serious design flaw.",

The development of renewable energy has been stifled by the fossil fuel industry for years.  We could have gone with electric cars over 100 years ago even.\n\nAlso, a switch to dependence on nuclear power for a lot more of our energy would have huge benefits as well and would potentially offset whatever greater costs come from reducing fossil fuel dependence.  Just have to get irrationally scared people to accept the benefits of nuclear power.",

Everyone keeps saying \"Buy a Model 3!!!\" That's great when it's here but it's not yet, and many people that need a new car now are not going to simply do without a car until they can buy one. This will probably be available 1+ years before a Model 3. When you can buy all of these cars at the same time, we can compare them. \n\nSecond, boxy is more practical than a trunk. I don't see what's wrong with a hatchback that has practical space. I'd prefer a boxy design.\n\nThird, this is way cooler than a Nissan Leaf and the old i3 was a lot more fun to drive than the old Nissan Leaf.  It was carbon fiber and aluminum, much lighter and more fun to drive etc.\n\nThe range is lower than upcoming Model 3, but it's still a huge improvement over the 80 miles on the outgoing model and for many people it would be fine. I drive 40 miles round trip every day. Why do I need a 200 mile EV if 70 would suffice? 114 seems like plenty to me. Two of my co-workers have had 55-80 mile EVs for 5+ years now, they would be very happy 114...",

"comment": "The stats on it are basically deliberate and misleading, as well as functionally pointless and in all probability, impossible:\n\n&gt; Type of drive: Rear-wheel\n\n&gt; Peak power: 4 x 25 kW (136 PS) \n\n**Power contradicts Rear Wheel. 4 times *what?***\n\n&gt;Type: nanoFlowcell® \n\n**Meaningless. Is it mature enough to be in use by anyone else?**\n\n&gt;Voltage (V): 48  \n&gt;Rated current (A): 300 \n\n**48V x 300A is only 14.4kW or 19.2 hp. That is *low*, even for pure continuous power.**\n\n&gt; Capacity (kW/h): 15 \n\n**Eh? 75kWh of a Tesla's usable energy corresponds roughly to between 250-300 miles in realistic use. 15 kWh.. is a bit low for practicality.**\n\n&gt; Buffer system: Supercaps \n\n**Ah, so power is *not* continuous. Good luck with the performance crowd...**\n\n&gt;Maximum power kW (PS): 80 (108) \n\n**From the supercaps, I assume?**\n\n&gt;Fuel type: Electricity \n\n**Well, duh. But why mention this and not the chemical? Chemicals can't be *that* proprietary - most energy based applications use simple compounds. They are not drugs or hair products.**\n\n&gt;Energy consumption: 12-14 kWh / 100 km \n\n**So at least 8km or 5 miles per kWh? Sounds like 30-40mph, judging by Bjorn Nyland's Tesla Model S record &amp; speed, and lower than the BMW i3's roughly 140-150 Wh/mile.** \n\n&gt; Tank volume (l): 2x 159 \n\n**78% of batt left after 14 hours  as in the article? Why not limit the size to a standard 50 litres or more left if the 'fuel' is that dense?**\n\nRange (km) std. consumption: &gt; 1,000 \n\n**Again it says the car drove for 14 hours then had 78% left in the tank. So the car took 14 hours to traverse 220 kilometres? Between 15-16kmph? Wtf?**\n\nThat's not counting the \"low voltage\" bit, which is clearly an irrelevant non-advantage.",

"comment": "That is not what the average consumer shelled out for a new car, and if you're an adult that's ever shopped for a car, you should have known that immediately. That's the average transaction price for a new car or truck, and that average is heavily influenced by almost half of the sales it includes being large trucks and commercial fleets. If you look only at consumer purchases of cars and SUVs, it's $18-22K, not $33560. People are buying Civics and Rogues and Camrys... none of which are anywhere near $33K.\n\nLarge car manufacturers have announced dozens of BEVs and committed billions of dollars to bring them to market over the next few years. If your \"point\" is that they \"are doing nothing\", then your \"point\" is factually incorrect and easily disproven, and you should give it up instead of repeating it some more.",

I didn't owe anything at tax time because I had already paid the taxes through withholding.\n\nI guess I'm confused about how I receive the credit then? From doing some research it's my understanding that if I don't modify my income or withholding amount, thus owing close to zero come next year's tax time, and buy a car with a tax credit towards the end of this year, then that tax credit will take the form of a refund come tax time since I will have effectively paid $7.500 more than I owe.",

"comment": "Thanks for the study. When we started to work on hybrids in 1996, during conferences, we all had these plenary sessions where people where predicting that we would all drive electric cars within ten years and fuel cells twenty years later (so more or less now). Prediction is a very difficult art... \n\nConcerning vehicle elctrification, probably that the situation may be more favorable for some country than others. Even at European scale, there are significant differences between countries. Some have huge hydraulic ressources (eg austria), France rely significantly on nuclear power plants others are using different energy mix. The grids are also organised and managed differently.\n\nToday, most of the people agree that electric cars are the 'future' of transportation. But nobody cares so much about who is going to produce the energy. In France, many people agree to have wind turbine because it's renewable but they don't want a wind farm nearby their house or on their coast. They will argue about protected nature, etc. And their argument are most of the time justified. People want cheap electricity and with large available power, but they do not want any coal/gaz plant. Nuclear is OK as long as the plant is far away and you send the nuclear waste far away.\n\nWhen dealing with automotive mass market, the amount of energy and the requested power is enormous. The human behavior is not favorable: in many situations, people will try to charge at the same time, which is the worse thing. Just look at a gas station the day before the main summer holliday departure : people are queuing to fill the tank. A gas pump is delivering a few megawatt per car (due to the gazoline energy density). How to deal with such load if switched to electricity. How will we handle this?\n\nBeside this exceptional situations, vehicle to grid is a possibility but there is no real large scale market today. Niche application are possible. Managing all this will requires some paradygm shift in the vehicle usage. It will not be only a vehicle anymore, but also a moving battery. \n\nHydrogen is also quite a hope at this moment. But when it comes to real application (I m involved with ship applications), difficulties appears and the obvious solutions are not so obvious. Storage safety is so complex to handle. Hydrogen is very complex to produce (and hydrolysis at an industrial scale is not a simple thing) and today is very costly.\n\n\nMy point is simply that most of people (including myself) have forgotten how much energy it consumes to drive a car. It is so easy and convenient. We get used to a very high quality of service with large amount of energy available everywhere. A more reasonable way will be to mix everything, choose the best energy source for every usage. That imply that would should go toward buying a transportation service rather than owning a car. That would probably be more reasonable.. But we all love owning a nice car.. Reason versus passion.",

"comment": "Sure: for a start [the main page](https://www.stopglobalwarming.eu/) contains the text \"by an idea of 27 Nobel laureates\", which is CT&amp;D. Then, under the \"Advocate\" concertina-box it says \"27 Nobel Laureates, 5.227 social scientists ([read more](https://www.econstatement.org/))\".\n\nIf you click on \"read more\" it links to a page saying \"ECONOMISTS’ STATEMENT ON CARBON DIVIDENDS\"\n\nThis *is* about Carbon fee and dividend, which is *indeed* supported by your Nobel Laureate Economists - but now you asked me to look at it more closely I see the text says **\"To maximize the fairness and political viability of a rising carbon tax, all the revenue should be returned directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates. The majority of American families, including the most vulnerable, will benefit financially by receiving more in “carbon dividends” than they pay in increased energy prices.\"**  -- which is not increasing Europe's competitiveness!\n\nGiving the tax raised directly to families is progressive because they will spend their money on the lowest carbon things (e.g. green electricity is more competitive compared to gas-generated, and diesel/petrol ICEs shouldn't be in the same ball park as EVs any more).  The problem with giving the money to government to spend is they tend to invest them in pet projects and don't necessarily spend it the most efficient way; also it's regressive in that it will charge poor people tax on the things they buy but not actually benefit them (riot!).",

"comment": "&gt; So when skeptics tell you the truth you sent it.  When one of your own tells you the truth you still deny it and seek out reviews by people with something to lose.\n\nI'm not sure I'm following. I have been reading about clean energy for years, and I don't care who talks about it as long as their  work is based on solid evidence. I enjoyed the documentaries of Moore about healthcare and gun violence, but that doesn't make him knowledgeable about energy.\n\n&gt; You can use car batteries sure for obscure off the grid low draw low use niche use. But they are useless in any commercial setting or even a standard household setting. They have far to many limitations and require lots of maintenance and you have to make sure you don't discharge them too far etc etc etc.\n\nNot only. A \"virtual power plant\", as they call it, can harness the energy of millions of distributed batteries and play a significant (although not indispensable) role to sustain the grid on a regional scale.\n\nSee this [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05290.pdf) by a team of grid modelers: figure 6 shows that car batteries can replace all utility-scale batteries in the V2G-50 scenario (i.e when 50% of the cars participate in a vehicle-to-grid plan and in a demand-side management plan). These plans already exist, as shown in my 2017 article, and they will most probably expand with the number of electric vehicles.",

"comment": "This is just inexperience. It never would have been an emergency for someone with a bit of experience living with an EV. Specifically your two biggest mistakes were trusting the would be true (that number is an estimate weighted belly by whomever drove the car before you and adjusting in real time for terrain, etc. it’ll never be fully accurate) and not understanding how charging worked. L2 chargers are for when you’re parked anyway. Fast chargers are your gas station equivalent and it seems you didn’t know that, or how to identify them.\n\nThat’s what I mean by you didn’t think about it. Those pins are not equal. You need to use an app like PlugShare that allows you to filter by speed and compatible plugs and then choose the one that makes sense BEFORE you embark. Many cars will incorporate your charging stops in your GPS. They will use fast chargers, which are not in golf courses or closed garages. You didn’t know the difference and chose slow chargers managed by private properties. That’s just inexperience.\n\nYou need to choose a car that’s fits your life. You can’t do that at a rental place, you get what you get. So on those instances an EV driver would be extra careful with something unfamiliar. You can’t make broad assumptions about the viability of EVs based on one car that didn’t fit your day. It’s like wearing dress shoes on a hike and lamenting shoes.\n\nI’ll note, many gas stations are also closed on Christmas so as a gas car driver I would also play it very safe in this way, not letting the car get to a critical level. \n\nAnyway, EV drivers think about this, but not hard. It becomes intuition, aided by some good software either in the car (some cars are better than others and this is a big reason why Tesla is so popular because they get this pay very right) or on your phone. I think about charging about as much as I think about the weather. A quick glance. Oh it’s raining? I’ll bring my umbrella. That’s it. You didn’t check the weather and got wet, that’s all.",

Not sure if they tested anything longer than that\n\nMy impression is in terms of battery safety BYD’s blade battery is probably better than any other in the world. And CATL’s battery is also quite good\n\nIn terms of crash safety I think in domestic lower end products like galaxy E5 might be inferior than international competitors in same segment but more expensive. But Chinese EVs similarly priced with foreign ones like Zeekr 7x has comparable structure strength \n\nFor exports I recommend you check out local crash test results",

If people aren’t buying the cars, manufacturing will decrease, so they lay off the employees anyway. All a bailout does is help the executives, board, and share holders. And I don’t care about them. \n\n> And if you’re all about survival of the fittest, why not let ICE cars compete with BEVs?\n\nBecause you have to protect the environment. Even if EVs were inferior to ICE (they’re not), we should be willing to sacrifice some convenience to protect where we live.",

I would like to work in the renewable energy sector later after I graduate and am working hard towards that.\n\nI'm currently doing a research project on the feasibility of low cost concentrated solar power generation in my physics degree, but I'd say I have the spare time to learn a new skill (I've never made a website before) and to do something I care about.\n\nI'd be keen to be the guy who does the stuff on renewable energies such as solar, wind etc.\n\nHit me up as to when you want to start this, even if it's just the two of us I'd love to be able to do it. I'll send you a message with my details. I can't contain my excitement!",

If you want to do this right, you should install the racking system when you install the rest of the other roof penetrations (plumbing vents, etc). With the right planning, you can get the roofing contractor to install the \"stand-offs\". Next, you would get the electrician on the project to install the solar array. Pay a solar guy for a complete design + bill of material, and hire him to be on site for the installation. Your project cost should be around $2.50/watt.\n\nBut if you want to use a turnkey installers, micro-inverters are the easiest to retrofit nicely because of the ability to run Romex through the attic. The installer should be able to penetrate your roof and manage the install in a structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing manner. So long as you have a 200 amp service panel, you should be fine.\n\nBe sure to ask the roof manufacturer about their warranty + solar.",

"comment": "Okay first of all Graph #1 isn't loading. Your second and third graphs show an upward trend of around .4 to .5C. Not sure what planet you're on, but an upward trend of 0.4-.5C is not a pause. I'm also not reading into this to see if it's based on outdated analysis or cherry picked data. Aside from the well known trick of starting with the late 1990s. If these graphs aren't recent then they likely understate the actual warming. Beyond that, are you a climatologist? If not can you name any climatologist who agrees (Not used to agree) that there hasn't been warming and who hasn't been shown to be on the take from the fossil fuel industry? \n\nYour second point shows a complete lack of understanding of economics. Most people in Africa can't afford energy RIGHT NOW. The status quo is harmful to Africans. They currently compete to buy fossil fuels on the open market where developed nations have much more spending power. They are at a severe disadvantage. Your fake humanitarianism is just the opposite.  \n\nIf we prioritize renewable energy and disincentivize fossil fuels in the western world then both of those forms of energy will become more affordable in the developing world. It would be a quantum leap over status quo. If the western world begins to invest heavily in renewable energy then economies of scale will drive costs down even more rapidly than they are currently falling. Which will be great because renewables are better suited to places like Africa where people are spread out and large capital investments are unheard of. Solar panels can provide reliable decentralized energy to the many spread out African villages much easier than coal plants and (if we drive up demand) much cheaper, and if we can help them become solar panel importers it will be good for us because we can export the technology to them.\n\nAlso whatever complaints germans, belgians, and spanish have about the high cost of energy they also have thriving economies (well 2 our of 3 isn't bad and you can't blame that for everything) and they also offset much of that with more efficient cars and homes. HHmmmmmm. That sounds like exactly the point of all this. doesn't it.\n\nBeyond that whatever need they do have for fossil fuels more affordable if half the world curtails their use.",

"comment": "The better technical solution is to use DC in the house.  A 48 volt system is an excellent option and allows full off-grid operation.\n\nIf you must have A.C. then the best solution is an inverter that can triple source pulling power direct from the solar panels when they are producing power then switching to the batteries to produce power after dark or as an alternative pulling power from a generator if needed.  This requires a kind of side-step process because the batteries need to be fed with DC direct from the panels through a charge controller.",

In Louisiana, the leasing companies would claim the tax credits, and then charge a monthly fee (around $40-45 a month). The solar systems were set up for net metering, and you'd receive all the benefits of that. So I don't think we can make claims about how solar leases work across the board.",

Once you create hydrogen even with an 'efficient' program you still have to store it in high pressure containers wich costs power and the nature of hydrogen itself means that you lose hydrogen in time. You also have to take into account that you need to be able to transport and store hydrogen acros the entire world in large quantities.",

"comment": "I just installed 37 panels with micro-inverters on my south east facing roof in Massachusetts.  My whole system is 9.8KW. The install cost was about $38K, but after the tax credit, it will cost about $25K.  On a good sunny day it will make 60kwh, and at peak it will push 8KW.  If my system faced more to the south, it would make more.\n\nThe company that makes my inverters puts lots of their system monitoring online and public, so you can look up what a particular size installation in your area will generate. [enphase public systems](https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/public_systems?locale=en-US) this link only seems to work on a desktop browser - it's just a summary on mobile.\n\nOverall, it's pretty nice. Even when with the A/C pumping in my 3600sqft house, my meter has spun backwards by 30kwh at the end of every day.  My power company does net metering, so what we save in the summer, we use in the winter.  Plus, Massachusetts has an energy credit system that pays me another $2500/year.",

If they're lag screwing into the roof truss, is the engineer evaluating how the truss is attached to the house? In other words, could the array pull the roof off the house during a hurricane?\n\n3) NABCEP certification indicates solid PV knowledge, but doesn't mean the installer is a roofer nor an electrician. I wouldn't make it a project requirement. But I would ask about the roofing experience of the crew (which is the typical shortcoming of solar install crews IMO).\n\n4) Is the array NEC 2014 compliant? How is the installer meeting rapid shutdown requirements?\n\n5) Does the selected inverter manufacturer have or is planning any battery retrofit options?\n\n6) What kind of heavy equipment will be used during the project and what should I do to prepare my site for the equipment?\n\n7) Is any onsite storage necessary? How will the equipment be secured and weather-proofed?\n\n8) What software was used to perform the performance estimate? What inputs were used for the performance analysis? Was shade analysis considered?\n\nNot that your installer will answer all of these questions. Not that the questions aren't worth asking. If you sent me a list like that, we'd probably talk about a design fee. \n\nAlso, you might want to think about how much some of that stuff is worth to you. You're probably going to have the best experience with a SunPower installer, and they're probably going to be the high bid (aside from SolarCity).",

So many of the ones I have seen miss the point. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the guy quoted of having his payback moving from 7 to 18 years must have the world's largest residential solar array. He had a $690 a month power bill.  With a large system like his the fixed costs are not as big a hit and he probably has a huge AC load (when the sun is shining so less of a hit on feed in) being in Vegas.\n\nMy bill was more like $80 a month (1/8 of his bill), and my 3.5 kw system will take about 40 years to pay off under the new rates.\n\nI am sure by then I will have added new equipment, reroofed my house and incurred more expenses.  Actually, I will probably be dead.",

"comment": "I understand your points.  They are valid.  But we aren't comparing apples to apples here.  There is where I think we have a difference in opinion.  You want to compare car maker to car maker (and big one vs. small one on R&amp;D), when we both know Tesla is more than that (energy, batteries, etc).  Tesla is a little guy right now - shelling out a very large portion of their (would be) profits to set up huge moves for the future. Even taking it into account, is the share price high right now?  Sure, I'm perfectly willing to acknowledge that - its based on future speculation.  Hell, even Elon acknowledges that.\n\nBut if their plan DOES play out, and the batteries and powerwalls do come to fruition, and the Model 3 does sell like hotcakes, and the Gigafactory does reduce costs... is it really that overpriced?  I don't think so.  It is not complete \"unadulterated, illogical hype\" - there are many articles online that guess that the price will continue to raise if those risks play out.\n\nIf those don't happen, then it will definitely crash and Tesla will remain a small niche market.  Lucky for me, I bought in early for most of my stock so I don't have much to worry about.\n\nLet's revisit this discussion in.... what?  A year?  6 months?  What is your time frame for the inevitable crash of the Tesla stock?\n\n&gt;tasteless joke made by a group of circle-jerking elitists who ejaculate every time they hear Elon Musk speak\n\nI'm not even sure what to say about this one lol.  You are a little too sensitive in my opinion.  We will just have to agree to disagree.",

Putting solar panels on our roof, bringing reusable bags to the store or driving around in an electric car, for instance. But I'm not sure it applies to actions by individuals that are mostly in isolation from others, such as saving energy at home by not using air-conditioning/heating as often. \n\nVeganism might well be in the former category, but it's ambiguous because a vegan's concern might mostly be personal health or animal ethics (or even just trying to save money by purchasing beans rather than beef).",

A deflationary currency means that either the supply of currency goes down or demand for that currency goes up, in our case, the supply is 0 or &lt; 0 because of losing keys or sending to the wrong wallet, and demand only grows due to population growth. to the second point the large energy consumption costs provide an economic incentive to invest in renewable energy to cut those costs, the having a proof of work currency the main one provides the incentive to have an overhaul of our infrastructure just like during the industrial revolution except for this time its the renewable revolution and the incentive is money that will one day stop being a reward for mining, think a space race except for money and having infinite solar power wins, China is winning and they know this.",

"comment": "It is a 30% credit, and I talked with the SunPower sales rep, they still recommend I go with the lease (for obvious company reasons). I talked with the sales rep for the builder and they said others who have purchased homes have gone with the lease as well. Also, the SunPower sales rep said that it is the builder who set the price on the price of the solar system if I were to purchase, not SunPower themselves (not sure if that is true or not).\n\nThen they started talking about buyback or something like that with the power company, SMUD, where if I over produce, they give me a credit that rolls over into the next bill. \n\nTalking with the SunPower Rep they gave me this calculation, where if I were to purchase the 3kW system they said my break even amount would take 14 yrs. From a 3kW production, I save $52/month producing 4,303kWh per year (est.). So around $9000 (after tax credit) divided by $52 in savings a month = 173 months = 14.42 years for break even. Does that seem reasonable to you? I get this is a marketing ploy as well, but is it accurate?\n\nAlso one of my concerns, technology is constantly changing. Where the value of a dollar changes (so paying $40/month flat isn't too bad if wages continue going up), but on this solar system from my research and what is offered, they are X21 panels which have been out for a while. And coming out this year, there are now solar tiles for housing roofs. So if I pay this much for a solar system, it may become obsolete 5-10 yrs from now, it makes me second guess buying or just plan leasing it.\n\nAnd with the lease being only $40/month with no increases or anything, I would think if I were to sell the home most buyers wouldnt have a problem with that right?\n\nEdit: I also forgot to throw in, talking with the sales rep. They said that after the 20 yrs, there may be a buyout term, since it is so long away they don't have a price yet. So that is also something to think about. Taking that into consideration (and if I actually stay in the home for 20 yrs) it is $9600 over a 20 yr lease of $40/month (and cost of the system if I purchase it after the 20 yrs) vs spending $13K to buy outright (before tax credits) with a 14.5 yr break even point. \n\nThe rep also said with CA, at the end of 2017, they will make all new homes built in the state have solar systems mandatory.",

I believe we had to use sunpower. The entire community has them. \n\nWe were forced to buy or lease for the new home and we decided to use the extra cash we had to go towards 20% down to avoid PMi. Sunpower is the only choice.. linked to our builder.",

"comment": "You're omitting a few very key important things:\n\n1) Intermittency. The wind does not always blow, and it does not always blow everywhere consistently. That is a big issue.\n\n2) Storage. We literally do not have enough storage to run even a city for 4 minutes straight, if you go with 100% intermittent sources of power, you WILL have blackouts when the wind dies or the sun sets.\n\n3) Transmission. One of the biggest 'hidden costs' of wind and solar is the massive increases in transmission lines needed to shunt energy around between areas that are producing to areas that are consuming. It's non-trivial, and people don't really like massive power transmission lines in their backyards. This is one of the reasons that everywhere large % of RE goes in, power prices actually go UP not down. (see: Germany, California, Hawaii)\n\nHuge amounts of renewable energy are already wasted because they produce energy when nobody needs it, that's called curtailment. They literally dump disconnect the energy from the grid because it has no where to go. Here's a primer with calcs on exactly the scale of challenge CA (my birth state) is facing with their RE pledge:  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cm7HOAqZY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cm7HOAqZY)  \n\n\n100% RE advocates state that we should just store the energy in batteries or pumped storage or some as-yet-unbuilt thing, and will point to the Tesla batteries in Australia as an example of this being feasible while ignoring:\n\n1) Lithium ion is expensive, uses rare resources, and has a 10-year cycle life tops. (replace worldwide grid-battery storage every 10 years? We would run out of lithium in the first cycle)\n\n2)  The batteries in Australia are for frequency regulation NOT long-term power storage (essentially stabilizing the grid while RE rapidly fluctuates up and down in production, preventing brown and blackouts).\n\nThere is a great study done by some very rigorous utility engineers and scientists on this subject recently, if you can get your hands on a copy I highly recommend reading it:\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722)  \n\n\nSo, point being - YES there is a ton of wind energy out there, and YES we  should be using a HELL of a lot more of it, but we need to do it in a way that makes SENSE, is SCALABLE, SUSTAINABLE, and provides for 24x7 energy usage.  \n\n\nZero-emission anything is better than fossil fuels, but we need a solid MIX of power sources to get there.",

"comment": "If they have excess power going unused, they need more power storage.  China should invest in some means of storing power.  Even if the gains are strictly local and the interregional infrastructure isn't there, almost nowhere on the planet has enough energy storage to achieve the hour-stabilized electricity prices that are *emphatically* possible.\n\nPumped hydro systems are an established technology for expending electricity storage, but they can only be built where the geography permits them.  Concrete block energy storage utilizes cranes to lift blocks of concrete, and to store in potential energy the electricity whenever there is an excess of supply over demand.  When the electricity is needed (because more is being demanded than supplied), the cranes let down the blocks of concrete, converting potential energy back into electricity that they can supply to the grid.\n\nThe sun only shines through the day, but concrete blocks on cranes can generate electricity in the dead of night.  That enables solar power to be utilized to run lights at midnight.  It frees us from having to use backup generators to keep the power running overnight.",

So no roof mounted solar panels that are visible from the ground are allowed.  Fortunately they are building a new home about 45 minutes away brand new and are incorporating solar panels in to the basic design right off the start of it.  They are not sure about power storage yet.  Still working on them on that aspect as utility cuts are frequent in the area ( 3 a month on average for 15 minutes to three hours ) and during any kind of weather that isn't calm and clear.",

Now, yes, if you are in below zero then they don't perform as well and I know it is a completely different type of heat but you can't beat how efficient it is and money it saves you. We have done the same. Solar panels and 2 x brand new mitsubishi heat pumps. We still have a wood stove and I will use that on freezing days but otherwise it's just switch on the heat pumps and don't worry about power bills. We'll spend a lot less money on wood going forward.",

Use an export-limiting solution to ramp down the solar when required to not exceed the transformer (SolarEdge have this option as do most manufacturers). You'll have to buy a power meter from the inverter manufacturer but you can use the cheaper inverter and skip the cost of a new transformer.\n\nWe did an analysis for a wind farm site and found that over the year the solar could still produce 80% of its yearly power compared to having its own transformer",

"comment": "This is what I posted when someone posted this on Facebook:\n\n\"This video is presented as a sober assessment on renewable energy but is really a series of misleading info/facts.\n\nSome examples of misleading info I noticed:\n- The efficiency limit for solar cells is said to be 33% but this only applies to single P-N junction type solar cell. The actual efficiency limit for Solar of all types is 86.8%.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit\n\n- The rapid gains in solar and wind is not just due to efficiency gains it is due to them actually getting cheaper on a $/kiloWatt basis. It is now cheaper to build solar and wind plants (even with battery storage cost factored in) than coal and alot of time combined cycle natural gas plants. The costs for both technologies have sharply fallen over the last decade. That's why alot of grid operators are getting in on this. Of course they aren't doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. It's because it's become dumb not to.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source\n\n- The video quoted the world wide % of wind and solar at 3% but since we are talking about US energy policy we should probably note that it is 10% (wind and solar) in the US.\nhttps://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php\n\n- The video talks about lithium Ion batteries for grid level storage and they will definitely be a large component, but for longer term and GigaWatt scale energy storage we are likely to rely more on tech like Redox Flow Batteries. Which are too heavy for cars but perfect for stationary storage applications.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery\n\n-Everything we make in our society has a material and energy cost. That is unavoidable. But life cycle studies have shown that even a mediocre electric car powered by all coal plants still has a lower carbon debt than a internal combustion vehicle.\nhttps://sustain.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/2018-63%20Lifecycle%20Analysis%20of%20Electric%20Vehicles_Kukreja.pdf\n\"",

"comment": "\\-Is my math correct?\n\nThe math appears correct as far as it goes. I'm guessing that the 0.85 is the assumed power factor. Your gear likely has a switch-mode power supply with a p.f. more like 0.5. I have no idea if 100W per speaker is going to provide the volume you need in an open air environment. It would be enough to be unpleasantly loud in a living room.\n\n\\-Is “1/8 power” from the speakers equivalent to 1/8 of max volume?\n\n\\-How would increasing volume increase the power draw…is it simply a linear scale up to 340W at 100% volume? The Jackery product info shows that a 300W blender can run for 13 hours, but a 700W ice shaver is 3.5 hours so I assume it’s not linear.\n\nNo. The relationship between power and volume is logarithmic, not linear. The smallest perceptible volume increase requires doubling the power. Doubling the perceived volume requires ten times the power. If you have to crank the volume knob to 8-9 to fill the air, you will probably be running more like 700 Watts power supply to the amp.\n\nThe Relationship of Voltage, Loudness, Power and Decibels:\n\n[https://www.gcaudio.com/tips-tricks/the-relationship-of-voltage-loudness-power-and-decibels/](https://www.gcaudio.com/tips-tricks/the-relationship-of-voltage-loudness-power-and-decibels/)\n\n\\-The Jackery has an LCD screen that shows “input” and “output”…once everything is plugged in and it shows those numbers, will redoing the equation give us an accurate run time?\n\nThat should give you are reasonable estimate if you test it in open air at the volume you want.\n\n\\-Are there any other considerations?\n\nIf you are running the Jackery hard, it will need good ventilation.\n\n\\-In your opinion, how much run time will I get?  \n\nMy guess is that you will be running something like 600 Watts out of the Jackery during music play with a power factor of 0.5, less 100 Watts of usable Solar power so,   (1002 x 0.5) / 500 = about an hour.\n\nIt seems unlikely to me that a notebook computer running the digital to analog conversion of the music files would only be 5 Watts. It's probably more like 50-75 Watts. If you are running 600 Watts to the speakers amp, that would not change the run time much.\n\nWhy is power factor a consideration? When we buy power from the electric company we pay by the Watt regardless of the power factor. When we supply the power it gets used from our source at Watts/p.f. The electric company actively manages the p.f. on the grid by switching in huge capacitor banks.\n\nBy way of reference, I hooked up my KillAWatt meter to my home audio and played some rock music. My home amp is 100 (audio) Watts per channel. Idling it drew 62 Watts. Playing the music at pretty loud living room volume drew 110 Watts. My loud living room volume would probably be like a whisper in open air 20 feet from the speakers.\n\nGood luck",

"comment": "Nope. I have solar as we speak. A $700 setup that should pay off in 2-3 years. \n\nIf you sat down with a spread sheet and did all the math. You could figure out all the intangibles. \n\nBut in general, to me, it's like a car. Depreciation happens so quickly on a car, like solar, that if I buy a 5-year old car, it just makes more financial sense. Solar panels are changing so rapidly it's best to stick in a 5-year window. After 5 years the depreciation and the potential tech improvements makes it a losing situation. \n\nYou have to stop thinking of it as \"in 10 years I won't have to pay anything\". Because there are other scenarios where you can get to that point, earlier. Or cheaper.  Or maybe avoid it and save money.",

"comment": "The answer to this really depends on the size of your solar system.\n\nIf you're never going to produce more energy than you use go with a company that offers 1:1. The downside to ALL the companies that do offer 1:1 net metering is they don't allow you to roll over your unused kWh into the next month and so on. Not a problem though if you'll never produce more than what you use.\n\nIf you do have a large enough solar system to generate more than what you use you'll want to consider Shell or Octopus. Those are the only two options in my opinion that have a plan that's even worth considering once you're producing 110% or more of the energy you need. Shell buys back at \"Market Rate\" (which is GARBAGE!) and that averages out to about $0.03 but they allow you to roll your unused kWh over into next month and so on. Octopus is the same but they'll cut you a check for your unused kWh upon your request(I think or maybe at a certain milestone like 50 or 100 kWh) and also allow you to roll over unused kWh into the next month.\n\nI have Shell, am paying $0.13 per kWh and getting paid $0.03 per kWh, no monthly fee just for the pleasure of having Shell be my energy provider(unlike many other companies). At the time I signed my contract Octopus was $0.22 per kWh and also charged $10 a month just to have them be your provider so I passed on them based on price alone, didn't even consider what their buyback was. \n\nSomeone eventually will post a link to a website that shows all the companies that offer solar plans(no not [powertochoose.org](https://powertochoose.org) that sites great!), I'm not going to post it because it's mostly all incorrect information. When someone does finally post it, please go to the actual companies website and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH to determine what works best for you and your solar system.\n\nEdit: I did some more digging on Rhythm and LO AND BEHOLD I found an EFL that says they buy back solar! Their 12 month plan is $0.22 per kWh and they'll buy back excess from you at $0.102 per kWh, not bad, but, they charge you $8.95 a month to have them as your energy provider, that's a bummer. They do allow you to roll over excess kWh into a new month and so on, so Rhythm is definitely a good contender.",

Later in the evening I may draw power from the utility and not be charged for the power as I already supplied the power they sold. If at the end of a year (true-up) period I had excess power produced (that the utility sold to others); I get less than the price per watt they pay the supplier (which works out to about $0.023/watt), as they tack on additional charges. NEM 2 also dictated moving those with systems to TOU plans that generate additional revenue. If I don't produce an excess, I have to pay utility the full rate per watt for what I used. With NEM 3 a system has to produce 3.7 times more electricity to the grid to get the same return as NEM 2. This means the utility companies are reaping the benefits of selling nearly 4 kwhr of energy, at full price, with minimal infrastructure use, before they return 1kwhr to generator of the 4 kw's. \n\nTrue-up doesn't matter but what it gives you is a hint of the true value of excess residential generation. 2.3ct/kWh is a price the utility would pay any utility scale generator for their energy. If you want the residential consumer to be treated like serious part of the grid, that's the value.\n\nAvoided cost compensation is 4x lower than retail rate compensation, sure. That's because net metering is a subsidy structure and doesn't reflect the market value of your generated kWh. NEM2 mandated TOU because the growing duck curve called for the incitement of different consumption patterns. It never solved the fact that PV consumers are being paid 20ct+ for a kWh at 12am while the spot market would offer energy for 2ct/kWh.\n\nInfrastructure costs are being equally (mostly) spread across all consumers. I don't get to avoid T&amp;D costs just because I live in the shadow of a gas plant, and our neighbors don't get to just because the house across the street may have PV, either. You two could go off-grid together, and it would swiftly become evident what you're paying your utility for.\n\n&gt;These companies are not government utilities, they are investor owned utilities that make billions of dollars in profit. Why can't they accept a small profit margin to manage the infrastructure for which the public has already paid. A profit margin of 4% would seem reasonable for such a non risk business. \n\nI didn't call them government utilities, I only mentioned government and utilities because your PV system is also being subsidized by the government. They accept a higher than 4% ROE, but it's not like they make money hand over fist. If you want to invest your money, utility shares probably won't be your first choice.\n\n&gt;As far as buying \"junk generation\" without the existing residential solar systems there would be many more days of emergency power restrictions and blackouts in CA. CA has always purchased coal fired plant electricity. Over a third of electricity usage in CA comes from out of state plants. Allowing Sacramento politicians to claim air quality improvements in CA. Nothing is ever said about the other states.\n\nPV's role in avoiding grid emergencies is limited because peak load doesn't occur during the middle of the day. The avoided cost model does reward you for feeding in during power shortages, via high summertime afternoon/evening rates. Junk is the bulk of solar exports that occurs mid-day when prices are low. You aren't saving the grid from blackouts at 11am.\n\nCali also imports non-coal power. When the sun is out, that out-of-state power is easily 10x cheaper than rooftop solar. Where do you think the money needed to replace imports with rooftop energy at this premium comes from? It's either you, the consumer, or if you can zero out your bill with NEM2, other consumers who don't own solar.\n\n&gt;Other countries do not have the same import/export taxes and other barriers that the US has but there are still permits and fees involved.\n\nGerman PV owners are comfortable setting up systems with a feed-in price of 8ct/kWh (retail rate: &gt;30ct) and accept an ~11yr payoff. Works out.",

Will reduce that to breakeven by True Up with summer generation.\nOn an annual basis I produce 1500 kWhs for every 1KW of solar panels installed. Every location is different.",

"comment": "I have been having the same issue. I have two of the RESU10H Prime batteries paired with a SolarEdge SE7600H inverter and they recently started throttling the charging to no more than 2kW.  The batteries are outside next to the house (temp never gets below freezing), but this charging behavior is consistent no matter what temp it is outside. \n\nIf I change the backup reserve in the SolarEdge app to a percent higher than the current charge of the batteries, then the battery charging drops down to 1kW. I also noticed if I make this change at night when no solar power is generated, the battery will charge at 1kW from the grid.\n\nI’ve had the batteries over a year and they used to charge at a higher rate (~5kW if I remember correctly), but after the last battery had to be replaced again under warranty the charging has been limited to 2kW. Prior to that battery replacement, the batteries would never charge from the grid, only from the solar panels. \n\nI’m assuming there must be some kind of setting on the battery side???",

"comment": "I get rid of the water then use a paper towel to dry out the tofu a bit. Except for when I use it for a tofu scramble I like that to be moist. This is the [Tofu](http://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/img/prods/tofu/1111-house-tofu-extra-firm-lg.jpg) that I use. \n\nMy favorite tofu is the [Garlic and Pepper tofu](http://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/img/prods/tofu/1408-house-tofu-steak-garlic-pepper-lg.jpg). I just cut this stuff up in long rectangles and fry it till its brown then I toss some soy sauce on top then let it fry up a bit longer and get crispy. It tastes amazing.\n\nI really like the Garlic and pepper tofu in fajitas. I fry up my veggies in a separate pan and add the tofu. I add the teriyaki when everything is combined because I really like the teriyaki flavor in the veggies.\n\nOne of my favorite meals is to make is Southwestern Kale and Beans. Its possibly one of the simplest dishes to make.  If you've never had Kale before this is possibly the best dish to eat it in.\n\nGet 2 cans of any type of beans you like. (I have never tried Garbanzo beans in this but it might work.)  Open the cans and Toss the beans in a big frying pan liquid and all and make sure the pan is big and that you can put a lid over the pan. Then just with your hands pull the leaves of the kale off of the stem. The stems can be pretty big and tough so I just discard the stems. The recipe requires 6 cups of kale but I found that if you just make sure that the top of the beans is covered with kale where you can't see the beans anymore is perfect. Take a clove of minced garlic and just toss it inside.  After that bring the liquid to a boil then bring it back down to a simmer.  \n\nCover and set the timer for around 15 minutes. Come back and add a bit of your favorite hot sauce (I used to use Tabasco but found that if I use a mixture of Mexi-Pep and Tapatio it comes out so much better. I suggest adding Salt and pepper (Fresh ground pepper is best) to your liking and just eat in a bowl.",

"comment": "That's fair enough. And I plan on transitioning to a vegan lifestyle eventually, but right now I can't afford it as I have developed a leptin resistance from the 10+ years of a fast food diet. Once I'm at a healthy weight and I'm able to eat carbs and have my body process them normally will I make the transition.\n\nAnd I don't want you guys to think I'm trying to pick a fight, I'm not at all. In an earlier comment I mentioned I no longer eat pig products, and only eat grass-fed beef purely for ethical reasons. That's mainly due to meeting my vegan friends a while a back. They planted a seed and more and more I find it harder and harder to continue eating animals. I used to love, ***LOVE*** bacon, but I just picture a face every time I see a slice of ham/bacon in the meat section of the super market.\n\nI also don't necessarily enjoy eating beef, but I also don't mind it. I've now adopted a practice of verbally thanking the cow that gave its life so I can live every. single. time I cook. I know it may seem like a moot point to most vegans, but I see it as one step closer.",

None of these statements are true though.\n\nI don't base my veganism/strict vegetarianism on compassion, I base it on reason. There's no reason for me to kill and eat other animals, who very obviously can feel pain and suffer, but a bug breaking into my home and flying all over my food and flying up in my face (I'm looking at you, craneflies!) is not rational to me.\n\nI could scoop them up and throw them out, but like I said in my other post they're 1) not worthy of moral consideration, 2) freak me out.

"comment": "I'm a vegan in the United States Air Force. When you are out of training and stationed at home then being vegan is almost exactly like it is for a civilian. Very few people around you would be vegan but there is a culture of fitness where many people will experiment with diets and be open to alternative eating. When you are in training, especially in the beginning there is huge pressure both formally and socially to be like everyone else but they can make an exception for a different diet as long as it's in a \"special needs\" frame like what the article posted by nawitus mentioned about Muslim diets. You just have to be adamant about it which can be hard at times.\n\n\nYou may also be stationed in a backwards part of the US where no restaurants offer veggie selections and grocery stores don't carry a variety of plants. What I wouldn't give to live in Portland, New York or California... but I'm in the midwest and have to make due mostly with what I can cook. \n\n\nIt can be difficult too when you deploy. There are much fewer food choices.  My chow hall had fruits, some cooked vegetables, a salad bar and sometimes soymilk but never anything like tempeh or tofu. I benefited from a new focus on health foods that the Air Force has but they still rarely have whole grains or other foods rich in nutrients. \n\n\nOverall you just have to resolve to stay vegan and be strong, which is what every vegan has to do.",

Big things that everybody should know should be submitted like normal.)\n\n* \"Everything went better than expected\" (Positive responses to you \"coming out\" vegan / explaining veganism  / cooking for a non-vegan) \n\n* \"Inspiring (everyday?) activism\" (Stories, tips, etc. What small things did you do to help the cause today?)\n\n* \"Critical day / This stumped me / I've never really understood the common pro-veg argument that..\" (Arguments against veganism that seemed valid and you might not have had a response to. Or arguments *for* veganism that you find to be weak.  )\n\n* Eureka! / Nailed it! / New insight! (Link and/or quote insightful comments /arguments that made you realize something, or see something clearer. Great analogies, thought experiments or even an anecdote that made you realize something on a emotional level.\n\n\nI think it's good if the topics are fairly specific so that they don't \"steal\" to many of the regular submissions that day. It's great if the topics capture things you ordinary wouldn't think of submitting (because it's not \"big enough\", might not interest everyone etc). If they don't, they may end up making the subreddit less active. \nI also think it's good to have one or two topics that are more negative (Like \"Critical day\" above and/or the \"rant-day\" that OP suggested), but *not to many of them*. We still want the subreddit to have an overall good/positive vibe. \n\nFeel free to criticize. \n\n**Edit**: If this is an idea that people want to implement maybe we can have a new thread where we have just one suggested topic per comment.

It would be great if I could add it into my diet but I was just a bit worried.\n\nAlso how often would you recommend (if you have any idea) it being okay to eat seitan cos i'm a hungry guy and from the sounds of it, it looks pretty good!!",

It is surprising how much people simply don't know about animals and the meat/dairy industry so it's important to keep spreading the knowledge! I have always been against eating meat because I've always known that it's wrong to murder and eat animals. However, I used to think veganism was stupid because cows make milk any it doesn't hurt them right? And chickens naturally lay eggs? But obviously I was wrong. If we spread our knowledge, more people will realise that they're wrong. \n\nIt's natural for lots of people to respond with anger when they are being told that they are doing something harmful, especially when it's something they've always done and never given much thought to. They get really defensive and irrational, which is what these two women did. \n\nI'd get so upset if I were in your shoes, which is why I tend to shy away from these debates, but you were brave and certainly did the right thing!",

As vegans are something of an ultra minority, I believe that it's practical to compromise our social ideals as long as we are still maintaining our personal ideals. \n\nI reached a sense of peace on this by reminding myself that the people we love would exist in the same lifestyle with or without our love. We deserve to be happy and don't need to isolate ourselves on principle. \n\nMost significantly, I think when analyzing the personal bad habits of partner, in deciding whether you should compromise/accept or leave, you should think about if those habits will likely bleed over into other aspects of your relationship. Someone who participates in the typical, albeit harmful, consumption pattern of the vast majority of humanity is not necessarily going to be thoughtless, greedy, or violent in your interpersonal relationship. All the people that have been considerate, friendly, generous, etc. to me live a non-vegan lifestyle. I allow myself to enjoy the benefit of their good qualities.",

"comment": "I just started regularly exercising a few weeks ago. It's been a journey since I've been out of shape for so long! It's also challenging because I haven't exercised since switching from omni to vegetarian to (now) vegan.\n\nThe gym I go to is basically a crossfit box but they offer \"fit\" classes which is what I do. Basically crossfit-style workouts minus the more intense gymnastics and olympic weightlifting. We do a lot of dumbbell and kettlebell exercises, mixed with bodyweight and cardio stuff. It's a ton of fun!\n\nHowever some days, I just \\*know\\* that I haven't eaten right. I almost passed out Wednesday on the row machine. I just felt like I was running on empty and didn't have anymore to give, and that was super early into the workout.\n\nWhen I got home I evaluated what I ate that day and realized there was basically no protein going on. Usually for breakfast I'll have a green smoothie or avocado toast. I skipped my late-morning cliff bar (no longer allowed to eat at work), and lunch was a small veggie sushi roll. I wolfed down almost an entire block of bbq tofu and felt instantly better.\n\nBut yeah, yikes. Basically I really struggle with the protein thing. Even when I was omni, I didn't eat a lot of it. Dinner is easy because that's the one meal I actually care to spend time on. I always incorporate either beans, tofu, or tempeh. If it makes it to lunch for leftovers, great, if not I find myself eating out at work which has almost no vegan options (carrot sushi, or salad, you pick!)\n\nSorry this got kind of long. Basically what are some easy ways to incorporate protein into my morning/afternoon? I was thinking about adding some kind of protein powder to the smoothie, but from what I've heard the vegan options can give it a weird taste? Anyone have experience with that?",

There are cruel and inhumane ways of raising and killing them that should be outlawed. Killing animals in excess is murder. Especially the amount of food people waste. You will probably never convince me of the morals against eating meat, but I do appreciate the moral question of their livelihoods and treatment. That I can stand for, and I stopped eating red meat because I do not want to support those industries. Now that goes the same with chicken and industrial fishing. But if I, myself, go down to the pier and catch the occasional fish that is plentiful in population, I am not going to lose sleep over it. \n\nSerious question though, and I am really not trying to be a dick about this, but say we fail to bring down global warming by 2040, and by 2060 agriculture is hard, expensive, and probably not viable as a food source for most regions of the world, what is your plan then? I mean, we will probably be dead, but I guess hypothetically. Does your belief system extend to alternate proteins like insects? Seriously though I really hope we get our shit together about climate change. Third biggest reason I stopped eating red meat altogether.",

There are a few people in my class who constantly bash vegans, post pics of themself in a milking parlor or drinking milk with #februdairy or #dairyforlife... these are people that have chosen a profession to help animals! Yet somehow they think it’s OK to keep animals healthy just to be killed off for food or milk or cheese or whatever. It is so disheartening, but the fact there is this much pushback means we are making a difference, otherwise they wouldn’t bother. Dairy farms left and right are going out of business because of how unsustainable it is, the only reason they are still going is because of government funding. In lectures we are taught about farm budgeting and most farms don’t even break even without the help of the government. Dairy is a thing of the past, hopefully it’ll be gone sooner rather than later.",

"comment": "I agree with the second part. I feel like our society has become one where doctors and the entire healthcare system is just for solving health problems once they need that treatment. Preventative care isn’t really  factored in. \n\nIn my experience, at least from the experience as someone who’s not very well-off financially and from the United States, I only go to the doctor when it’s absolutely necessary. I’ve cancelled appointments because I’ve been kicked off my healthcare. So when I do go, I have a specific issue in mind that probably requires medication or a cream or an allergen testing or whatever. \n\nThis may be slightly off-topic from veganism, but I definitely admire countries where healthcare covers things like gym memberships and I think it would be amazing if they covered things like a plant-based diet because of all the health benefits it has.",

We’ve rationalized the “self” as all sentient beings and try to reduce harm by disengaging in the animal food chain. Those that don’t see animals as “self” can’t rationalize the lifestyle choice. They base it back on the food chain and pat themselves on the back for not considering alternative realities.",

I don't think all vegans should try it or anything.\n\nI just think ethically (from an animal suffering perspective) it's fine that some vegans opt for it.\n\nYou have a different issue that I won't really argue against. You're not wrong at all. But for me (and I suspect millions of others) moving to whole foods would be more difficult than going vegan. So I think if we are interested in the animals' well being and climate change a focus needs to be just reducing animal products for now. I believe we really can make this seamless for the developed world with meat alternatives, and that this is more possible than WFPB for the masses. Not that we have to pick and choose, can advocate for both, but I'm a fatass so for now all I can committ to is not killing animals.",

If it's a snack food,  then buy a vegan version that's ready for your next snack attack:-)\n\nTake control and ensure you are stocked with foods that are vegan. And don't let yourself get too hungry, that leads to old habits and bad choices in general. It has little to do with willpower,  and all to do with setting yourself up for success. Plan, prepare, and review.  You are in charge, don't let yourself become a victim of circumstance! :-)\n\n\nFocus on what \"food\" really is. If you look at meat,  it's really a leg that was stolen from a tortured animal that cried and pleaded for her life. They've disgusted this suffering as food by chopping off the parts we recognise as animals, and they packaged it with colors that our brain likes, since we evolved color vision to see plant foods. They've hijacked our instinct to see food where there is none. When a cat brings us a dead bird we know it's not human food. But the store puts a bird in a nice packet to make think its human food.",

One really hard thing is the constant mocking/ not getting it from people in my life who think it's ridiculous that I won't eat stuff with a bit of milk powder or honey or something in the ingredients. It's very frustrating to deal with. Also, just the general sadness that comes from knowing how cruel the animal agriculture industry is, and the knowledge that I'm making next to no difference in the grand scheme of things. \n\nThe hardest thing for me, in terms of food, is how much I miss cheese, though. It was my favourite thing in the world before I went vegan, and I haven't found any vegan substitutes that come close to replicating the exact taste and texture. I'm autistic so I'm really picky with sensory experiences, and so I can tell the difference to a much greater extent than neurotypicals can. I've tried a lot of cheeses that other people have told me are \"just like the real thing\", but they never are. Some of them are tolerable, but a lot of them are disgusting to me.\n\nObviously I'd never stop being vegan, because I do it as I believe it's the moral thing to do, but it does suck. I really miss my old favourite foods like loaded skins or mac and cheese, and the vegan alternative versions just aren't the same.",

Seeing the gore/slaughter truck footage etc helps remind me why I went vegan in the first place, and that the passive action of going vegan is not remotely enough in terms of my moral obligation. In recent times I've come to the realisation I need to stop fucking around and stop being lazy..\n\nI get that everyone is in a different place, but when we consider the bigger picture and the reality of the world:\n\n- 60 billion land animals are slaughtered yearly, most of them in quite horrific conditions.\n\n- 2+ trillion marine animals are slaughtered yearly.\n\n- Estimates of the vegan population indicate that we are at best 5% of the global pop, but more realistically ~1%.\n\nWe're a small group abstaining from animal products to protest on behalf of literally trillions of animals. \n\nBut smaller still is the number of vegans who actively speak up and campaign for the animals in a way that can have some semblance of hope to affect change. \n\nIf the gore/footage can help light a fire under our asses to motivate us to become activists, maybe it's necessary.",

"comment": "But surely you can see there’s an inherent contradiction in the eagerness to reject any ethical discussion regarding this issue. Any acknowledgment of the ethics is met with “see, this is why no one likes vegans, no one wants to be judged.” This idea of sheepishly skirting around the fact that meat eating is killing the planet because it won’t be popular is absurd. Even if we were to ignore the immense suffering that we inflict on animals in factory farms and focus solely on the selfish perspective of what is beneficial to humans and humans alone, we will literally render our home planet uninhabitable by eating so much meat. \n\nThere *is* an ethical component to this and eventually it won’t matter how unpopular it is to acknowledge that. It will simply be too late.\n\nIt seems the most popular suggestion is always to skirt around the ethics and present this issue to people in a more palatable way. But there is another alternative: we could all grow up and face the reality of the situation that *we literally can not survive* meat consumption on this scale.",
