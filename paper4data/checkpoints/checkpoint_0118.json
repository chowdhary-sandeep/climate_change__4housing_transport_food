Most people are raised as carnists through lies, against their own will by their parents and the rest of society. It is an unexamined societal ideology that is passed on from generation to generation. Veganism is not in the same position, despite what many deluded vegans believe. Many pro-capitalist, consumerist vegans argue that diet or veganism is only about \"personal choice,\" but if that was true kids would be raised knowing the truth of the agriculture system and given a choice whether they are the center of the universe and don't care, or to make a protest effort through a diet-lifestyle movement called veganism against animal exploitation. If it was not for some type of advocacy, no one posting to /r/vegan would be vegan. What happens in the real world most often is that many carnists without any particular prodding just by the presence of or learning about the existence of non-normative values mock a vegan, vegans, veganism just like any other non-normative value like being car-free in a car dependent society meets immediate unprovoked scorn, as well. \n\nI am continually amazed at how many apathetic consumerist vegans try to bash advocacy, probably because it makes them self-conscious of themselves.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.27455908556112263,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21457981522984243,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1585909260036087,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21076412204032144,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1676567721001715,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2395173254680324,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.003906220973779758,"ev_1":-0.14157540494731316,"ev_2":-0.005678971637583648,"ev_3":-0.002052263014775235,"ev_4":-0.004506676639721263,"ev_5":-0.001286057381851909,"ev_6":-0.005372283022249273},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed (The author's stance toward EVs is not mentioned in the text.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Audi is using induction motors on the e-tron, but its sister Porsche is using permanent magnet motors on the Taycan. \n\nFrom what I can piece together, permanent magnet motors are slightly more expensive, slightly more efficient especially when running at their design speed, slightly smaller, and a good deal easier to cool. Induction motors are slightly cheaper, slightly less efficient overall but they can be optimized over a wider variety of speeds, slightly harder to design but easier to manufacture, and require more active cooling.\n\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'd say it all comes down to the supply of the magnets. Tesla secured a large contract for magnets early, so they could count on enough being available for their model 3. VW is perhaps less confident they can get a secure supply for all the MEB models they have planned.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005101963470224291,"1.1.1_stance":-0.04204984224447798,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1943564992336615,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0827031210064888,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20547619674356324,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1392366538232892,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1995047538075596,"ev_1":-0.2182817302915703,"ev_2":-0.06746135219873395,"ev_3":-0.023037078567237284,"ev_4":-0.052640547777021617,"ev_5":-0.056328817193085946,"ev_6":-0.17869068984224185},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

He's not saying EVs are bad, he's correctly pointing out that car makers are over-hyping the energy savings of EVs in order to sell more cars.\n\nAdam says right up front that EVs are more efficient than most gas cars. He even says that if your car is on its way out and you need a new one, EVs are definitely worth considering. The problem, which is clearly articulated in the video, is when people buy into the hype and prematurely ditch an efficient gas car for a sexy new EV because they think it'll make a huge difference when there's a real possibility it won't.\n\nIt depends a lot on where you live (and even a bit on the type of EV you buy). I've been looking into getting a Chevy Bolt. According to [this tool](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/ev-emissions-tool#z/NATIONAL/_/_/_), in my zip code a Chevy Bolt has roughly the same carbon emissions as a 58mpg gas car. That's a lot better than my 9 year old Focus at 30mpg. But it's also pretty much what a Prius gets (and the Prius is $15000 cheaper). In fact, where I live *every model of Tesla* except the Model 3 Long Range is outperformed by the Prius in terms of CO2e per mile. EDIT: and the Model 3 is only slightly better at 63mpg\n\nEverybody's getting so worked up they're ignoring the central thesis of the video:\n&gt;If you buy a new car too often, you could completely undo all the carbon savings that you might get from buying an electric car. If you really want to help save the environment, the best thing you can do is to reduce the amount you drive, and drive your current car as long as possible, provided it's reasonably efficient. But if your car is beyond repair, and you absolutely need to buy a new one, then go ahead - buy yourself a nice, small electric car. Perhaps even a used one.\n\nThat's it.

It is a scam, usually to make you pay up front so you have credit in the app you will never successfully use unless you charge on that brand all the time.\n\nIf you scan an RFID card before looking in the app, you will never know the price youre paying because the app linked to the RFID card will not tell you the tariff while charging is ongoing, it only shows you that you can stop your charging session.\n\nNo apps list the price in any list or index.

We will harvest oil out of thin air. If we can get enough renewable to power these carbon capture that turns CO2 back into fuels, it would be a much better energy storage than batteries. I don't personally believe that an electric car is the future because we might not even have enough lithium available to switch every car to electric if I recall correctly. Unless we find ways to make sodium batteries viable, lithium is not limitless and would require a lot of mining, including the bottom of the oceans (which can severely impact the ecosystem).\n\nHowever, if we want to return to the same level of CO2 as 1990 (below 300ppm), on top of turning CO2 into fuels we have to permanently remove CO2 out of the carbon cycle. Sure we can plant trees, but they will most likely burn in forest fires with climate change and the carbon will return back into the air that way...\n\nThat's why I think creating diamond sand more effectively without high pressure and high temperature conditions like the breakthrough method that the South Korean researches discovered in the link I shared in this post looks very promising. Maybe we will be able to invent some kind of diamond concrete to build stronger structures that could withstand most climate disasters. Maybe we could build underwater cities with that new building material, and keep land surfaces for agriculture and natural habitat. I am an engineer and these possibilities of creating new industrial material make me very excited 😄\n\nAnd then the trees we plant won't all burn and will semi-permanently absorb more carbon the way we intend it to work. But we'll have to be careful not to remove too much carbon or else we could artificially create an ice age 😅 but I think that will take centuries to reach this point.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005257474685398241,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2669680436568462,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22884584138113098,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2907164040754348,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.340378762416852,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17816676132406406,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.275438444215589,"ev_1":-0.28383169254629803,"ev_2":-0.055305473829018105,"ev_3":-0.06304410492642394,"ev_4":-0.0609969925887223,"ev_5":-0.03731315136246849,"ev_6":-0.212159591911553},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Article is about US but I’m from EU, NL if be exact. \n\nAt the moment of time, EV’s are not cleaner than gasoline modern car (for example EURO6). And don’t throw anything to my side yet, see below. \n\nThis is practically cleaner IN the city when you drive EV as far your emission to the city or neighbourhood is practically about zero. \n\nHowever charging the EV’s are much worse than you think. If someone in real life believes in some kind of advertisement or written brochure that you are using 100% clean (alternative) energy - false. \n\nLook, all the grids in the country or even in the region (with some exceptions, as always) are interconnected and have NO dedication or special channel for delivering you or to the charging stations specifically wind or solar power. The power in the grid coming from all sources available at the moment, including coal, oil, gas, hydro, nuclear power plants. So you are charging = adding fossil fuel consumption. \n\nMain problem here is misunderstanding of how much really EV’s affects power grids and how much in real life them are consuming. \n\nFor example you can say I have 15-20 kW solar panels on my house roof and I’m almost closing my house needs even can store and yeh, you are correct, typical household can consume approx 10-20 kW/h (in EU) per 24hr with approx grid demand of… 0.5-3.5 kW, in rare cases more but let’s take normal day without repairing something and etc. \n\nNow understand this: power plants burning fuel on a DEMAND you make in kW, in a time when this demand created, not later not earlier - just in the moment you turned your stove you created demand of 3-11 kW and you need to take in somewhere just now. No exception. So power plant taking the load and burning more fuel to fulfil your demand. All happy. \n\nNow EV charging. One EV with fast charging can create demand in 150-350 kW. One car. Now imaging busy charging station with 50 EVs. They alone creating power demand more than a good household block with couple of hundred houses. And energy again beer to come from somewhere. Unfortunately solar energy and wind power cannot give you not as much energy and most important - cannot be regulated up and down. So all regulation and coverage of all peaks is fossil or nuclear. \n\nAnd no, battery storage will not save you because % from generation and demand stored in them extremely low in capacity and time. It made actually because all these alternative sources influence on the grid to somehow make it stable. \n\nConclusion: biggest part of energy you use to charge your cars - fossil fuel and your demand and consumption is really huge. Efficiency of fossil fuel power plant lower than modern gasoline engine. \nSo, we are cleaning our streets from pollution - yes. \nDo we produce less pollution - no, at the moment. \n\nAdditionally here will be battery production and utilisation track - but it is separate discipline I’ll not touch. \n\nAnd yes I’m driving EV, and yes I’m building this networks. \n\nMy Karma now will be in deep shit :)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.07463025076625247,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0836797925792098,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19405553378797857,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17348188427400488,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20609168407757103,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20942252052146493,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.026026794997354347,"ev_1":-0.16299852303956222,"ev_2":-0.20234194533958755,"ev_3":-0.16484604552832455,"ev_4":-0.14259933447923057,"ev_5":-0.06775044255967562,"ev_6":-0.12494386180575627},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Solar installers absolutely do lobby at the local level, especially the large ones.  For the most part, they lobby to ensure that large utility companies cannot deny access to grid power to people with solar.  However, yes, they can and do make bargains that do nothing to help the individual, and may actually make it harder for DIY installations.  Does this make them evil or bad?  No.  But it sure is frustrating to see that their lobbying is definitely focused on their individual financial interests, rather than to encourage solar installation in general.\n\nI'm going to disagree with you about building permit codes.  If safety were the main issue, a very logical, straightforward, and streamlined process with review by an educated person would be in place.  Instead, a fee was paid to my city, no actual review of my permit application actually occurred (they specifically placed a sticker saying that they didn't review or check my electrical diagrams, my roofing structure, etc to see if any of what I said actually complied with code), and we didn't have a single on-site inspection by anybody.  Therefore, the city did absolutely nothing to ensure safety.  They merely created a complicated sounding process in order to justify collecting fees.  \n\nAs far as DIY instsllation, I would also argue that the majority of people who THINK they can actually can.  It is actually very simple.  All the parts click together easier than Legos (since Legos can be placed in almost any arrangement, and these parts only fit together in a certain way).  Most people with basic handyman abilities can install solar.  \n\nWhat I would love to see happen is a more stream lined permit application process that is very open to DIY installations, with the fee going to pay for an actual on-site inspection.  Safety is hugely important, but our current process (at least in my city) does nothing to increase safety, only to create barriers.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.24216277028711414,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22819373703941848,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27445719071983515,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2163997868136057,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29629482681718095,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15686283920461688,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24904645200876985,"solar_1":-0.10439778268192568,"solar_2":-0.056939612992600946,"solar_3":-0.07338671372053795,"solar_4":-0.0697991349898075,"solar_5":-0.04078085124395633,"solar_6":-0.13849982783722226,"solar_7":-0.07615712658055902,"solar_8":-0.11052791248584981,"solar_9":-0.025318618956688965,"solar_10":-0.14576151989154382},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

But commercial sized installations, think large land or roof based arrays, those have been done for over a year in national grids territory. Eversource claims their allotment is running out fast, as well. \n\nNeither of those affect residential, though. \n\nWhat does affect residential is the ending of the SREC-II program. SRECs are the primary driver of returns for Massachusetts installations over the first 10 years of a systems life. Because of them, you could see rooftop installs paying for themselves in 7-10 years (commercial paid for itself quicker due to the use of depreciation). So without SRECs, your payback period will likely be beyond a decade.\n\nIn feb, the state said that just 60MW was left for sub-25kw systems (residential-sized) in the SREC-II program. I was speaking to /u/commercialsolarguy last week and he said that the last he heard, only 10MW was left. \n\nSo basically, if you haven't been talking to an installer, you're too late to have any hope for SRECs. Maybe the state will roll out SREC-III, but it won't be as generous as SREC-II, which wasn't as generous as the original SREC program\n\nNet metering is still an option.  And we still have some of the highest electricity prices in the country, so solar is still a decent proposition if you have a long enough time horizon.  And I think there is still a REC program that can compensate you a little for the green energy that you produce, but whAtever number you're quoted today will likely be smaller a year from now. \n\nSorry if that doesn't answer your question. \n\nThe best answer is that it still works if you're motivated to help the state produce clean energy. It also helps if you want to do your little part to lower CO2 emissions. But if you're looking to get a fast return on investment, as of now, that's not so promising. Best bet would be to wait and see if the state comes up with something. But during that waiting period, the legislature could dismantle net-metering for residential systems. \n\nWe have no idea what will happen, there is no clarity at all.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.21662806356713796,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08488606455743479,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21601728159726008,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.01783645577563675,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30694632308592085,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.04439430345821904,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03692180042465528,"solar_1":-0.22086264732639255,"solar_2":-0.11813771103290989,"solar_3":-0.19612746095809463,"solar_4":-0.1614637397117035,"solar_5":-0.012789972019769872,"solar_6":-0.005629504768876359,"solar_7":-0.0031131160188427507,"solar_8":-0.005029335601041869,"solar_9":-0.07227573167377462,"solar_10":-0.2615944341501483},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other: the author does not explicitly mention a personal reference group in the text.","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.","1.3.3_second_order":"weak.","solar_1":"NO.

Most solar installers have not done their homework lately with regard to ground mounting. It is no longer expensive, provided you don't have rocky soil. Just think about it. Assuming the material costs are roughly the same, how much more would you charge to do an install job up on a hot, slanted roof as opposed to staying safe on the ground? I would charge much more, but as you can see from the other responses, many residential solar installers have not come around to that conclusion (yet).\n\nNow I remember talking to a solar installer / master electrician about a labor only contract, and they expressed skepticism about willingness to bid a project without material due to decreased project profitability.

You need a general contractor and a good set of plans.

EVs can recharge without paying those taxes. In the future, electricity to recharge EVs will be 3x more expensive than regular electricity once taxes are added there too.\n\nThat's the kind of hidden subsidies we find everywhere in the eco hippy wonders.\n\nIn the case of wind and solar, there are huge hidden subsidies. They benefit from priority access to the grid, which means they can sell 100% of their production while coal and nuclear comes last and is only allowed to produce what remains of the demand, while baseload is made to produce at maximum capacity all day long.\n\nAlso, intermittent sources require massive investments in the grid to handle peaks and variation. The price of consummer electricity is around 30% taxes, 30% grid, 30% production. Grid costs exploded due to solar wind, but as the grid is paid per kWh transported, it's mostly nuclear/coal paying the grid upgrades. Meanwhile, rooftop solar net metering allows those people to be free riders to the extreme.\n\nSo it's far far from over for fossil fuels. Nuclear was killed by insane overregulation de though.\n\nI'm a fan of EVs because it adds more energy demand that isn't oil, on top of fossil fuels.

I only recommend batteries for areas that frequently lose power or if the client has to have crucial medical equipment on all the time.    \n\n\n$3.31/watt is a great price.  My company charges $3.40 here in Central Texas, and we're the cheapest I've found.  You're going to get $6,464 back on your taxes, giving you a bottom line of about $15,275.  My company also gives a 10% break for cash, as it saves us a bunch by avoiding the loan companies.  You should ask if there is a benefit for paying up-front.  \n\n\nLooks like they're covering 88% of  your bill.  Depending on your electrical provider, this is ideal.  For my local utility, who uses a monthly net-metered method, 85% is what we shoot for.  Net-metered is when they credit you on a 1-for-1 basis for every kwh you produce, they take one off your bill.  Should you overproduce, they purchase the excess electricity for wholesale prices and credit the amount towards next month's electricity bill.   Should you under produce, you pay the remainder of your bill like normal.  \n\n\nThe most important point that doesn't show up in your estimate is ownership.  Purchasing a solar power system vs buying electricity from the grid the same as owning your home or renting a house.  Usually, rent is about equal or a little less than a mortgage, but you see no return on the rent vs building equity with home ownership.  You need a place to live regardless, and by purchasing a home, your money, at least some of it, is staying in your pocket as opposed to going to the landlord.  With solar panels on your home, your property values go up.  In Texas, the return is about 90% return on the panels.  Another bonus in Texas is this increase in property value is not subject to property tax.  If your house was in Texas, you would have added about $20,000, tax-free home improvement to your home instead of paying $200/month to the electric company. You should check Illinois law and your county for a Solar-Exemption form, and file it once you get your panels up.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.15770298020409731,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1755879402561342,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18939965788938906,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08676144110487871,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12587947706879277,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21093206579651377,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24546346365179406,"solar_1":-0.13380135837604434,"solar_2":-0.190961271161005,"solar_3":-0.014869186894429731,"solar_4":-0.13930924788445181,"solar_5":-0.1662559848239956,"solar_6":-0.03430035729737332,"solar_7":-0.032709026243537664,"solar_8":-0.05148609640774189,"solar_9":-0.03085447138729336,"solar_10":-0.17375788792355548},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Seems they specialize in the installs mostly and less the technology and extensibility of it all. The primary reason I went with them is because they were pretty much the only company willing and confident enough to do the hook/tile install method on our delicate Spanish clay tile roof. I didn't really like the idea of the comp-out method and shopping around to find a competent enough roofing/solar company who would do it properly. I'm sure this could cause a lot of debate but I wanted to leave our roof relatively 'untouched' (and yes, they did replace the tiles that they broke as part of the quote... although, there was a shady tactic they tried to pull but I can get into that in another thread if necessary lol).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a sidenote, I was wondering about batteries and if it's possible to have a Tesla Powerwall installed in conjunction with our Enphase system. Can you \"mix and match\" solar panels/microinverters/etc and batteries like that? I guess the concern would go back to potential warranty issues, etc... what would be concerning to me regarding that is how easily this could turn into a game of \"hot potato\" when all I (and probably many others) wanted was some flexibility between components.

We've had \"energy storage systems\" in place in the US for decades to smooth out the surges in need vs the cost of spooling energy plants up and down. They work.\n\n&gt;Maximum battery storage is 4 hours\n\nsimply untrue\n\n&gt;heat pumps use electricity. Wind and solar go out no electricity, no heat pumps.\n\nWell, this is obvious. In life, we often have a primary source or method of doing something, and a backup plan for when the primary plan fails. There's nothing wrong with having primary environmental system that uses heat pumps and a back-up plan that uses another method.  Or even just having enough back-up power to get one through the loss of grid power.\n\n&gt;Public transport is not a realistic alternative to ICE in most places.\n\nInteresting statement. With the research I've done over the years, I find that something like 85% of the people live in or near urban areas. Their daily travel needs can easily be met with public transport, perhaps something as simple as electric car or bus to the train station, electric light-rail to somewhere close to destination, electric car or bus from there to their final destination. Average daily trips for urban folk are less than 30 miles. If we had more accessible public transport, that could be less than 10 miles.  A small, highly efficient electric taxi could do that \"commute\" with 2 or 3 kWh, if they were just delivering people to and from the light-rail station. An electric bicycle or scooter would be able to do the daily trip with a couple dozen watt-hours.\n\nWhere we'd continue to need a different solution is out away from the cities, where 15% of the people live and work. There, farm equipment, long-haul truckers moving freight, long-haul transport moving people, etc. would be better served with a higher energy-dense system than battery-electric. We could easily use bio-diesel or   \nsynthetic diesel for those systems, made from renewable sources.  Internal combustion engines, yes, but not necessarily from oil pumped out of the ground.  And don't forget that we can use electric trains for passengers and freight for long-distance much more than we do today. \n\n&gt;Insulating houses and making them more energy efficient also costs money. Who pays for that? Oh yeah...taxpayers.\n\nWell, for the most part, it's people who own and operate apartment complexes. Since, as we've stated, most people live in rented spaces in cities. Currently, if the bill to heat and cool the apartment is the responsibility of the renter, they have no incentive to improve the thermal management of the rental space.  Make the provider of the space be accountable for the cost of heating/cooling, they will immediately insulate.  It's cheaper, long run, than paying high heating bills. \n\nThe other issue you have not touched on is: \"Is this all necessary? Do we really need to reduce CO2 drastically enough that we should be doing all of this?\"  The fact that this wasn't even in your list of objections means you've given up on the first point entirely, and moved on to other things.  Don't give in to the claim that all this is necessary, until it's proven.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2612016243704905,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09992060242868775,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2442165513833364,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22117483997611465,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3581480890079012,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25511098916391234,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.14675895479740575,"solar_1":-0.07195125817247572,"solar_2":-0.04419699474356729,"solar_3":-0.06550038654644129,"solar_4":-0.07837464903362464,"solar_5":-0.07166762404085603,"solar_6":-0.009860759383930903,"solar_7":-0.013523338494754475,"solar_8":-0.012556412389434021,"solar_9":-0.013705898081994405,"solar_10":-0.09754351165087},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear.

When I did installations for them they used SMA, which is a German inverter manufacturer. The inverters said \"SunPower\" on them, but except for that logo they were identical to the same inverters we sold with other solar panels. SunPower later switch to un-branded SolarEdge Inverters, then unbranded Enphase Micro-Inverters. I was still installing when they used SolarEdge and they were telling customers it was a SunPower inverter, but they weren't even putting their logo on them at the time. SolarCity/Tesla has done the same thing with a bunch of different brands of inverter. They don't actually make them, but they claim they do. \n\nAll of these inverters have built-in monitoring systems. Most independent companies use those systems as is. I had about 3,000 residential systems on SolarEdge when I left in 2022. Some companies take the data from the inverter and create their own web-page from it. The problem with that is if you own your system outright and need service, you can hire someone other than the original installer to service it, but they can't keep the monitoring data. I serviced a bunch of systems from a national chain that pulled out of my state and I had to set up the regular inverter monitoring because I couldn't get access to the original installer's monitoring website. It would be like buying a Ford, but having the local dealer claim they programmed the dashboard  with their own software and other Ford authorized service centers wouldn't be able to access it.\n\nSome of the installers might actually do everything in-house and some might just say they do because they know its good marketing. SunRun is a national chain with a fairly good reputation, but they have no local installers. They subcontract with local independent companies that probably also do their own independent sales. When the installer show up they might be in a SunRun truck or they might be in a Pete The Electrician truck. \n\nAnother note about SunRun and SolarCity Tesla. IF they have their own proprietary solar racking, no other installer will ever be able to work on the system. I'm not sure whether or not SunRun ever moved to their own racking. They tried when we installed for them and we refused to use it. SolarCity/Tesla does have their own racking. We kept getting calls from their customers asking us if we could repair their arrays because SolarCity/Tesla just was not responding to service requests for months at a time. Since it was proprietary racking and I could not buy replacement parts, I couldn't work on it because if I lost or broke a part I would not be able to re-install panels. Installers who use off-the-shelf racking (which is most of them) can have those systems serviced by anyone in the future.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00041119696106761694,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10286296111273714,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1394647337175411,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.052825948844353356,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.05045313553938513,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15753400821919192,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20339033502386883,"solar_1":-0.0047202766230232856,"solar_2":-0.001206431944713889,"solar_3":-0.28215786201386467,"solar_4":-0.0169495803290071,"solar_5":-0.0006109229955958048,"solar_6":-0.23124370650406176,"solar_7":-0.012200236504819864,"solar_8":-0.0012806040543485626,"solar_9":-0.11239063682417812,"solar_10":-0.2558132540963622},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

From my experience, the most important thing is to avoid using any harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the protective coatings on the panels.\r  \n\r  \nI used to think that products like Windex and RainX would help keep my panels clean and efficient, but I quickly learned that's not the case. Those cleaners can actually degrade the specialized anti-reflective coatings that help the panels absorb sunlight.\r  \n\r  \nInstead, I've found that plain water and a soft cloth or sponge is really all you need in most cases. I only clean my panels when I notice a visible buildup of dust, pollen, or bird droppings. Living in a fairly rainy climate, the natural weather does a pretty good job of keeping them clean most of the time.\r  \n\r  \nOn the rare occasions when I do clean them, I use an extendable soft-bristle brush and gently spray them with the hose, being careful not to use high pressure which could damage the panels. If there are any stubborn spots, I very gently wipe with a damp microfiber cloth.\r  \n\r  \nOne mistake I made early on was trying to clear snow off the panels in winter. I ended up scratching one of the panels with the snow rake I was using. Now I just let the snow melt off on its own.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, I've found that less is more when it comes to solar panel cleaning. Gentle and infrequent cleaning with plain water when needed has kept my system running optimally. The key is avoiding any harsh chemicals or abrasion. With a light touch, your panels should keep humming along and soaking up the sun for decades.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19924497767713728,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21869138117550493,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24168551178565012,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.35688812251723523,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2877562246974941,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26230978628986384,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1913778254370794,"solar_1":-0.2191284273091393,"solar_2":-0.2182580047267577,"solar_3":-0.03414406623111669,"solar_4":-0.022025212572164794,"solar_5":-0.04571356774734644,"solar_6":-0.02466275028443003,"solar_7":-0.08801790435488026,"solar_8":-0.2265856051138447,"solar_9":-0.17646359968983477,"solar_10":-0.20598879902125114},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Eating meat is not necessary to live, nor is it healthy for your body. It is their bodies and we have no right to use what isn't ours. Murdering them to eat or do anything else is morally wrong. \n4.Truth, it is hypocritical to say that you support animal rights and are against animal cruelty while eating the dead flesh of an animal who was most likely caged, drugged, and murdered without a chance to experience life. That is cruelty in itself. \n5. There are uneducated people on both sides, but most people on this subreddit have done research, myself included, as have most major universities and science institutions. They have all said that eating meat is unhealthy and not needed to live a healthy life. Meat eaters tend to prefer ignorance over acceptance, and some vegans can come off as hostile.\n6. It costs more money and wastes more food to produce meat for those people to eat than it would if we fed them a non meat based diet. If the world was vegan or even vegetarian, world hunger could be almost gone.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"yes","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"yes","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0074750107402602834,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3075536135584116,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.250180374579827,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18750438823817417,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20397662285326443,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13328503534406386,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.00392567854335842,"diet_1":-0.2024817132038623,"diet_2":-0.053476529377689985,"diet_3":-0.13841704084170758,"diet_4":-0.20773939331580432,"diet_5":-0.17434392490520606,"diet_6":-0.18459868089260165,"diet_8":-0.15806346891123138,"diet_9":-0.286517476507773,"diet_10":-0.22987361772696055,"diet_11":-0.005076695659965935,"diet_13":-0.23118405002888767,"diet_14":-0.24510571205793885,"diet_17":-0.038824310254616044},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

You're spreading the meaning of veganism to others, in some way - vegan check. You would cut the rest of these products out of your life *if you could* - vegan check. Uhh, looks vegan to me?\n\nThe only negative point I can agree with here is that it does bother me when people call themselves vegan when they eat animal products only because it enforces weird misconceptions (e.g. \"vegans eat fish!\" \"it doesn't matter if it's just in the sauce, right?\" etc.). **But** I don't think that really applies to your situation, so I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nIf you're worried about calling yourself vegan, maybe say \"I'm trying to be vegan\"? That tells people that what you're doing doesn't meet the dictionary definition of veganism, which helps stop them from forming misconceptions, BUT it also tells them that you'd appreciate it if they didn't serve you animal products. Hopefully.\n\nAnyway, veganism needs to be more accessible. @This thread, if the message you're sending is \"you can't be a vegan if you need to accept free food whenever it comes\", you're doing a shit job and you're getting caught up in personal purity.\n\nVeganism is about making an impact with your choices, and whether you accept free birthday cake or not changes literally nothing.\n\nTo answer your **actual question**: I personally feel like palm oil isn't a vegan product, but I still eat things with it (or unidentified \"vegetable oil\") because of the same reason as you - I can rarely afford the alternative, or have the time to seek them out. However, if I have the choice, I'm definitely going to choose palm oil-free/sustainable, and when I have the time, I still research palm oil-free alternatives that I might be able to get next time. (Then that works great for about 2 weeks until the store stops carrying them, lmao... I miss those instant noodles...)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.14903398602048887,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2324983779355521,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.29963431025911336,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11895920439081964,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4496136634461436,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25388155973130094,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06434920740624268,"diet_1":-0.02227094797611547,"diet_2":-0.014997919507247085,"diet_3":-0.27899948234456434,"diet_4":-0.043448866961019426,"diet_5":-0.012876176449935883,"diet_6":-0.05248353892238811,"diet_8":-0.001801709668749633,"diet_9":-0.0009875796095002443,"diet_10":-0.028582241017526638,"diet_11":-0.01705673581454903,"diet_13":-0.010197709993614504,"diet_14":-0.054978474004504584,"diet_17":-0.00544870054970185},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Commercial honey production is a long way from the image of a few hives in someone's back garden. In fact, all honey collection by humans harms and often kills bees - even when this is done on a small scale with smoke! If the bees survive the honey collection process they are often weakened and traumatised. Bees have been proven to have a complex nervous system. [See this link for more.](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/wont-vegans-eat-honey-2938.html)\n* In addition, bees produce honey as their own food. In its lifetime, a honeybee may only produce about a teaspoon of honey, but in the US alone, more than 400 million pounds of honey is consumed each year. Sugar water is often used to replace the stolen honey, which is a poor nutritional substitute. [Here is more information](http://www.godfist.com/vegansidekick/guide.php#a7) and [here too.](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/honey-is-not-unethical)\n* As with eggs, there is no dietary need for a human to eat honey.

The average omnivorous, westernized diet, consists of far less variety of flavor than the average vegetarian/vegan, westernized diet.  \n\nAnd if not comparing average diets, then what are we comparing, exactly? One could easily say that adding dog, bugs, dung and manflesh to your diet could increase variety. So?  \n\nAnd certainly, some meat eaters eat a very multi-flavored diet with lots of assorted vegetables. And some vegetarians live off of oreos and potato chips. I think it'd be empirically provable via random selections of the 2 sets of people, monitoring their intake, and setting up some measurements for \"flavor variety\".\n\nHe didn't claim there were more flavors *available* to the vegetarian diet.

I don't wish them any harm and I certainly think it's better to eat them if we don't need to but I don't own pets and don't feel the need to be around animals all the time like a lot of people do.  I don't like pet hair.  I'm a bit afraid of cats and aggressive dogs.  I quite like gentle and friendly dogs but I don't think I would want one on my furniture.  I don't live in a western country and I have some neighbors who keep multiple dogs outside and they are happy and well cared for and get plenty of exercise.  Animals aren't humans and don't need to live like humans.\n\nI honestly think that the future is either vegan or lab grown meat, dairy and eggs.  I think people are realizing that not only is meat bad for your body and bad for the environment but it's also cruel and not necessary for health.  I think most people don't know how to cook even simple vegetarian cuisine and make it taste good.  They are so used to just frying up some ground beef or a piece of bacon or sausage and throwing it with a carbohydrate.  They don't think about how to cook tofu, seitan or legumes and how to incorporating and flavor them.\n\nI also don't generally like meat that much.  I have no desire to eat it.  Pork and lamb and fatty beef even disgust me.  Meat leaves a coat of grease in your mouth and has a heaviness to it that I find off putting. I will eat chicken on occasion, but I moved to a country where all the chicken has bones in it and/or is the darker and fattier part of the chicken, so I will not eat it anymore.
