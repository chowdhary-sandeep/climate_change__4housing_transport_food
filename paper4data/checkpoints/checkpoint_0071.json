However some commenters were saying that the HOV lanes are clogged up as it is with white-stickered EVs and green-stickered range-extended vehicles.\n\nBMW took a risk making the US version with a tiny gas tank to try and skirt the laws and it failed. Now they will benefit by allowing the i3 to have a larger gas tank.\n\nNow, if only they gave the EV version additional batteries in the REx space rather than leaving it empty...  ;)",

"comment": "I assume you've already seen the movie \"Who Killed the Electric Car\", which has interesting details on what I consider to be the birth of the modern electric car era in the late 1990s.  Even though those cars were taken off the market and destroyed, except for some of the Toyota RAV4 EVs, they proved that electric cars were viable and they paved the way for Tesla to step in and show just how viable they could be with the Roadster using Lithium Ion batteries.  \n\nYou could also write to a fellow named [Jack Rickard](http://evtv.me/), who was involved in the EV conversion hobby in the early 2000s and did one of the first lithium conversions I saw.  Jack's other claim to fame was his magazine BoardWatch which covered the evolution of Bulletin Board Services in the 80s and early 90s before the internet.\n\nThe key to the viability of the electric car is obviously the battery, and a story of the evolution of the EV has to also be a history of the battery that powers it.  That first generation of modern viable EVs were enabled by large format Nickle Metal Hydride (NiMH)batteries and the current crop of EVs are enabled by Lithium Ion batteries. \n\nBack in the early 1990s, I was an engineer at a D.C. TV station and had some experience with the AGM batteries that our camera crews/reporters used to power their camera, lights, wireless mics, etc.  The batteries were heavy and could only power a camera with a light for a few minutes, and they needed to be replaced often.  We used batteries that attached to the back of the camera, and battery belts.  A battery belt was able to power a camera and a small light kit for a half hour or so.  \n\nAt some point, we purchased a new system from Anton Bauer that used these new NiMH batteries.  These new batteries were the same size as the old batteries, and they weighed the same.  However, the small battery that attached to the back of the camera was now able to power that camera and the same small light kit for the same amount of time that the battery belt did.  We ended up discarding the belt and went exclusively with the camera batteries.\n\nThis experience put a bug in my head, that's kind of still there.  I estimated that the energy contained in the new NiMH batteries we had was about 3-5 times more per volume and weight than the AGM batteries they replaced.  A few years later, I knew about California's zero emission vehicle mandate, and I was passively following GM's EV1 program.  I knew that GM was using lead acid batteries for their first cars, and I wondered why they didn't use the kick ass batteries that my camera crews were using.\n\nI was disappointed that nothing became of GM's EV program with the repeal of California's law, and was later outraged when I saw Who Killed the Electric Car.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I relocated home to Cincinnati, and I began to very strongly look into converting a car to electric.  My cousin and close friend is a car mechanic, and between the two of us we had the necessary skill and equipment to do a car.  I avidly read the postings at the DIY Electric Car Forum, and looked at their member's conversions.\n\nI had done my math, specified my components, and was on the lookout for a donor car.  Unfortunately, work and travel requirements did not permit me to actually pull the trigger, but I was able to finally purchased a Volt last year.\n\nThe batteries that I wanted to use at first were the NiMH batteries that I had used back in D.C., but they were not available.  The only real option was Lead Acid batteries.  My car would not have been a practical car.  The suspension of the donor car would have to be modified to accommodate the ton of batteries, the range would have been only 30-35 miles, and the battery would need to be replaced every 3 or 4 years.  \n\nWhen I was looking for batteries, I saw these large format Lithium Iron Phosphate cells out of China from Thundersky and Valkyrie that weren't really available and were unbelievably expensive.  However, on paper, Lithium batteries were even better than the NiMH batteries I had wanted to use.  They were just as energy dense or more, but were 1/4 the weight.  When I plugged the numbers into my calculations for my conversion car using those batteries, suddenly my 30 mile range car was going 80-100 miles between charges.  The number of charge cycles was 3x that of my lead acid pack and was getting me 3x as far per charge.  I realized that this battery was going to last the lifetime of my conversion car!  The icing on the cake was that it was light enough that I wouldn't have to modify the suspension on the donor car.\n\nOn the DIY Electric Car Forum, a number of people were talking about these unobtainable lithium cells from China.  One fellow had contacted Thundersky to inquire about selling them in the US.  The members of the forum decided to pool their money and do a bulk purchase.  One person received the cells, split the shipment up, and sent them to the other members who had gone in on the purchase.  Eventually, they became more available and the prices dropped.\n\nAround this time, I heard about this internet billionaire that was building a rocket in the desert to win some NASA X prize, who was also going to build an EV using Lithium batteries.  I decided to follow this guy's progress, and still am today.  When he comes out with his affordable EV in a few years, I think I'm going to buy one.\n\nThings I would like to know more about are these early Chines lithium batteries.  There's information buried in the DIY Electric Car Forum, including emails from folks from Thundersky and Valkyrie.  In there is analysis of manufacturer claims, there's disappointment with Valkyrie under performance and quality, and pleasant surprise at Thundersky under specifying the capabilities of their cells.",

"comment": "No love for the Focus EV so far, so I'll chime in. Although /u/lonelan really nailed it with his response. \n\nI drive 90 miles per day with my Focus EV. There's a charging station across the street from my work, so I generally arrive to work with 20-25 miles of range left. \n\n(Focus EV gets between 70 and 80 miles per charge)\n\nHere's my answers to what you are asking. \n\n**Public Chargers** Yeah, it's considered rude to be parked in an EV spot when not charging.  I'd look up charging station maps around your workplace to see if any are within walking distance, or ask your employer if you'd be able to plug in at work. \n\n**Repairs** You don't take an EV to anything OTHER than the dealer. Most dealers now are pretty competitive with their shop rates. While there are a lot of things you DON'T have to worry about with an EV, there's a lot in common with a dino car. \n\nFor example, you still have brakes, AC, power windows, sat nav, cv joints, shocks/struts, wiper motors, 12v battery, power steering, etc. \n\n**Tax Breaks** Yes, in the U.S you get a $7500 federal tax credit (not a rebate, a credit). This isn't something that shows up as a refund, but something that cancels our part (or all) of the income tax you pay.  Look at last year's filing and see if you paid $7500 or more in federal tax.  The tax credit is \"use it or lose it\" meaning if you only pay $5000 in tax, the other $2,500 of the credit is \"lost\". \n\nOn a related note, many manufacturers are offering CRAZY incentives on their EV's, due to growing competition in the plug-in hybrid/EV space.  I got my top-end Focus EV for significantly less than the base model MSRP. Combine that deep discount with a heavy $3500 Ford Rebate, and 0% APR, I just about have a free car when the gas savings is factored in. \n\n**Insurance** As far as my auto insurer is concerned it's just a 2015 Focus. \n\nAs for your drive, I'd say in mild weather, with flat terrain, and little to no traffic, a 64 mile round trip drive would be do-able with a few miles to spare for an errand along the way. \n\nMost EV's come with a 110v \"convenience\" charger, so worst case scenario, you beg your boss to let you top off for a few hours at work, and give yourself an extra 10 or 15 mile buffer. \n\nOne other consideration is to get a plug-in hybrid instead of a straight up EV. Something like the Fusion Energi, or the GM Volt. You can drive a plug-in hybrid close to 20 miles on battery alone, then the dino motor kicks in. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. I'm new to the EV game, but I did a TON of research before buying this time. I came VERY close to buying a LEAF three years ago, and I'm glad I didn't.  \n\nThe LEAF might be the #1 EV on the market, but it's still a shitbox. I look at them and think Yugo/GEO Metro.",

It also gives you a nice sum of tax money which you can (ideally) invest into green energy infrastructure. So a carbon tax is a great complement to investments into renewable energy.\n\nThat being said, you're right that a carbon tax doesn't solve global warming by itself, but it's a step in the right direction.",

"comment": "Three words....Real Time Pricing. Just look at what PG&amp;E is experimenting with and pretty obvious this is where things are headed.  RTP will adjust the demand curve to match the supply curve, which will eliminate overproduction, flatten out the duck curve, and decrease how much the utilities have to pay solar owners for power sold to the grid.  Win...win...win for utilities.\n\nThe technology for this is already in place with Smart Meters and Zigbee.\n\nhttp://www.pge.com/en/myhome/saveenergymoney/savingstips/han/hanpilot.page\n\nIt will happen in stages.\n\nStage 1 - Move Peak rates from afternoon to early evening for solar users.  This step is already done.\n\nStage 2 - Move non-solar users on to time of use rates unless they opt out.  This step is already approved by PUC and will start soon.\n\nStage 3 - Move solar owners from TOU to RTP rate schedules, which will essentially be the end of net metering. Make TOU rates mandatory for all non-solar owners.  Figure this is probably 5-8 years out.\n\nStage 4 - Make RTP mandatory for non-solar owners.  10-15 years out.\n\n10 years from now, we will all be buying Zigbee enabled appliances which will allow our appliances to know what the electricity rate is in real time. We will also be installing Zigbee devices to our AC units so we can program our AC units to only run when rates fall below a certain level.\n\nAnd don't forget about electric cars and batteries.  Right now, it is more cost effective for solar owners to sell their extra electricity back to the grid. As the utilities decrease what they pay for this electricity, it will make more sense for solar owners to pour that electricity into an electric car or battery.",

Odd looking vehicles tend not to sell so well, at least I don't recall these vehicles being sales leaders: Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet, Isuzu Vehicross, Pontiac Aztec. Even Nissan toned down their latest Juke. \n\nI just don't get the design goal. It's not sporty, sexy, macho, conservative, elegant, tough, futuristic, gaudy, or funky. It's ungainly. As awesome as the tech would be if they survive long enough to work the bugs out, it's wrapped in a controversial body.\n\nThere are cars people will spend six to seven figures for, and they're incredibly visually appealing to lots of rich people. I'm sure there are some sheiks out there that will buy this so they can get is gold plated and pinstriped, but who else would pay an upper class price tag for this?\n\nHopefully I'm being way too pessimistic because the world needs more electric car companies, but I fear FF screwed the pooch here. If they do fail, I hope the story comes out about how this design got so far.",

It is simply because for the other things to change very little must actually happen to you- getting to work in your F150 is almost identical to your volt or leaf or Tesla. It's really not too much of a change, and improves the environment. Unless you work coal, switching away from it has basically 0 effect on your life.\n\nI don't really know what you mean by resource hoggin ass, but as far as veganism goes I'd have to make a daily radical change to my diet- outside of like peanut butter and Oreos I'd say easily 50-80% of my daily calories are non vegan.

If you drive a car that gets 8L per 100kms 22,000kms a year you would produce 8800 pounds of CO2.  Alberta's current CO2 per kWh is 560g.  So if you drive an EV the same distance a year and get 6kms per kWh you would produce 4527 pounds of CO2 using those numbers.    Still an overall savings.   This is a fairly simplistic view as we are not adding in the CO2 in the manufacturing of the cars or the all the CO2 produced before generating the electricity (or in the making of gas).  It is the majority of Canada where the savings will be massive.   BC, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec all have very low emission grids.   Using the above numbers and EV charged in Ontario would put out 283 pounds of CO2. That is like 1/3 the C02 that the average adult breaths out in a year.",

I'm not super sold on the performance guarantee, as it seems like it wouldn't truly affect much over time.\n\nYes, my biggest fear is jumping into this right now and then finding out in 3 years that significantly better tech is out there for a much better price.\n\nIn fact, after running the numbers, the Tesla Roof is like $100 less a month for a much better solution to my home (I'd like a nicer roof). But you can't finance it, so that's out.\n\nDefinitely going to call around today.",

It is a story for Tesla stock bulls and a few Leaf drivers who are pushing the envelope. \n\nIf the 30 kWh battery degrades below 80% in less than 5 years, then Nissan will replace them. And Leaf battery issues in hot climates have been well known for at least 4 years: just wait for the 60 kW actively cooled battery. \n\nFinally, the Jaguar battery pack is assembled by LG Chem, and they have enough experience with GM that I would guess that Jag have it covered - without any evidence to the contrary and looking their public and very comprehensive car testing suite. It is clearly actively cooled so why spread FUD - just like Tesla bashers have been doing for the past 5 years. \n\nNow, if you had intelligent commentary, like the stupid decision to only put a 6.6 kW level 2 charger in the Jag to charge a 90 kW battery, then I willing to entertain discussion. \n\nBut otherwise you are just a Tesla troll.",

They seize on a concept that can be used to disparage opposing viewpoints and hammer it home, both when it makes sense, and when it doesn't.\n\nFrom your perspective, my evidence is anecdotal, because I'm a random person on the internet telling you a story. But you know what else my evidence is? It is empirical. It includes data my city acquired through direct experimentation, and empirical evidence is **absolutely critical to making effective, pragmatic decisions.** Rejecting empirical evidence because it was received anecdotally is even more logically fallacious than accepting purely anecdotal evidence.\n\nIn fact, I just looked up the study that my city did on these bike lanes to measure their effectiveness. The bike lanes have been in for a year, and they're celebrating that bicycle traffic has increased by 32%! Woohoo! Can you guess how many bicyclists that brings us to? We've recorded a maximum daily peak of **135 commuters!!** In a city that supports 150,000 jobs, I'm estimating that only 0.0009% of commuters are benefiting from the bike lanes.",

"comment": "I'm sure people will think of ways to game the system but maybe if at inspection time some combination of miles driven, vehicle mass, tire size/type(?) could be used to determine the approximate wear a vehicle causes. I'm just not sure how the tax would be collected. A yearly lump sum is unappetizing.\n\nAnother unpopular option would be a per kWh tax included in the cost when using charging stations, similar to gas tax. This would at least encourage more efficient vehicles. Again, it might not always be possible to collect given all the ways someone could charge, like plugging in at home or in random outlets.\n\nIt's tricky and annoying but we'll have to pay for road maintenance somehow once gas becomes less used.\n\nOf course, large trucks like 18 wheelers are already more responsible for road wear. I'm sure it's easier to tax them.",

Tesla's charging system predates CCS in the US. Is your argument that Tesla should have ate the cost of transitioning to the CCS standard even though they already had their own. Thats not an inexpensive proposition in the least but I'm going to assume you see no issue with it. \n\nAlso even if Tesla had gone with CCS what is to prevent them from maintaining their \"walled garden\" because its such a strong positive to purchase their cars. Plug and charge is absolutely superior to any of the garbage found with non-Tesla chargers. They built the infastructure needed to push the transition and their sales demonstrate this.\n\nI think its great they are looking into opening the system now but there were valid reasons on why it didn't happen until this point. Opening the system now will provide an easy to use, reliable, fast charging infastructure at the time when the non-Tesla infastructure is turing people away from the technology.",

"comment": "Good luck.  There are precious few EVs on the market today, and the ones that are have waiting lists.  You can find cars that fit the AWD and range requirements you have relatively easily but you will not find it remotely close to the price you’re looking to get them at.  \n\nThe only EV that I can think of which will get you 150 miles of range and is FWD would be the 2022 Nissan Leaf.  As long as you have the tax liability, you can get the base model leaf for $27,400 and then take the $7,500 tax credit to come in just under $20k.  \n\nIf you’re legitimately looking for AWD with that, I’d recommend the IONIQ 5 or Kia EV6.  Significantly more pricey, but also coming in with well over 200 miles of range.  You’re probably looking at spending above $50k on either of these.  They do come with that $7,500 tax credit, so that’s an option, however, many dealers have market adjustments on these vehicles making them even more expensive.  Not the choice if you’re shopping bottom dollar.\n\nMost likely whatever market there is on the east coast, the only used vehicles there will be any volume of is very old Leafs and BMW i3’s (range is waaaay too short on those) and maybe some Chevy Bolts (probably less likely considering the recent issues with the recall).  A Bolt fits the bill from a range standpoint, but it still is only FWD and I think it would be tough to find one for under $20k in today’s used market on them.  Finally, there are used Teslas.  Steer clear of Model S or X from 2012 or 2013 (the battery and drivetrain warranties are completely up) and I’d be wary of anything older than 2017 at this point.  If you’re really lucky, there may be some Model 3 LR Dual Motor vehicles from 2018 available at ok prices - Tesla pricing is very high right now with the demand.  At best, I’ve seen one of those selling for about $40k with a bit over 50k miles and some pretty fair signs of use.  That car will fit your other two requirements of having just over 300 miles of rated range and being AWD.",

Price elasticity exists and enough with \"well akshually the TCO after 10 years of ownership\" lol.",

A lease is a contract for a set amount of time (most commonly 2-3 years) and very hard (expensive) to get out of early without coming up with a big chunk of cash to pay off the remaining lease payments, pay the negotiated residual value, plus early termination fees.\n\nAlso keep in mind that a lease has a set amount of miles you’re allowed to drive, and the car must be kept in good condition. If you’re living out of this thing, feels like you’ll be putting more miles and more wear and tear (odor, scuff marks, etc) that could lead to fees at the end of your lease.\n\nI’ve slept in a Model 3 before, I used to camp in it when I drove it to the track. If you run the climate at all, you’ll chew up a good chunk of your battery overnight and you’ll be looking for a charger every day. Maybe that’s fine if you have plugs at work, but you’ll also be paying for that energy every night. It might not be as economical as you’re expecting (sure, still better than Bay Area rent). None of this is comfortable though, and your back/neck may pay the price.",

"comment": "Damaging a charger will likely not cross the threshold needed to cite someone for a crime. Private property owners are not likely to spend the money to file a civil case either, the courts are not designed to make this efficient or cheap.   \n  \nReally comes down to changing the expectations of charging which may not happen until technology improves the rate. That can mean modeling charging on the petrol model where the charging stations are part of a staffed location with convenience features to further entice spending instead of just taking some space in the middle of a parking lot far from view. Part of this would be to adapt charging to the pull through design of petrol stations to imply, you are not parking here, you are charging here.",

So export power is effectively valued at 1/6th of the price. So in our case, batteries are now a must.",

"comment": "**tldr: It makes sense. Payback in less than 6 year. Out of pocket $17k, incentives $13.1k, annual energy generation $700**\n\n\nThe solar modules that you install on your house will resell at the same price that you install them at - they are different than things like a bathroom or a kitchen for one simple reason: they are producing a measurable commodity. There are many studies ([2011](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/study-finds-solar-panels-increase-home-values/) [2013](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Solar-panels-seen-as-boost-to-homes-resale-value-5063262.php) [Real Estate website opinion](http://www.zillow.com/advice-thread/Resale-value-of-Solar-panels/439664/) [2011](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17200) that show solar panels hold their value well and help you house sell faster than those in the neighborhood.\n\nSince you are going to be using PACE financing you will be given a low interest loan on a 20 year pay back period. This payback period means you will DEFINITELY have a lower tax payment than the amount of energy your system produces. \n\nFor example - check out this [4kW system](http://i.imgur.com/1wwf8fv.png) I just worked out on [NREL.gov](http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/) (National Renewable Energy Lab). The original system price was $4.25/W - the total install was 4,000W. The total, out of pocket, cost will start at $17,000. Now - the first thing that will happen is that you will get [30% of that money back in the form of a Tax Credit](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5695.pdf) from the IRS. That is $5,100 - you can do with it what you please. Do you want to apply it to the $17,000 loan? Do you want to pocket it? Your choice. The next benefit changes on a state by state basis. For instance in my home state (Florida) you will get a [second beneift of $2/WDC](http://dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=FL119F). Since this money comes from the power company you will have to pay taxes on it - however - it will not affect your 30% number. That's another $8000.\n\nYour out of pocket: $17,000\nFederal Tax Credit: $5,100\nFlorida Residential: $8,000\n\nEnd cost: $3,900\n\nNow - lets go back to that original [4kW system](http://i.imgur.com/1wwf8fv.png). The total money it will generate annually for you is about $706. The system will pay itself off in about 5.5 years.\n\nOf course - you need to add in the interest rate on that PACE loan. The total amount of money you pay out (and the TRUE payback period) will adjust based upon how you pay back the incentives.",

"comment": "Of course. It's not like you need a license to apply for tax credits. You can just do it yourself. Go to your state website and search for \"solar tax credit\". \n\nIf you're willing to consider my suggestion then I'll go into a little more depth. You can get the panels on-line and the inverters. In California there is a list of approved inverters so you can shop around and you should definitely shop around. \n\nYou can also get the wiring yourself. MC4 connectors, for instance, are a place where many ripoff installers try to make a buck. I bought ten male and female connecrots for US$15 on Aliexpress. \n\nHere is 500 feet of the wire that goes with them for fifty cents a foot. That should give you more than you need for the whole job twice over.  \n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/500-10-AWG-PHOTOVOLTAIC-PV-Solar-Power-Cable-Wire-UL-4703-2013-/171404277605?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27e87db765\n\nOkay, so now you have the panels, the inverters, all the wire anybody could possibly use for the job and so besides the actual electrical hookups what you have left is a solid frame. \n\nThe standard 250 watt polysilicon panels you get these days usually have holes that happen to fit perfectly on slotted angle iron or \"L\" beams. It's easy stuff to work with that doesn't need to be welded. It's full of holes to attach big heavy screws. I'd have a welder bid on that job if looks are key and you have some special attachment issues or need a stand-alone frame. Otherwise, just do that yourself too. An angle grinder would be nice for cutting the steel but a hacksaw can work in a pinch and a 10mm wrench is pretty cheap and common. That's all you need for some big jobs with slotted angle iron.  \n\nAt that point all you would need is an electrician to make the final connections and you can find an electrician who will do that for more than it's worth but still a hell of a lot less than a solar installer. There is no such thing as a solar installer really. You've got electricians and you've got plumbers. You don't need a plumber and if you hire an electrician to do carpentry or metalwork or even worse to act as your purchase manager then you're most likely not going to get a low price.",

"comment": "There are many things that I agree with from the Climate Change side.  The world has certainly warmed some since pre-industrial times.  I think that's easily demonstrated.\n \nAnother \"fact\" is that water vapor, methane and carbon dioxide are all molecules capable of capturing and releasing IR.  Large concentrations of these molecules will capture and randomly redirect IR, much like a fog bank captures and redirects visible light.\n\nIt seems logical to think that they are right when they say that all IR leaving the surface of the planet (land or surface of the oceans) will be captured and randomly redirected within a few tens of meters.  When you add up all of the frequencies that overlap between the different molecules, I'd say that yes, very little IR get though untouched.\n\nMankind has certainly liberated more CO2 than would have happened naturally, so claims that man has increased the levels of atmospheric CO2 seem credible, too. \n\nI also agree with them on some of (not all of, but some of) the efforts to move to renewables.  There are some situations where renewable energy just makes more sense.  Unfortunately, they don't concentrate on those areas, they want to use all the renewables, all the time, everywhere.  Solar roofs on remote Caribbean Islands, for example, is brilliant.  Solar roofs in Seattle, not so much.",

"comment": "Well, Fraunhofer's PV Durability Initiative found that [SunPower was the only manufacturer tested that got the highest possible score on every accelerated stress test.](http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/sunpower-tops-fraunhofers-first-pv-durability-test-report-results) The Fraunhofer tests [were designed to reach the \"wear-out\" failure modes](http://www.cse.fraunhofer.org/press-releases/fraunhofer-cse-ise-joint-testing-venture-ranks-performance-of-pv-modules) that determine the lifetime of a module. This is an **independent** confirmation that SunPower makes the most reliable modules on the market.\n\nNow, if you want more details you will probably have to start looking at SunPower's own literature. [This white paper (pdf)](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/white-papers/wp-sunpower-module-40-year-useful-life.pdf) makes the claim (with evidence) that after 40+ years, 99% of the modules will be producing at least 70% of their original power output. Page 11 might be particularly interesting, as it shows real field data from SunPower modules compared to conventional modules, and sees that conventional modules degrade ~4 times faster than SunPower modules. \n\nIf you want an extremely detailed and thorough description of how they have identified and engineered out practically every failure mode, [this document is a fantastic resource](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/white-papers/wp-sunpower-module-degradation-rate.pdf), although it is 54 pages long. Well written, though.",

"comment": "The Carnot limit for solar power is 86% efficiency, although that can't actually be achieved without concentration (using lenses and/or mirrors), for physics reasons I don't understand.\n\nThe technologies that are economical to manufacture today though top out at around 25% efficiency. The most cost effective panels today are in the upper teens, which should creep up to the low 20s over the next decade or so. Past that, it's hard to guess what new technologies will pan out and become cost effective.\n\nBut panel cost isn't cost prohibitive today, though. Most of the cost (particularly for residential systems) is in balance of systems (racking hardware, inverters, etc.) and soft costs - business overhead, permitting, cost of customer acquisition, etc. More efficient panels help a little bit with that (lower racking &amp; labor costs), but the ones we have today are good enough.",

Truly that is what Solar needs to make the jump into mainstream, I agree that I don't need to know how to build a car to purchase one, however, I do like to know how many items within my car work... same goes for appliances.  I purposely haven't upgraded my laundry machines because the older ones are able to be maintained by me, a guy with youtube and a handful of tools and basic knowledge.  I have some older cars, because I'm able to actually work on them, I don't need to pay a professional to do something simple like rotate tires or change the oil.\n\nAs a techy guy, I truly want more of a hands on type of situation as I look to make my 150 year old house a bit more efficient in the world.  I have fancy thermostats, wifi smoke detectors, etc... I want to have some visibility and control into my power usage/control as well.  \n\nThat said, I don't want to be the one hooking it all up, but it would be pretty sweet if somebody made a plug and play system for people to at least start with.  I think my only option right now would be to buy a panel and do the thing where you just charge/maintain batteries, right?  Like what you'd use on a sailboat or with an off-grid cabin.  Because the next step is plugging into the grid, which requires a lot more effort and professional assistance?  I'm assuming the interconnect you mentioned, is the grid tap-in?  Why can't it scale?  Say I want that to be able to handle 14 kWh max... for a single powerwall 2 installation down the road, couldn't I get setup for that, minus the powerwall, just have panels that could produce say, 1/4 of that at the start?  Then add the powerwall and panels later?",

"comment": "&gt; your quote that there is no rate increase, and frankly, that's surprising in a too-good-to-be-true way. \n\nThis was my thinking as well... my finacee's cousin actually works with NRG so he's currently looking over this offer for us and having his guys work up an offer from NRG as well. Apparently a non-escalating rate is a thing that exists it's just rare. \n\nI'm just looking for this \"You're fucked now\" loophole that SunRun has as it seems like they're giving stuff away for nothing in a sense. Guaranteeing me a $0.14/kWh for the next 20 years seems insane. \n\nThe 30% federal credit I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean, I know I don't get the credit. I'm not sure that Sun Run is giving a reduced rate because of that or not. \n\nAs for TriSmartSolar, they said they sent my \"quote\" to SunRun, SunEdison and SolarCity and SunRun had the best option as the \"no-rate increase\" option. That's a great idea though in terms of getting an offer through SunRun directly and see what they say as opposed to through the reseller which is I guess what TSS would be considered? I'm assuming they make some kind of commission from SunRun for customer acquisitions.",

"comment": "&gt; Yes, this would generate power, but not as much as rooftop solar. That is utterly undeniable. \n\nThis assumes a preponderance of available roof space, which just isn't the case.  From my experience, I'd ballpark somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%-20% of homes have a viable roof-space for solar.  Of those, I'd say my average % of consumption I deliver is 40%-60% range.  Occasional spikes, and with the right customer willing to pay an increased cost, we can bump that up in individual cases.  But utilities are fighting hard, and the days of net metering surplus back onto the grid are gone.  so no 110%'s.   That simply tells us that there is no net gain on rooftop residential solar.  Period.  Ain't gonna happen.  \n\nYou wanna talk Commercial?  sure... go for it.  Big flat rooves.  generally a fair a mount of open space (*especially* for designs that incorporate future solar, but that's not a given).  So sure, we start to see a few hundred kW on top of a commercial roof.  What's happening under that roof, though?  Commerce.  Industry.  Manufacture.  Energy gobbling activities.  We're still rarely above 70-80% (on rare occasions), and I've done more than my fair share of 10% commercial bids.\n\nWe simply *must* find more real estate for solar.  And ***that*** is what is \"utterly undeniable\".\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not saying it's the greatest solution and it's the panacea to an electronically dependent society.  It is, however, *potentially* a piece of the puzzle.   And we owe it to ourselves to explore that possibility.",

"comment": "The first argument is that they pay less to support the grid.  While someone who conserves energy doesn't use the grid as much, someone with solar uses it more by pushing power onto it as well as pulling power off of it and doesn't get double counted.  However, at the same time they take strain off parts of the grid because of distributed generation.  But then again only during daylight, and cloudy periods can require additional demand response efforts. \n\nThe second argument is that why should they be forced to pay retail rates for DG when they can pay wholesale from a big solar plant and be just as green?  This is the way they look at net metering.  And it is somewhat true that DG customers on net metering get to use the grid as a big free/cheap battery.  \n\nThe problem from the consumer perspective is that the utility monopoly status takes away all other options so these concessions are totally warranted.\n\nThe problem from the utility perspective is wait a minute our customers are becoming our partners now and this is supposed to be a monopoly not a coop.\n\nThere are a lot of parallels to the net neutrality debates.",

(I am an incredibly insignificant part of this process. Please don't send me your hate mail).  \n\nIts basically going to flip. Peak power is currently 12:00 pm to 6:00 pm. The proposed TOU changes would move it to 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm. Super off-peak is going to be 8:00 am - 4:00 pm. These changes are a reaction to all the solar power being generated. During the day there is alot and then there is an extreme ramp up in demand as the sun goes down. \n\nIts going to be bad for solar customers and even worse for electric car drivers that charge at night, like yourself. I'm not sure if residential customers can take advantage of CPP or RTP programs. Or ask your work to install a charging station. Might want to look into that. These changes aren't coming for a bit. You have time to figure it out.",

"comment": "The market isn't lousy. It's both extremely competitive AND diverse. What Home Depot and other similar retailers sell is not really targeted for someone who wants to build a big system to cover their home energy needs. It is more for hobbyists and outdoors recreation like camping, RV's, etc. Which is not a trivial market. There is also a growing market for DIY and off-grid, while the prime markets of residential, commercial, and utility scale are also still very healthy and growing for the most part.\n\nAs is the case with almost all technology, when you price shop you can still be satisfied depending on what you want. Outside of solar panels, TVs may be a good example. You can perhaps spend from, say, $300 to $800+ for a 50\" LED with similar specs (resolution, etc.). One gets you an Asian product using a Western brand under license (e.g. Westinghouse) and the other gets you a name brand product from a fully integrated supply chain (Sony? Samsung? Phillips?,etc.). One may have much better chromaticity, longevity, etc., but for many buyers it may not matter at all. Getting 4 or whatever good years of a big bright picture may be enough. Or having the right bells and whistles may be enough, like wireless connectivity or built in services, etc.",

"comment": "Make sure the regulations covering domestic charger installation are clear, perhaps encourage (throw money at, facilitate, report on, etc) charger manufacturers and electricians to have training events so everyone knows the supply, wiring, installation, testing and maintenance required.\n\nPerhaps seeeten deals for consumers, providing bundles of PV, ToU metering, chargers, and even batteries with virtual power plant software.\n\nCheck out Reposit for some ideas: there are doubtless other similar companies doing the virtual plant deal: coordinate batteries/inverters in a given area to act as a peaker plant when wholesale costs hit certain thresholds, credit the owners with some of the income.\n\nBattery peakers (industrial and virtual) will be seen more and more often, and they double as neighbourhood brownout protection too!",

All it took was 9 days, 37+ calls to solar installer, 1 to Enphase, 21 emails between the 2, 1 call to the finance company, and an offer to get panels removed and reinstalled by a different installer. It seems that “it’s a new thing”, wanting access to the panels you purchased. \n\nI am awaiting my consumption monitoring meter still. As there was an emergency in someone’s home. I also found out that there is a check in the mail from the company. Apparently it was part of the sale, paying 1 year of the solar bill, as incentive. \n\nI would like to thank all whom commented and the advice submitted. My best advice get all these things done in writing prior to installation.",

The Span panel has integrated key solar inverter communications and control standards [such as IEEE 1547](https://www.greentechmedia.com/squared/dispatches-from-the-grid-edge/tying-together-the-technology-standards-behind-der-grid-integration) to ensure that it can disconnect during grid outages and serve other critical tasks.\"\n\nOne thing I could think of being in Florida, if it would allow to use solar panels with sun up and grid down (i.e. Hurricane Outage), that would make a lot of people very interested. Heck, I would buy it immediately.\n\nThis is from a different article:\n\n\"The Span panel replaces a traditional electrical panel to become the primary energy and control hub for the home. It displaces the need for *many disparate pieces of equipment* to install solar, storage and electric vehicles today with a **single, integrated device**. The result is a faster, more cost effective installation for both new homes and retrofits that delivers unprecedented functionality to the customer.\"\n\nSounds like this is more than just a smart electrical panel, integrating several devices into one. I think there would be a market for that. \n\nI agree that there is a trade off with all the smart home devices, in that, if they require maintenance they can turn into a headache.",

This requires consumption meter but the inverters from enphase, solarEdge, SMA, and Fronius among others can then be configured to zero grid consumption.  \n\n&gt;  I can stand the inefficiency if I can skip the bureaucracy! \n\nThere is very little bureaucracy for net metering.  keep in mind you STILL with or without this set up or any other grid zero set up need to get a permit and inspections.  That is the bureaucracy part.  Net metering though just requires a valid permit and its associated inspections and a simple form to be filled out.  \n\n&gt; My only question is what happens when the panels are producing energy and I am not using it or storing it?\n\nThen they are not actually producing energy.

V2H would be perfect if the price was right, but even Mitsubishi's [CHAdeMO Power Box](https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/suzukimotors/item/tuph004/) (only available in Japan) is $1700 and just gets you 1500W of power.

The skies tend to cloud up in the evening. If you didn't have a powerwall this might make since to put them on the other side anyway because you are using more energy in the evening.\n\n\n\n\nAs for the the powerwall count, if you want to be fully off the grid capable a 3rd one is a good idea.  I have 2 here and do wish I had a 3rd.  We do use a good amount of power.  The power tends to go over to the grid around 4am every morning leaving about 23% of the battery remaining.  A third would also bump up your available power  in a power outage.  I have found 10kw is a little lacking. For me my AC takes up 3kw, water heater takes up 7kw. If its after sundown then i am hitting my max power draw. Another powerwall would give me another 5kw to work with.",

So until we figure out fusion there's no point to scream and yell about it in every damn post about solar panels.\n\nIt's like screaming at reforestation projects that \"planting these trees by driving to that forest area releases CO2!!!\"\n\nIt's pointless and doesn't solve a fucking thing.\n\nEdit: the article literally points out that the largest release of CO2 comes from energy used during production - energy that increasingly is coming from hydro, nuclear, wind, and solar.\n\nIt's the same dumb argument people use against EVs. \"If the energy used to produced the electricity is from coal then it's not that clean\"\n\n... fucking duh. Look at any Western EU grid and see how CO2/Mwh has absolutely plummeted, and how an EV bought 5 years ago is now 20% cleaner per KM driven than it was in 2015.",

They claim this is based on real world data from their solar facilities around the world and the third party verified position that SunPower cells perform significant better in various lowlight conditions due to their IBC technology as well as their anti reflective glass patents. Notably, the 327s use a 320w microinverter so there is no optimization loss there. I would confirm that this proposal was made in EDDiE, which takes shade, tilt and azimuth into consideration.

"comment": "I have had to deal with this before.  We have found panels on the same pallet from the factory shaded slightly differently.  I had to dig through 3 different pallets until we found some panels that matched the rest.  \n\nIf you are working with a medium to large installer, they should have no problem shuffling some panels around until they find some matching panels.  If the installer is a small shop, they will not have inventory around to do that.\n\nSolar panels get shuffled around at the factory after they are tested for wattage output, and sometime there are variations in the coatings on the glass that will make them reflect light differently.   This is absolutely not the fault of the installer, just the nature of the manufacturing process. \n\nThe colors will eventually balance out after exposure to the sun, and after getting a light coat of dust.  In my opinion, it would be worth waiting a few weeks before you ask the installer change the panels.",

"comment": "There are a few people who have mounted solar panels on their car's roof. Search Youtube for Innovative Sustainable Solutions for a guy that mounted panels atop a roof rack on his &lt;50mi range Leaf. He fit I think 400W of panels that charge four 12V batteries (now Li-ion). The slowest J1772 charging requires a minimum 6A(or 720W) but the Leaf needs 8A(or 960W). Anyway, the panels charge his aux batteries slowly and when they have enough charge, a timer turns on the inverter and EVSE for 30min or so, discharging them to 50% and it repeats as long as there's sunlight. In theory, 400W panels could make 2.5kWh in a day, for 10mi range per day. So, it's possible, but there's no single product, only a DIY assembly.",

"comment": "I just got solar installed in San Diego from Tesla last week. Everyone I talked to on energysage told me how bad their customer service is so I was expecting the worst, but from $100 deposit, to panels on roof took 10 days and was an extremely smooth process. (SunRun told me panels on roof wouldn’t happen until December for example)\n\nTheir initial design also had half the panels on the north facing roof of my house, but when I talked to the rep he showed me the design submitted to the city had all the panels fitting nicely on the south side (with one awkward panel). Then when they came to install they even asked if I wanted to move that awkward panel to a better spot besides the others and I said yes. The panels look great now and aligned perfect with my roof. \n\nAlso note that for me, Tesla installed their own panels (I got Tesla 425w panels). As far as I understand this is new since last month they no longer use the Hanwah panels. The sunrun guy was impressed by their specs when I showed him the plans submitted by Tesla. \n\nOverall I heard so many bad things about their service, but so far in San Diego at least, it has been top notch for me.",

I am in Michigan, we have had snow (not as much as we used to...) but today around noon my panels were overproducing 3kW back to the \"grid\". I haven't had need for heated panels, as others have noted even after snowfall the sun the next day does a good clearing job. But if I did lose 500-1000 watts to heating the panels for an hour or two just long enough to clear snow, I would still have overproduced most of the day. \n\nBut obviously regular maintenance in a commercial solar array as others noted would be far better. Just like we have maintenance on all other energy supply systems or most anything in our lives, including ourselves.",

"comment": "It would also be entirely possible to add to the system later on, but that would cost more than the lost $500 in permitting fees, etc to do it as two projects. Enphase is very scalable, so adding solar panels and microinverters to an existing system is pretty simple. Enphase combiner panels can accommodate 4 solar circuits. If you decide to add more later, the best thing you could do now would be to run 4 circuits from that combiner to the attic/roof junction box, so all you would have to do later is connect the spare wires to the new portion of the system. Also, if the first installment consisted of any solar strings that weren’t maxed out (I believe max # is 13 IQ7+ per string), those strings should have their free end located where the new array is planned, so you could add to an old string that has room for more micros.",

"comment": "It should become clear to various parties that the newer generation of electric vehicles is no better, environmentally speaking than late-model automobiles powered by the much-maligned internal combustion engine.\n\nThe goal of saving the Earth from ungrounded fears of “climate disruption” attending CO2 emissions pales in contrast to the massive disruptions by a transportation system whose dependence on EVs will trigger dreaded brownouts.\n\n…..\n\nAnother sobering thought for EV prospects in northerly climes - there is no waste heat from onboard fuel combustion to warm the car’s interior.\n\nBoth warm and cool air must come from a heat pump operated parasitically with current drawn from the battery pack, whose stored energy is intended primarily for vehicle propulsion.\n\nDiverting power to accessories decreases the driving range below its advertised value, and substantially during very cold or very hot weather.\n\n…..\n\nAlso at issue are scarce materials needed in the construction of both the lithium-ion batteries and several versions of high-performance motors to power EVs.\n\nLithium, nickel, cobalt, copper, and rare earth metals (lanthanum, neodymium, and other elements) lead the list of key components in batteries and motors. Serious supply problems ahead promise to keep consumer prices sky-high.\n\nAnd to no one’s surprise, China cornered about 90% of lithium reserves and dominates the market. Automakers are scrambling for other sources amid turmoil in other international arenas.\n\nMining lithium and other strategic metals incur environmental costs such that strictly enforced regulations in the United States force most mining and processing of lithium offshore.\n\nBut in Third World countries, extracting these exotic minerals often leaves behind improperly disposed of dross containing toxic waste. Out of sight, out of mind, right, greens?\n\nIt is mistaken to assume electric vehicles leave behind no environmental footprint, either in their construction or operation.\n\nThe electricity needed for charging comes from the grid fed by coal-fired, nuclear, and hydro-plants, far more than from wind farms or solar panels atop roofs.\n\nThose pushing for a rapid transition to an all-electric fleet suffer myopia that may come back to bite them, sooner than later.\n\n➖ The favored cars of the future are not ready for prime time in 2022, despite what the President recently said. And in many more ways than proponents are willing to acknowledge.\n\n…..\n\nThere are several things to consider: investment cost, operating costs, convenience, reliability, and safety. There is no obvious choice based solely on what’s good for the environment, despite the widely advertised opinions of EV advocates.\n\nStubborn safety issues persist with electrics, centering on potential fire hazards inherent in lithium batteries.\n\n…..\n\nMinimizing fire hazards translates into delays drivers will experience whenever venturing beyond the normal range, requiring the next recharge.\n\nNewsmax compares the costs of owning and operating an EV with a comparable SUV. It reached the conclusion that the combined costs of purchasing the new vehicles (with EV subsidy) and subsequent operating expenses favor a conventional model by more than $13,000 over a six-year period.\n\nThe figure doesn’t account for increases in electricity rates that may accompany the enormous increase in power demand with 50 million EVs taking to the highways. Rates applicable to charging stations away from home would be higher.",

Then each destroyed property would be a short term negative but a long term positive to the climate.\n\nSadly we don't typically do that.  Many places get rebuilt over and over and over.

"comment": "If you're paywalled and reading on a desktop browser, pick up a plugin that allows you to toggle javascript off.\n\n-----------\nThis story appears in the October/November 2023 issue of Forbes Magazine. Subscribe\nThis $30 billion industry is built on a shaky foundation of cheap money, questionable accounting and aggressive claims for federal tax credits. With money no longer cheap, subsidies a matter of politics and swirling allegations of fraud, a collapse could be coming soon.\nBy Christopher Helman, Forbes Staff, and Nikhil Hutheesing, former Forbes staff\n\nS\nitting at a mostly empty 20-person conference table in his Houston headquarters, William “John” Berger, CEO of Sunnova Energy International,\n\nlooks relaxed and confident. The top of his crisp white shirt is unbuttoned, and no strands of gray yet spoil his shock of black hair. At 50, this Texas-born Aggie engineer with a Harvard MBA has built Sunnova into the nation’s second-largest residential solar power developer, with 2,000 megawatts of generation on the rooftops of 390,000 homes. And yet, he quips, if you like cliffhangers, “you’ve come to the right place.”\n\nSunnova has lost $330 million on $722 million in revenue in the last 12 months. Its shares are trading around $10, off 80% from their 2021 high. Wall Street is nervous about its bonds: Its $400 million 2021 senior unsecured debt issue, maturing in 2026, initially paid 5.75%, but now yields 14%—high even for junk. But the big test, Ber­ger says, will come if there’s a recession or difficulty raising money (which he fears more than high rates). In the worst case, he says, he could slash costs by 50%, stop seeking new business and fire himself.\n\nThe glory days for residential solar power in the United States weren’t that long ago. In 2022, a record six gigawatts of peak generating capacity were installed on 700,000 rooftops, bringing total residential solar power to 40 GWs—nearly enough to power Los Angeles and Phila­delphia combined. The boom was partly fueled by falling prices for solar panels and inverters as more countries, including the U.S., jumped in to compete against China. Topping it off, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, an orgy of renewable energy subsidies which boosted the solar tax credit from 26% to 30% and extended it through 2032—meaning Uncle Sam is on the hook for maybe $8 billion a year for at least a decade.\n\nDespite all this, the residential solar industry is in serious trouble. Sharply rising interest rates have sapped both growth in demand for new residential systems, which are typically financed, and the value of $21 billion in debt issued to install existing systems. High interest rates are what Sunlight Financial, a residential solar financier, blamed when it filed for bankruptcy in October. (It went public in 2021 via a SPAC.) Two days after Sunlight sought Chapter 11 protection, San Francisco–based Sunrun, the largest player in residential solar with annual revenue of $2.3 billion, said it was writing off $1.2 billion in goodwill, primarily from the $3.2 billion acquisition of Vivint Solar in 2020.\n\nThe interest rate spike is drawing attention to other problems in an industry built not only on cheap money but also on suspect accoun­ting and a tax credit regime (born in 2005) that has invited aggressive—and in some cases fraudulent—claims. Sunrun, whose stock is off 90% from its 2021 high, faces continuing pressure from short sellers who allege it has claimed inflated tax credits. As Warren Buffett famously observed, “you don’t find out who’s been swimming naked until the tide goes out.” In emailed responses to Forbes, Sunrun defended all its practices as proper.\n\nThe shorts have some company. One industry whistleblower has told the IRS that inflated tax credit claims are endemic across the residential solar industry. The IRS isn’t talking, but the whistleblower’s attorney believes the agency is still investigating the man’s claims, which could eventually earn him a fat reward of 15% to 30% of any funds recovered.\n\nGordon Johnson, whose New York boutique equity research firm serves mostly short sellers, goes so far as to compare the residential solar industry’s current peril to the subprime mortgage debacle of 15 years ago: “It’s a debt Ponzi. They perpetually issue more debt to fund these pro­jects that don’t generate the cash they say.”\n\nThis isn’t just short sellers talking their own book. “There is going to be some kind of reckoning,” predicts John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C.\n\n“Because of the perceived goodness of the industry, they did not receive all the scrutiny that other sectors would have.”\n\nT\nhe residential solar business has always faced one big obstacle: high upfront costs. A new 7.5-kilowatt residential rooftop solar system costs between $20,000 and $45,000. That expense is mitigated somewhat by the tax code, but claiming federal subsidies is not simple. An individual federal tax credit should eventually kick back 30% of that tab to the homeowner, but the credit is nonrefundable—meaning you can claim it only against income taxes you paid or owed in the year you installed the panels. You won’t get a subsidy check from Uncle Sam, though you can roll any unused credit forward to offset taxes in future years. The bottom line: Most families can’t—or won’t—pay out of pocket for the upfront cost of installation.\n\nThe industry’s two main solutions both depend on cheap money. One is to lend creditworthy homeowners the full installation price, which they can theoretically cover (typically over 20 or 25 years) with lower electric bills and the tax credits they eventually receive. Installers sometimes offer below-market rates on these loans, wrapping the additional interest expense into their upfront charge. The consumer loans are then securitized and sold. That’s the model used by now-bankrupt Sunlight and by GoodLeap, the solar loan market leader. When rates are low, it’s an extraordinarily lucrative business. GoodLeap’s cofounder and CEO, Hayes Barnard, has ridden this cheap money express all the way to a net worth of $3.7 billion, enough for a spot on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans.\n\nThe other approach is older. The installer—Sunnova or Sunrun, say—continues to own the panels on the roof, and the homeowner signs a typically 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to buy the juice. That allows the solar companies, or their investors, to claim a similar 30% investment tax credit for solar energy. This financing method was losing market share, but the Inflation Reduction Act gave it a boost by allowing the outright sale of renewable energy tax credits.\n\nEven before the Inflation Reduction Act, however, the Sunruns and Sunnovas of the world were able to raise billions by selling tax credits indirectly to profitable corporations with big tax bills to offset. These “tax equity” investors put up 30% of the cost, then get nearly all their money back within two years in the form of tax credits, plus the halo of investing in green energy, and an additional return. Big players in this market include Alphabet, Meta, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.\n\nIn this model, debt financing—in the form of asset backed securities—covers most of the other 70%. And when interest rates were at all-time lows, fixed-income investors lined up to buy solar bonds priced like high-grade corporate debt. Sunnova has issued $4.5 billion and Sunrun $3.5 billion in asset backed securities in the past decade.But now that investors can get a riskless 5% on money market funds, they’re demanding much higher yields. “You’ve got to reflect the fact that interest rates have moved up, so your cost structure is higher,” says Sunnova’s Berger with a sigh.\n\n     “Liquidity flowing into the clean tech space is dropping. People are running on borrowed time.”\n    —William “John” Berger, CEO, Sunnova\n\nC\narson Block first made a name for himself expo­sing dubious accoun­ting at Chinese companies; his Austin, Texas, firm, Muddy Waters Capital, is named after a Chinese proverb that says you catch more fish in muddy waters. For more than a year, the 47-year-old lawyer turned activist short seller has been targeting Sunrun, arguing it has used un­duly aggressive assumptions to inflate apprai­sals for residential solar systems, misleading investors and claiming excess tax benefits.\n\nOne might be forgiven for thinking that establishing the basis of a solar system for tax credit purposes is straightforward: What did it cost to buy the panels, inverters and gear, then hire a few guys to screw it to a roof? That’s the way homeowners do it.\n\nBy contrast, in the PPA segment, the custo­mary practice—so far allowed by the IRS—is to appraise the value of rooftop systems for the purpo­ses of both the investment tax credit and financing, based on the net present value of the income they produce. That involves lots of assumptions: adding up all the expected future cash flows, mostly from custo­mer payments for electricity over 20 years, and subtracting forecasted maintenance and other costs, then applying a discount rate.",

"comment": "Suggest a different way to think about it. In the military there's a saying, \"the big things are very simple. The simple things are very hard.\" Global warming is a very simple but very hard problem. Simple: we know what the cause is, and we know what the solution is. We know global warming is happening because humans are putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We know that to stop global warming, we have to stop putting greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Simple. But very hard. That's why we have to replace ICEs with EVs. We have to replace fossil-fuel power plants with renewables and non-carbon sources like geothermal and nuclear. Yes, there are environmental costs with that. De-carbonization is not a free lunch. But we still have to do it. And we can be in favor of smaller houses and more and better public transportation. There's nothing wrong and a lot of good to be obtained from reducing humanity's overall environmental footprint. Anything that makes the problem smaller contributes to the solution. But to control global warming, we have to end the use of fossil fuels, more or less completely.\n\nThe good news here is that replacing fossil fuels with renewables, geothermal, and nuclear energy offers the potential for a greener, cleaner future, with cheaper energy available to more people. It's the potential to eliminate open pit coal mines, strip mines, mountaintop removal, oil refineries, oil terminals, gas stations, and all the associated pollution. Yes, there will be other kinds of pollution and damage from mining the minerals needed for batteries and solar panels. The environmental problems of industrial civilization don't go away because we change the energy source. It's a good reason to emphasize less consumption, less energy use, more conservation, more efficiency. Again, anything that makes the problem smaller contributes to the solution. But if we don't get the global warming under control, the other problems won't matter.",

Easy.\n\n\nAn EV with a solar roof is absurd because:\n- The solar panels get very little energy because of their orientation, also they're small.\n- Forget about glass roofs.\n- Car is heavier.\n- Car is more expensive, and you're definitely not getting that money back by electricity savings.\n- Car has more hardware that might require maintenance.\n- In order to maximise charging you'll want to park it under the sun, something you would otherwise avoid for multiple reasons, one being you'll need AC as soon as you get back in the car, AC that might consume more energy that what you've recharged in the first place 🤣",

Truck with two pallets of equipment shows up, he gets on the phone and says it's getting pushed back til tomorrow. Couple hours later I get an email saying it's getting pushed back almost a month until Dec. 2nd. The deadline to request Amerens witness test is Dec. 13th, extremely close. They claim the issue was weather, we have had perfect weather the last couple months except for two days of rain. I contacted the project manager who basically said sorry, we are bringing in extra crews from an adjoining city. I am worried they may have oversold their services let alone rain or possibly snow will delay it more. If we miss Amerens deadline the excess solar will get the supply rate rather than the full retail rate and we miss getting grandfathered in for 30 years. Has anyone dealt with delays and Amerens witness test? Do I even have any options other than wait and be overly concerned?",

Total financed price is $61k, let’s just say the 2 Tesla Powerwall 3’s are $21k to make it simple and the 14.62kW system is $40k. Which brings the solar system only PPW to about 2.74 which isn’t that bad. Not sure if you got any dealer fees for financing in there. But since the 61k is the financed amount, unless they sold it at less then $2 with the remainder of the PPW the dealer fee. You got yourself a very competitive quote that is being financed!",

"comment": "> 59% of their load with a claimed availability of 95%\n\nDang, sounds almost like the nuclear fleet wasn't sized to cover the entirety of the consumption. Great discovery you just made buddy.\n\n> Half the transmission infrastructure \n\nSure buddy, half of Germany's generation is lost and you are the only guy in the entire country who knows about it. Don't lose your time here with me, go tell the Energiebundesagentur or whatever its name is.\n\n> A claimed availability of 60%\n\nLol. Famous solar panels and windmills with 60% load factor.\n\n> Over twice as reliable in terms of living up to the promised energy delivered\n\nDid you have a stroke when writing this sentence ?\n\n> Which is now default with every new installation \n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nNo really Germany plans to add 4 GWh of utility battery storage by the end of 2026. For a planned installation of something like 60GW of additional renewables capacity by then. A whole 4 minutes of storage at full power.\n\n> Blabla France electrical grid\n\nBro the vast majority of the grid in both country was built at the time when we only had fossile fuels. The French grid is older than the nuclear plan. The only meaningful metric here is population density and overall country size.\n\n> Just in smaller quantities \n\nYes, keep telling yourself those sweet lies.\n\n> China has taken thirty years\n\nChina takes nine years from project beginning to commercial operation on a bad day\n\n> A plant usually starts 3-5 years before the reactor breaks ground\n\nAnother stroke, maybe you should get a medical check\n\n> Only two years after the last reactor is built\n\nYou don't wait for the last reactor to be built to activate the plant that's a lie. Each reactor begins operation once its ready without waiting for the others, they do not have any common infrastructure except for the transmission line, which will of course be built faster than the rest.\n\n> Where you pretend 99.9% of the waste doesn't exist\n\nThose 99.9% of the waste are stuff like gloves and suits worn by workers, which barely took any radiations but are trashed as radioactive waste out of precaution. \n\n> It has no viable plan\n\nPutting it in a bunch of concrete is literally a viable plan conceived by radiation engineers. You not wanting to hear about it doesn't mean it's not viable.\n\n> Chernobyl and Fukushima both cost their countries trillions in economic damage\n\nDo... Do you even know what a trillion represents? Or are you just throwing random words you don't understand?\n\n> Both very minor quantities of radiation \n\nMmmhhh, I sure wonder what that would mean about our overly inflated security measures.\n\n> A full, mostly spent fuel load gets spread over a large area\n\nYeah, I guess the fuel just starts to magically fly and sprinkle itself over a city. Do you have more fantastic scenarios you want to share with us ?\n\n> The public is ensuring against this for free\n\nWhich means the public didn't ask for enough insurance commitment from nuclear companies.\n\n> Ukraine was impoverished for decades\n\nI am pretty sure Ukraine, the country born in 1991, didn't pay a cent toward Chernobyl since it isn't its fault. The economic strain was carried by Russia and then the international community. Ukraine isn't any poorer than Belarus, Moldavia, Georgia, Armenia. It's just eastern, non-EU Europe, not the result of Chernobyl.\n\n> Minuscule liability cap\n\n17B in the US and then the money they committed as insurance kicks in. That's absolutely not minuscule.",

"comment": "You skipped a higher number of articles arguing that organic food production is lower yielding and problematic as a result with respect to scaling. And then picked a single study and called it the scientific consensus? Plucking one study does not make a consensus, nor does it indicate anything in particular. I don't think you have read this study, or you would understand that its methodologies are not those which are designed to conclude on a scientific consensus. In fact, the study is not even a study. It is just averaging a handful of random studies yield numbers. These studies are never meant to speak on global scalability in the first place! Those that talk about global scalability as their main focus almost unanimously scoff at organic as viable. Learn things before you talk about them, please.\n\nPS: Vegan organic permaculture is not as good for the environment or global poor as non vegan non organic permaculture. Fact. The kind of fetishism that comes from this crowd is mindboggling. I really feel bad for being counted among this group. But hey, when you are high on the list of stuffwhitepeoplelike, I guess this is what you have to put up with. I am just waiting for you to bring in discussion of mother gaia and new age chakras. That is about all you are missing with your loony fetishism of low yield hobby farming.",

This also plays into it, I feel guilty and bad every time I cook something. To be honest even the idea that I only consume animals 2 or 3 times a years is a lie as i do need to taste a lot of dishes I make mostly stocks, soups, the odd sauce if I’m not confident. Point being when you’re caught in a hypocrisy you can’t avoid because you need a job,  and want to be Chef, and there are no vegan restaurants for  150 km, you sort of live with your hypocrisy, and yes it hurts, you live with this constant anger that simmers under everything you do.\nTo end, I’m not bothered ehtically or morally by fishing for salmon or pickerel, I’m not going to order it in restaurant, or would i ever sell it if i ever owned one, \n\ni am a walking hypocrisy",

Convincing even one other person to stop eating meat and dairy will save more animals than insisting on a completely \"pure\" diet and lifestyle for yourself. \n\nIf you're instead motivated by your own personal feelings towards using animal products for yourself, and a desire to minimize your own personal impact, then you will have to try a lot harder. There's many activist groups such as the vegan society that help advice where you can get hold of vegan alternatives for many animal products. \n\nOne can do both of course, but being slightly cynical I just think it is a more effective use of my time and effort to try to demonstrate to others that it is quite possible to live comfortably without meat, dairy and leather than to push myself to try to be perfect.",

Every step of the way you can multiply the energy, land, and water requirements for animal-based foods by 6-15 times (estimates vary). Grass-fed beef are less inefficient and unsustainable, but still they don't use land or water as efficiently as plants and they produce more methane than grain-fed.",

"comment": "&gt;Is using bat shit not vegan friendly?\n\n[From wikipedia...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano)\n\nBat guano is usually mined in caves and this mining is associated with a corresponding loss of troglobytic biota and diminishing of biodiversity. Guano deposits support a great variety of cave-adapted invertebrate species, which rely on bat feces as their sole nutrient input. In addition to the biological component, deep guano deposits contain local paleoclimatic records in strata that have built up over thousands of years, which are unrecoverable once disturbed.\n\nThe greatest damage caused by mining to caves with extant guano deposits is to the bat colonies themselves. Bats are highly vulnerable to regular disturbance to their roosts. Some species, such as Phyllonycteris aphylla, have low fat reserves, and will starve to death when regularly disturbed and put into a panic state during their resting period. Many species will drop pups when in panic, with subsequent death, leading to a steady reduction in population. Research in Jamaica has shown that mining for bat guano is directly related to the loss of bat species, associated invertebrates and fungi, and is the greatest threat to bat caves on the island.",

As I showed you above, many people already eat those animals. You can't say they're not *food*. If your position is that: \"*not ALL people eat those animals**, that's simply besides the point; diet is not universal.\n\n&gt;they're not good candidates for factory farming now, and to make them that way it would take too much time and money\n\nAnd who proposed that they should be factory farmed? Or farmed at all? \n\n&gt;Consider how long we've been breeding pigs and cattle, and you'll have some idea.\n\nConsider that factory farming is &lt; 100 years old. I'm sure someone could create a factory system to fatten up cats and dogs with various protein mixtures made from soy or other plants, and would have success as long there people who still want to eat such meats. \n\nYou're simply arguing that herbivores are discriminated because they're cheaper, but you're ignoring how volatile the nature of economics is and how various the demands people make are.",

Well, to my surprise, some of the shoes I thought were leather were actually synthetics all along! I never really thought to look before.",

"comment": "I like the way the super strict approach to veganism was satirised in a spoof agony aunt column in [Vegan Views] (http://www.veganviews.org.uk/vv100/vv100earlyyears.html)  magazine in the 1908s. Some readers thought the column was serious. A sane approach is to make the changes you can and stop worrying about the ones you can't. The mirror question is my favourite:\n\nDear Laura,\n\nRecently I discovered that modern-day mirrors invariably are not vegan. Apparently a small amount of animal fat is used in their manufacture, in order to obtain glossier and more reflective surfaces. I'm finding it easy enough not to have mirrors in my own home, but it's much harder when I go out. I have to be on constant alert in friends' houses (especially their bathrooms) so as not to get my image caught on their mirrors – and of course those modern shops with four-sided mirror columns, or even whole walls of mirrors, are pure hell. Do you have any advice? Do you know of any suppliers of vegan mirrors? What do other vegans do about this problem? T.P. (Huddersfield)\n\nLaura: I think most vegans take the attitude that it's sufficient not to own mirrors of their own, and that it doesn't matter to be seen in other people's. However you have taken the hard-line but ethically consistent approach, and of course this will necessarily cause severe practical problems. Mirrors are a dilemma for all those vegans who enjoy agonising over what else they can give up, and I do sympathise. I'm afraid that as yet no vegan mirrors are on the market in Britain, so for the foreseeable future you're just going to have to be very alert. At least we can be sure our shadows are vegan, so all is not gloom. (VV33, Winter/Spring 1985)",

It's just incorrect to use it to make that distinction, since we are also omnivores. I think the term \"nonvegan\" is accurate for describing meat-eaters and lacto-ovo vegetarians.",

"comment": "Let’s do a comparison. \nSmall (100g) ribeye nutrition info-\nCals: 274\nFat: 22g\n   Saturated fat: 9g\n   Cholesterol: 68 mg\nProtein: 17.51\nCarbs, fiber, sugar: 0g\nSodium: 56 mg\n\nSweet Earth plant-based burger:\nCals: 260 \nFat: 15g\n    Saturated fat: 7g\n    Cholesterol: 0g\nProtein: 26 g\nCarbs: 9 g\nFiber: 6 g\nSugar: 1 g\nSodium: 400\n\nExcluding the animal cruelty factor of eating meat, here is an analysis- the ribeye is a good choice for a low carb/diabetic or keto diet, and by itself is relatively low in sodium. However, it is higher in all fat content, especially cholesterol. The plant-based burger holds its own in most categories. It’s still relatively low-carb if you eschew the bun and I’d argue it’s only worse off in the sodium category, but 400 mg isn’t THAT much. I try to avoid adding salt to all my food and usually have a side of veggies or salad with my burger so one of my meals having 400 mg of sodium isn’t much. How many people eat a steak unseasoned? Add just half a tsp of salt to that steak or homemade hamburger patties (which pretty much everyone that I’ve seen prepare meat does) and you’ve got an additional 1,162 mg of sodium. Another comparison is a McDonald’s junior burger contains 491 mg of sodium. \n\nRegarding the processing - I’m willing to take my chances eating plant-based protein unless or until substantial evidence-based studies produce results remotely comparable to meat-eating. Processed meats are a group 1 carcinogen. How many people add bacon to their burgers? (And cheese, which ups the sodium content again, but I digress.) Red meat consumption is definitively proven to cause higher incidences of bowel cancer. \nRegarding cholesterol, it’s just flat-out false of people, especially the low-carb or keto proponents, to claim that dietary cholesterol intake does not correlate with an increased risk of heart disease. That being said, high dietary cholesterol hasn’t been definitively proven to increase heart disease risk. You can cherry-pick studies to support either side. A combination of meta-analyses about the link of cholesterol and increased risk heart disease (many high-quality, researched long-term studies) does not come to a consensus. However, some points I think are relevant. I’d also like to point out that I’m an adult-geriatric nurse practitioner. I have a Master of Science degree with the majority of my clinical hours worked in internal medicine clinics with patients &gt;65 years of age. I also worked in a medical and cardiovascular ICU for 6 years. \n\n-The #1 killer of men and women in the US is heart disease. Genetics plays a huge factor ( I’ve seen patients with three generations of heart attacks at the same early age). Since the consensus on the role of diet differs, why not err on the side of caution? If I had a higher chance of heart disease from eating meat I would choose not to. If I had heart disease in my family history I would especially avoid eating meat/dairy and limit my dietary cholesterol. That’s the easiest point. The fact that most people aren’t vegan and most people in America eat meat means you could argue there is at very least a correlation there. \n- I’ve taken care of thousands of patients with cardiovascular disease in the hospital and while I didn’t ask every single one their dietary preferences - there were a handful of vegetarians - I can’t remember a single one who was vegan. \n- Most clinic patients I’ve cared for have high blood pressure and are overweight. I’d say 80-85%, at least? Of those, most have high blood cholesterol levels and are prediabetic if not diabetic. I asked diet questions to nearly every one of these. 99% reported diets high in fast food, sugar and fried foods and limited in vegetables, whole grains and fruits, the staples of vegan diets. Sure you can be vegan and eat Oreos and fries every day but most of my patients, and arguably Americans’, shitty diets contain meat and animal products because most people don’t avoid them. \n\nIn conclusion, processed plant-based foods are relatively new and need reputable studies. But as of now, they aren’t proven to cause cancer or cardiovascular disease. And the bottom line is I’d still rather not eat animals for ethical reasons.",

"comment": "Hey there. We hear this point a lot, and I understand where you are coming from. \n\nI don’t disagree with your argument in principle. For example, I am asexual and have no interest in sex, but I’m all for other people having consensual sex. The difference between this example, and my choice to not kill animals is that me choosing not to have sex doesn’t come with casualties. \n\nWhen we choose to consume cow’s milk, this requires the separation of mother from baby. Mother cows are deeply maternal- they love and want to keep their babies. When you consume milk, are you giving the mother the choice, or are you forcing your beliefs on her? When the male calf, which cannot produce milk and is therefore a byproduct of the dairy industry, is sent off to a slaughterhouse where he has a bolt shot into his skull, are you giving him any choices?\n\nWhat about the sheep, who produce your wool? In many cases, those who are hired to sheer the sheep are paid by how many sheep they are able to sheer in a period of time. This rapid pace does not allow for slow, gentle care. The sheep are often handled roughly- are the sheep given a choice? Or when they are sent to the slaughterhouse, just like every animal that is no longer able to produce at a rate that makes them profitable, and they try to escape slaughter, slipping in the blood of the sheep whose blood covers the floor. Are they permitted to leave because they struggle? Or are they forced back up onto the table, their head shoved up against the head rest to allow the worker the right angle to slit their throat?\n\nOr the goats, just a few days old, who are grabbed by the neck by a worker so that they can burn off their budding horns with a hot iron. The goats scream and thrash, but surely they want to undergo this procedure?\n\nWhat about mother pigs, trapped in farrowing crates. They cannot turn around. They may only be able to take 1 or 2 steps forward and back. Movement is difficult, and this causing muscle wasting. To counter this, farmers may beat and yell at the mother pigs to force them to stand so that they stay ambulatory. What choice in this do you think they have? What if they can’t or don’t want to stand? Or when one of her piglets falls through the wooden slats in the floor to the waste pit below, and the mother cannot help, what choice does she have? The babies have their teeth clipped and their tails amputated so that they cannot hurt each other. Pigs are intelligent, curious animals. The constant stress and complete lack of environmental enrichment cause stress and boredom, and pigs are known to hurt one another as a result. The boy pigs have their testicles removed so that their meat tastes better. Their ears may be notched (cut) or tagged (pierced) for identification. This is all done without anesthetic (where I live, this is legal as long as the animal is under 6 months). Do you think they would pick this, given the choice? \n\nWhat about turkeys, whose bodies have been engineered so that they grow as large as possible as fast as possible. This expedites the process from birth to slaughter, increasing profit (less time to pay for their care equals less money). Do you think they value this ability more than they value their ability to stand on their feet without pain or difficulty? When they cannot stand, and the workers kick them, are they just indifferent? They don’t want to make a choice?\n\nI am happy to send you videos of all of the things I mention. This is, in many places, industry standard. \n\nI truly understand your position, I value freedom and choice, too! That’s why I’m vegan- because I think it’s important to extend this choice to other beings, who also want the choice to live and be free from pain, fear and suffering.",

It's pretty clear she respects my choice, but doesn't want to learn anything horrible because she knows that as soon as she does, then she won't be able to enjoy all her favorite animal products anymore.\n\nLike many people, I'm sure, she's metaphorically squeezing her eyes shut, putting her fingers in her ears, and saying, \"Not listening, la la la la!

"comment": "Remember that Calamari is a culinary name, not the name of an animal. \n\nVegan calamari is a description of what kind of food it is: it’s using mushrooms to make a version of calamari vegans can eat. It has the same texture, and near-identical taste (I’ve eaten it before, it’s stupidly realistic and very yummy).\n\nIt’s really simple, and the people pretending to misunderstand it are only making themselves look thick, not vegans.\n\nIn fact it’s significantly less confusing than ‘peanut butter’, ‘fish fingers’, ‘bread fruit’, ‘candy corn’, ‘sweetbreads’ and ‘sweetmeats’ etc. which meat-eaters rarely nitpick at (because they’re not *vegan* foods). \n\n&gt;If I called fired calamari “non-vegan fried mushrooms” you’d think I was insane, and rightly so. Why miss-name it? \n\nYou’re right that it sounds strange, but that’s because there’s no reason for that to exist. Everybody eats plants, so nobody would ever have a need to emulate plants with animal products.\n\nAlthough it does happen (mince pies are a Christmas staple in my country, but they haven’t contained meat for over a century).\n\nMeanwhile I bet you’ve heard of veggie burgers, veggie lasagna, vegan chicken wings/nuggets, vegan sausages etc. which are significantly more normalised \n\n\n&gt;Veggies are delicious, why do we have to pretend they’re not even in the dish?\n\nVegans aren’t attempting to hide veggies in meals - they eat a lot of veggies. This is just attempting to reproduce a tasty animal product that they now ethically object to killing an animal for. I highly doubt people eating this aren’t doing so to ‘trick’ themselves into eating plants",

Amsterdam has one of the best vegan (and  in general) bakeries I’ve ever stepped foot in (Saint Jean), eating out is super easy, and there’s plenty of selection at Lidl or Jimbo. I visited last month and was so tempted to bring back a crapload of oyster mushrooms back with me. For the same size they are extremely overpriced where I’m at. Almost $4 compared to 1.79 euros. \n\nAnother example was McDonalds in Germany…..hadn’t eaten at McDonalds for nearly a decade until last year. Tasted so fresh and bomb!\n\nFinland….from beauty products to the selection of fresh foods to candy, everything was marked clearly and I had no shortage of options. Hippeas are great, but I had been craving more of what cheese balls and curls taste like and low and behold. When I went to Helsinki for my friend’s birthday weekend getaway she had brought this very thing specifically to cater to my diet. \n\nIn the US Los Angeles is still King for me because when it comes to take out a lot of places don’t even have to rely on processed meat substitutes.",

"comment": "family's vegan. Before then they were very accommodating vegetarians. On holidays typically my boyfriend and I are in charged of making a vegan meal and we invite them over. We try to make something special - we watch a lot of vegan recipe videos and always have a very instagrammable dinner.\n\nthat's the tip - turn your family vegan.\n\nAlthough when attending events with my boyfriend's family - he kinda paints me as the extreme vegan of the two of us - which i guess is probably true and tells them that i am uncomfortable eating with people who are eating animals, and they've been accommodating, otherwise I don't go. My boyfriend has been vegan for a very long time so they do have a clear understanding of what it means and how to eat and cook vegan. I understand that they may not like me very much like this but I think it's a small price to pay for fewer animals to be eaten.\n\nso i guess that's another tip - ask for accommodation/ask for people to try to be vegan for one day. you never know, they could agree.",
