"comment": "As nice as it is to see towns and people making an effort to showcase and test new technologies, this was unfortunately a step in the wrong direction. Hydrogen fuel cells a mistake - an inferior technology in comparison to battery electric vehicles. The refuelling network doesn't exist (which is one of the main points in the article), fuel cells are cost-prohibitive, but more importantly using hydrogen as a fuel makes little chemical sense from an efficiency point of view.\n\nI'd love to see Whistler adopt a few BYD battery electric buses. Whistler is a beautiful place, and I'd love to see them continue to try out new technologies to improve their local environment.",

"comment": "Here's a list of this non-profit's [key accomplishments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Defense_Fund#Key_accomplishments) as displayed on Wikipedia. I've added some, though not all, relevant links from the Wikipedia page also. The rest can be found on Wikipedia, including citations.\n\n---\n\n1967 - A group of scientists forms the organization and sets out to ban DDT (succeeding in 1972).[13] (See [DDT ban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT#Restrictions_on_usage).)  \n\n1970 - Efforts to ban whale hunting.[36][37]\n\n1974 - An Environmental Defense Fund study of Mississippi River water[38][39][40] helps pass the [Safe Drinking Water Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Drinking_Water_Act),[41][42][43] establishing the first comprehensive health standards for water nationwide.\n\n1985 - Helped convince federal regulators to phase out lead from gasoline,[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53] leading to a dramatic decline in childhood [lead poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning).[54]\n\n1986 - Pushed McDonalds to institute biodegradable food-packaging containers.[55]\n\n1987 - Played a key role in the treaty to phase out the use of CFCs, chemicals that many researchers believe damage the Earth’s ozone layer, although CFC-22 was continued to be allowed, renamed H-CFC-22 to avoid banning.[56][57]\n\n1990 - Designed Title IV of the [Clean Air Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_\\(United_States\\)), which incorporates market-based methods to cut air pollution and [acid rain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain).[25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] The measures reduced sulfur dioxide pollution faster than expected, and at a fraction of the cost.[33][34][35][58][59][60]\n\n1990 - Improved McDonald's packaging, reducing solid waste in a groundbreaking corporate partnership. This came after dozens of other groups had protested McDonald's use of styrofoam packaging and the corporation was looking for a way to \"save face\" by claiming EDF's advocacy was the reason for the shift. The Citizens Clearinghouse on Hazardous Waste, founded by Lois Gibbs, helped coordinate the protests of McDonald's.[61][62]\n\n1993 - EDF was one of seven foundation-funded environmental groups to endorse the NAFTA Treaty.\n\n1995 - Designed the Safe Harbor plan[63][64] that gives landowners new incentives to help endangered species on their property.\n\n2000 - Seven of the world's largest corporations join Environmental Defense in a partnership to address global warming, setting firm targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.[65][66]\n\n2001, 2004, 2008 - Won measures resulting in cleaner vehicle exhaust from trucks, ships and other vehicles[67]\n\n2002 - Initiated the recent campaign to remove the O'Shaughnessy Dam in Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park[68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78]\n\n2004 - Culmination of 4-year partnership with FedEx to develop and deploy hybrid electric trucks. The new vehicles cut smog-forming pollution by 65%, reduce soot by 96%, and move 57% farther on a gallon of fuel.\n\n2006 - Co-authored the [California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Warming_Solutions_Act_of_2006) with Natural Resources Defense Council.[79][80]\n\n2006 - Led adoption of catch shares, a science-based method to manage fishing and control fish population decline.[81][82][83][84]\n\n2007 - Co-founded United States Climate Action Partnership (US-CAP), a coalition of major corporations and environmental groups supporting action on global warming, including a market-based carbon emissions cap. Corporate participants include GE, DuPont and Duke Energy; non-profit groups involved are Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Resources Institute, a co-founder.[85][86]\n\n2007 - Helped negotiate an environmental codicil as part of Texas Pacific's buyout of TXU.[87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98][99][100][101][102][103][104][105]\n\n2008-2011 - Founded and developed the Climate Corps program, which matches organizations with MBA and MPA students to uncover energy savings.[106][107]\n\n2011 - Successful campaign to clean up highly-polluting heating oil in New York City.[108][109][110]\n\n2011 - Built coalition to defeat [Proposition 23](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_23_\\(2010\\)), an industry-backed ballot initiative that would have blocked California’s Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32).[111]\n\n---\n\nIf Anthony Watt has inspired you to donate, then you can do at http://www.edf.org/  \n\nI am of course not affiliated with EDF, i just like the idea of someone trying to misrepresent them leads to extra donations *to* them.\n\nMerry Christmas",

Every charger at every site would need an identification method, a payment handling system, then they would need staff to handle billing issues, \"this charger isn't accepting my card\", and so on.  As it is now the sites don't need to be staffed and can be open 24/7 without an issue.  A lot more infrastructure would be required if they were pay-as-you-go.",

It takes a lot of metal and gas to get the fuel to customer, comparatively bringing it right to the factory to be moved threw electric wire is cheaper. Who would of known?\n\nPartly saying this because people 'calculate' the amount of energy an electric car uses, then an internal combustion, and believe it takes nearly has much energy to push an electric car. \n\nWell yes it does you twats. Its a little more efficient at actively pushing it self, but majorly more efficient has using potential energy. Electric things are much better then anything else, because they make power modular, and extremely easy to mass produce, ending up to a much more efficient use of the whole technology, even if all your city had was a coal factory, its more efficient then running internal combustion.\n\nThe 'fuel' price (being electricity) only shows how much more efficient electric cars are.",

"comment": "Hence why large automakers don't have the advantage or the edge when it comes to electric cars. Their legacy of ICE car making is a liability and despite having a lot of cash to invest, they refuse or do very little of it, far less than companies whose whole business is electric cars. I don't find any misunderstanding, I agree. \n\nWhat's not spelled out clearly is that EVs do make sense now for anything above $40000 because the cost per kWh has dropped more than 3x in a decade and it's in continued free fall at a time when not even 1 million units with good enough range is achievable with current world battery production. In other words, the economies of scale that allows the existence of $15000 ICE econoboxes is going to allow $15000 electric econoboxes sporting 60 kWh of energy storage.\n\nAt the moment, it doesn't seem like VW or Renault will be positioned to take advantage of the switch to electric. Who wants a Leaf more than a Model 3? Tell me who that is and I'll show you an idiot. Things could change, nothing is set but the signs have yet to appear. It's all marketing and brave talk for now.",

(Seriously; look at your local off-lease stock.)\n\nThen why have they suggested that Polestar will be the EV focused sub brand of Volvo? \n\n&gt;Polestar using twin rear motors is not a drag-strip move. It's not a P100D competitor. It's a BMW i8 or 6-series competitor. \n\nIt couldn't compete with the Model S, it would need to grow up first and have a real man's battery pack. It's more like a luxury Chevy Volt.\n\n&gt;This is a touring car version of the Porsche 718 with an electric kick in the pants and it's exactly what a Volvo buyer wants to see out of Polestar.\n\nWhy even focus on hybrid for Polestar if all they cared about was to make GT cars? Why not just make hybrid Volvos and leave Polestar to cater to high performance market with traditional ICE cars? Why even hold the reveal in China? You know what this looks like? It's like they fucked up and couldn't make a decent range EV with high performance so they frankensteined a hybrid to meet whatever internal deadline they had and pushed the BEV back for a later release.",

"comment": "BEVs use batteries to store electricity. FCEVs use hydrogen fuel cells which converts the hydrogen into electricity. The hydrogen tank is the \"battery\".  But it you need a lot of electricity to make the hydrogen, so it only seems to make sense to make hydrogen when there is excess renewable electricity being produced since (until recently) it's difficult and expensive to store electricity. The old argument for hydrogen was that it's faster to refill a hydrogen tank than it is to charge a battery. But with newer batteries and DC charging technologies, HFCV are being left behind at least when it comes to passenger vehicles.",

EA doesn't overprice their stations, but Tesla has the benefit of vertical integration (powerpacks to offset peak demand, build their own components together at one factory, etc.) along with not using the superchargers for profit which allow them to have significantly lower charging costs. Once EA's network is more complete and they don't have to spend as much building new stations,  I'd guess they would be able to reduce their prices somewhat. Will they, though? I doubt it.",

One would have to add in all the Tesla destination charging stations (240V) to make that a more even comparison.\n\nFurthermore, EA’s total plugs is 400, averaging 4 plugs per station. Tesla’s average is much higher than that per station: probably double after skimming the list, but I didn’t calculate it exactly.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I absolutely wouldn’t be nervous about owning an E-Tron or Taycan for trips. The EA network is generally sufficient and they’ve installed stations at a rapid pace. AND they absolutely have more stations per trip-capable EV than Tesla. It’s a relative handful of CCS cars that are doing long trips at this point. Look at the cross-country Etron trip where they said they literally never saw another car charging the whole time. Point is, you’ll have plenty of available chargers.\n\nHowever, these numbers aren’t apples-to-apples and are therefore somewhat misleading.",

"comment": "Higher kWh/kg reduces weight and likely vehicle battery costs since it may require less materials and could simplify pack manufacturing.  If battery longevity increases, it also decreases warranty replacement expenses.\n\nWeight impacts efficiency.  It's why Tesla builds the model S/X almost entirely out of aluminum, and a good chunk of the model 3/Y out of aluminum.  Also why Tesla made a big deal out of reducing model S weight in their 402 mile range press release.  If those vehicles had used more steel, then each part could have weighed up to 30%-50% more.  It's been a big boon to the company that aluminum prices have tanked.\n\nAfter efficiency losses just from the vehicle's total weight increasing, the car may need more structure to support heavier batteries and a more robust suspension/wheel/tire setup and larger brakes/rotors, increasing unsprung weight and rotational mass.    Tesla mitigates the unsprung mass by using aluminum in the suspension components instead of steel.\n\nReduce the battery weight, reduce the structural and suspension requirements.  Either you can use lighter aluminum components, or maybe you can use cheaper steel components.  \n\nOverall, it just brings the price of the car down.",

"comment": "We haven't yet reached a steady state for how public charging will go yet, so it's hard to tell what will or will not make sense. There are a lot of different kinds of charging situations and it's unclear which ones will be most favorable. On top of that, max charging rate and range still varies quite a bit from vehicle to vehicle and is likely to continue changing for the near future. This differs a bit from gasoline vehicles where pump speeds have remained the same for a long while and range has generally stayed around a 400 mile average for the last few decades.\n\nFor people who can charge at home, that's likely the vast majority of their charging miles except for longer trips where they'd likely want DC public fast chargers near highway ramps that are similar to drop in replacements for gas stations and/or level 2 chargers at any lodging they stay overnight. There are going to be odd situations here and there for those people where perhaps other charging is useful, but that's going to cover the vast majority and perhaps entirely their use. However, there are a lot of people for whom home charging is for whatever reason not accessible or not reliably accessible. For that fairly large chunk of people, there are going to also use the DC public fast chargers near highway ramps and level 2 chargers at hotel lodging when on a long trip, but they will also need to have other things to go on. \n\nDC public fast chargers are harder on the grid in some ways and cost more to install and operate than level 2 chargers, so they are generally more expensive to charge at. Doing this occasionally is fine by the person who does this occasionally while they charge mostly at home, but for those who must rely on public charging, they may want to seek out cheaper charging and that's where there might be an exchange of time and where other kinds of public charging situations might arise like level 2 workplace parking charging (fantastic for a place you regularly go to and park for several hours a day) OR the retail center kind of charging that Tavares is talking about. That retail center kind of charging could take the form of DC fast charging whether at very high rates at 350 kW or higher or towards the bottom at 50 kW. It can also take the form of slower AC charging. Note that in Europe, 22 kW AC charging is not that uncommon so stopping by the gym or a restaurant for an hour and getting upwards of 20 kWh of charging is a very usable amount of range and can be well worth it. The recently adopted NACS in North America also allows for about 22 kW AC charging with 277 V at 80A though it's unclear if automakers will be rolling out vehicles to accommodate such.",

Nah, humans want their own cars.\n\nDo humans want the world to die from global climate change?  \n\nDoes it actually matter what humans want?\n\nTesla has no incentive to work on mass transit.  They're a car company.  As such, they will push whatever narrative / propaganda necessary to ensure they sell more cars.  It really is that simple.   \n\nIn being a car company, they're about as far away from a real sustainable solution as one can get (no cars are sustainable)... even if Musk claims that Tesla has done more for the environment than any company on Earth (they haven't) and that by extension in being that company's CEO has done more for the environment than any human on the Earth. \n\nNew York's public transit system has replaced far more cars and emissions than Musk or Tesla ever has... for example.  China's and Japan's railway systems as an even bigger example.  Bike producers do FAR more per passenger mile to reduce emissions.\n\nIn regions with solid well used public transit systems, people may not love everything about using public transit, but they certainly do use it instead of a car.\n\nWhen I was last in Chicago, hopping on the train to get from my hotel to an event was great.  What was bad was the way back when some homeless dude was smoking, drinking, and spitting... yes spitting... all over the train.\n\nFrankly though, that isn't a problem that can't be solved with properly enforced public transit code of conduct, and a larger workforce / security force to deal with those who aren't willing to follow the rules.",

"comment": "Absolutely solar is viable in Seattle! I actually know of hundreds of people in the Seattle area with solar on their homes. There are several reasons that it works well.\n\nFirst of all, current state incentives make payback periods very short (4-5 years). The **state actually pays you $0.54/kWh**, up to $5,000 per year, for power you produce with Washington-made panels and inverters. If you use out-of-state (and less expensive) panels and inverters, they will still pay you $0.15/kWh. This is ON TOP of the net metering credit you'll get, which averages about $0.10/kWh in Western Washington right now, and the federal 30% tax credit.\n\nIt's also important to note that **it doesn't rain in Seattle all the time**. Primarily in the winter it is cloudy, but the sun is low in the winter anyway, and the days are short, so it doesn't really matter that much. But it's **almost always clear in the summer**, so when the sun is high in the sky, and the days are twice as long, there are no clouds, and you get a huge amount of production.\n\nOn top of that, it rarely gets particularly hot in Seattle. This is helpful because solar cells are more efficient at cooler temperatures. A rooftop solar array in Seattle will produce more power on a summer day than an identical array in Arizona, for example, because of these factors.\n\nThe result of all of this is that in Seattle you can expect to get about 1,100 to 1,200 kWh per year for each kW of installed capacity. This is a little lower than the efficiency you'll see in California, but it's still within the realm of \"viable\".\n\nBecause Washington utilities have net metering, you can bank all that extra power you generate in the summer to run your heat pump and heat your house in the winter.\n\nIf you have more questions about solar in the Seattle area, please feel free to join our Facebook group to ask questions: \"Seattle Solar Homeowners\"\n\nYou can also ask more questions here, obviously.",

"comment": "Hold on a second there. This got me curious, so I picked up the nearest dictionary at hand (a Merriam-Webster app) and looked up the word \"vegan\". I was surprised at how simplistic the definition was. Basically that a vegan, according to them, was 1) a vegetarian who didn't eat any animal products, or, 2) someone who refrained from using animal products such as fur or leather. According to definition 1, someone could be hunting deer for their hide, but as long as they didn't eat meat, eggs or dairy, they're vegan. Even many mainstream 'omnivores' could tell you that's plainly incorrect.\n\nGranting that words can change use over time, there also isn't a guarantee that a dictionary definition is right. Not how often dictionaries and style guides disagree to see examples of this.\n\nFurther, dictionaries are really not the place to go for nuanced discussions of ethics and philosophy. Look up the definitions of any religion, atheism, or philosophical concept and you'll find a similar lack of depth.\n\nAlso remember veganism is a minority position, and you're using a mainstream resource written by majority opinion (which tends to be threatened by and misunderstand veganism) as a reference. This is a bit like asking a representative from your coal power company to tell you all the benefits of putting solar panels on your roof; they're unlikely to be versed in it to start with and to whatever extent they are, they may be threatened by it, so you probably won't get the best answer.\n\nFinally, if all you're interested in is the dictionary definition, why did you ask the question here?",

"comment": "Micro inverters are fine if they feed directly to a breaker as they were designed and aren't plugged into an outlet.  Plugging an inverter into a wall outlet changes the situation considerably.\n\nA circuit breaker limits the amount of current available in a branch circuit.  If you use a solar panel and and backfeed/use a plug to add more current to a circuit, the wires of a circuit can be overloaded.  Even though it is unlikely, it would be possible to plug an unlimited number of solar panels into one 15amp branch circuit.  If there wasn't any load on the circuit, the electricity would feed back through the branch circuits breaker until it tripped from an overload condition(heat).  The wire would be protected by the breaker.  Add loads to that same circuit, and less than 100% of the electricity would never make it back to the breaker to protect the circuit.  An extreme example would be multiple solar panels plugged into one 15 amp branch circuit, and multiple electric resistance heaters plugged into the same circuit. The resistance heaters could prevent any of the electricity from making it back to the breaker.  The current on the 14 gauge wire could be massive.  Nothing is protecting the wire.  ( Just thought of some of this.)",

(manufacturing and building)\n\n[$100,000-$175,000 depending on the location, and how much site modification is needed at a particular location.](http://insideevs.com/tech-crunch-what-it-takes-to-be-a-tesla-supercharger-partner/)\n\n----------------------------\n\n&gt; Are there any competitors in this domain? or are they to far behind?\n\nThere are 616 Supercharger stations with 3644 plugs. There are nearly 60,000 public chargers not operated by Tesla. The US Department of Energy has [a map of 32324 of them](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html) in the US that is a good place to search through. 1672 of these stations with 3563 plugs are DC quick chargers, which are essentially non-Tesla \"superchargers\".\n\n----------------------------\n\n&gt; Do the solar powered superchargers have the same output as the regular superchargers?\n\nNo EV chargers are solar powered. They may have solar panels to feed into batteries or into the power grid installed at the same location, but even a huge amount of solar panels won't put out enough watts to charge an electric car battery in a reasonable time.\n\n----------------------------\n\n&gt; Does tesla have battery swapping stations?\n\nThey set up an experimental station or two in California, primarily to take advantage of a tax credit on vehicles with swappable batteries. The program was never expanded for a variety of reasons, including practicality, cost, and low interest among Tesla car owners.\n\n----------------------------\n\n&gt; Is there any other company building superchargers?\n\nThere are many companies building DC quick chargers that any compatible EV or plug-in hybrid can use. You'll find them in the map I linked above. Supercharger is a trademark of Tesla and only available for Tesla's two vehicles. \n\n----------------------------\n\n&gt; What is the most efficient charging station to date?\n\nYou'd first have to define your metric for efficiency before someone else can measure against it.",

Your net metering allowance includes some of the non-generation fees.\n\nYou are probably on the right track to do a monthly calculation (each month) like you show for March and apply it to you system's measured output. That should get you closer to your avoided cost. If there is a tiered rate structure - and I thought some Eversource territories have it - it might be a little more complicated. About a year ago I remember seeing a bill with generation charges for the first level (under 500 kWh? don't remember) and another charge for the amount above that.",

"comment": "One concept I find useful is the levelized cost of storage, which ranges from $0.08/kwh - $0.20/kwh+, with FLA being around $0.16/kwh.\n\nLike solar, you won't get many buyers until the levelized cost is about half the retail value (i.e. 10 year payback on a 20 year investment).  \n\nWhen you look at most TOU plans across the country (high-priced electricity markets excluded), there's quite a range, and you're lucky to find a TOU differential of 20 cents per kwh. Which is usually only available on weekdays during the summer (35% of the year). In m paper napking opion, residential batteries need to be around $0.04/kwh before they become mainstream. This is actually possible within 10 years time, so its good to get your battery game going now.\n\nCommercial demand management, where the business has a short-term spike in use, rather than a full-day load profile, are the best applications of batteries. Grid-assist is also an interesting design strategy in anti-solar areas. Still hard to make work economically outside of your most extreme cases, but alot of residential battery buyers right now are more luxury customers rather than economic ones.\n\nCalifornia has a 30% battery subsidy which adds the the federal tax credit of 30% when appropriately designed with a solar array. Combined with high demand prices and some extreme TOU differentials, it's the only real battery market for the time being.\n\nEnphase has a storage solution, but you have to be careful. Many battery solutions are not designed for off-grid living, or even substantial battery back-up, but rather to take advantage of demand-based rate structures (as they're the most economic application of the technology).",

"comment": "I really loved the car when I got to see it two years ago! It's definitely moving in the direction of being as practical as a fully solar-powered car can be. More importantly, though, Eindhoven is really promoting renewable energy with their project, as are all of us solar car engineers, but Eindhoven has one of the best, if not the best, outreach and public awareness campaigns ever by a solar car team. Three of the biggest things against Stella's widespread use by your typical eccentric billionaire are:\n\n1) She isn't as comfortable as commercial luxury vehicles (which is an issue for wide-spread use, due to the cost of construction) both in terms of internal design (though it is really great by solar car standards!) and in climate control. She also lacks a lot of safety features that have become standard. As someone who has driven the super-aerodynamic solar cars, though, I would much rather drive Stella day-to-day. \n\n2) The solar cells have basically no protection from the environment. You can't even touch them without people freaking out about it! And the cost to replace a damaged solar module is really expensive and time consuming. This is necessary to get the power (~1500W) necessary to drive the car at reasonable speeds, though.\n\n3) It isn't the sexiest design ever. Don't get me wrong, I love the look of the car from an engineering standpoint, and the internal layout and instrumentation are fantastic, but it isn't the look of a normal luxury car, which is important to a lot of people. Personally, though, I'd love to have a car that the team behind Eindhoven designed.\n\nOne important thing, however, is that the regulations for the 2017 competition that the next Stella iteration will be racing in have removed restrictions on battery capacity. Therefore, all three issues that I outlined above could, theoretically, be addressed, and I am willing to bet that Eindhoven is taking a shot at it. However, at a certain point, the car will get to the point where the solar panels don't contribute much to the car, just like with a more traditional car design. I fully expect, however that the engineers working on the car will optimize around the regulations and unveil a very nice car later this year that is both practical and has phenomenal range.\n\nI'm personally hoping to be able to see the 2017 Stella in person in October! Though I would not complain if another team comes in and beats her in the main competition for the first time ;)",

"comment": "Yes, it's very cheap if you don't mind using it six hours per day on average and going days at a time without it. In other words, it's cheap if you ignore all the costs associated with intermittency. Before you challenge me on this, understand that I've been trying to make a solar farm happen as the primary electricity source for a rural community for the better part of a decade. When the costs of intermittency are accounted for, it just isn't competitive. I would love for solar power to be the panacea its supporters believe it to be. Unfortunately, it just isn't.\n\n/u/knappis, let's examine your editorialized headline. Oil is used for transportation and plastics. Only in rare cases is it used for electricity production. But do you know what intermittent producers need? Backup generation. How is that most often provided? Via natural gas. Who are the largest natural gas producer? Big Oil. \n\nIn other words, wind and solar are great boons for Big Oil and competition for Big Coal. Your headline, though, misrepresents that reality, though.",

A new roof with lifetime warranty shingles is $12k (plus whatever wood/decking needs to be replaced) and the rooftop solar would be $27k ($18k after incentives). Both systems were quoted at about 10kw.\n\nAs you can see, going with a traditional setup saved me $12k-$15k. If money was no object, I would’ve splurged on the solar tiles. But I assume their cost will come down, and that money I saved is put to better use in an investment account than premium tiles.\n\nI would consider the tiles again in 20-25 years, depending on cost and the longevity of my asphalt shingle roof and rooftop solar setup.",

"comment": "If he was talking about a decent price point bump from QCELL to Panasonic/LG/Sunpower level, maybe, but he was quoting 305s not 320s. A roughly 10% increase in efficiency would probably wipe out your bill, which I think its worth it. \n\nYour price point is way expensive for QCELL 305s though. It would be expensive for the top panels tbh (depending on the financing fees, although most of those gimicky low APR deals are around 12-15% fees, so still expensive depending on your market)\n\nIf someone offered 305s to our customers today at that price I'd laugh. Shop around, let us know what you find, feel free to ask any questions.",

"comment": "Hello all, looks like we are buying a house with a 20 yr SolarCity lease here in Colorado. One area that confuses me is the net metering credits which may accumulate if we use less than the system produces. Are these credits that we get to use to offset future usage or does SolarCity capture all our credits? For example, do we pay Xcel (power company) for night usage even after a day of high solar production?  Do we get any storage?\n\nThanks for your help.",

The perfect solution really depends on how much capacity you use and how long those \"3KW\" peaks last. IF they are very brief, a smaller battery that charges capacitors that you use for the 3KW peaks would probably work, though the electrical system design would be complex.",

"comment": "&gt;So I could get the power bank now, charge it off the grid and look at solar later. Is a battery needed in your setup if I am in fact charging a battery in the power bank? Like if I got the panel first (even a few postible ones) and then the battery later is that impossible to achieve what I want or not recommended?\n\nYes, you can't really use solar without some form of storage because the power fluctuates easily over timespans of seconds... Your inverter for instance wouldn't like the input voltage fluctuating wildly due to clouds or haze or whatever flying overhead.  \n\nA common mistake beginners make is buying small and then finding out their small purchases are not expandable.  For instance, buying say a 80Ah AGM and then wanting to add more later.  You really shouldn't mix battery types or sizes.  So then you throw out the 80Ah battery and buy [say] 100Ah batteries, etc.  Same with your charge controller.  You can find PWMs for cheap but then you'll quickly learn they suck so then you throw that out and buy a proper MPPT, etc...\n\nAs for AGMs vs lifepo/etc... it depends on what you want it for.  AGMs are great for UPS applications but not good for routine cycling (e.g. not great for a \"powerwall\").  For instance, I have 12kWh of AGMs that sit 24/7 floating (I have a DC-DC converter to supplement my solar to ensure they float all the time even in Canadian winters...).  but in my setup the AGMs are a backup if the grid goes down (which doesn't happen too often but it does happen).  \n\nI would go AGM vs flooded too since they're much easier to live with.  If you never really plan to go \"huge\" I'd go with\n\n- 100W 18VDC mono panel\n- 100V/50A MPPT\n- 100Ah AGM\n- 1kW pure sine inverter\n\nThe panels aren't that expensive and you'd be able to add a couple more easily (2 or 3 in series will net you &lt;70VDC).  A 100V/50A MPPT will allow you to grow modestly for instance up to 600W with 12V batteries.  The 100Ah AGM is a common enough size that you'd be able to parallel up more as you go.  \n\nanyways tl;dr; you'll waste more money buying small and then replacing repeatedly.  Buy things with an eye to upgradeability in the future.",

They're expensive, and switching everyone over to Time-of-Use (TOU) billing this year (source: [https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/feb/21/sdge-start-new-time-use-billing-system/](https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/feb/21/sdge-start-new-time-use-billing-system/) ), which means you'll be paying more for electricity during peak (afternoon) times. West-facing solar panels can help mitigate that a bit. \n\nStill, your 316 kWh is really low usage. To make that much electricity in San Diego, you only need about a 2.9-kW solar system (maybe 7 or 8 standard panels). That's fine, but because of the small size, you'll be paying a higher cost per watt. \n\nThe best way to actually suss out whether your savings are worth it is to get multiple quotes for solar and see what companies offer you. At that system size, I'd assume a cost of something like $3.75/watt or more.  It should still pay the cost back within 10 years or so, with an additional 15 years of production after payback.",

Only the USA is even close!).  \nNatural CO2 is also rising, and there's not one single thing humans can do about it. \n\nFossil fuels are not going anywhere until something can actually replace them. Not fake replace, actual replace. Even then? All those solar panels are made of coal, and wind farms require tons of fossil fuels to make... of course that never gets counted in the \"CO2 output\" of \"green power\". Not once.",

"comment": "This isn’t true by any stretch of the imagination. Variable cost wise wind and solar are cheaper but there is a lot of extra cost associated with this generation the ends up going to natural gas. The wind isn’t always blowing and the sun isn’t always shining, but your fridge can’t go out - renewables are intermittent. Batteries can solve this problem, but right now it’s natural gas generation in most areas. Also new build wise, gas is the cheapest when you remove subsidies. I tend to think that the return on investment is higher for gas as well save subsidies, though I’m not sure. Fossil fuel plants can sell capacity whereas wind and solar cannot.\n\nOil hasn’t been economic in the us for power generation for over a decade save for some very cold spouts in New England - meaning that power sector use of oil is an immaterial part of total demand. \n\nI love renewables and am all for them, but 100% renewable is a long way off unless you do it at a local level (rooftop solar + battery backup). The federal government is heavily subsidizing this now, and frankly I see this as the #1 way to reduce emissions. \n\nAlso, if you drive, it’s highly likely you’re using oil, that is unless you drive an electric car. Tesla is obviously trying to change this, but wide scale adoption of EVs is going to take a lot of time.",

Sorry to be blunt, but if you're asking this sort of question you're going to need to learn a *lot* to do this. Go spend a few dozen hours reading the archives over at the DIY Electric Car forums if you want to have a better understanding of how this stuff works. You're missing key background information that is needed to ask intelligent questions about what you are trying to do. It's a laudable goal, just complex and a really unexplored corner of the market, probably because general purpose battery storage is still relatively rare with solar in the first place.",

Though I wouldn't take a shower after say... 3pm..\n\nIf the sun is up you have access to a lot more power with AC coupled systems (like powerwall or ensemble) than you would with a DC coupled systems... as the battery will help support the load if the solar isn't producing enough, of course you want to minimize how often that happens since you still need the batteries to fully charge daily...",

"comment": "You're not wrong at all in a general sense. However, just like a tax break for donations or (in a way) one for electric vehicles or one for solar panels, in this instance it's more of an incentive for general good/planet-health than it is just \"not paying taxes for that important societal feature I don't use\". Big difference, so maybe it should not be called a tax-break at all for clarity. How you'd ever control it though, I have no clue.",

The software seems okay now from an end user's perspective who hasn't seen a code review. From my years as an IT security  professional, this concerns me.\n\nI knew nothing about solar power at the time, so I went with my installer's recommendation. \n\nSolaredge isn't going to address this issue until installers stop recommending and installing Solaredge. \n\nOne of the times my installer's serviceman were here replacing optimizers, we got talking and they said they wouldn't put Solaredge in their home. They would likely go with Enphase from what they see in the field. \n\nFrom my experience with my Solaredge gear, if any of my friend's or neighbor's asked me about solar power, I would tell them I wouldn't go with Solaredge. And yes, I am worried about their flaky software and my battery burning my house down.  My installer has told me about the built in fire extinguisher, but I worry it is controlled by their software.\n\nSigned, a worried Solaredge home owner.",

"comment": "I mean you're entirely right we are on an upward trend and what you say about renewables is also true in that they hardly pollute once they are built. However, the old horse scenario meant you stepped in poop everyday but now we just outsource the raw materials and manufacturing to some other country so we don't have to deal with the aftermath in our backyard! Since renewables are generally much less energy dense than fossil fuels, we now have to acquire that much more raw materials to meet our demand. Now we only have to acquire it once and hopefully we can recycle a lot of it but if you factored in expected lifespan then I wonder where the tipping point in that equation would be. It's why I still like nuclear energy, it's a lot of energy up front but it is also very energy dense so it becomes reasonably efficient over the long term. \n\nI remember about 10 years ago when I was building a cogen we had a summer engineering student do a study for his work experience that compared the viability of building the cogen vs a nuclear reactor. The cost was so high for the reactor it would take 40 years to come out ahead. A couple caveats though is that this was a fairly small cogen ~80MW and being a cogen it was basically waste steam they were generated anyway. \n\nAnother thing that I've noticed is over our human development we seem to be able to keep solving these more complex issues but we also create more complex unintended consequences. Back in the days of horses, you could hire a bunch of people to shovel manure all day. Nowadays, how do you stop pollution? It's definitely not a simple answer like it is with a shovel and some closed sewers. What kind of problem are we going to develop with the proliferation of renewables? The big one I worry about is water and mining. I know our current consumption uses a ton of water too so maybe if that ramps down then we can use that water for the creation of the silicon wafers in solar panels and we might even come out ahead! I really don't know, I just don't think that when a jurisdiction installs batteries on their grid they go \"how much water did we use in Bolivia for this\" vs \"who has the best price\".",

Should be cheaper than utility scale solar in that roof  work is needed anyway, and no additional support structure is required.

I honestly don't remember what they charged for installation, or if it was built into the price per battery, but I do remember they mentioned that I got an additional $3.5k discount for purchasing the powerwalls in addition to solar panels as some of the installation and system design costs would have covered both.  This was two years ago in 2021 and I am not sure of the pricing now.",

"comment": "I don’t think your as knowledgeable about this as you think . First of all it’s not just because enough haven’t been built yet , they just don’t create enough power those wind turbines produce 2-3 megawatts each & the largest solar farm in the world is like 650 megawatts a nuclear power plant can generate 4000 megawatts, \nit’s not that I’m pro nuclear I’m just saying what is most likely going to happen after this doesn’t work out. I actually prefer the natural gas over nuclear, but In the last 20 years they have shut down many large power plants all up & down the west coast which has taken thousands of megawatts away from the grid , they did this while building smaller combined cycle natural gas plants that don’t produce as much power & actually need more maintenance than the big steam turbines. They sold this idea to the public as the newer turbines being more efficient which they are but your still falling behind on total megawatts. It’s all a scam & big companies are making a fortune from this & eventually they will come out with the next phase which I believe will be nuclear & they will continue to get richer . Of course Nuclear has issues with the used fuel rods but you get way more time & power out of it. the solar panels are getting better but the life span is still short, same with the wind& when you see those blades aren’t spinning for weeks & months at a time it’s more than simple maintenance & when 20% of the farm is spinning then you know it’s not any of the other reason you listed . I didn’t come here to argue about it I was responding to oPs question of if we will become net zero in our lifetime & the answer is clearly no. As long as a lot of people are making a lot of money We will go backwards before we go forward . Time will tell , we will see what happens, it doesn’t matter to me I work on all the different turbines from wind/solar to natural gas / coal & nuclear I’ve seen some things in the industry & the politicians are playing games .",

My buddy had a perfect 17 year old architechtual shingle roof and they made him change his when it could have easily lasted 25 years.  I do roofing (low slope) for a living and know it could have lasted longer, but thats the concern I have with them making us replace our roofs sooner.",

"comment": "“The concepts of animals or the animalistic become a sort of conceptual dumping ground for all the features of ourselves that we don’t like and want to expel from our definition of “the human”: irrationality, instinct, emotion, ignorance, the body in a word, precariousness...\n\nWherever the human is, it is always outside itself in the non-human, or it is always distributed among beings, among human and non-human beings, chiasmatically related through the idea of precarious life. So we can neither lodge the human in the self, nor ground the self in the human, but find instead the relations of exposure and responsibility that constitute the ‘being’ of the human in a sociality outside itself, even outside its human-ness.\" - Judith Butler\nRegardless of the power and vitalism of these contemporary ethical approaches, however, I do not think we will find some final salvation in subjective and highly convoluted explorations of ethics and post-humanities that, if they were just delivered with sufficient conviction or eloquence, would somehow magically suffice to turn the world vegan, to free all non-human animals – and human ones too - from captivity, that would stop the logging trucks in their tracks and shut down the polluting power plants and still the oil pumps and lift plastic from the ocean and divert food to the needy and replace all GMO's and monocrops with permaculture gardens and liberate the voices of all oppressed and marginalised peoples around the globe.\n\nNo. What we need are not more sophisticated ethical arguments. What we need is much more simple.\n\n\n\nSOLUTIONS:\nWe need to radicalize our thinking and challenge all of our sacred cows. Single issue campaigns, of which animal rights in isolation from issues of social and ecological justice is a prime exemplar, regardless of what people like Gary Francione might say, are, as we saw, a set of performances legitimated by and legitimating the very system that needs to be dismantled. Petitions and protests can serve to raise awareness, but unless they are coupled with an appeal for real, radical action, undertaken on behalf of the entire biocommunity, they merely serve to reproduce themselves, just as we saw during the unprecedentedly vast street marches that arose in opposition to the war in Iraq several years ago; millions of marchers had no impact on US imperialism then and they have no impact now. Power concedes nothing without a real demand and the performance of a demand is not a real demand.\n\nAn effective campaign is more like class struggle. Not in the sense that unionised Marxists need to seize the means of production in some kind of proletarian moment of divine redemption, but in the sense that we need to expand the boundaries of our class – the class of the exploited – to include all other life on Earth and position the full force of every moment of every life in the swelled ranks of this enlarged proletariat against the systems - and if necessary those who refuse to disengage from them - that continue to oppress us.\n\nSteve Best has said that:\n\n\"Victims of oppression cannot advance by oppressing and victimizing others.\" - Steve Best\n\nI would add that they cannot advance by ignoring the oppression and victimization of others either.\n\nMany former Animal Liberation Front'ers recognised this in the 1990's; they became the Earth Liberation Front. There is but a single short, necessary step to be taken by those of us who allow ourselves to fully accept the implications of animal liberation from the exceptionalism of the ALF to the inclusive justice of the ELF and beyond.\n\nWe cannot hide behind the rhetoric of fundamentalist pacifism any longer either. Violence is only violence in context. The violence an abuser enacts against his victim is not the same as the violence his victim enacts against her abuser. The violence – which is almost always more accurately seen as property damage – that is enacted against the destructive, soul-destroying machineries of capitalism and the State is not the same as the violence enacted by capitalism and the State against each and all of us, human and non-human alike.\n\nIndeed, these dogmatic, overly-simplistic prohibitions to act serve only to facilitate our oppression and our right to extensional self-defense against great ongoing violence, and they operate only within the context of complete denial. The suffragettes knew this. So did the Black Panthers. So did the Native North American peoples. So did umkhontho we Sizwe. So did the Indian fighters against colonialist rule, no matter what you think Gandhi might have said.\n\nAs Ward Churchill says in his book, Pacifism As Pathology:\n\n“The desire for a non-violent society is the healthiest of all psychological manifestations. It seems the height of contradiction, therefore, that we should need to break with this in order to achieve it. Therein, however, may lie our only hope.” - Ward Churchill\n\nI do not wish to fetishize violence, but if we are to be effective we can no longer flippantly dismiss anything beyond peaceful placard-waving as somehow antithetical to our ends, as a priori wrong. We cannot deny the possibility that at some point violence will be necessary; the more we discuss the implications of this now, the more successfully we will be able to absorb its impact then.",

I don't think there is enough information available to know that veganism can be very healthy - but nothing to say small amounts of meat aren't fine.\n\n&gt; an aversion to needing something to be killed in order for you to eat it, but plant matter is alive at one point as well. \n\nSentience though.. there is a reason that brain death suffices to call a human dead even if the other organs are still flowing. We say we grieve the death of the human, but really it's the death of the brain... once that shuts down it's completely legal to let the human die. So plants being alive is not entirely relevant to vegan interests... \n\n&gt;  It all just a transference of energy, and I see no problem with taking caloric energy from a life-form in order to grow and eventually have my nutrients and caloric energy put back in the ground and have the cycle start all over again.\n\nOk. Then why not humans? Because humans are sentient....?",

"comment": "Good point. The people in China, for the most part, eat much less animal protein than Americans. Many people in China are also smaller (not just height). Certainly there is a genetic component to their smaller size, but I also think there is a dietary component. A vegan eating whole foods will be smaller than they would be if they ate the standard American diet. So being isolated from other Americans for two weeks -- then seeing them from a distance in the airport -- was like seeing a monster from a horror movie. The western people (not cowboys) in the airport all looked bloated and unnaturally puffed up. My immediate thought when I saw them was \"unnaturally bloated appearance = too much animal protein and fat in their diet\". I believe this makes sense, as the people I know who are vegan do not have that typical bloated appearance that most Americans have (oh, I expect to get downvoted for this statement!)....",

I'm a college student myself, a double major, and one of my majors is music which takes up a lot of time. Yet, I still find that I don't wind up eating animal products, and I always eat home-cooked healthy meals. It's possible.

"comment": "Tiramisu can seem a little daunting but if you break it down in steps it's totally manageable. \nHow was the recipe you tried a failure? Did it fall apart? The first thing you want to think about is the lady fingers. There are a few brands that are vegan (Roland makes one I know of for sure) - or you can make your own. Either way I recommend really letting these dry out ( if you live somewhere like new mexico just leave them out overnight - if you live somewhere like florida put them in your oven on a super low setting for an hour or so).\n\n\nYou also want to make sure your coffee/liquor soak is cold cold cold when you start. For your \"mascarpone\" you want to use recipe that's going to make something thick. When I make it usually puree tofu with a couple packages of Dr.Whitaker vanilla pudding AND vegan cream cheese (plus sugar and other goodies). You want the consistency to be something you have to spread (not pour).\n\nSo lay everything out. Lady Finger, Soak, Mascarpone, and Shake (Cocoa, cinnamon, whatever you like). Line your pan/ dish with parchment if you plan on serving single servings and build away. I'd then let this sit in the fridge for no less than overnight. A few hours before you plan on serving it top the whole thing with chocolate ganche and let sit again for a couple hours. When you're ready to cut it get a pitcher of super hot water and let you knife sit in it for a few minutes. After every few cuts dip your knife back in the water to clean it off. If a few slices don't come out perfect - don't fret - top everything with the forgiver of all - chocolate shavings!!\n\nHope this helps some.",

An ethical vegetarian is taking steps towards it. Dairy and eggs are not as direct as meat is, and if you have got your own chickens eggs are not that ethically compromising. \n\nLook, not everyone has the same ethical rules and guidelines for themselves. My husband agrees with me on a lot of things but sometimes he still eats meat, dairy, eggs etc. \n\nWhy should we get annoyed with ethical vegetarians? They've obviously not made the connection between ethical living and dairy/eggs we have. That doesn't mean they are less ethical according to their own ethics. How we see the world isn't always how others view it. The best thing we can do is inspire people to make the connections and show them that being vegan is really not more difficult than being vegetarian.",

As a meat eater I had never had bean burgers, hummus, guacamole, soy beans, and now I love them as much as I liked putting chicken in salads, eating beef burgers etc. Maybe make some tasters of some traditionally non-meat meals (I find fake meat meals aren't particularly good at capturing the palette of a meat eater). Colourful meals work really well too, with plenty of deep reds from kidney Beans, lucious greens from avocado, etc.\n\nShowing pictures of dead animals kinda made me think vegans were a bit crazy. Negative reinforcement doesn't really work.",

That's really what I was driving at. I think the argument against secondhand stuff is questionable, though. While it's true it takes away support from true vegan alternatives it still doesn't create a direct demand for new versions unless somehow all of the secondhand items get snatched up, which seems pretty unlikely to me. Either way, I'll happily agree to disagree.\n\n&gt; Veganism doesn't really concern itself with resource usage. If it used 1/10th the resources to use a new animal product rather than a new plant or synthetic product, vegans would still abstain from the animal product.\n\nI agree, but only to an extent. If veganism were economically less viable (e.g. it cost significantly more than omnivorous living, for example) I think that would mean significantly fewer people would be vegan. While I don't think it's super relevant to evaluate the resources invested in, say, a pair of wool socks, if it created 100 times more pollution resulting in more deaths of humans and animals alike, I think it might be arguable. I guess what I'm trying to say is, it matters on a macro level but less so on a micro level.",

Sometimes someone can read about cruelty, or listen to someone talk about it... but once they actually see a video is when it \"clicks\" to them. This is how it went down for me. For a while I realized that, \"killing animals is wrong for food\"... but it never really clicked for me so I still ate animals, but than while I was scrolling through Twitter, a video on my feed was someone axing a pig to death and than I instantly stopped eating meat. Seeing the murder is what made it click. \n\nPersonally, watching a health documentary wouldn't have done shit for me because even going into veganism, I was under the misconception that it was an unhealthy diet... and before I was vegan, I didn't even care about my health. Probably 6 months into veganism is when I really started getting into nutrition.",

It's very strange (I will admit I still crave cheese sometimes, but I've found some alternatives that taste 100% the exact same). Depending on where you live, there are some great chicken substitutes out there... Gardein and President's Choice both have really good stuff. As for milk, try cashew milk! To me, that tastes the most similar to cow's milk, but better — fatty and creamy. I would also recommend googling some recipes for vegan alternatives to your favourite foods. If you need any specific recommendations, feel free to pm me! Good luck! You're doing the right thing and are gonna feel so good after just a lil while :)",

Aren't there movies or documentary films out there that focus on the positive attributes of a vegan diet as opposed to the animal cruelty involved in a non vegan diet? \n\nIt just seems to me that it's a lame stance for a documentary to take, kind of a politician saying vote for me because that guy supports terrorism and a vote for him is as good as murdering children. Or a preacher spouting off about you going to hell if you don't believe in god.\n\nAs a buddy of mine pointed out, unless you personally grow everything you can't guarantee animals were unharmed. Take almond milk, almonds are pretty aggressively treated with pesticides and to pollinate the trees they often have to migrate a hive which has something like a 30% mortality rate and it leaves 5% or so bees behind.",

"comment": "I eat a whole foods, plant based diet. You can find specific nutrition information about it [here](http://nutritionfacts.org/). The same doctor who puts together that website has a book titled [How Not to Die](http://nutritionfacts.org/book) that’s a good read.\n\nWhat I eat daily varies a bit. I always have peanut butter on nut toast for breakfast, mostly because I freaking love peanut butter. I cook large pots of food every 3-4 days and eat the leftovers for lunch and dinner. This will usually be chilli, pasta, quinoa, or something fancier when I have longer to cook on weekends. Yesterday I made some super badass stuffed squash that I’m looking forward to eating again tonight. I eat tons and tons of veggies and beans.\n\nI went vegetarian before vegan, then switched to vegan when I learned more about the dairy and egg industry. I used a lot of the [meat]( http://fieldroast.com/) [substitutes]( http://www.tofurky.com/) that you commonly find in stores when I first went vegetarian. Now I don’t use those at all; the bulk of my protein comes from legumes. I have a far easier time getting protein now than I ever did when I was using animal products.\n\nCheck out [How Not to Die]( http://nutritionfacts.org/book) (same link as above), and the [thirty day vegan challenge](http://www.the30dayveganchallenge.com/fe/29373-30-day-vegan-challenge). Colleen Patrick-Goodreau also has a great podcast called [Food For Thought](http://www.joyfulvegan.com/podcast) where she talks about all sorts of different vegan issues and how to live a happy, compassionate vegan lifestyle.",

"comment": "Sure, and we should all provide our kids with knowledge and moral guidance in an age-appropriate way, but comfort and reassurance comes first. At the young age that this storybook seems intended for, the way to teach children about morality is by teaching them to give and receive empathy, mostly by showing it to them ourselves. It is counterproductive to that goal to deny them empathy by inflicting something on them that they are not developmentally capable of dealing with, especially as the adult who is supposed to be protecting them from that stress and pain. \n\nTelling your kids what meat is and taking them fishing isn't upsetting if the parent isn't upset because kids are wired to respond to their parent's emotional cues, though personally I actually did find those things pretty upsetting as a kid. I remember learning about eggs, and how much I needed my parents to reassure me about it and tell me that the baby chicks were going to be ok and hold me while I cried (and I still became a vegetarian at age 8, which they fully supported). I can't imagine if instead of doing that, my parents had said to me \"yes actually, their deaths are violent and sad\" or whatever.",

Provided school/ work has no issue with you taking a very quick snack break or eating while you're working or studying then that shouldnt be an issue. Always have a good protein source (tofu, tempeh, seitan etc) with your meals, make sure you eat regular good meals, dont skip meals and ALWAYS have a protein source handy. Protein will balance you out more than carbs will, carbs will give you a quick sugar spike and then you will crash again, but with protein you will find your levels much more stable.\n\nSource: Husband has idiopathic hypoglycemia, been dealing with his blood sugars for years.",

Your third point is an issue with tax laws not so much with capitalism.  \n\nBut also don’t forget capitalism is a large reasons we have beyond burgers at Carl’s Jr., vegan options more readily available in cities, vegan specific clothing, skincare products, and products as well as larger selections of plant mills and hummus all across the board. It’s not always a case or “capitalism bad” but a quagmire of competing ethical considerations.",

"comment": "I used to love cheese. Now I make my own nut cheeses and they're awesome too. They definitely scratch the itch.\n\nI don't know of one vegan cheese that does everything dairy cheese does but there are fantastic ones out there. If you're looking mostly for flavour, you want an air dried and aged nut cheese, from someone like Tyne Cheese (UK based) - a small producer. They're more expensive but have the fermented taste of a real cheese. If you want one that melts and stretches, look for one with carrageenan in the ingredients. If you want a goat-type cheese, strain some soya yogurt in a cheese cloth for 24 hours, beat in some nooch and salt, then chill.\n\nMy cheese Bible is Miyoko Schinner's [Artisan Vegan Cheese](https://g.co/kgs/ksqS84). Making your own is easy and you can customise to get exactly what you want. It's also a lot healthier than the gross, rubbery commercial vegan cheeses.",

We also focus on issues like pollution, global hunger, and the well-being of livestock workers. The general position of vegans is: if you are able to make the choice (i.e. barring survival and food desert situations), you should be vegan. This means that the least amount of suffering possible will occur. To address your questions, we do not support hunting or eating insects, because they are sentient or at least experience suffering when hurt or killed.",

Plus, I don't get a dry mouth in the morning after it like I did after the previous one, so the new medicine is working out better. I know I have to come to terms with things that threaten my health sometimes and I have to prevent it, but a few days of insomnia won't kill me",

"comment": "I'm still a baby vegan at only 3 and a half years, and I'm sad my adoption was rather slow, but I'm here to stay. I have seen in my short time as a vegan the \"ex-vegan\" influencer trend on and off, usually precipitated by some viral news story about veganism. It does seem that many people who struggle to stick with it are, as you pointed out, motivated primarily by health and will quickly jump ship at even a possibility of any health issue (little to no attempts made to resolve it as a vegan), often going from an extremely restrictive version of a plant based diet to full on raw carnivore, fast food feeder, or drinking their own pee. As someone else mentioned, this often changes with shifts in perceived ideas of purity and naturalness. These really dramatic diet shifts could be indicative of preexisting mental health issues surrounding food before \"going vegan\" (it's not uncommon for people with eating disorders to claim to be vegan so as to lower suspicion of why they won't eat publicly).\n\nBecause veganism is seen as extreme in most cultures, it also attracts people who wish to feel special or are prone to adopting controversial ideas (because of their controversy rather than merit). YouTube's algorithm loves this kind of dramatic influencer content because it gets a lot of clicks (vegaphobia), and maybe you've also realized that there are anti-vegans and meat industry shills that are actively and constantly trying push this narrative. Something I saw someone else say is that social reasons are the likely the biggest reason for people quitting, which I believe to be true, it certainly has been the most stressful aspect for me, mostly feeling unsupported, unwelcome/unaccommodated in carnist spaces (which is nearly all spaces where most live), and targeted or ridiculed if I dare speak about veganism. That's the hardest because it interests and means a lot to me.\n\nAlthough it's grown a bit outdated, the only kind of comprehensive sociology study on the topic that I'm aware of is [this one by Faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org/study-of-current-and-former-vegetarians-and-vegans/) (it studied 11,399 US vegetarians and vegans, which are lumped unfortunately with vegetarians being the vast majority). I bring it up because It gets used sometimes by anti-vegans as evidence that veganism can't be sustained for long and the ones that claim to are lying because...? veganism bad (you know they never actually read the data).\n\nThe study found that compared to vegetarians, vegans have a much smaller \"relapse\" rate, a 9-fold difference (attachment 1, page 4, table 1). Makes sense as vegetarianism is more diet than ethical stance. When we look at former vs current vegetarians and vegans, we see that a third of formers dropped their new behaviors within 3 months or less, and by the 2 year mark, 71% had gone back to eating animals (attachment 2, page 6, table 4). But optimistically, of those that were current at the time of the study, 58% had been doing it for 10 or more years, and not only that, they were way more attuned to animal rights than those who were formers (page 7, table 6). In a questionnaire about their struggles, both currents and formers found that not having a support community was the most difficult part (corroborating what I and u/plscallmeRain said), but formers were much more dissatisfied with how it made them stand out, wasn't a part of their identity, and saw it more as a trend (page 10-12, table 9). Overall, though, 37% of the formers were interested in readopting their meatless dietary pattern at some point in the future (although health was their primary motivator) (attachment 1, page 2). But in any case, I do like the study and I love Faunalytics because they provide free data on effective animal advocacy.\n\nAnyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk. \\*drops from B-12 deficiency\\*",

For most people their morality can be boiled down to  \n\n1) not suffering > suffering, and  \n2) less suffering > more suffering.\n\nThat's what almost everyone wants for themselves and via compassion extend to others. Most people include animals too in their circle of compassion and you can see this is true because animal abuse is wildly unpopular. Veganism the philosophy is just the *explicit* inclusion of animals. (Fuck whoever gave it a name though, it's a harmful mental division line that causes more animal suffering from tribalism it creates.)\n\nThe catch is, most people are inconsistent with their morality because they cling to whatever personal benefits they happen to gain from some products of animal suffering – usually foods they like and whatever pervese pleasure or social validation they get from hunting/fishing/[insert animal abuse here]. The trade off for ironing out those inconsistencies is a no brainer – sacrificing those benefits and pleasures in return for inner peace. Maybe you've caught a glimpse of that inner peace.",

We could organize community potlucks/festivals on that day (or any day, heck monthly if possible), maybe in a park, or church, or rental hall. Have all vegan food including \"fake\" meat dishes, for free, and vegan products/crafts for sale. Have activities for kids, pamphlets with non-confrontational/non-distressing info, music, etc. But, hear me out, advertise it as \"for meat lovers\". Maybe something like \"Meat-Lover's Meetup\". After all, we do love meat, while its alive, and keeping it alive. Keep flyers simple with the gimmick, and don't explicitly say vegan. Make t-shirts too. (Tell your vegan friends to help and show up.) This will draw people in. Once you get people through the door, they're more likely to try something new, especially if its free. And if its somewhere they can bring their kids, even better. Some may walk right out but some will stay.\n\nGotta think outside the box. Proselytization is unpopular no matter what the belief. Tricking people into a more moral stance is not immoral.",

Where fish is hooked, paraded around and then tossed back into the water as a symbol of ethos. \n\nPersonally, I am for abortion. Also, pro animal abortions for situations like cats that don’t have homes.  So maybe I’m not a perfect paragon of veganism, but I’m trying my best with information I find. \n\nAt this point, I’ve written and deleted a couple of responses because I’m not real interested in having this discussion with you. I did feel that you deserved an answer though so there you have it.",
