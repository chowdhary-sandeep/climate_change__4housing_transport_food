"comment": "&gt; That's one of the great things about a debate: we are not obligated to provide evidence for our opponent's argument.\n\nLet me add one thing about this. I don't consider this a \"debate\", and I think it's wrong to do so. It's not like we're each standing at a podium and charged with defending our \"side\", or that we're lawyers legally obligated to support our clients. This is not a zero-sum game.\n\nThis should be viewed more like a \"search for truth.\" If one of us provides a clear fact that contradicts a position held by the other, then I'd like to think that said position should change, even if only slightly.\n\nOf course changing one's mind is never easy, but I hope that I'm keeping an open mind. I'll come out of this thinking harder about the grid storage problem, and unreasonable impediments to developing nuclear energy. I was previously unaware of the SkyTran, and am encouraged now by its progress. I'm also planning to read into the effect of aquifer pumping on SLR.\n\nOn the flipside, are your positions not changed in even a small way by my pointing out things such as the non-climate-related benefits of EVs? Or how glaringly wrong the cost effectiveness portion of the UCLA LCA is, or how your Energy Collective article reaches an unwarranted conclusion? Or perhaps at least you learned that your previously-held notions were wrong about how the EV tax credit works, and what materials are needed for lithium batteries, and can take that forward.",

"comment": "The 5+4=20 varies drastically from manufacturer to manufacturer. In my own practice, I tend to go with higher priced inverters, where that may not be the case. To me, it sounds like the installer is trying to keep you happy within reason. I would consider an 8kw inverter.\n\nThe micro-inverter cost effectiveness is in the 25 year warranty/life vs the 10-12 year on string inverters. Might as well front load that cost now while the tax credit is around, for a total lower LCOE.",

This can be cracked to make H2 cheaply.\n\nAs for the other countries, there is a fair bit of momentum from the days when BEVs didn't look promising. Car companies have enjoyed all the govt support for fuel cell development.\n\nFuel cells may yet be a good idea for something. Trains? Trucks?\n\nI was a bit shocked that California recently announced they would spend $200m on H2 stations. For a fraction of the cost they could install an impressive 200kw DC charging network (future proofed!).",

Failed part? replace part.  \nWhile this works well enough on your Honda where a caliper is $50.. suddenly the labor to rebuild your calipers at significantly outweighs the cost of new calipers. Same with rotors. They can absolutely still be turned, but currently it's become a limited thing because most techs aren't trained to do it, or have access to a brake lathe.  \n  \nI mean, if you're looking at shop hours rate of 100-125, that's almost 6 hours of labor for a tech to fix one caliper. One. that's alot of time for something that would usually be a 1-2hr job.",

"comment": "The first article talks about battery cells cost, meaning if you throw lithium ion batteries on a pile, be it prismatic or cylindrical cells, until they could theoretically hold 1 kWh.\n\nThe second article talks about battery pack where that theoretical pile of batteries that could hold 1 kWh are actually assembled into a pack (obviously larger than 1 kWh) that contains connectors, fuses, cooling and heating system, protection materials and everything else needed.\n\nThe third article you linked also talks about battery pack costs. The thing is that in each situation the price can differ from one company to another and when news sites mention a certain price they usually quote the lowest prices in the industry or at most average prices from industry leaders.\n\nIf you want to buy your own cells and build your own battery pack it will cost a lot more since EV manufacturers for example get high discounts due to large scale economics. If you have the tools and know how to build your own batteries from raw materials and then assemble them into a battery pack that you designed, it will cost less than the industry average or industry best but the upfront costs of everything you need to accomplish that will make the price sky rocket.\n\nSo what is really the price per kWh in Q2 of 2017? It depends who you ask. If you talk to Tesla they might tell you the cells are around $100 per kWh and the pack at around $170 maybe less. If you ask Nissan they might tell you the pack costs around $300 per kWh or more although they do intend to switch supplier in order to source them at half the price.",

That's your assumption. \n\nI didn't say you *wanted* the cars to be slower, I'm just pointing out that barring some incredible solid state batteries being unveiled tomorrow, the cars *would* be significantly slower.  You pointed that out yourself in the comment I replied to:\n\n&gt;The cars are still too slow, probably because having enough battery capacity at 600-700kw for 1,5h race is not that easy.\n\n&gt;The cars will be very heavy which will cause slower cornering speed.\n\nEven if you added a car swap mid-race, you're still looking at 300+ kWh batteries.  That amount of weight slows the cars to a point that it's a non-starter.\n\n&gt;Your response is exactly why F1 is conservative.. Fans only think in problems instead of thinking in solutions. Fans aren't open to explore change, but only want to stay stuck in past glory.\n\nThere's a difference between not being open to change and not wanting to go down a path that removes one of the core parts of the spectacle for the sake of appeasing some small, vocal groups.  Going electric would make Formula 1 significantly slower.  That's not a question.  You even pointed that out yourself.  Making Formula 1 that much slower is a non-starter.  I'm open to solutions, but I have yet to see any sort of solution that doesn't involve the cars being significantly slower.  When that changes, then it becomes a reasonable discussion.\n\nF1 has always transitioned with the times, as evidenced by continually downsizing the engine and now moving to a turbocharged hybrid formula.  But it's never at the cost of speed.",

I've heard they have some reliability issues, would you use yours as a most of the time stored (plugged in) and used a few times a year to tow a race car?  I have all the fast charging infrastructure and the room in the garage already, what I'm hoping for is a car I can ignore until I need it, and not worry about issues from sitting for months like my truck.\n\n66% is the standard best practice for tesla highway driving.  Faster = way more energy use, and the EPA rates at 55 miles per hour but no highway moves that slow.  At 70 you use a lor more energy, and at 85 you use way more.  \nThe record on a Tesla is 680 miles despite the 330 mile EPA estimate, but that drive was made an entire day at 25 miles per hour so I wouldn't call reaching 205% intelligent driving.",

"comment": "No, single motor.\n\nSo electric cars were typically set up as a living room-style layout. Forward-facing rear bench seat with room for 2-3 people, and two rear-facing front seats. The driver would sit on the rear seat on the left side, with two tiller levers basically in their lap (which folded up out of the way to get in and out of the car), a short one for speed control, and a long one for steering. There'd likely also be a brake pedal of some sort in front of them. This layout was done so you could have a conversation with your passengers, just like they were in your living room.\n\nThen, you had front drive electric cars, which have nothing to do with the drivetrain layout, but rather the where the driver's seat was. The left front seat was facing forward, and the tiller levers and brake pedal were in front of that seat - the normal position for a modern car's driver. These were intended for a chauffeur to drive - the chauffeur isn't intended to interact with the passengers, hence the forward seating position.\n\nFinally, you have duplex drive cars. In these, the left front seat swivels so it can either face forward or backward, and there's two sets of tillers and brake pedals - one for the left rear, one for the left front. This way, you could have a chauffeur drive you, but if they weren't available, you could drive yourself, too.",

They'd never buy a Tesla because \"with so many fit and finish issues who knows what else is going on that I can't see\". They always say how these issues wouldn't bother them if they're shopping for a €10k bottom end Hyundai or Kia (or some other brand that's perceived as a \"budget\" brand here) but a car that costs well over €50k has no business not being perfectly polished and absolutely on point in every single way.\n\n\nSure you only hear about the bad apples because those are what get talked about the most, but unfortunately with Tesla, it just seems like there are reports all the time. To the average consumer who's not going to spend time sifting through all the information, this could easily be perceived as a rampant problem. \n\n\nAs much as I don't really care about a car's aesthetics and panel gaps don't bother me much, I'd be disappointed (or even pissed) if I bought an expensive car and it had bad paint, rattles, creaks and stains.\n\n\nI hope Giga Berlin fixes these issues.",

"comment": "I frequently make the case here that if you want a \"big scoot\" for longer distance commuting then you really should consider a motorbike or motor scooter (I've got a hybrid of that these days).\n\neScooters at higher speeds are so unstable that you really do need to compensate with high levels of concentration (even on my Mercane Widewheel if I'm going down the mountain here I'm pretty focused and its pretty stable).\n\nBy contrast motorbikes are more stable carry more and last for hundreds of thousands of km (announcing *I've done 100km* is a joke on a motorbike)\n\nIt seems few eScooter riders have experience on motorcycles (or much else really) and so while convalescing I encourage you to review a few things, this is a video I did for my mate who broke his wrist &amp; elbow &amp; shoulder to make the case that its actually far more stable (he'd never ridden a motorbike)\n\n[https://youtu.be/MURtu1rKTUs](https://youtu.be/MURtu1rKTUs)\n\nLastly I'd consider this discussion on my blog: [http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/05/scoots.html](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/05/scoots.html)\n\n [http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2019/12/scooters-going-fast.html](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2019/12/scooters-going-fast.html) \n\n [http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2019/10/scooters-are-not-motorcycles.html](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2019/10/scooters-are-not-motorcycles.html) \n\nand lastly:  [http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2019/12/bicycle-vs-escooter.html](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2019/12/bicycle-vs-escooter.html) \n\nI ended up buying the MX60 instead of the eBike and so far that seems to have been an ok decision. The MX60 is not the fastest scooter around but it'll sit comfortably on 35\\~40kmh and has a reasonable range:\n\n [http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/search/label/MX60](http://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/search/label/MX60) \n\nI observe at the end of that article that I used 780 of the 1200 available Wh, meaning it would be skating on thin ice to go much more than about 35km (or 17km each way). Charging is slow with the supplied charger (trickling in under 2Amps) and if I was to use it more seriously as a transport item I'd be considering a 5 or 6A chager for it (I already use a 4A on my Widewheel). However there is only so much of the charging cycle you can speed up (and still get maximum range).\n\n[https://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/01/4a-charger.html](https://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/01/4a-charger.html)\n\nHope all those thoughts help and best wishes",

Literally none of your examples involve Tesla backing out on an order price.\n\nIt's a broader point about whether they deliver on what they say they are going to do vs change the rules of the game as they go, but if that's too much of a stretch for you, go ahead and believe that they will deliver 1M CTs for 40k and 50k because of how the model Y launch worked out. They have already publicly delayed the CT, so there's one known difference from the Y launch already. They have also added some additional language giving them more flexibility on price to the T&amp;C too, which I'm sure you have a great excuse for.\n\nYou really are incapable of saying anything negative, skeptical, or even neutral about Tesla, aren't you? It has to be glowing positive spin 24/7? Why?",

"comment": "At Battery Investor Day, Tesla showed a slide comparing the footprint of a hypothetical 1TWh plant as being a little smaller than the eventual 150 GWh Nevada factory.  However Elon has often mentioned colocating battery and car production, and it’s very hard to see just 3 factories total.\n\nSo I agree with you.  I don’t believe any given factory will produce 1 TWh.  Each line is able to 200 GWh, so maybe 10 plants of 200-400 GWh plants make sense?  I believe Austin and Berlin are slated for an eventual 2M vehicles each.  2M * 60 kWh = 120 GWh.  Austin building Semi and Cybertruck would obviously have a higher than 60 kWh average.\n\nThe big unknown is cells for Energy and whether Tesla would setup dedicated Tesla Energy Cell plants.",

"comment": "&gt; Just drive an ICE?\n\nWell yeah, that's my best option currently. My point is is SHOULDN'T be.\n\n&gt;You want an Astra with very long range and inexpensive price tag, when no EV at all with long range is inexpensive to start with. \n\nYES. THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT. Big batteries are ONLY put in expensive EVs, so the premium you pay for long range as a feature FAR EXCEEDS the cost of implementing that feature.\n\n&gt;Batteries cost money. Bigger batteries cost more.\n\nYes, but not THAT much more. The Dacia Spring has a TOTAL COST of maybe €15k. It has a 26.8kWh battery. To triple that battery size would not cost triple the price of the entire car. Even if the battery cost is half the entire car's cost, that still means that for €30k they could shove an 80kWh battery in one. Even if the battery is 90% of the car's cost, a Spring with an 80kWh battery would still cost under €50k. Are you following me yet?\n\n&gt;It's like me saying a Lambo is too expensive and Ford Mondeos are cheap but not fast enough.\n\nNo, it's more like wanting more boot space than a Ford Fiesta, but a Ford Galaxy isn't an option and your only choice is a Range Rover.",

Or I guess if you have a lot of frozen food, then maybe it's all the food you saved from getting spoiled.\n\nThere is some ROI on batteries because I sell back electricity at peak rates.

"comment": "As a Model 3 owner since 2018, I tried driving the Ionic 5, Ionic 6, Rivian S and T the past couple months.  The Ionic 6 was really underwhelming as far as performance goes.  My dual motor long distance Model 3 feels much more powerful and sporty than the Ionic 6 I test drove.  I'm not 100% sure which configuration I drove, could have been the single motor.  The accelerator felt kind of gummy and not that responsive.  I was excited to try out the Ionic 6, but that test drive certainly killed any interest I had in it.  I thought the back seat was bizarrely spacy from front to back while simultaneously having a very low roof.  Taller passengers probably won't be able to sit straight up lol.\n\nI liked the Rivian, certainly a fun drive and well-engineered car.  But it's too wide for city driving and the air suspension feels a bit floaty while at the same time feeling rough with larger wheels.\n\nNow I'm either looking at a Polestar 3 or 4 or hoping for a more compact Rivian.  I may test drive the Kia EV6 next.",

"comment": "Because switching to NACS only requires a simple plug change in the charger. This isn't Betamax or HD DVD where you have to throw out all of the existing hardware and start from scratch.\n\nThe vast majority of the cost of building a charging station has nothing to do with whether you put a CCS, NACS, or CHAdeMO plug on it. You can serve the existing market now with both CCS and NACS on your charger and then switch the CCS plugs out down the road when nobody is using them anymore, when you probably will need to replace the cable anyway.",

If the charging ends at 4am instead of 9pm the previous evening it makes no difference to me.\n\nWhen I need a fast charge, I can go back to 48A (which is the highest when using a 60amp breaker.\n\nTo be fair - I also happen to live within 10 minutes of 6 level-3 chargers, so it's easier for me to be less worries about timing.",

I'm an eternal optimist, and I'm greener then 95% of the people posting on this subreddit (probably including you and the climate commune you live in).\n\n&gt; Coal is degrading our environment.\n\nThis is only one side of the debate... the other side include the benefits that cheap power brings and the cost-benefit analysis of all options.  In the case of coal... the pollution risks are outweighed VASTLY by the benefits it would bring to those with no other option. (IE. 10000x more people die this year from diseases because they don't have electricity, then people who die from pollution)  When that balance of pollution risks is nearing equilibrium with the benefits, then we can talk about international sanctions that affect fossil fuel production.\n\n&gt;If you like being dependent on other countries for our tech and power, as we have been on OPEC, keep burning coal.\n\nThe same thing can be said about cutting fossil fuel production too early or bankrupting your nation by going full retard with renewables too early, like Spain did.   Russia has economic leverage over the whole EU right now because the greens in the EU mandated extremist policy and gutted the \"domestic\" production of energy.  What you said is true for everything including green energy (IE the world gets 95% of its solar panels and rare earths from china)  Also, I'm not even getting into global competitiveness and job loss/offshoring from higher red tape induced production costs.\n\n&gt;Beijing has given itself 6 years to get totally free from coal. \n\nChina is not banning coal production(increasing fossil costs to make renewable more competitive [which hurts the poor]),\n\nThey are lower the cost of solar (making solar storage costs lower to match un-manipulated fossil costs) And increasing efficiency of the grid and connected items.\n\n\n&gt;So we can have all the things that, as you point out, keep children from dying. **But we can no longer do it with coal.**\n\nWhy not?  There is no hard evidence whatsoever that a warming climate is a worse climate, given the long term historical records showing life's diversity and prosperity was highest when temps were highest.  You can make predictions of doom and gloom and extrapolate out coupled non-linear chaotic systems until they show anything you want... but none of that makes the predictions true until confirmed via observational  trend lines that follow (sigma 5 confidence to be called conclusive).  The temperature trends lines ARE NOT FOLLOWING the disastrous model paths so far, they have radically diverged to the under side of the most mild of IPCC predictions trend lines predicted (IE RPC 2.6 ar4-3-2-1 models).\n\nIf there is a net global positive to bringing coal to the poorest among us... then you are wrong.  Where is that study?",

Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/ZSS9oA0.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_updraft_tower.svg) - *Schematic presentation of a solar updraft tower*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^EnviroMission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnviroMission) ^| [^Wind ^turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine) ^| [^Vortex ^engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_engine) ^| [^Solar ^chimney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_chimney) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+chpyqbc) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+chpyqbc)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",

I would reocmmend installing a whole house service panel monitor so you can understand your energy usage before making the swap.\n \n2) Do you own your RECs? You may be able to sell them. This is likely the case if you did not get an incentive for installing solar from the utility.\n\n3) Know your net-metering policy. Wholesale credit at the end of the month is very different than wholesale credit at the end of the year. Likewise, when does the \"year\" start? Do you even have net-metering?

"comment": "You're accusing me of not believing science just because I'm not falling over myself to tell everyone how concerned I am about butterfly populations in Antarctica. I accept that it may be the second warmest January on record. Nobody except the temperature keepers notice though.\n\nI am an energy engineer, so I have every right to be part of this discussion. What I am saying is that the standard of living we would have to give up to significantly affect global warming is far more precious than any minor benefits we may or may not get otherwise. The fact that climate pushers like Al Gore, who claims that the \"internal combustion engine is the greatest enemy of mankind\", can say these things without getting any criticism is the most dangerous anti-science attitude there is. Climatologists do not seem to understand or care about the extent to which an abundance of energy has contributed to our standard of living. You don't have to be a scientist to see how life was before the Industrial Revolution and after it. And how would you have powered the digital revolution on solar panels and windmills? We wouldn't have iPhones -- we'd be figuring out how to keep warm. \n\nOn top of that, you can often find so-called legitimate climate scientists blaming every out-of-the-ordinary weather event on global warming despite statistics not showing it to be true. On the flip side, you have people like Warren Buffet, who hires the best and the brightest because he has billions of dollars on the line with his insurance business, [who says he doesn't even take climate predictions into consideration. ](http://youtu.be/HSwH0mK5o8g) So yes, there is more than meets the eye here.",

So far as I can tell, the FPL rebate has no transfer of green attributes or RECs, nor any other kind of system operation obligations. As such, FPL's program is a true rebate, and OP should not write off the 30%. It would be interesting to see where OP is coming up with the 1099 obligation. It may be that OP needs to pay tax at the State level and not the Federal on the utiltiy incentive. Defintely something OP should not be leaving to the hands of turbo-tax. \n\nHowever, numerous $/W utility incentive programs which require REC-right transfer and operability requirements for the \"rebate\" are not rebates - even if the word \"rebate\" is on top of the form. This is all in accordance to general accounting principles, which state that you must treat finances as they behave, not based on whatever the F--- you decide to call them. In these structured REC purchases, the solar array owner is effectively entering into a 5 year contract to sell RECs to the utility for an up-front lump sum payment. This is no different than any other business the OP could be starting. Making the argument to the accountant that you are liable for the money of the term (if you do not deliver the RECs during that 5 years, you have to give the money back!) should solidify the write-off in the eyes of your accountant. At which point you treat the array as a business - pay income tax, write off the full 30%, and depreciate the sucker.\n\nResidential solar arrays are depreciated all the time - but only when they are treated as business operations.",

"comment": "Ideally, I would hope we would go with Sunworld modules (made in the USA). For the rest, no, I haven't specced out the entire project... But with the modules themselves having 25 year production guarantees, it doesn't seem like a stretch to say the whole thing will be good for that period. I agree, I used numbers that are worst, worst, worst cases - $14mm and 5%, but even at that level, we come out with $5mm savings at the least, and growing from there with more favorable conditions, so if some of those savings went to replacement inverters, etc, we'd still be ahead. \n\nEven under the PPA plan, there is no intention to take the town off the grid, just to replace 80% of its energy usage with \"clean\" power via net metering credits.\n\nI guess my point is, the town should negotiate further. Maybe there's an impediment that really makes it optimal for SunEd to do it their way. I didn't see or hear it at the town meeting. If there was openness, I could get engineers from my co to the sites in a week or two and we could develop an alternative prop taking things more fully into account, rather than my 15 pages of written notes. But again, I intended this to be a letter from a town resident encouraging them to further explore their options, with or without SunEd (and even if i didn't work in solar, i would still want to see large projects like this kept with in-state companies unless the skill and expertise wasn't available), not a sales call or an actual proposal.",

I've been assuming that standalone and off-grid are synonymous.\n\nAny off-grid system (assuming it's not a pv-direct load but rather a whole house kind of situation), still requires an inverter (an all DC house is not really feasible to have all modern amenities), presumably some metering for the inverter, numerous breaker panels, labor, etc. The only thing missing from your list was the transformer from 240 to 120V.\n\nAre you suggesting that the components for the powerwall, although similar to components for FLA, for example, will be more expensive? \n\nThanks!\n\nV/R",

Some notable cars that completed the 3002 km (1865.3 mi) race include the single passenger Nuna 8 (91.75 kph, 57.01 mph), https://youtu.be/4W2rUWesxtQ), and the four passenger Stella (76.7 kph, 47.7 mph, https://youtu.be/nuND8epNLec).\n\nKeep in mind these solar panels are only about 25% efficient at absorbing the average 1050 W/m^2 of power, there is a lot of improvement to be made. You can add about 250W of power on the roof of your car right now.",

"comment": "Very odd situation. Quick question - Do your solar panels have a diode in them? \n\nA reverse blocking diode prevents the power from flowing back into the solar panel. When the sun shines the solar panel will produce power and make it go in the direction it can be used - path of least resistance. They can also be a load source, much like a electric heater, and be the path of least resistance when no sun is on them. \n\nIf you panels don't have a reverse blocking diode I believe the other panels are feeding the shaded panel. The panel is the path of least resistance for the power generated. \n\nThis was a common issue years ago when panels first came out to charge a battery. At night the panel acted as a load on the battery and would drain it through the night. If you add a battery to your equation the panels might drain it at night when the power reverses.",

How many are installed? Warranty? I'd probably ask for a second quote with a more industry standard panel. \n\nHow long has this solar company been around? What guarantees do they have? So many solar installers out there just know a lot will not be around in 5 years, make sure you have a good one who will stand behind their work.",

I wouldn't care so much about an itemized quote a sit is really the overall cost per kW that matters.  \nI don't know the DC market, but that seems like a tremendously expensive system.

I see the intent behind EV incentives to increase the number of EVs on the road, which will in turn encourage people to install solar panels, and will hopefully put pressure on power companies to clean up grid electricity. More sales of 60mpg non-plugin Priuses and Ioniqs won't accomplish these goals.",

The plug-in systems are smart enough that they could keep track of everything for you. It would be similar to the gas tax that ICE owners pay and just seems like a way to make everyone pay their fair share for road upkeep.\n\nI would also say if you’re charging at home while your solar panels are generating excess power, then it should be tax free as an extra incentive.",

"comment": "Things you can do that actually have an impact on your personal footprint:\n\n1. Vote for candidates with aggressive and positive environmental policies as a priority.\n2. Reduce/cut out meat and dairy. Beef and cheese, especially, have an unbelievably high carbon footprint. Try to replace dairy milk with hazelnut, oat, almond, soy etc. Just as cheap and (in my opinion) just as nice.\n3. Pay for a green tariff. Especially ones that promise 100% renewable energy supply - personally I do not include Nuclear and Biomass as true renewable, but that's up to you.\n4. Reduce your travel; especially plane travel. Use public transport or walk/cycle wherever possible.\n5. If you can afford it, install retro-fit insulation, solar panels, solar-thermal panels (cheaper and will give you free hot water for showers etc), or micro-wind systems. The pay-back time on these, if you have the upfront cash, is pretty decent.\n6. Ask the company you work for why their building isn't powered by renewables or on a renewable tariff. Talk to coworkers, get them involved in the discussion. Most offices would benefit from renewables. I know that there are companies in Europe (Statkraft etc) and probably America that offer free installation of solar panels on your building, and then supply electricity to you at a greatly reduced rate. Great if you don't have the upfront cash.\n7. An extension of 6. ASK QUESTIONS, TALK ABOUT IT. Tell people you care about it, tell people what you're doing. Get involved.\n8. Plant trees and wildflowers in your garden instead of lawn (which is uglier than flowers in my opinion, and has no biodiversity). Every new tree absorbs about 13 pounds (6 kilo) of CO2 a year.\n9. Make investments into sustainable/low impact causes, rather than companies than invest in Oil &amp; Gas.\n\nI know, no matter what you do as an individual, it's difficult to ignore that most emissions are from industrial companies well out of your control. But all is not lost. Consumer change on a large scale, especially in terms of demanding renewable energy supply and GREATLY reduced meat and dairy industry consumption, WILL CHANGE THE WORLD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: These are all important and in no particular order.

I lean towards extra panels but maybe your ductwork is crap and fixing that would save you hundreds each month? There is no way of knowing without more info. \n\nIf you have true net metering the powerwall won't gain you much. If you are TOU it possibly could eliminate your bill. Do you currently have a string inverter or micros? If string, how over/under sized is it? If it's already oversized, you will likely need to upgrade your inverter which could take up 2-3k of that 9k.\n\nThe best case scenario I can see is that you've got proper net metering, stable utility power, plenty of roof space, an already efficient home, and micro inverters (or a string where the panels aren't already oversized). In that case, spend your 9k on extra panels.",

I chose another local installer over them to save a few bucks, but I’m starting to regret my decision as my production isn’t what I had expected. Make sure you know exactly where the panels will go. They put one row of my panels super close to the tree line which I’m not happy about. Is a good section of your roof south facing?\n\nIf I could go back I would definitely go with a larger system because as of now I still have an electric bill. Hopefully I make up for it in the summer. \n\nI don’t believe there is a cap on the federal and you can do what you want with the credits, but most quotes you see are assuming you will apply the credit to the loan.",

We then decided to pull the trigger on solar panels, which we had always wanted. And in August 2021 we transitioned that one remaining car to an EV.\n\nE-bikes are a huge eye opener to electrified transport.

That means if I sell at 56c during solar for 1 hour, I can use 6x the energy at 12am for 6 hours and it'd be the same 'cost'.\n\nDoes the appliance run 6 hours even?

That's like looking at buying a mouse traps and saying *\"if we exclude their cost and how effective they are at killing mice, which one is better\"*. \n\nPutting them on one face will make it easier to install and will lower your costs. If one of your faces is slightly south of East or west, it will have greater generation. \n\nIf you have a net metering agreement, it literally does not matter when your power is produced or when you use it. If you have time of day rates, then sure, maybe you're better off putting them where they get sun when you plan to use the power. \n\nYou literally have to look at the cost difference and power generation -unless aesthetics is more important to you these are literally the only 2 points of comparison that matter.",

"comment": "LMAO Lazard?\n\nFirst of all, Lazard is referring to solar thermal towers, which are a relatively new technology that is not widely used and is unlikely to make a significant contribution to stopping climate change. The largest solar thermal tower is the Ivanpah facility, which relies on gas to reach operating temperature and is classified as a greenhouse emitter, among having other negative impacts on the environment. The type of storage in question is not batteries, but rather thermal storage using molten salt, which, other than being a relatively recent development, dissipates energy much more quickly than batteries. It also only stores thermal energy and only stores heat from the facility itself. Lazard doesn't even show their methodology for the cost of this storage\n\nTo give an idea of how unreliable Lazard is:\n\nThey assume a capacity factor of 36% for Solar PV thin film in the low case of LCOE, yet according to the EIA, [average utility capacity factors are about 25%](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_07_b). The IRENA puts it at 16% in the report [Renewable Power Generation Costs 2020](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2021/Jun/IRENA_Power_Generation_Costs_2020.pdf), although it uses AC-to-DC capacity factors. At a conversion ratio of 1.25, this would be 20% AC-to-AC. [This report on utility scale solar](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1823604) puts it at 24%\n\nThey assume $6025/kW for the low case for Nuclear power EPC costs and $9800/kW for the high case, yet according to the 2020 edition of [projected costs of generating electricity](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ae17da3d-e8a5-4163-a3ec-2e6fb0b5677d/Projected-Costs-of-Generating-Electricity-2020.pdf), median OCC costs (including owner costs, contingency costs, which account for ≈15% of OCC and EPC costs) are $3370/kW. What they mean by \"capital cost during construction\" is unclear, so I can't make a judgement on that\n\nThe O&amp;M value is also questionable. From figure 3.2 of projected costs of electricity, fixed O&amp;M for Nuclear is about $60/kW, whereas Lazard assumes $119-133.25/kW-yr.   On the other hand, they assume $9.50-13.50/kW-yr for O&amp;M costs, yet according to the aforementioned report on utility scale solar, they are $16 and according to the IRENA\n\n&gt;For the period 2018-2020, O&amp;M cost estimates for utility-scale plants in the United States have been reported at between USD 10/kW/year and USD 18/kW/year\n\nThey also assume a 40yr lifetime for the low case, even though many NPPs are designed to operate for 60yrs\n\nLooking at total LCOE, the IRENA puts the LCOE of utility PV at $57/MWh which seems to agree with values given by the IEA and  is much higher than Lazard's $29-38 for thin-film PV or $31-42 for crystalline. The lowest LCOE according to the IEA at a 7% discount rate is $34.39 is the US, whereas the highest is close to $200, with the median somewhere around the LCOE given by the IRENA. To be fair, the report on utility scale solar did give a value of $34/MWh, although that only analysed utility solar in the US\n\nAccording to the IEA, the cost of Nuclear New build at an 85% CF (which is relatively low) for a 7% discount rate ranges from $42.02 to $101.84, which has precisely 0 overlap with Lazard's range of values",

"comment": "A bit.  But the standard right now is $3/watt cash, and about $1/watt more if you finance.  If you search around on here, TX prices are generally cheaper because of standard of living.  You have a good size system, so with economies of scale, that's why I was saying you should be able to get under $4/watt financed.  And acquaintance just signed, financed, and they got $3.87/watt here, in the Bay Area.  I have another friend who got a quote at $3.62/watt financed.  So you should be able to find that with more quotes.\n\nBest way to get lower quotes is sought out local installers.  They'll give you better priced quotes and better customer service.  I actually ended up just using Yelp and blasting installers.  Then researched the ones that responded and found my installer that way.  National installers like ADT, Sunrun, Sunpower, Tesla, are going to be meh for the most part, unless you somehow get lucky.  I wouldn't risk that.",

"comment": "For years, European policymakers had assured the world that the relatively rapid “transition” to “green” energy was the world’s preordained future—regardless of the costs.\n\nAccordingly, many European Union governments followed the advice of green experts. They eagerly shut down coal, natural gas, and nuclear power plants to transition immediately to “renewable energy”.\n\nMost citizens were afraid to object that in cloudy, cold Germany solar panels were not viable methods of electrical generation—especially in comparison to the country’s vast coal deposits and its large, model nuclear power industry.\n\nAs a result, German government officials warn that this winter, in 19th-century fashion, families will have to burn wood—the dirtiest of modern fuels—to endure the cold. And there is further talk of “warm rooms,” where, like pre-civilizational tribal people, the elderly will bunch together within a designated heated room to keep alive.\n\nSri Lanka may be the first modern nation to adopt deliberate policies that have led to mass hunger and bankruptcy. The government, for a variety of reasons, listened to foreign advocates of back-to-nature organic farming, specifically outright abandonment of highly effective synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nThe result was endemic crop failure. Cash crops for export failed. Widespread hunger followed. Without foreign exchange, it became impossible to import key staples like food and fuel.\n\nSri Lanka once had a per capita income twice that of nearby India. Now it cannot feed or fuel itself.\n\nUnfortunately, its incompetent government trusted radical environmental advisers, many of them foreign experts. Sri Lanka believed it could become the woke darling of the “environmental, social, governance” movement, and in that way draw in unlimited Western woke investment.\n\nInstead, it has embraced a policy of national suicide.\n\nRecently, a group of 55 distinguished pro-administration economists assured us that President Joe Biden’s massive borrowing and new entitlements agenda were not inflationary. In September 2021, these economists with 14 Nobel Prize winners among them declared that Biden’s inflationary policies would actually “ease” inflation.\n\nLast month, inflation spiked to an annualized rate of 9.1%.\n\nNone of these “blue chip” economists have offered any apologies for lending their prestige to convince Americans of the absurd: That inflating the money supply, spiking new government spending, incentivizing labor nonparticipation, and keeping interest rates artificially low would not cause inflation.\n\nIn late July 2021, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, claimed that the Taliban takeover “was not a foregone conclusion”. He bragged that 34 provincial capitals were still in Afghan government hands.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin nodded in approval. Less than a month later, the entire Afghan government collapsed. The American military fled in its most ignominious retreat in over 50 years. Milley had been parroting Biden’s earlier prompt that a Taliban victory after the American evacuation was “highly unlikely”.\n\nOn the eve of the 2020 election, news accounts revealed some of the lurid contents on Hunter Biden’s lost laptop. Emails and photos began to incriminate the entire Biden family for leveraging millions of dollars from foreign grandees for access to a bought Joe Biden.\n\nFifty retired intelligence officers, however, without evidence, swore that the laptop’s appearance could be due to “Russian disinformation”. Yet after authentication—Hunter Biden himself never denied the lost laptop was his—few, if any, of those marquee “experts” apologized for their election-driven dissimulation.\n\nAt the height of the massive 2020 enforced quarantine and lockdowns, some 1,200 medical and health “professionals” signed a petition claiming that thousands of left-wing protesters should be exempt from the very quarantine they had insisted on for others.\n\nThe experts absurdly claimed that denying tens of thousands the right to break quarantines to protest in the street was a greater health threat than COVID-19…..\n\n&gt;They disgraced their profession. They tarnished the scientific community. And sold their souls to ideologues.\n\n&gt;Is it any wonder why the Western public has lost confidence in their degreed and credentialed elites?\n\n-- Victor Davis Hanson",

Even after 10 years a car battery might have 80% of its charge left.\n\nFrom my understanding what does them in is ability to recharge and discharge rapidly. for a car you want fastest possible charging, and very varied and sudden discharging.\n\nFor a static battery in a grid you don't care if it's only 80% capacity as you aren't dragging around extra weight, and the charging / discharging can be much slower and constant.\n\nBiggest concern is the gap between a battery being replaced, and testing if it is OK to be used in a static battery storage unit.",

"comment": "1.) There are compa issues in AZ that sell DIY kits, and that can include helping with permits, and so on. \n\n2.) 16kw system using 400 watt panels is 40 panels, how are you going to mount to the roof? Ensure you don't cover any vents, and don't break fire code (36inches on some edges of your roof).\n\n3.) Each Enphase micro inverter (I'd suggest iq8m for 400 watt panels on a south facing roof) is connected to just one panel then you need the rest of the material and combiner box. That's around $8000-9000.\n\n4.) 40 X 400w sunpower panels Maynot be able to be found, you'd have to contact their installers and see if they will sell the panels. In AU and Europe it's much easier to buy them. They need the extra profit here. However you can buy the Panasonic, REC, SEG, Q.Cell no problem. \n\nPanasonic 400w are 426/panel and can be found in mesa.\n\nThey are probably the best you can find where you can just pick them up. \n\nThat's 17k there. \n\n25k so far, and that doesn't include modified one, racking, permits, electrical (you will need to use an electrician with a CR-11 for some of the install) and other costs associated. \n\nI know someone who could educate you more and even get you a DIY kit if you want their info.",

Solar panels and turbines on everything. Vertical urban housing solutions instead of hellscape suburbs. Staple crop rotations instead of grazing land for meat. Re-engineering computing hardware to run efficient software with less computing power, and no need for upgrades. The abolition of lawns for native plant zones. I do not consider these to be reversal of growth, but a different utilization of existing growth. Certainly not a reduction in quality of life, in fact it would be in every way the opposite. The existing economy, at it's current size, made efficient and resistant against further growth, while deconstructing the atomizing elements of profit seeking in our daily lives. De-industrialization, or god forbid de-urbanization, however, are impossible at best, and sociocultural suicide at worst. The ultimate get out of jail free card to hand to every wannabe fascist demagogue on earth - not to mention discarding our best tools to fight them, and to proactively improve the earth's climate in the near and far future. De-urbanization would be even worse, ruining the possibility for efficient organization of human society in limited space.",

"comment": "Until very recently, most people hadn't even heard the term \"vegan\". But now that research on vegans has come out showing us to be healthier on average, people are lining up to write cook books and health books about eating like a vegan. Unfortunately, when they call that \"veganism\" they are misrepresenting veganism. But that's what has caught on in the mainstream media. And it's pretty upsetting for those of us who have waiting so long to hear veganism get some media attention for the sake of the animals and yet the topic of animal exploitation (and not just how they are treated but that they are needlessly exploited at all!) is still being dodged! \n\nConsider this, how do you think Orthodox or other kosher-keeping Jews would feel if people started talking about becoming Jews for their health when they just meant giving up eating pork? What if their religion was reduced to some fad diet? I think it would be very offensive. \n\nAnd, fyi, many animal rights activists aren't vegan, sadly. They are only interested in *certain* animals. Well, most people care about certain animals! Every culture has animals they exploit in some ways but not others. My mom will eat cows but not horses or dogs or cats. Some people will eat dogs and cats but not cows or pigs. And even the most pig-eating people I know think it's terrible that others club baby seals to death. Vegans, on the other hand, are against ALL animal exploitation. We stand up even for insects. We stand up for animals used not just for food but also for clothing and animal testing. That's what makes veganism different. It's not about being in a \"club\" -- a very dismissive and offensive term that I hope you won't use again -- it's about justice for all animals. It's not about us, it's about them.",

Does it really matter though in the grand scheme? You don't have to label yourself to be more ethical in your choices. However, I do think calling everyone who shows effort to be *more* vegan \"vegan\" is just watering down what the term means. Unfortunately, the conundrum of veganism is that someone who is more vegan will always call you out for it, which I agree (and I'm definitely guilty of it) is unnecessary and defeatist.",

It doesn't translate well but Supreme Master is a rank of monk, it's more of a plea to get back in touch with nature and your body than anything. She supports veganism for it's compassion and being in line with her ideals and teachings but in all she's really just someone trying to be memorable.

Hopefully, someday even think of the effort of going vegan as not as big as otherwise. Hope you get my point. :-)",

"comment": "&gt;&gt; So, I do agree with rinabean when s/he says that person, in that context, with that attitude deserved to be told off.\n\n&gt; I don't think it doesn't matter if they deserve it or not. It's a counterproductive action which has a damaging effect on the perception of veganism. I thought that we had previously agreed on that point?\n\nNo, actually I think most people reading that would see how obtuse the person in question was being, and think that the way people eventually expressed their frustration towards that person was justified. I don't think we should just be endlessly tolerant when someone is being ridiculous. I don't just mean 'we' vegans. I guess I just mean me. I don't put up with bullshit beyond reason. Everyone else is free to draw their own line. \n\n&gt;Okay, I'll admit that I started a couple exchanges at the beginning of this but I haven't been going back to the main topic and reading through. So you may be correct.\nI guess I'm not completely sure where you're going with that point though. Could you clarify?\n\nI'm not trying to accuse you of starting fights! Just pointing out how some of us, some of the vegan users of this subreddit, react negatively to having their \"approach\" criticized, and how that leads to the majority of conflicts between vegans on here. It's not a judgment, just an observation. People don't tend to react well to hearing others tell them that their method is wrong, especially without solid proof. That's just human nature.",

If we can't, if it's just a beast driven by instinct then the question does not apply, similar to how it doesn't apply to lions and bears.\n\nDoes the zombie have moral agency, and its life depends on consuming flesh? Then maybe, according to the sidebar definition. \n\nIf eating human flesh is optional, and the zombie has moral agency, and is eating unconsenting people, then it probably wouldn't be vegan - Humans are animals, after all, and we usually like to not be eaten for the same reason as animals prefer not to be eaten. \n\nHowever, a lot of other concerns would present themselves in either of these scenarios that would push the question \"Is it vegan though?\" to the bottom of the barrel.",

It's generally considered to be fairly accurate to say that if you eat a whole foods, plant based diet (no processed food, NO OIL) then it's extremely difficult to overeat. I find that to be true. If I am extremely careful about the amount of food I eat that's not whole food, plant based, then I maintain my weight easily. \n\nI also find that my skin looks better the more vigilant I am about limiting oil. \n\nGood luck!",

B-12 is generally a must - but it is easy to get in fortified foods. \n3. Omega 3's are generally smart to supplement too. \n\nI would recommend you try eating what you would consider to be a normal day  of eating, and then track it with chronometre. See what you are and aren't getting, and go from there.",

Most medical cannabis companies I've checked don't test (Zynerba being one of the few I found that does).\n\nCrypto, specially Bitcoin, might not be a very environmental friendly investment, Bitcoin uses huge ammounts of energy to mine the coins.\n\nAnd talking about mining, some of the electrical car companies (looking at you Tesla) are in bed with huge mining conglomerates because they require rare metals for the batteries and whatnot, so expect the usual workers and nature exploitation from these.",

"comment": "But it is hard. The problem is that you can't just jump into veganism without education and expect to succeed. You need the right kind of vitamins, and you need to eat the right stuff every day. To truly do it right requires a lot of (remedial or just even basic) training in cooking, nutrition, how to shop for groceries, and the courage to not fall prey to the myth that vegans are unhealthy. You also basically have to give up eating out at all, since all the vegan places just slather everything in oil. It takes a special person to take that plunge and the way we are programmed in society makes it even harder.\n\nI check up on vegans all the time. No offense, but most of you are doing it wrong. A lot of steps on this path get skipped and it has a negative impact on people's health. The problem with this is that pharmaceuticals aren't vegan, so an unhealthy life choice, such as eating oil, may end up with a vegan taking pills they could have avoided, and that's not very vegan at all. They also rely on these meat analogs that come in single use plastic that cannot be recycled and are damaging species with their pollution. Palm oil and coconut oil are devastating to species, but vegans will gleefully keep buying these products that are not really vegan when you look at the supply chain and the likely endgame to that scenario.\n\nSo, in conclusion, veganism isn't just avoiding meat, it's the delicate balance of ethics, health, and environmentalism. Learning that this balance even exists, let alone how to navigate it, is a commitment that (let's face it) even most vegans can't or won't make. Maintaining the strength and willpower to carry yourself through that transition is not easy.",

Not just accept the problem or break up. \nHowever, I do agree that trying to change her could be a bad idea. So try to have a non-judging conversation about how you feel and why this is important to you. Try to figure out a way together, how you can get along with this. \nIf you can life with her not beeing vegan, at least for now maybe leave it with that. \nIf her not beeing vegan is a big problem in itself, maybe ask her if it is ok for you to show her the reasons for your ethical position. That can be the story of how you became vegan, that can be documentarys, honestly pretty much anything that emotionally relates you to veganism. I know, that can be understood as trying to change her, but focus on increasing understanding for each other. Your goal should not be to change what she eats, you goal should be that she understands you and your feelings better. And if she wants, she can show and explain to you why she does not want to be vegan at the moment. And then, try to understand her feelings too.\nHope this Is helpful. Decide for yourself what you want to do, in the end we are all just strangers in the internet.\nThanks for beeing here and beeing vegan 💚",

Like u/Socatastic said, you can always just donate to animal sanctuaries, animal rights activists/activist organizations, etc.\n\nYou've done more work for the animals than most vegans have, more than even most vegan activists have. You're allowed to take some steps back and take care of yourself now. \n\nIf not doing activism is just something you can't accept, I suggest you start making resources for activist self-care, to help prevent others from going through what you did. This kind of thing helps people be able to stay activists in the long-term. The biggest reason people quit activism is burn-out, so you helping fight against activism burnout will help the animals. \n\nIf this is all too close to home and not something you're ready to do, then another thing you can do is either volunteering with or starting a local social group for vegans (doing things like potlucks and other non-stressful activities). Since one big reason people stop being vegan is lack of social support, that kind of a resource can help people stay vegan. \n\nYou don't have to do things directly involved with animals to help the cause; think about the pain points vegans have or those transitioning to veganism have and see if there's anything you can do to address them. \n\nThere's so many things you can do that don't involve re-traumatizing yourself with the work you used to do. But even then, it's important not to attempt any kind of activism until you are emotionally ready for it.",

Someone here already mentioned r/veganrecipes but honestly I think youtube is really the best place to look for this, that's where I get all my food ideas.   \n\n\nJust look up either foods you like (vegan meatballs, or vegan curry/stew, burgers for example) or even just vague phrases like \"easy vegan dinners\" or \"good vegan recipes for date\" and you will get tons of results with fairly easy to follow guides. If you want something both of you can enjoy, looking for vegan alternatives/versions of stuff you like can be a good place to start, that's where I started personally and found success.  \nHere are some of my proffered channels that I would recomend:  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ChefJana/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ChefJana/videos)   \n[https://www.youtube.com/@TheeBurgerDude/about](https://www.youtube.com/@TheeBurgerDude/about)   \n[https://www.youtube.com/@YEUNGMANCOOKING/about](https://www.youtube.com/@YEUNGMANCOOKING/about) (not vegan but makes plant based foods with a lot of vegan recipes)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/@RachelAma/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@RachelAma/videos)   \n[https://www.youtube.com/@CheapLazyVegan/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@CheapLazyVegan/videos)  \n\n\nIf the recipes seem too hard, just put \"easy\" in your search and you'll find plenty of stuff.",

"comment": "&gt; I wouldn't assume the suffering of animals to be that level of bad *from the perspective of the average meat-eating person*\n\nThis is a strange sentiment. What if someone two hundred years ago had said that the suffering of slaves isn't that bad from the perspective of the average plantation owner? Of course the person doing the abusing won't consider the suffering they inflict on others to be bad, but that completely ignores the victim in the situation, whose suffering is not determined by others' perceptions.\n\n&gt;many of them still can't understand the other side, something that I think is very important\n\nQuite the contrary, in fact. Virtually none of us have been vegan our entire lives, but rather came here after contemplating society's norms and deciding that we didn't want to participate in slaughterhouse practices any longer, and we're quite familiar with the reasons why people don't go vegan because we used to be those people.\n\n&gt;I even have been told in other replies, by various people, that the vegan point of view is the only one possible for a rationally thinking human\n\nIn all sincerity, the only \"convincing\" argument that I've heard against veganism is some flavor of \"I don't care,\" which shuts down all conversation: Global warming is destroying the planet? \"I don't care.\" We shouldn't beat women because they're just as capable of happiness and suffering as men? \"I don't care.\" And I don't think that people want to find themselves in this camp.\n\nLet's get to the heart of the issue: What compelling reasons are there for not being a vegan?",

I can’t imagine the hurdles you’re going through for being who you are and for that, to you personally, I’m sending all my love and acknowledgement to you as a transgender person. I see you. I hear you.\n\nThe world is shitty, I know. People around have their many battles to fight, either being black, being Jewish, being Asian, being Palestinian, being a woman in Taliban Afghanistan, being Rohingya, being Uyghur put in concentration camps I can go on. Here in America, people still get bullied, for being a weirdo in school, for being gay, and yes, for bring trans or vegan too. it’s cruel. But it’s life &amp; we keep moving on &amp; fighting our battles where it should be fought. Do you think a woman who lives in Iran cares about the trans movement when they’re literally being imprisoned or even executed for not wearing the hijab? A movement can’t achieve their rights overnight. But when I see this all ganging up on people who just experiences the slightest doubts &amp; be branded as hateful then be brigaded upon, I sometimes ask myself who’s the bully now? Have we lost perspective?\n\nAnd here it’s for our voiceless friends who suffers the most horrific dystopian nightmare of all &amp; remain forgotten with all these other movements who come to take the spotlight. In a strange way, taking care for our furry &amp; feathered critters is upstream of the movement for gender personhood. When one sees the value of life, ultimately they will feel more compassionate towards others and their life choices. Shaming an old codger to get them to rethink what they learned about male &amp; female in school is not the way. They’re gonna double down, eat all the meat they want just to spite our face &amp; more animals suffer.",

That's literally the only thing that was slightly off. I realize every human being is different but you probably don't need to put that much thought into it.",
