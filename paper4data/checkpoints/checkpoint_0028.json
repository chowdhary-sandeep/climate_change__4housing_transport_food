"comment": "I work for a solar company, and some people have it right, some are way off. It all depends on the size of the system, and how fast your crews are, and how many people to a crew.\n\nOn average, we see 1500-2000 per install, for an average sized system (6.5+-) roughtly 20-30 cents per watt. Of course you have to add workers comp and additional payroll costs, but its close enough.\n\nIf you are a DIY, I definately recommend microinverters. They are more expensive for larger systems, but pencil much better for smaller ones, specially if you are slowly expanding the system. It allows for module flexibility, in case panels get discontinued and you can maintain the panel line look, and efficiency increases by 3-4% on average under ideal conditions and much more if shading/module mismatch, etc.\n\nBy using microinverters you'll be able to start with a much smaller system, and keep adding modules as you go along. Look for state incentives, city incentives, use the 30% fed tax credit and look up at all your options panel wise.\n\nBest of luck and feel free to send over any questions.",

"comment": "The Model S/X is a completely redesigned vehicle.  It has a brand new type of chassis, and this alone makes it revolutionary.  It's battery, motor, and electronics are all below your feet.  Not only does this give the S/X superior handling and safety characteristics, allows seating for 7 occupants in a sports car form while allowing the battery to be quickly swapped out, it also lets Tesla create new body shells to drop onto this chassis.  The Model X is no more than a Model S chassis and a beefier suspension.\n\nGM first developed this chassis in the '90s and built their [Hy-Wire](http://www.flixxy.com/gm-hy-wire-concept-car.htm) car around it.  GM was more interested in being a bank than a car company and simply doped the project, like they dropped the EV1 project.\n\nCost aside, the Model S is the first truly practical electric car in the modern age.  No other EV has the potential to be your only car.  With some infrastructure build out, the long range, battery swapping, and free fast charging gives you a car you could drive around the country, exactly like a gas car.\n\nNow having said this, I'm not an investor in Tesla.  I think one of the established car companies could step up their game and develop a Tesla killer.  Problem is, they don't want to.  So far they have been content with cars that are no more than EV conversions of conventional cars.",

"comment": "There are several comments that are well worth reading:\n\n[Top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1m169h/climate_change_leaves_hares_wearing_the_wrong/cc4scav) by /u/Duke_of_Pillows:\n\n&gt;This is a very misleading headline. If you read the article it says that this happens all the time due to late snowfalls, or early ones, and that there is a \"concern\" that is will become a bigger problem due to global warming.\n&gt;\n&gt;I'm not a global warming denier but this sounds like a pretty nothing story.\n\n[Comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1m169h/climate_change_leaves_hares_wearing_the_wrong/cc4th0d) by /u/Qonold:\n\n&gt;Since global warming has some political connotation, I'd like to point out that global warming deniers feel the way they do because they see misinformation like this being passed around and discredit the whole theory.\n\n[Reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1m169h/climate_change_leaves_hares_wearing_the_wrong/cc4toix) by /u/bobcat:\n\n&gt;Most of the stories that mention climate change are like this. Forest fires in the West burning million dollar houses? Climate change! Not the fact that we've been fighting fires for over a century, and letting brush build up, and that rich people are building million dollar houses of wood, in the woods. Nope, must be climate change!\n\n[Long reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1m169h/climate_change_leaves_hares_wearing_the_wrong/cc4vd2z) by /u/Qonold:\n\n&gt;Precisely.\n&gt;\n&gt;When I think of global warming deniers (or extreme skeptics at least), my father comes to mind. He's a very very intelligent man; he has a degree in physics from one of the world's top universities and he works for a Fortune 500 company designing and selling industrial water systems. He also loves the environment, on Sundays he goes to our town's parks (driving is his electric car) and picks up trash with his home-made devices.\n&gt;\n&gt;However, he doesn't buy into global warming one bit. Although he's not vocal about it, I believe that both his own reasoning and the reasoning of nearly all GWDs boils down to two core principles: Jadedness and a frustration with GW's popular culture.\n&gt;\n&gt;1.) **Jaded**\n&gt;\n&gt;Like most GWDs, my father is relatively old(er). He's lived through environmental crisis after crisis, many of which were later proven to be false. When he was growing up the crisis was \"global cooling\", as in CO2 emissions are actually making the Earth colder. Take a look at this Popular Science article from 1969 to feel properly immersed.\n&gt;\n&gt;New scientific research says that car exhausts, industrial air pollution, and jet contrails could be altering the earth's climate and may be bringing us into a new ice age.\n&gt;\n&gt;(The article makes mention of the greenhouse effect, but it says that cities create their own \"heat domes\" while the rest of the world gets dangerously colder.)\n&gt;\n&gt;I think it's quite fun to poke around the history of environmental science over the last several decades and observe the contradictions. If this was the kind of behavior you grew up observing in the enviro-science community, I'd understand your knee-jerk denial of every new \"fad\".\n&gt;\n&gt;99% of global warming deniers are not fundamentalist Christians who think science is evil and they're not obnoxious conspiracy theorists either. They're mostly silent about global warming because they haven't even bothered to look into it and they're jaded.\n&gt;\n&gt;2.) **The Culture**\n&gt;If you admit that you don't buy into global warming on somewhere like Reddit you'll likely be labeled as something like an, \"ignorant fundie theist\" (edit: it's actually happening right now, just a few comments below). Anywhere else on the internet it's the same story. However, like aforementioned, not every GWD is Glenn Beck.\n&gt;\n&gt;The movement to educate people about GW has become callous. It not longer seeks to convert people, it just wants to call them idiots for not religiously trying to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels. It's not persuasive at all, it's just condescending.\n&gt;\n&gt;When you're a well established and respected individual who has made a career out of science, you're not the kind of person who takes kindly to 20-somethings with liberal arts degrees talking down to you. If organizers would stop trying to make reducing green-house gases the, \"cool thing to do\" and start making it seem practical they'd gain a lot more traction.\n\nThere are several others that are worthwhile.  So I guess a big thanks goes out to /u/pnewell for the own-goal, aka the masturbatory post.  Thanks buddy.  You are doing wonders for skeptics.",

"comment": "OP will be fine if he treats the installed cost as the basis. \n\nI simply wanted to add additional discussion about FMV lease price manipulation that can occur in the solar market, because the topic interests me. FMV price is not set by the installed cost, but rather the installed price, which can be higher than cost. This price can be determined in different ways (arms-length equivalent deals or appraised cash flows are common methods).  Setting the solar FMV becomes problematic because the upfront 30% tax credit creates an opportunity for pricing manipulation that otherwise wouldn't exist under FMV lease standard practices. \n\nYou can imagine an inverted lease structure where investors buy into an inflated project value for tax credits, with the shell company failing to produce profit until it absolutely has to. This allows the tax credits to essentially clear out the capital requirements of the project, with the high, unrealized project margin being slowly paid back as income tax over the 20 year lease. \n\nThis kind of project structuring is only made possible when upfront tax credits become significantly large, which is yet another reason why we should be moving away from all upfront energy subsidies and moving towards a carbon taxes included into our standard electricity prices.",

"comment": "You are going to need at least a 2kW inverter maybe a little more depending on how much the startup of the pump is.   \nYou could consider a grid tie bimodal (hybrid) solar system which would have the added benefits of incentives to reduce the cost and reducing your electric bill by feeding in power to the grid.\nI put in a small 3kW system with a 3.5kw inverter for just this situation.   Now I have the fridge, freezer, some lights, internet, and water when the power is out.   My home is all electric so it offsets only about 40% of my bill but provides terrific backup capabilities.\nYou do not need a huge amount of batteries as you would if you were off grid.  The batteries are normally kept at float unless the grid power is out, so they last longer.\nDepending on where you are located and the incentives available and cost of electricity, you might find this type solution has a decent return.",

It requires coordination, capital and a long term commitment that is lacking in the private sector.\n\nCurrently most private fast chargers are installed mostly in cities or high population areas ignoring rural area and interstate routes. They are not installed in a coordinated way so that chargers are evenly spaced. There are often only 1-2 fast chargers which can lead to congestion on heavy travel days. Private charging networks have proprietary payment systems which make authorization more difficult than it should be.",

"comment": "Still mostly over 20K, unknown service history potential, not a lot of shops can service and supply Motor Vehicle Inspections due to lack of training and licensing. And most used models are early ones with currently sub-100km range. At least in my area. The most tempting is a Smart ForTwo EV but would cost quite a bit to ship, as driving it through a few provinces would take... Almost an entire day to go 200-400 kms.\n\nEd: My reasoning is that when EVs are more accessible, more shops will be qualified to work on them than two dealerships that are 70 kms away from where I live.",

"comment": "All great questions, If I'm planning through an established territory then about 200-300 miles a day and Supercharging is a fairly regular.  I haven't had to go more than a 5-10 miles off route so far.   If I'm cold calling and checking out the industrial parks for new accounts then I'm 150 a day usually.  For me charging is an opportunity to catch up on emails, quotes and info for customers that I would push off until I got to the hotel that evening so it's kinda nice to break the day up and have less hanging over your head in the evenings. I do have complete autonomy over my schedule and that certainly helps. \n\nDestination chargers are fairly easy to be found in the South East and I can usually find a hotel in any town with one but it does make it harder to stay in the same hotel chain to get points...  Wish Holiday Inn Express or one of the other big reasonable business hotel chains would put em in across the board so it made it less of an Easter egg hunt (until you figure out your regular spots). Plugshare has more Destination options by far than the built in Tesla nav.",

I'm sure this kind of situation is uncomfortable for car makers that can't increase production and just validates suspicions that the long waiting lists with new EVs is caused by battery shortage from suppliers. Idk what VW will do, but they better decide fast, this kind of conflicts will slow things down and they have been talking the talk for years, we expect the execution to start.",

Next I set my sights on the Kona Electric and was very proactive with my dealer to order one ASAP.\n\n\nMy dealer was a real champ got me the pricing details and options ahead of time, and he got the order in as soon as they became available to order from Hyundai. Got mine delivered in January and I've been a happy driver ever since.\n\n\nNow that I've driven an EV for a while (3,5k km) I can say that the 400+ km range is nice but I don't anticipate really needing it more than once or twice a year.",

"comment": "Yup fair enough on the vampire drain.  Bjorn has gotten wildly varying results in the past but it's also possible that they have improved the vampire drain significantly in recent updates.   For me, since I only drive 10,000km/year I'd definitely be using more energy.  I'm certain that the average Tesla driver uses more per km overall though.  Resistive heater, and advanced features like sentry and dog mode that others just don't have.   Totally logical to use more power for better features, but in the end it is less efficient.  \n\nNot that it matters in the long term.  My power is almost 100% renewable and that will happen in most areas in the future too.   Better to use more power for features that sell more cars than to maximize efficiency and sell fewer.   \n\n&gt; And larger battery doesn't affect the equation much. The number of cycles each cell gets is what matters most.\n\nCycles is directly related to battery size.  Obviously a pack twice as big will do half as many cycles to travel the same distance.   My 24kWh leaf has done about 550 cycles for 75,000km, while my brother's mid range Tesla would have only done 180 at that mileage.  I suspect the sweet spot for a city car is about 40kWh for maximum environmental benefit, and perhaps 60-75kWh for a road trip capable car.\n\nAs for longevity data, we simply don't have the data yet to know how long Tesla cells will last.  Extrapolating high mileage teslas in a taxi duty cycle does not mean they will last as many miles under normal use cases where they are much older.    We have the cases of Tesla limiting max voltage in older packs via software update because of degradation.   Different mechanism than how a leaf degrades but in the end the result is the same: less range with time.   Without data for the whole fleet we simply don't know how it will behave over time.  \n\nWe do know that early Leaf packs did poorly in hot climates, but we don't know how the new ones will do.",

So you would be increasing the strain on the grid power and increasing use of fossil fuels from power plants which is the dirtiest of polluting energy sources.\n\nFinally, you need states to go along with any mandate and we are in the middle of a pandemic that has wiped out state budgets and they will need major funding for any massive grid expansion to bring those renewables online and install infrastructure for charging. \n\nI am all for EVs , FCEV and public transportation and getting off fossil fuels for all uses but if we start mandating EVs before we have those renewables in place you will hit a massive amount of resistance that could completely undermine the move to renewable energy and it will be especially harmful to lower income people.\n\nDon't put the EV cart before the renewable energy horse.",

It's the same for scooters but it depends on the limits set by the manufacturer and how often you charge it anyway.\n\nElectric car manufacturers recommend  not charging to 100% if you don't need full range to preserve the battery. It would be a nice option to be able to configure the BMS on scooters with an app to tell it to stop battery at 80-90% for everyday usage, and 100% for extra long trips :)",

Come in last, take all the credit, leave the party late. 🇺🇸\n\nNo, but seriously, lots of the \"standardization\" work happened in the US thanks to European and Asian auto manufacturers basically ignoring EVs.\n\nSince SAE defined the levels, we got to name them. L1 and L2 are separated by their voltage (120 versus 240), so that's why you get the levels where they are and the naming that you get. It's historical convention.\n\nFor what it's worth, you can use IEC conventions. They have 3 AC modes with 2 types per mode, so that's super fun to memorize. But you get your Mode 4 DC charging with no good distinction between low end and high end power ratings.",

I'm looking for something that is relatively affordable ~30k USD, and have fallen under two different cars, the Nissan leaf and the Chevrolet bolt. \n\nI would go with the leaf any day of the week, it looks better in my opinion, it has a fairly similar mile range, larger trunk space and it even charges faster. But the more I look into EVs the more I see that Chademo is kind of going away here in the US.\n\nSo I'm here to ask for some opinions, would you guys get a the bolt, the leaf, or a third car that I haven't considered?

Good heat pump water heaters can be had for ~$1500-$2000, less with any tax credits (I believe there is a $300 US federal tax credit, double check) or local/utility subsidies.\n2. The annual energy savings is going to be dependent on your cost of power. Lower cost of power, lower per year energy savings. Higher cost of power, faster payback/breakeven period.\n3. All come with at least 10 year warranties (which is typically the same period as a well built resistive or gas fired water heater).\n\nHydro One in Ontario is ~8 cents/kwh (clean nuclear and hydro) if I recall, so for yourself, probably not a lot of benefit.",

The question is why do people stop on roadtrips, to eat, drink, stretch their legs and so on and where would they want to stop. The idea is to spread the chargers out instead of concentrating them. And get them to places people would like or need to stop anyway. \n\nA good restaurant with a chargers a minute or two from the highway might be more attractive than a charging station with many chargers but only a fast food joint directly at the highway. \n\nThe businesses opportunity to convince smallerish businesses to get a charger in their parking lots might be better than trying to compete with big companies operating service areas at the highway.",

"comment": "&gt;I mentioned in another thread the structural pack is more about removing the floor than simplifying the pack, so seen through the lens of eliminating  the need to stamp the floor (ie. vehicle production simplicity, rather than pack production simplicity) it becomes less surprising there's a minimal weight saving.\n\nI agree. I don't remember if it was you I was talking to in another thread, but a similar discussion, I mentioned that Leapmotor's CTB configuration on the C01 provides some really good perspective on this. In their implementation, the pack has no topcase — the topcase *is* the floor, which remains with the chassis when you pull the pack out. It kinda shows you that there's more than one way to skin a cat here.\n\nBionicast is interesting. That's the EQXX? It appears to be generatively designed — I imagine Tesla could replace the existing casts with something like that in the future.",

Tesla is great at many things, but doesn't mean they are better here. \n\nIMHO, Enphase is the \"Apple of residential roof-top solar\". Are there cheaper ways and vendors? Yes. \n\nBut, is there a safer, more resilient/redundant PV system with tight battery integration, micro-grid forming micro-inverters,  advanced real-time panel level and grid-level diagnostics? What about warranties? No sir.\n\nUntil the PW is LFP, residential shoppers should plan otherwise, or not install anywhere near their home! If PW3 is LFP, then it becomes a good option for those retrofitting systems that can't or don't want to tie into an ecosystem like Enphase. But, the Franklin and some others are already there for that need today. PW is a good product line, but not for residential....yet.",

"comment": "I don't think you should worry about what plug your new EV has. Adapters are really not a big deal, especially since they'll just be dumb hunks or plastic and wires, since NACS uses the CCS communication protocol. The existing Tesla -> CCS adapter is cheap ($175) and merely reconfigures the locations of the various wires. The reverse adapter that CCS cars will use to plug in to NACS chargers will be equally simple.\n\nThe three EVs you mentioned are perfectly fine choices (though I unfortunately can't answer your cargo space question regarding the Polestar), but none of them really stand up to the Model Y in terms of value proposition. \n\nThe Y can be had for just over $40k (after federal tax credit), *and* you can get one pretty much right away, no matter where you are in the US, and it has a fold-flat cargo area with *tons* of storage space. None of those other EVs offer that at the Y's price point, and they're also all shorter range (especially if you go for the long range trim for $2,700 more (adds another 50 miles).\n\nI think your next best option is probably the Ioniq 5, assuming you can find one without markup and with the features you want. But that's unfortunately a big IF.",

"comment": "If I'm understanding what you're saying correctly and it's literally a smart plug like these https://www.amazon.ca/TP-Link-HS103P2-Smart-Plug-White/dp/B07B8W2KHZ then I would absolutely not be doing that. Here's why:\n\nWith the J1772 standard (or NACS or EU standards), when your car is not plugged in, the EVSE (\"charging station\")'s connector has no voltage on the main pins, because its contactors are open. It waits for you to plug in a car and have the proximity and pilot pins act to indicate that a car is plugged in and wants to charge. Only at that point do the contactors close, and 120V, 240V, or whatever gets applied on/across the main pins. When the contactors are engaged, the car should not be pulling any current. It should wait to detect voltage on the pins, then start drawing current, ideally gradually ramping up to full power over at least a few seconds, rather than going straight from 0 to 12/32/48A instantly. When the car is done charging, it stops drawing current, and signals the EVSE to open its contactors.\n\nThis process has one key advantage that using a basic smart plug eliminates: there is no \"loaded cycling\" of a contactor. There should always be roughly 0A (maybe 0.001A or something like that) of current flowing through the contactor whenever it opens or closes. This means that there should be little to no arcing.\n\nWhen you use a basic smart plug to _start_ charging, I'm not too worried about that. There'll be a little arcing when its contactor closes, just as there is when you plug an EVSE or a phone charger or just about anything else into a receptacle, just from the onboard electronics' inrush current to power on, but that's expected and designed for in these smart plugs. What I would be worried about in smart plugs is using them to _stop_ charging, _while your car is drawing, say, a full 12A_. There would be significant arcing in the smart plug when you do that.\n\nTheoretically, are these smart plugs rated for 15A, and would it be logical to assume that the contactor should withstand opening/closing while 15A is being drawn? Sure. Is it necessarily true that you can use a smart plug, most of which are realistically used for lower-draw loads like lights and stuff like that, for any length of time, but particularly over months or years, routinely using it for a 12A sustained load that maybe sometimes runs for hours at a time, and at other times regularly cycles its contactor while that 12A load is active? I'd be very concerned about doing that.\n\nThe right way to do this would be an automation, assuming that your car can be automated (e.g. Tesla has an API that can control charging). Keep the EVSE plugged directly into the receptacle with no smart plug, and have an automation that monitors available solar power and commands the car to start and stop charging using its API. That way, the car will be able to properly start/stop drawing current before/after signalling the EVSE to open/close its contactors without an active load.\n\nOther than this, I'm not too worried if you have a quality EVSE. For example, the tesla wall connector, and some other models that are sold for residential usage, are routinely installed in locations like parking garages, shopping malls and other retail locations, etc., where multiple cars may be plugging into/unplugging from them throughout the day. These EVSEs have contactors that should be rated for many thousands of cycles over their lifetimes, and usually a warranty between 3 and 5 years. Doing this with the 120V EVSE that comes with a car, that may not even really be intended for daily charging as much as occasional usage, but at most is probably expected to have 1 or 2 on/off contactor cycles per day for a few years, may not be such a good idea. As for the car's onboard charging circuitry and battery, I don't feel like there's much need to worry on that end, I'd think that even in EVs that aren't so well engineered, it's probably in the manufacturer's interest to have contactors in the OBC that are rated for a good number of lifetime cycles, as the OBC is covered under the 8+ year battery/EV warranty in most vehicles.",

If one type is really the better option, majority of consumers will choose it.  \n\n\nSo now you’re moving the fossil fuel subsidies goalpost?  Now it’s “incentives”\nInstead of subsidies.  So we will need to do same for Renewables then, add tax preferences, R&D aid, and Tax incentives.  Mention was of subsidies, which swing heavily in renewables favor.  And for that Forbes reporting of EESI data?  It added health costs as part of the “incentives” listing. \n\nWow, way to move the goalposts to meet your narrative.\n\nAs for ending subsidies?  End them all would be my option.  Costs of renewables have dropped, companies were already spending to construct more power generation and power storage.  It is happening without those subsidies or “incentives” already.  Heck my local Electric CoOp was 35% renewable by 2019, way before any another tax credits/tax breaks/incentives/subsidies…\nWhat do you wish me to cite directly?  The subsidies for each field for 2023?",

"comment": "&gt;...if the effect of that regulation is to ensure that energy companies and not taxpayers bear the cost of that risk isn't that a good thing?\n\nI didn't say regulation isn't necessary.  What we have, though, is strangulation wearing a regulation costume.  The executive order banning breeder reactors is a prime example.\n\n&gt;I just have a tough time imagining that it can outcompete solar if we're not socializing the cost of its risk. Solar is just so much simpler by comparison - throw a bunch of mirrors out in the desert and we're set.\n\nSorry, but solar only provides power for maybe 1/3rd of the day.  To make solar competitive with nuclear requires a secondary energy storage system that is far more expensive than the solar panels themselves.\n\n&gt;Electrified roads would be great, but tremendously expensive, and we'll need EVs that can use them before they make sense.\n\nThe prototypes being built use induction, IIRC.  It is true that they would be expensive, but they may be able to function as distribution lines as well.\n\n&gt;SkyTran or similar sounds great too, but convincing Americans to abandon their cars and use public transportation of any kind will always be a big challenge.\n\nAll it would take is one major city to deploy it.  The speed of getting to one's destination compared to cars would go a very long way to ending that American love affair with cars.\n\n&gt;I don't know why the Civic CNG remains the only production car out there available to go that route.\n\nI'm confused by this as well.\n\n&gt;It's cheap and plentiful now, but eventually it'll have its supply problems too, so it can't be a long term solution like EVs can.\n\nIt will outlast oil by a couple of decades, so considering the longevity of cars, that is really not much of an issue.  One thing to consider with EVs is that they require a very petroleum intensive road system, just like other cars.\n\n&gt;Whoever said anything about doing that?\n\nWhat almost always follows talk of the negative externalities of oil: taxation.\n\n&gt;...and EVs allow for access to this cheaper form of transportation energy.\n\nYet the price premium of the vehicles negates the cost of cheaper fuel.  This is even more true in the secondary (used) market.\n\n&gt;Phasing out per manufacturer effectively puts those companies who assumed the risk to invest in EVs early on at a huge competitive disadvantage should another company decide to jump in later.\n\nThey should have first mover advantage and various intellectual property from related R&amp;D, though.  I do agree that phasing out by manufacturer makes no sense.\n\n&gt;I pointed out above that the only CNG car out there isn't that cheap.\n\nThat is really because of lack of availability.  There are lots of CNG cars in other countries.  If whatever is preventing them from being sold here changes, I expect the price will drop quickly.\n\nMy response to part 2 will have to happen much later today due to time constraints.",

"comment": "Well, solar photovoltaic panels/modules directly generate electricity in the DC form. \n\nSolar thermal systems like the one you mentioned heat up salts which store the heat and then are used to heat up water to power a steam turbine and then generate electricity. \n\nYou can see that the two technologies are extremely different and for solar thermal you have to factor in turbine and generator efficiencies whereas solar PV would only require an inverter to transform DC to AC (which is at about 95% efficiency). \n\nMy gut feeling is that for AC electricity solar pv modules are more efficient. But when you factor in scale and the projects become larger, the costs of solar thermal plants become extremely attractive. \n\nas /u/Centmo mentioned, multi-junction cells are extremely efficient (in the late 40% range) when compared to single tandem cells we most commonly see (at roughly 20%). Again, in this case the scale of the project is an important factor. \n\nedit: I just read your response to Centmo and if you want to generate electricity in your backyard, go with PV. It's  a far better system as it does not have to be maintained and just sits somewhere for 25 years until you have to check on it for any damage/wear. Solar thermal for residential scales is best for just the thermal portion, not generating electricity.",

"comment": "&gt; Water electrolysis is sufficiently efficient, especially if considering a \"use it or lose it\" situation during noon PV peak.\n\nIt sounds like you favor H2 because it allows distributed storage of excess power. I think it would be most efficient to send distributed excess peak PV power into the grid, to be stored in [pumped-storage Hydro.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity) \n\nThe wiki link claims efficiency upwards of 70%, which is similar to electrolytic efficiency, and skips the 70% loss from a fuel cell when it needs to be converted back to energy. [This paper by a Duke research scientist](http://people.duke.edu/~cy42/PHS.pdf) has the following to say about PSH efficiency:\n\n&gt;*The round-trip efficiency (electricity generated divided by \nthe electricity used to pump water) of facilities with older designs may be lower than \n60%, while a state-of-the-art PHS system may achieve over 80% efficiency.* \n\n\nPumped storage is already in wide use, with a relatively low tech barrier, and scaling to industrial size has proved effective. Here's a case study: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_County_Pumped_Storage_Station\n\nOne of the major benefits would be that it makes use of the existing electrical grid, which is one of the biggest positives of a battery-electric ecosystem - everything is already in place. High voltage wires are solid state. Distributed H2 production would require entire cottage industries to develop, like electrolysis repairmen. It would be hugely complex at scale. \n\nThe hurdle would be implementing a net metering system that credits each home for its contributions to the grid, which is a software solution instead of a hardware solution like distributed h2 electrolysis and storage.",

The large scale stuff isn't really new.  Are all decades old and aren't really improving much. flywheels, pumped hydro, compressed air, etc.  The cheapest form of battery storage for static operations is *still* lead-acid, a technology over 100 years old.  You might see some progress with the big liquid batteries that have been proposed, but they require huge amounts of antimony, probably more than we can dig up.  \n\nKeep in mind as well that if storage somehow *does* become cheap, it's just as easy or easier to oversize your base load production and release stored energy to the grid during peak load.  In fact, it's probably easier.",

"comment": "Generally speaking, to maximize solar exposure, solar panels in the southern hemisphere should face north and solar panels in the northern hemisphere should point south.  Hence the Australia (which is in the southern hemisphere, for those who slept through junior school) comment.  Since I see that your buddy's location is 39N 77W, that points me to somewhere in Maryland, United States, Northern Hemisphere. \n\nIdeally, all of your buddy's solar panels should be installed facing south, but without more knowledge it's really hard to tell if that's the best option.  First, is there even space on the south side of the roof for the additional 12 panels?  My guess is probably not.  Perhaps there is a giant tree or building throwing a lot of shade on the roof.  I don't know.  Rest assured that those panels will produce electricity, just not as much as the ones facing south.  \n\nI'm not sure what type of system your friend has, but many home solar systems can use the Enphase Energy website and app to track the production of each module or panel.  Hopefully, that will be helpful to show how much less the northern module or panels produce. \n\nAlso, most leased system agreements force a customer to purchase everything the system produces at a rate less than the standard utility rate.   If the customer uses more electricity, the customer just buys power from the utility at the regular rate.  That could explain why your buddy is still paying for power from the utility. Also consider that solar systems produce more in the summer than the winter so take that into consideration when assessing the current production.",

"comment": "As an avid Aviation buff, and someone who thinks that these kinds of things are just cool as hell, I've got to say that this kind of article makes me ashamed to be associated with this group of people.  The solar impulse aircraft are technological advances.  No, they are not in any way practical, but then, that isn't the point of them.  \n\nEarlier this year, or late last year (I can't remember which) there was another aviation first: a human powered helicopter that rose up to 20 feet or so and flew for something like a minute or two on human power alone.  It was a marvel of engineering, and a testimate to the human spirit that we have accomplished something so profound.  Sure, a small gasoline motor would have been able to do it easily, but that's not the point.\n\nYou guys know me, and you know that I don't give a rat's ass about the claims that the world is about to heat up to unlivable levels.  But, please, stop cheering on stories that seem to be all about saying anything other than gas or diesel powered vehicles are total failures or laughing stocks.  We should be better than this.  Do we think that we've reached the pentacle of technological innovation, and will never move to anything else?  Is an Overhead Cam, piston engine the highest achievement we ever need to make?  For fuck's sake!  \n\nWe need to cheer on people who are attempting to fly around the world on sunshine - not because we should all do that, but because it's that kind of spirit that brings us new advances, new ways of doing things.  It's the same spirit that the first airplane racer's had in the early years of the 20th century, with their dangerous machines.  Back in the day, it was much more sensible to take the train than to try to fly an airplane.  But, look at where they are now!\n\nSo, let's encourage those who push the boundaries, who want to try to do the nearly impossible.  Let's not cast their ambitions into the mud, just because we want to live in the past.  Oil is our best fuel today for the machines that do the day to day work of today.  But, using electric engines, batteries, solar panels, hybrid energy systems, might not be such a bad idea, if it makes us more able to do what we want to do.  If we can learn to use them now, and continue to improve them, we might just find that we can use something we learn to do great things.",

Most residential customers pay a flat $22.50/mo regardless of how much they use.  After that, for solar customers, they do net metering.  That's (IMO) the most fair thing.  EVERYONE gets charged the same \"access fee\" and electric rates (and credits) don't need to be inflated (deflated) to find that magic formula that's \"balanced\".   The problem with those coefficients is that it will benefit some and hurt others.  Much simpler to just line item the grid maintenance.",

A brand new car company, which is trying to fund itself on Indiegogo (meaning the founders don't have the industry experience and connections to get real investment), is going to produce a production vehicle with a battery the size of a new Nissan Leaf for less than half the MSRP?\n\n50 kW motor? With a supposed 6 person capacity, trailer hitch and ~90mph top speed? That's 38% less powerful than the motor in a Leaf, which already has less horsepower and worse acceleration (past ~25MPH) than any comparable 4 cylinder car, and nobody's towing anything with that.

"comment": "I'm assuming with a pool and ac, you're in a hot sunny place. What is the current state of your roof? How many years of life are left in it? It's good to coincide a roof job with a rooftop solar installation. Or at least make sure the roofer who holds the warranty on the roof will honor it after solar installation. Typically you need to make penetrations in the roof to install solar and you don't want to have your contractors pointing fingers if it leaks. Also, you don't want to install solar then re-do the roof a year or two later. \n\nI've lived in a house with a pool and that thing ate so much power. Do you know if your state has net metering? That will make a difference in what system size you will want. \n\nSolar city really pushes the lease and takes advantage of the tax credits. I think they inflate their outright ownership price to make the lease more attractive. If there are local installers in your area, you can definitely shop around. A lot of shops can help you with financing too.",

Once you've started working with a company you can then begin to gain experience and further education toward the NABCEP PV Professional certification, which is representative of a highly qualified solar installer.",

Everything online seems to indicate it's fine for daily charge/discharge cycle.\n\nBut you are correct, if we are just talking about emergency backup then solar system wouldn't need to be larger.  If we are talking about daily charging to provide power at night, then need to look at cost of powerwall vs cost of grid.  Can't just assume battery and extra panels to charge the battery will be cheaper than buying electricity from the grid at night.",

"comment": "I have a quote for solar, and we made a down payment. Just wondering if it is a good deal considering this is a full turn key solution. USA, MN. \n\nTotal price 42,895\n\n41 panels JA Solar 295 (295 Wats each)\n\nLooking online, the panel costs would be around 8k.\n\nSo 35 k for the installation, inverter, grid tied, and a cool monitoring app. 10 year warranty on installation, 25 year on the panels.\n\nWe have net metering, so excess generated is pushed back in to the grid for us to use later. \n\nIs 35k a realistic cost for the installation, warranties and everything minus the panel costs?\n\nThanks!",

"comment": "Well the thing can take 1.1kW of DC power so you would need 4 of those panels. Granted you only get the perfect 1.2kW from direct sun, real world might be closer to 20 miles a day?\n\nYou could still make an EVSE that tries to soak up any excess solar by alternating between 0A, 8A, or 12A that keeps the Kodiak at 70%-80%.\n\nWorth it? I think with a Kodiak+1.2kW solar you get enough energy to run a fridge or microwave during an outage, and without an outage you get a little 'free' electricity. A generator makes nothing when there aren't issues and you need to supply it with something that can go bad for it to work. Granted it could be cloudy after a storm...\n\nI wonder how feasible it would be to be able to have a grid tied system and in an outage redirect the panels to the Kodiak. Then you don't have to worry about a special EVSE, use the solar power now, but during an outage can still use your 1.2kW+ worth of panels. I read where a Kodiak can charge from the grid but can it also act as a grid tied inverter?",

"comment": "This is the point I keep trying to hammer on people. \n\nIn the last 4 years I have made extreme changes in my life (very extreme). Examples are converting my land into a food forest instead of grass lawns. Going to EV's and charging almost exclusively from green sources. Growing roughly 80% of my own family's food. Reducing my waste to near zero, and infact even upcycling other people's waste. Composting every once of my food, but also I pick up restaurant scraps and compost their waste which would end up in bags emitting methane. \n\nAll of these things have actually made my life better in every way conceivable. Growing my own food has easily surpassed the monetary investment I put into my trees and bushes (1000-ish trees/bushes). I eat healthier than I ever have. I am more active than I've ever been. I'm outside more. [I get to watch my land come to life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZMKhxu0vRI&amp;t=1659s)\n\nThe fact of the matter is, a green economy can be very profitable. Not just for the green companies but for the individuals in it. It's just simply not profitable to destroy the planet. I can save money on heating if I burn my furniture, but only for this season, and only if I don't take into account the fact that I either have to then replace it or I no longer have it. If I ignore all those costs, then sure, I should burn my kitchen table in the fireplace this winter. That's basically what a dirt coal economy looks like. It's what mining agriclture looks like. Farm soils being depleted isn't on anyone's yearly financial sheets, but it should be. If it were, the cost of monoculture cash-crops would be more in line with their true price. And regenerative agriculture would look more and more the straight up financial benefit that it is - because it regenerates soils, not depletes them.\n\nThere is no reason we need to transition into a lower energy economy when we have free solar energy bombing down on us 365 days of the year. The true secret is 2 things:\n\n1) More food growing on trees, LOCAL to the people eating it. That means we need to resist against HOAs, and we need to celebrate the person with tomatoes in their front lawn, and chickens in their backyard.\n\n2) Solar panel infrastructure and clean energy infrastructure everywhere. Remove subsidies for polluting industry, and create subsidies for green industry. Either that or just remove them all, but ensure the true cost of environment destroying industries makes their financial cost in line with their environmental cost. \n\nWe need to ensure that ANY carbon we burn is spent in a smart way - developing the infrastructure to transition into renewables. Solar panels on houses is just such a smart way to do that, not only because it is \"green\", but because it decentralizes production - which means minimized distribution I^(2)R losses. Then we need better storage (as you mentioned). And we need significant baseload generation - which in my mind nuclear is the best current solution. We need to get on that though, because nuclear plants are nearing end of lives and need to be refurbished - and new nuclear plants can take 5-10+ years to build.",

Even so, youd need to be getting a rebate from your energy company to get the price that low. 3.57 minus the tax credit is only 2.80ish.\n\nOncor rebate isnt a guarantee, and apparently require a battery, which are on back order across the board. Very interested to see how they shaved another .30 / watt off of your price.\n\nI do not recommend Tesla for that reason, but Austin has companies that have been around as long as sunpower with much better pricing. Generally speaking, the \"top tier\" equipment isnt so much better as to justify insane prices.",

"comment": "California has a lot of higher prices for things as well, we (generally) want clean air &amp; such. At least part of the cost of living here is getting what you pay for. That's not the same as saying we're getting the best deal we can, or denying how outside forces are messing with things, but consider the recent comparisons to Texas. \"Cheaper\", but when you start digging it's not what you think.\n\nOne note in regards to utilities... IMO we're seeing something of an emergence of people actually wanting to fix things, for the first time in my adult life (I'm an older gen xer). We absolutely are having reactions on the other direction, both here &amp; in other states, but I don't feel like it will be business as usual.\n\nThere's also the point that power generation isn't the same as the petroleum industry. Even ignoring home generation like solar, we're not relying on the same kind of middleman to be constantly supplying fuel for an item we own (this in reference to false claims that materials for EV construction or solar PV, for example, compare to needing a constant supply of oil).\n\nTo be sure it will be rough and there will be hard fights. Also, there's no guarantee of a win. It might even be location or time based; see California's late 90s power problems (thanks Enron) and most of Texas' current woes. But frankly, I won't personally let perfect be the enemy of good - however we stumble we're at least pointed in the right direction.",

"comment": "I'm not an electrician, but I am willing to put money down and say no installer will backup your A/C solely on IQ8 sunlight backup. Couple of points in the scenario you presented... 12kW is the \"rated\" size, but that is ideal and you never get that. Next you're limited by your inverter sizing... assuming 1.25 DC:AC ratio then the maximum you will ever get is 9.6kW. Then again, that is ideal setup, ie ALL panels directly south facing and likely only for a few hours per day. If you have panels facing different directions, then you'll never reach that peak because different facing panels will be receiving their optimum sunlight at different times of the day. Once again, that is only a few hours mid-day. After 3pm in summer your solar power starts dropping off strongly, so doubt you can run A/C after then. Also, A/C have a high start-up power spike, more than the 3.5kW you used (which I feel is low for a A/C, but that depends on the unit). PLUS, I assume you'll want to power the other things in your house at the same time, so you need to add that to 3.5kW example you used. TLDR: No, I don't think that is enough power to run you're A/C, especially when you probably want to run it the most (after 3pm).",

"comment": "At $12k per, no wonder.  Do some due diligence, there are a few out there for half that price.  Batteries are becoming more affordable over time.  Major patents are due to expire over the next few months that should result in price drops.\n\nThe most critical number needed to figure out if storage is the right decision is the cost per kWh over the life of the equipment.  I calculated recently that a component sourced system (not using tesla powerwalls) has a lifetime cost of about $.07 per kWh.  Compare that number with the cost per kWh from your electric provider.  Anywhere it costs $.30 or more per kWh you can easily justify the cost of storage.  If - like me - you are in an area with $.14 per kWh, it is a lot harder.\n\nThere is also a consideration of being in an area subject to outages.  I had a 7 day outage in the last 2 years due to a winter storm. (no, not Texas)",

Also, if these are solar panels on the \"out\" each branch should be fused, at an appropriate level (fuse size is usually listed on he panels).\n\nIf there is no solar in your diagram, I think you're posting in the wrong sub.",

"comment": "> If so, why did you allow Angela to shut down your nuclear power, exposing you to Russian energy dependency?\n\nYou seem to be confused. Germany was dependent on Russian gas even before the nuclear phase-out and it wasn't Merkel who decided to phase out nuclear power, that was already put into law in 2001. The hope of the German governments was that Russia would behave and not become an adversary due to economic entanglement. Such an entanglement is pretty much what fused the EU together. And it also wasn't something unique with Germany, France tightly cooperated with Russia aswell.\n\n>Thank goodness for new sea-delivered LNG ports\n\nWell, if Germany wouldn't have planned with continued reliance on natural gas burning, and started to phase it out like, for example, [Denmark](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-consumption-by-source-and-country?stackMode=absolute&country=~DNK), there would have been much less of a need for LNG terminals.\n\n>You & the rest of the West needs to de-risk from Chinese dependency.\n\nNot sure, what you mean by \"you\", but I agree that it is concerning to leave dominance in many areas of progress to China.\n\n>Germany risks access to rare or China controlled earth's.\n\nEh, rare earths are found in a lot of places, that the western countries have left its mining to China is just down to the fact, that they do it cheaply. Also, which rare earths are needed for renewable power generation specifically?\n\n>Just as critically, your manufacturing prowess & jobs will disappear.\n\n*I* don't have manufacturing \"prowess\", I guess you mean Germanys. Which very well may be true, mostly because they stuck to Diesel and coal rather than to embrace EVs and energy storage.\n\n>VW was a world leader in EVs & gas cars\n\nThat may be, but their EVs never really were pursued or gained any traction. And in this century the thing that VW is known for is [Dieselgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal), ie clinging to Diesel for as long as possible. I'd say it's the biggest failure of the German automotive industry to not pick up technological leadership in EV development and leave that to Tesla and China.\n\n>China's cheaper EVs threaten that.\n\nTrue. And it was kind of obvious that it will come like that, nevertheless the incumbent auto producers rather opted to delay and bank on their ICE vehicles rather than preparing for the inevitable electrification.\n\n>but it sounds like your manufacturing leadership in the EU is at risk over unnecessary climate-alarm.\n\nNo, it's at risk because corruption and entanglement of incumbent players inhibited faster adaption to new realities. As they say: if you don't go with the times, you go over time. This kind of disruptions are observed again and again in various sectors and situations.\n\n>are merely shifting CO2 emissions & other pollution to Africa & Uygher areas.\n\nAgain, you are pretty wrong on that. [Consumption based CO2 emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions#consumption-based-trade-adjusted-emissions) try to incorporate the effects of trading with the embedded carbon emissions. And these have been falling over the last decade in [the EU and the US](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/production-vs-consumption-co2-emissions?country=USA~OWID_EU27).\n\nGlobally, the growth of annual emissions have slowed down over the last ten years. That's not nothing, that is slowly turning the boat, while working towards the [sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), of which the first one is to [end poverty](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1).\n\n>Your economy will decline while China gladly continues opening two new coal plants weekly\n\nPossibly, however, I don't think burning coal in your vicinity is particularly desirable. And considering shares in overall production, coal is [declining also in China](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-elec-by-source?country=~CHN) (share of electricity from coal declined from 75.46% in 2012 to 61.33% in 2022), their low-carbon power sources are actually growing faster than coal.\n\n>Your nuclear was a ship that never should have sailed.\n\nExcept that nuclear power wasn't used for heating and industrial processes, where gas was used. And also would require electrification of automobiles to be of any use there, which didn't come to pass, not even in France which embraced nuclear much more.\n\n>Now LNG & Chinese ships will sale your way & fewer Germans will have jobs.\n\nYou are right about the LNG, and I think that its high cost actually will promote a faster transition away from it. The rising importance of China as a trading partner also hardly has anything to do with the roll-out of renewables. As I explained earlier, Germany in particular was perfectly capable to produce solar panels, before they left that field up to the Chinese a decade ago. Whether there'll be fewer jobs in Germany depends to a fair part on how well and fast the automotive industries will turn around and get a grip on EV production.",

First the problem was the methane could not be replaced for fertilizer production. Then it was that electrolysis costs energy. And now its that we need a lot of energy and your brain has trouble comprehending numbers bigger than the number of fingers you have.\n\nYou are being deeply unserious right now.\n\n\n> And you can retrofit entire cities?\n\nYes.\n\n \n> Bud, you're peddling theoretical technology sectors. It's not on me to prove that something that doesn't exist doesn't exist.\n\nHeatpumps exist since the 18th century. Electrolysis exists since the early 19th. These technologies are older than the internal combustion engine. Again, you are deeply unserious.\n\n> You're acting like we're already swimming in solar PV and wind energy. Drowning in it!\n\nWe aren't. But things are scaling up so hard, that soon enough we will be. And once we have plenty of clean energy to work with, I'd rather our fertilizer industry is ready to switch over rather than the weird \"Lets stop using fertilizer so half the world starves\" you seem to be trending towards. \n\n\n> Look at the energy mix again.\n\nDamn, looks like wind and solar are the fastest growing energy sources in history. Thanks for proving my point.",

"comment": "Lmao at you running to reddit for answers of something you have no idea about to “own the conservatives”. I work in the solar industry. Its not all roses and daisies. Solar produces a lot of trash and waste when installed. Any time you clear cut hundreds or 1000’s of acres of land and put a massive electrical generator system on it that is going to have an effect in the ecosystem, like dirt runoff into nearby waterways and reduced grazing for native animals. The panels dont tend to last as long on commercial solar farms, so they are replaced at a faster rate than residential. There are whole graveyards of non functioning solar panels, however some are recycled or scrapped. Its still a better option than conventional energy production but there are valid concerns that should be raised and people have a right to voice them. Stop with the holier than thou crap.",

If you don't trust the person or company behind the contract in the first place, it's probably better not to do business with them.\n\nThe devil is in the details.  There's all kinds of \"weasel\" words in contracts to watch out for...  Timely, Satisfaction, reasonable.  Obviously if someone feels that they are being screwed over because their house is leaking with water damage from the install, fixing it in a \"reasonable\" time frame of 2 months isn't okay, but it might be to the company.  \n\nAnyway, your parents can obviously help out with the green movement and solar panels...  In due time.  If the company is too new, it won't be the end of the world if they wait another year to let it develop.  If you're being pressured into a time sensitive contract, then let it pass.  Life will go on as it did before and you won't have missed out on anything.  Any \"reasonable\" business will still be around in a year or two to take your money when you're ready.\n\nJust my .02\n\nGood luck!",

A few weeks ago an article got posted on /r/atheism saying atheists and liberals have higher average IQ, and /r/gaming pats itself on the back whenever an article is posted going against the \"games cause violent behaviour\" theory.\n\nNot to mention that this topic seems to be arguing about a connection between morality and whether vegans miss eating meat, which is completely unrelated to the veganism/IQ story that seemed to provoke this.",

That's just my opinion, downvote it if you want, as you apparently are dv'ing opinions you don't agree with while you ask for input and whore for attention. Don't you have some meds to take or a kid to watch out for...  (Feel free to take all this personally. I really have no respect for this submission.)",

I don't think because you follow a moral code it makes you religious.\n\nYou just said following Buddhist precepts makes Buddhism a religion.\n\nThat means following Vegan precepts makes Veganism a religion.\n\nIn actuality, I'd say they are both philosophies.  \n\nThere are Christian philosophers, like St. Thomas Aquinas.  But there is also a \"faith\" component to Christianity.  There's no \"faith\" component to Buddhism.  There's no \"faith\" component to veganism.  I think the lack of faith is the difference between a philosophy and a religion.\n\nIf you type in \"Buddhism religion or philosophy\" in google there are only **26 MILLION HITS** in the results.  So you know... the fact that you are so fucking sure it is a religion is astounding.\n\nIf someone asks me to name world religions, I would always include Buddhism.  But that doesn't mean that's necessarily accurate.\n\nI guess it'd have been easier if I'd have just posted the image that's the top comment in this thread, since that's all I was getting at anyway.",

Gonna go get me some soy beans to munch on :)\n\nIt sounds like everyone is getting enough iron, but just a note for any newbies - many recommendations are made on the basis that we absorb ~18% of the iron we eat, which is about right for an omnivore. However, it's estimated that on average vegans absorb only about 10% of the iron we eat (though our bodies do to some extent naturally increase absorption in times of need, and decrease in times of excess). \n\nWhat am I getting at? The RDI of iron for an omnivore woman in her twenties is 8 to 18mg. The RDI for a vegan woman is 80% higher (at about 14mg to 32mg daily if my maths is correct).",

Why is this important? Because if you are preparing a meal for somebody who is a vegan then they won't appreciate your individual interpretation of the term as you serve them something that to you is vegan but goes against the accepted meaning of the term.\n\nWe're not talking about ancient history, as the word vegan was coined in 1944 and for the purpose of describing a non-dairy vegetarian who also did not eat eggs.\n\nThere is no room in either the definition of strict vegetarian or vegan for somebody who eats eggs. We aren't debating a product that was created on a production line or in a facility where milk products or eggs are used. These things are unavoidable unless one chooses to forgo any products they don't plant, harvest and prepare themselves. When a product lists eggs in its ingredients, it is not vegan or strict vegetarian.",

"comment": "&gt; I live in New Zealand, so I think some industry practices may be different. One thing in particular is that there are various brands of free range eggs that have SPCA approved stickers on them.\n\nWhile industry practices may differ from country to country, there are a few fundamental realities that apply to egg/dairy farming pretty much everywhere because otherwise the economics just doesn't work:\n\n1) Chickens live naturally to 15 years. They don't lay eggs those entire 15 years. Their egg productions drop rapidly when they reach 18 months old. It's not economically viable to keep millions of hens around for over 10 years after they stop laying eggs. Hence egg farmers kill their hens at a very young age once their egg production drops. \n\n2) To replace the hens that are killed, new chicks must be hatched constantly. Half of the new chicks hatched are male. They can't lay eggs. It's not economically viable to keep millions of male chickens around for 15 years earning no money. Hence they are killed also. \n\n3) Cows live naturally to 20. They don't produce milk those entire 20 years. Their milk productions drop rapidly when they reach 5. It's not economically viable to keep millions of cows around for over 10 years after they stop lactating. Hence dairy farmers kill their cows at a very young age once their milk production drops. \n\n4) To keep producing milk a cow must have calf over and over. Hence cows are impregnated once per year. Half of the calves born are male who can't produce milk. It's not economically viable to keep millions of male cattle around for 20 years earning no money. Hence they are killed also. \n\nFree-range doesn't change any of the above.\n\n&gt; what veran substitutes are there for eggs and milk, do they work in baking, and how do they taste? \n\nFor egg you can use flaxseed meal, apple sauce, [vegg](http://www.thevegg.com/), [ener-g](http://www.ener-g.com/egg-replacer.html). I've had cakes baked with apple sauce or flaxseed meal. They were delicious.\n\nFor dairy you can use soy milk, coconut milk, almond milk, hemp seed milk, and other nut milk. I like them far more than dairy. But then again I never like dairy to begin with.\n\n&gt; how would you feel about adopting chickens, raising them on your own property, and eating any unfertalised eggs they lay?\n\nI think it's great. Chickens are one of those most abused animals in the world. If you can provide a home to rescued chickens it'd be awesome. Just make sure you're adopting rescued chickens and not buying from breeders. Also keep in mind eventually the chickens will stop laying eggs and will keep living for years afterward. You can't view them as egg laying machines. They are pets no different from cats or dogs.\n\n/u/tbrizzle adopts rescued chickens. Here's 2 threads about her rescue:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15yjzz/i_adopt_hens_from_factory_farms_whenever_i_can_i/\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1953hm/reddit_meet_orvill_clucknbawker_my_little_buddy/",

Simmons is a wealthy one-percenter whose history of economic exploitation of poor people (remember the [rushcard](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/rushcard_s_failure_underscores_the_need_for_postal_banking_poor_americans.html)?) is quite in line with that of the Clintons--who, btw, are never ever going to challenge Big Ag.\n\n\nIt's great that Simmons is a vegan, but his integrity is not indisputable.",

There was always that one meal my parents made, i told them always \"when are we having that again!?\" So my idea... find that meal! Have them asking for it.. branch off of it slowly to discover vegan meals similar. Use it as a foundation. For example... whT if that meal was falafel bites. Crunchy delicious.  With falafel you can do infinity things with it in different meals. So you find The Ingredient and you can play around with different interpretations of it. What about Vegan Pancakes? And what about vegan milk for cereal? My fave is Silk Nut Protein milk from cashews, taste just like whole milk to me. Boom, you solved breakfast. Just a challenge to find winning ingredients for all 3 meas :) i would love to offer more Outside Perspective ideas just let me know what youre struggling with!",

I don't think I need to kill a human being to condemn finding joy in that as an activity.\n\nI did fish a couple times as a small kid, but I don't even remember if I caught/killed any fish. I've killed insects and if I felt anything, it was grossed out (and not out of any ethical consideration; this would predate veganism).\n\nI do find it disturbing that, outside a context of hunting for survival where the alternative is literally death, one can take pleasure in the death of another creature. To me, that's rather horrible and sad. There are so many ways to find joy and satisfaction in our lives; why kill for that? What does it mean to feel joy or satisfaction because you've unnecessarily ended another's life with violence? \n\nIt doesn't surprise me that satisfaction or joy may be common responses; I guess that seems logical from a survival instinct perspective. But as you've said, emotional response does not indicate morality.",

They should not kill their chickens, I always advise them not to buy more and give the eggs to other omnivores so the demand of factory farm eggs drops a little bit and less poor birds suffer in those. You want to make it black or white, but it's not.\n\nWe live in a world with a lot of animal product inertia, we vegans do our best not in the best conditions. Some people argue that plants that have had animal manure as fertilizer are not vegan. But is it even possible to transition to alternatives in a blink? I don't think so. It's about doing the best we can, we are getting better.",

Try mentioning the negative impacts of two completely unnecessary substances - coffee and chocolate - you'll start hearing crickets or self defense.\n\nTry saying you don't care about animals, you go down quite fast.\nTry saying it's a good idea to eat the mistakenly bought animal products instead of wasting it away; to hell with you, animals are not food.\n\nI'm also hesitant to call myself vegan for quite some time now. It has become a really strong, ugly word in my opinion, so I would rather describe the lifestyle itself, rather than using labels, which people don't even understand to begin with.",

Because they have no say in the matter and because socially and legally I would in fact be owning them.\n\nBeing cutesy and calling them family members doesn't change anything about that.\n\nAnd harming hundreds of animals in order not to \"\"harm\" one animal is not vegan, no matter how you want to think about it.

"comment": "Oy. Ok well to start, the assumptions you made and continue to make are telling. Assumptions around internalized bias, and using it as an invective is itself quite the fallacy when you don’t know me. The assumptions around my gender, and sexual orientation are also assumptions that led to you making weird passive aggressive digs about my genitals which were…bizarre? Idk, but if you were as lefty as the language you use…it is just a bad look. I think you know better.\n\nThe “internalized disdain” for marginalized people is also weird. It feels like a shield, meant to weaponize the language of intersectionality to silence critics. Again, you don’t know me, my biases, my history. The arrogance of assuming so is typical of fat liberationists, but it’s still remarkable. I don’t know you. I made some assumptions about you, like suggesting you were just coping. So I’m sorry about that. \n\nLook, there’s an insane amount of data when it comes to obesity and health. It’s long term, but it’s there. It seems like you are just repeating what FA influencers say, so I would suggest keeping an open mind to the scientific literature, which is beyond robust. It is conspiratorial the way many argue doctors are just evil, or biased, or that everyone is merely swayed by cultural norms rather than the profound evidence collected over the last century plus. Diabetes type 2 and most CVD are spiking both in the west, and the most predatory capitalist areas of the developing world. And both diseases killing SOOO MANY are entirely preventable. Genetics loads the gun, but lifestyle pulls the trigger. These afflictions are hitting poor and marginalized people hardest because of the material conditions associated with late stage capitalism. It is really fucked up, and it is a structural problem, not a moral failing of individuals. \n\nThe biggest issue I have here is the way FA influencers selectively apply leftist ideologies in a manipulative way. It only helps the massive moneyed interests of the mega food industries (including Animal agriculture), the most bougie and privileged, or else those who are deep into a cycle of addiction and want to stay there. There is a reason why the diet industry exists, as vile and predatory as it is. You’re right about my anecdotal evidence. It’s paltry. But I can say as someone who has clawed my way out of that cycle of addiction that it was just as hard as other addictions I have clawed my way out of, that may be less offensive to you (I suspect you would give me a round of applause), and that I take just as much pride in overcoming. I have a ton of empathy for addicts, as one myself. \n\nAll these things you say don’t matter…they matter, save the fact that one’s intrinsic value is not tied to how obese you are. I am 1000% with you there. I don’t know you, your body, your age, or your soul. I do know that your life and mine are fleeting and precious. I also know that whatever the flaws there are in the scientific literature, (and there are MANY) dismissing them all is the same thing that right wing ideologues do for stupid shit like carnivore diets, and only serve to advance the interests of mega corporations like Nestle, Coca-cola, Unilever, etc at the expense of the world’s most marginalized people and animals.\n\nI hope you are well and wish you nothing but the best.✌️",

There are *many* ways we can influence people/governments/etc. to be more environmentally friendly, thus offsetting the negative impact of our existence.\n\nBeyond that,  even if \"conversions\" is the only activism you do, you don't have to convert 70+ people to full on vegans... you can influence people every day to choose one vegan meal, or try vegamuary or meatless Mondays, etc. \nIt would also depend on what age you converted people, how long they live, and how long you live. Plus, you probably used their \"average\" number for an individual's carbon footprint, but these theoretical kids would have a footprint much lower than that, thus requiring fewer conversions. Also... there are other ways we impact the environment than just carbon footprint.\n\nAnyways, my general point is it's far more complex than it appears on the surface.",
