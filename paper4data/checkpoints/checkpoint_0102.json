"comment": "Why is it a BS title warning?  the car was in the garage.  It caught fire.  That's what the title said and is, in fact, what happened?\n\nAlso, Tesla needs to start making the right comparison.  I really don't care how much less often a Tesla catches fire compared to a gas vehicle.  How about Musk start making a comparison with other electric cars on the market right now?  Like, say the Volt and the Leaf.  \n\nWhy doesn't he?  Because, compared to a Leaf or Volt, the Tesla is infinately more likely to catch fire.  Because there are no fires in the Leaf and the Volt.",

"comment": "As a brand, they are remarkable, and fascinating from a marketing perspective.\n\nThey don't advertise, as far as I know.   I've never seen a print ad or a TV ad or even an Internet ad.   \n\nGrab any lifestyle magazine and have a look at the luxury brand ads for things like watches, cars, handbags... even Apple spends a boatload on print ads in technology and lifestyle publications.\n\nBut not Tesla.   They have managed to take a product sold by every other vendor as \"green\", and sell it as luxury and technology.\n\nThey're doing something so different that the finance, technology, and transportation sectors all sit up and listen.\n\nI don't think Tesla Motors could be what they are without a personality like Elon Musk.   Internet billions, dramatic divorces, another business building freaking rockets to Mars.... all of that feeds into the mystique of a little car company making a single high-tech sedan.\n\nI think that's why nobody else can replicate Tesla's marketing success.   GM or Ford or Nissan could come out with a sleek sedan with 300 mile range and sub-4-second zero-to-sixty times and it just wouldn't be the same because Tesla has all the sexy and mysterious and stylish points locked up.\n\nI drive a Focus Electric, for example.   It's got enough screen real estate to be able to do about half of what Tesla does with their touchscreen.  But instead it's got a barely-enhanced version of MyFordTouch that I can get in any high-spec gas fueled Ford.\n\nIf GM hits it out of the park technologically with the Volt 2.0, they are still going to fall flat on their faces with marketing.   They've already said they are going to rely on existing Volt owners to promote the car.   In part, I think that's because they have vastly underestimated how important Musk's personality and other businesses are to the success of Tesla Motors.\n\nIf I were them, I'd hire Bob Lutz back to be the voice of the Volt program.  He could basically do a Lee Iaccoca impression and he'd be awesome.\n\nFord's lost Alan Mulally, so they have no business superstar to headline their electrification project, even if they cared to do so.   The best they can hope for is a celebrity spokesman.   They really did well hiring Mike Rowe to promote the F-series  pickups, but then fell back to stock footage of spinning wheels and muddy jobsites.",

When the public believes that obama is hitler and they choose to be against agw because the other side realisednits an issue. Its pathetic how climate change became politiczed.\n\nThe basic fact is acting sooner is cheaper and more effective. I honestly believe tesla will make positive changes simply through free market. Their road map for electic cars is impressive. Secondly we see another issue with public opinion and a lack of scientific understanding. Nuclear energy. That would be a great thing to switch of our energy too but people are afraid of nuclear for no good reason.\n\nSo the publics politicized lack of understanding doesnt supercede scientific evidence. Besides its really only in America where you find so many skeptics...since it became a political issue for people to take sides.",

"comment": "Your Leaf is a first generation product that is due to be replaced in 2017 or 2018 with a product that has double the range. The cadence for your Leaf is 1 hour of driving at highway speeds, 45 minutes to charge with a 50kW CHAdeMO EVSE. That isn't a cadence that most people with put up with and so to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, especially taxpayer dollars to enable a slightly longer operating range is ridiculous.\n\nMany people need to charge now just for running around town in a first generation BEV that isn't a Tesla. With the coming 2nd generation BEVs with double the range, that won't be the case. With 150 miles of range on tap, there would be almost zero reason to charge at a grocery store, Walgreens, or pretty much anywhere that your car will be at within a city for the vast majority of commuters in all weather. The charging infrastructure will need to cater to out of town guests and the occasional top off, which means shopping malls, hotel/motels, theme parks, and work places. \n\nWith the future needs of a destination charging network in mind, for the cost of putting a single 50kW CHAdeMO/CCS combo unit, a hotel can put in 20 x 80A J1772 or 40 x 40A J1772. For 10 BEV's staying overnight, would you rather move your car to the EVSE at 2:00am and come back at 2:45am, or just have the the 10 plug into a J1772's overnight? Of course destination charging will be on L2 charging and long range BEV's will need 40A to 80A charging. With up to 150 kWh batteries for long range BEVs, we'll need to up 80A charging to keep charging times under 8 hours.\n\nOn the other hand, to support long distance trips, a 48 kWh battery that can charge at up to 2C will want 100 kW DC charging. That's a cadence of 1.75 hours of driving, 45 minutes of charging. Not great, but much better than the first generation Leaf. Almost tolerable. Or a 60kWh battery that charges at 1.7C (Tesla Model S 60), which is a cadence of 2.25 hours of driving, 35 minute charging. A 50 kW charge point is really not worth the price. Basically, anything less than 100 kW will be seen as pretty much useless except in emergencies. But the price for such emergency chargers is way too high.",

"comment": "Big Oil’s Disruptive Climate Change: Oil majors face a real risk of stranded assets—and not just related to efforts to limit carbon emissions.\n\nBy LIAM DENNING\nMay 6, 2015 1:48 p.m. ET\n\nEven as oil rallies back above $60 a barrel, obituaries are being drafted. Oil majors face questions from shareholders concerned the threat of climate change means some of the reserves underpinning the companies will never be produced. In a recent report, HSBC urged investors to plan for this risk of “stranded assets.”\n\nThe risk is real—and doesn’t just boil down to efforts to curb climate change.\n\nOne warning: Saudi Arabia’s decision to keep pumping despite the drop in oil prices. Apart from taking market share back from higher-cost rivals, the country’s oil minister has indicated concern about long-term demand in the face of technological and regulatory threats.\n\nAlmost 1,400 climate policies had been enacted globally by 2013, according to the International Energy Agency, up from less than 200 in 2005. Meanwhile, although electric vehicles remain a tiny part of the global car market, they have grown phenomenally from virtually zero only five years ago.\n\nOne argument against such concerns is that oil-company valuations largely reflect the value of proven oil-and-gas reserves, likely to be produced before any serious disruptions happen.\n\nSuch thinking only holds, though, if you assume future cash flows will be distributed rather than reinvested. That is plainly not the industry’s way. In the past decade, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron collectively reinvested 66% of operating cash flow, according to data from S&amp;P Capital IQ; buybacks and dividends equated to just 46%. Reporting first-quarter numbers last week, Exxon and Shell barely covered capital expenditure with cash from operations while Chevron’s free cash flow was sharply negative.\n\nIn addition, more than half the last decade’s capital expenditure was spent post-2010. While producers test project economics under different scenarios, much of that investment was made at a time of triple-digit prices and the sector was clearly blindsided by oil’s collapse.\n\nThe dynamics of this drop, coming amid a massive investment boom, bring the threat of stranded assets much closer to today. Surveying 37 large oil companies, Citigroup estimates as much as 40% of the current investment cycle—about $1.4 trillion—may have gone into or be going into projects that struggle to generate acceptable returns at oil prices below $75 a barrel. Oil sands and liquefied natural gas projects—which require large upfront investments and long schedules before generating positive cash flows—look especially exposed. Right now, Brent crude futures for the next five years average about $74 a barrel.\n\nUltimately, the mismatch between those prices and project economics set up another cycle of investment falling, supply tightening, and prices rising again. But in this cycle, there are two added risks.\n\nFirst, the shale boom, which helped generate the excess supply weighing on prices today, represents a deflationary force. Productivity gains have reduced break-even prices for U.S. oil output, making some shale basins more competitive than traditional sources such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Russia. And the recent rally on signs of U.S. production flattening out also enables exploration and production firms to finance future drilling.\n\nSecond, Saudi Arabia’s decision to prioritize market share is also deflationary. If Riyadh is genuinely worried about increasing regulatory and technological curbs on long-term oil demand, it has an incentive to keep pumping at high rates. Cheaper oil helps to deter or delay efforts to limit consumption. More important, if you produce a commodity and suspect its days may be numbered, then it is far better to get as much out of the ground now rather than wait.\n\nThis is the dilemma in which Big Oil finds itself. Having sunk billions into the ground in recent years, several majors are banking on a rebound to triple-digit oil soon. Such an outcome would offer relief initially. But it would also enable rival supply from shale producers with much shorter production cycles and spur greater efforts to make Saudi Arabia’s deepest fear a reality. Oil demand doesn’t have to disappear altogether to leave a producer with stranded assets; they can just be sitting on uncompetitive ones.",

"comment": "Excellent question!\n\nYes, they are still sealed lead acid, but these are the ones typically used as the backup universal power supply at hospitals. The seller works in facilities management at a hospital and said he got \"a good deal\" on them, but strangely didn't have paperwork, so draw your own conclusion from that.\n\nYES! You can upgrade the batteries in any way you want, depending on your budget and stomach for adventure.\n\nThe best bang:buck ratio would be electric power tool lithium ion batteries. They give far better performance, far longer life, have greater power density (so you can go lighter, or stay the same weight with vastly improved capacity.)\n\nIf you wanted to take it a step further, you could actually pack way more of them in since they are smaller and easier to fit in odd places, so you could up the weight a tad and get a LOT more.\n\nProblem is the cost. Six lead acid batteries are going to cost $600-900 for the set, depending how nice you want to go. You could go quite a bit higher if you wanted, but once you get past a Sears Diehard, there's really not much room for improvement.\n\nConversely, a lithium ion retrofit will cost:\n\n* Easily $3,000+ for the batteries. Think $80 each for something slightly bigger than your fist times an awful lot of them.\n\n* The cost of retrofitting the battery compartments. If you're handy and have the tools, this could be less than $100, but if you need it done by a professional, it's going to cost a mint.\n\n* Testing and understanding how to wire in series/sequence so you still end up with 72v. Anything else will cause problems.\n\n* May also need to change out your heat monitoring system, since it's Lithium Ion batteries have different thresholds and you don't want to set your car on fire.\n\nOnce the Tesla Gigafactory comes online, the batteries may become less of a cost prohibitive issue, but for now, this is strictly a neighborhood car.\n\nAlso, it charges exclusive via extension cord, which is the very slowest charge possible. 4 hrs can get you to 60-80%, but a full charge is going to be 8hrs on average. Perfect if you can plug in at work and at home, less ideal unless your commute is under 10 miles.",

"comment": "Well it's a pretty complex answer so I'll try my best in the time I have..\n\nGenerally you need to first see where the best installation for your situation is, factoring in shading and other values.. essentially meaning will it be ground mounted or will it be on a roof? \nThat question will give you an idea of what Panel supports you're going to have to buy ( you could search up the company Schletter for an idea of what mounting supports are)\n\nYou also can't directly connect one panel directly and call it a job done.. you need several components; a Charge Controller, an Inverter (Fronius is a great company for both these components) and a Battery Bank (Tesla Power Wall for example). When you have everything properly connected in theory a panel will charge whatever your house is connected to or you could run a single line to power the things you want like you said a Refrigerator.. \n\nIn Canada the Energy companies usually use Net Metering, meaning if you use 1500kWh in your house and your solar system was able to inject 500kWh, then your bill would be 1000kWh. So, if you had a superb system you would be paying the energy company less because you'd be sending them more power.\n\nI hope this helps give you an idea",

Can it be the sole vehicle for every household? No. But for a family with more than 2 kids, nothing can be the sole vehicle short of a three-row SUV or minivan.\n\nI appreciate what Tesla is doing with their networks but it's just snobbiness to look at anything that isn't exactly a Tesla as worthless, which is what you're saying when you call something a \"compliance vehicle\".",

"comment": "I've built a couple electric Z cars. Easy to work on, big \"engine\" bay, relatively light. But it's difficult to fit enough batteries to hit your goals unless you use the absolutely highest energy density cells available - Tesla 18650s. \n\nI like to go direct drive but it's difficult to get right, stick with a transmission. And don't buy a DC motor, AC is the way to go now, especially if reliability is a big concern. Regen braking is fantastic.\n\nI'd do 7 Tesla modules with an AC-51 motor. Around 400 pounds of batteries, 100 for the motor and whatever the transmission weighs. You could fit all this under the hood, no wires to the trunk or split battery packs. Weight and handling would be almost identical to original engine.",

Now there's 390 kg's of other materials that are also mined that are also required for the battery, but we were focusing on Lithium. In retrospect 1kg of Nuclear will get you around 45,000 kwh of electricity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/f/fuelcomparison.htm](https://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/f/fuelcomparison.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this isn't an Apples to Apple's comparison. But you would need to mine nearly 40,000 kg of lithium to put out as much energy as a single kg of uranium. Also, Lithium needs to be replaced in 5-10 years. So that 40,000 kg of lithium would need to be mined again and again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow these are just hypothetical, and I know that. I love battery technology and alternative energy where it's economic, and where it replaces fossil fuels, but nuclear isn't too bad in those situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to answer your other question about where nuclear is the only viable resource you can take a look at: [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51946.pdf](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51946.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe long answer is there's a lot of potential, but the problem is the hurdles. Arizona for example has a lot of potential with solar, but it gets incredibly hot, and there have been fires. Not to mention how expensive it would be for everyone to install it. I'm perfectly fine with Palo Verde generating 3.3 GW of energy while we figure out the technological hurdles of Alternative energy. It's incredibly viable from a climate perspective. Especially when you consider that there are costs to every decision. Fossil needs to go, but Nuclear should be ok.",

Depending on the state, the bottom line can be even less than 35k. (5k credit in CO, no sales tax in NJ, etc). \n\nWhat Tesla is promoting on their website is no different than buying an appliance at Home Depot with a main in rebate. There's the price; there's the price after savings/rebate. Yet no one rage comments about how HD engages in false advertising.\n\nAnd the fuel savings - comparing a 27 MPG car (Mercedes 300) to a 116 MPGe car (Tesla) - is about 1k/year. So over a typical car ownership timeline, Tesla *understates* the savings, IMO. Compared to a PHEV, of course, fuel savings may be more in line with 4k.",

"comment": "They are in small quantities, so there are definitely some installs going up, but most of the people who signed have been pushed back by years or canceled. They're on version 3 and still working out the bugs: \n\nhttps://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/06/08/first-tesla-solar-tile-roof-installed-in-massachusetts/\n\nThey also need to figure out how to install them faster. Labor costs are quite high. You can see in the link above that one of the jobs took 11 crew members 11 days. I'd estimate that same install would have taken a standard 4 man install crew 1 day with regular solar panels, 2 days if there were PowerWalls.\n\nTesla Solar Roof on the OP's house would likely have cost at least $200,000-250,000 and taken 6+ weeks to install, if Tesla even accepted doing that job. Currently, they're only accepting simpler roofs for the Solar Roof.",

For example, all the Electrify America chargers near me are 150kW.  I've yet to actually find a 350kW charger, but if and when I take a road trip I'll certainly try to find them.",

Rental cars need to fast charge because the renters can’t usually charge at home, they’re staying in a hotel, etc., while traveling, and often need to drive significant differences. Something like a Tesla Model 3 would make a lot more sense…",

People need to remember we are more than twenty years away from no ICE and at minimum ten from when they are not sold new.  \n  \nhowever when I bought my TM3 back in 2018 one of the best stops was at a Sheetz in Pennsylvania. They had an adjacent Tesla Super Charge site they kept cleaned and free from people blocking. Apparently their food is really good as they had separate parking just for the store.  \n  \nand there is Buc-ees who is still building new 100+ pump sites plus ev charging.  \n  \nso yeah they are going away and the best benefit it lack of damage to environment from all the seepage from tanks and spills from refueling.  \n  \nimagine a day where parking lots don't have oil stains and you can really understand how EVs will change the environment.  petrol vehicles leak and some do it a lot.",

"comment": "The hard part about any generation classification is that it is easy when you’re looking way back, and gets very hard to classify anything recent. You have to be able to look back on it far enough to see the historical jumps.  It takes time to say “ok, *that* feature was so significant it delineates a generational boundary.” \n\nI consider early (early 1900s) EVs, golf carts, the CitiCar, and EV conversions with acid batteries and brushed DC motora with 50 mile range to be of a certain generation.  The GM EV-1 had regen, inverter drive, and areodymics and a custom body, and on board inductive charging and all the creature comforts of ICE and is a generation gap ahead of the earlier EVs.  The first Tesla Roadster used lithium ion, a purely inductive AC motor, could go more than 200 miles, could accelerate in a class of its own, and was another generational jump beyond the EV-1. The Tesla Model S was another generation jump beyond the original Roadster.  It had DC fast charging, and liquid cooled batteries, and direct electric power steering. \n\nThe Leaf, the Chevy S10 ev, the Ford Focus EV, the Rav4 ev… they all fall in the middle of those generations as well.\n\nOnce you get to the Model 3, where the pack is integrated with the power conversion system, and the car is produced for mass consumption, I think it’s another generational jump. \n\nI would wager that 48 volt low voltage with low voltage Lithium Ion batteries and steer by wire is another generational jump, but time will tell. \n\nThe Prius (not an EV, but an electric drivetrain for the masses) and the Volt and the Bolt all fit somewhere too.   It’s complex, multi dimensional and open for debate.  It’s why I was hoping someone else had already done most of the research and work on it.",

They're definitely satisfied with the shoddy build quality for the most part to date, I get that. Most tesla owners love his antics. Wall Street loved his ability to make headlines in the past. But even last year the articles about elmo were more mixed between positive and negative, and now media has realized people love to hate on the POS more than praise him. Maybe there's enough new people to ignore his shittiness? We'll see. Now because I've potentially settled on getting a truck that's not a full BEV my opinion is not even valid apparently. You realize that's a brand new option not even available yet and the sales cycle of a new vehicle is long right? 99% of people take longer than a day to decide on a new vehicle so it is possible I've strongly considered BEV vehicles for my purchase that I've been thinking about for a year or two now. The ability of having a vehicle that will be on battery 99% of the time, and if I choose not to, I'll never have to worry about a charge station, no matter how fast tesla's is if I want to is the most appealing thing, add to that the ability to power my house in a week long power outrage? Fucking sold. Best of all worlds. \n\nAnyway you're emotionally attached to elmo for whatever reason. Maybe you like that he's a POS and support that, you do you. I'm emotionally attached to hating him now cause I hate bully POS. So I don't think we'll ever agree.",

"comment": "I just had to go through a process over a ticket received at an EV charging station in California. I got a 440.00 ticket for parking and charging in a dual use disabled access charging spot. I was parked in one of 2 charging stations in a private parking lot. In California we have guidelines (not yet law) for building and using public and private EV charging stations. \n\nI went to court and won my case and got my ticket dismissed so these guidelines are for real although they are not yet law. The judge said I had done my due diligence regarding researching the rules for charging so she dismissed it. We don't take a chance anymore despite the legality of it. Fighting the ticket was a hassle. I tell everyone about EVG250.1\n\nEVG250.1 states:\n\nADVISORY: EVG-250.1 General. While there is no positive requirement to provide\n\nelectric vehicle charging stations, when they are provided a portion of them should\n\nbe accessible. When co-located with parking spaces, electric vehicle charging is\n\nconsidered the primary function of these stations, not parking. Accessible electric\n\nvehicle charging stations are not to be reserved exclusively for the use of persons\n\nwith disabilities. They should not be identified with signage that would mistakenly\n\nindicate their use is only for vehicles with placards or license plates for individuals\n\nwith disabilities. \n\nSorry I can't get the link to the full guidelines. Just search EVG250.1 on google and the first result will say State of California and show the full set of guidelines.",

I would suggest they make a 90kWh pack while reducing weight, their cells are far from the most energy dense on the market so it is achievable. Also moving to higher power density motors for the performance version for weight reduction, I bet a single axial motor at the rear could provide the same 1/4 mile acceleration time with a different gearing and maybe sacrificing some top end speed, maybe limit it under 150mph/250kph. This could reduce weight by at least 100kg, likely closer to 150kg for basically the same performanceexperience  for daily driving on public roads.",

I also don't understand your dirt, mud, and road grime argument.  These cars work great in real world conditions. Have you seen the video that is linked here? The video also provides a counterexample to your orientation argument.  Not to mention that people who own cars with solar panels would likely keep them clean.  They are not using the cars to go mudding.  I also don't buy your claim that \"we need every solar panel to make as much clean power as it can.\"  Solar panels are being produced at enormous rates now and the costs keep coming down.  If there were a demand for solar panels on cars, the manufacturers would oblige.  There is no shortage of solar panels. I agree rooftop solar needs to become more ubiquitous as well, but there's no reason we can't do both at the same time.",

"comment": "Anyone see this comment and care to comment?\n1.  All the \"Climate Scientists\" receive grant for results.  The Corporate Science behind them is overwhelming.  \n\n\n\n2.  In the 1980's, the Technology world was all a buzz about the electronic car and solar panels.  I still recall doing a report on the subject and recall, strongly, the chief economic views were that there was no viable market.  \n\n3.  Global Warming became a whisper in the 1990's.. and the resulting change has turned the group in #2 into a billion dollar a year market.  Too coincidental to brush off.  \n\n4.  The resources to build solar panels and solar cells are only recyclable up to a a maximum of 5% to 10%, depending on whether we are talking internal or external parts.  The remaining parts need to be mined, processed and constructed... which is actually just as polluting, since the materials are also carbon based.   The same components, being carbon based, as subject to degradation, which is carbon emitting.  And there is no true discussion about the effects of decaying solar panels and related.\n\n5.  Electronic cars and solar panels depend on batteries.  Batteries are prone to degradation and leaking.  The primary components of batteries are alkaline and acid.  Neither of which are good for the environment, nature or humans.  They are only partially recyclable.  Only 2%-10% of old batteries can be reused, depending on the previous usages.  0% of a leaking battery can be recycled, especially one that has leaked into the water table.  Alkaline prevent natural plant growth at a level comparable with nuclear radiation.  \n\n6.  99% of the data produced by Climate Scientists is the result of models and calculations of their own design... meaning they are taking selective information, computing within their own set perimeters, to get results.  If their results do not come out favorable, they rework the algorithm or say the calculations are flawed....  \n\nThey do not actually use real time data.  But it's available.  NOAA records EVERYTHING... so, if there is a true \"change\", it should be visible.  You can pick the historic records for any city and see there is no definitive pattern change...  since this has been supposedly progressing since the Industrial Age, the definitive pattern for ANY and all cities should be self evident...  not dependent on future calculations.\n\nSuch as Portland, if the Climate Was changing, the average rainfall for a 20-30 year period (couple climate cycles) should be definitively in one solid direction, but checking the data, they are not.  Record highs and lows are all over the chart in terms of dates.\n\nIn conclusion, there is just as much to doubt, and what is extremely alarming is the way individuals who are strongly anti-Corporation, fail to see that the strongest benefactors for \"Climate Change\" has been the Corporate World.",

"comment": "Yeah, exactly. So we don't radically have to stop using oil all at once:\n\n&gt; “Keeping it in the ground” does not mean stopping all production of fossil fuels instantly. “If you let current fields begin their natural decline,” says Kretzmann, “you’ll be using 50 percent less oil by 2033.” That gives us 17 years, as the wells we’ve already drilled slowly run dry, to replace all that oil with renewable energy.\n\nSo I have no idea what you're talking about. Does we have to be quick? Yes. Does it mean we have to stop fracking? Not necessarily. You can replace other oil fields with fracking installations to be less dependable on foreign material (which is very important to the USA).\n\n&gt; And I have not seen anything from the clinton campaign that approaches that.\n\nTrue.\n\n&gt; Now we could do it in a controlled way that would massively reduce the likelihood that people will suffer. Mandatory veganism, ban cars, one child policy.\n\nYou can get to the numbers mentioned in your article without banning cars or forcing a child policy (which are both VERY radical):\n\n* Banning meat\n* Mandatory A+ insulation for all houses\n* Air conditioning only in combination with solar panels\n* Banning new ICE car registrations by 2025\n* Banning domestic/continental flights\n* Getting rid of lorries (very important in Europe)\n* Massive investment in renewable energy (doh)\n* Massive investment in international railways to greatly reduce the number of ships\n* Introduce CO2 tax",

"comment": "Let's put it this way:\n\nFor $100k, my customer gets a auto-start renewable generator, a 22kW all black solar array, a 122 kWh industrial FLA battery + watering kits with a DoD/cycle curve that approaches lithium ion, and a 12kW double Schneider inverter system with all the bells and whistles. Then he chooses his appliances wisely for load leveling and shifting, and then adds a lithium ion battery for demand management in a couple years.\n\nOr for $100k from an Sonnen installer, the customer gets a 10 KW array and a 35 kwh lipo4 battery. \n\nI have no doubt which is the 2018 model racecar, but I'd rather sell the client a cheap battleship and add a racecar as the prices drop. \n\nFor now. Could change as soon as a year.",

Of steel production ? Of computer chip production ? Of clothing production ? Of water purification (both in and out? ? Of waste recycling/burning ?\n\nWhy should we have a small electric powerplant at home ? Why should we pay 2-3x more to get electricity produced by a home powerplant ?\n\nAnd Tesla home batteries are complete jokes from an economic perspective. The price of the battery is like 10 years of electricity consumption. And as it's not enough to go fully offgrid you still need to pay the utility to be connected to the grid.\n\nIt's part of Musk wonder PR to make batteries for grid storage cool. And to sell to people in remote areas who are using oil generators. And to sell to a bunch of survivalist extremists.\n\nAlso, batteries require a full electric transformer at home that costs 2000€. Usual rooftop solar needs to be balanced with the grid. When the grid goes down, you cannot use the electricity of your solar pannels at home. Batteries need to be connected through a transformer. That transformer also enables your rooftop pannels to work during grid blackout.\n\nOverall, battery+transformer is very expensive. It's only justified if you are truly offgrid in the countryside or if you are rich and want to spend money on survivalist safety.",

The panel size may be needed to handle all the loads plus the PV \\and powerwall backfeed.\n\nMakes sense, I don't want to upgrade to 400A service as I'll never use that much power and the costs just go up.\n\nI think they are saying this because they need the 400A bus from the panel?\n\n---\nEither way, I think you and I have the same idea when you say this:\n\n&gt; If you want to keep some loads out of the backup you could change the main panel to a 200A feed through panel. Put your non-backup loads in there and use the feed through lugs to feed 200A to the Tesla gateway.\n\nI want to put my pool and _future_ EV chargers here.\n\nI had mentioned this to my installer, which I probably worded it incorrectly, but they just shot back with:\n\n&gt; Main has to have no other breaker except Gateway supply breaker and main breaker to comply with 705.12.(D)(2)(3)(c)\n\nIt sounds like you're saying what I want to do is possible?\n\n---\n\n&gt; They may be suggesting a 400A panel to cut down on the number of electrical boxes though.\n\nThis is a possibility, but I have plenty of wall space to get this all done and don't mind the additional boxes. So I can bring this up with them.\n\n---\n\nWhile not perfect I think this drawing most close to what I had in my head.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HRWME8I.png",

Either way the studies were wrong, that’s undeniable because they contradict each other. In the case it’s already irreversible, there’s not much I can do. I like solar panels more for monetary reasons than environmental reasons, and I’m bound to get a tesla for reasons other than it being environmentally friendly. I can do my part without particularly caring.",

One of the big reasons for that, is we can't store this energy efficiently enough and we'd need 200% current grid production to cover the night.  Not to mention grid power regulation would become a nightmare. Fusion will replace fossil fuels, unless alarmist send us to the dark ages before that can happen.",

"comment": "Would highly recommend not having the roofer install flashing. While it would be great for the solar installer to not have water tightness as a liability, roofers are not solar professionals. They do not necessarily know how the products should be installed and in my experience they rarely, if ever, get the exact layout correct...even with well drawn plans. At least for me, I have never had this work out and if they get it wrong you have big issue on your hands. In the end it does not really save the solar installer any time. All you are doing is effectively shifting the solar flashing work from the solar company to the roofing company",

So what is like .27 cents per kwh blink charges 0.34 to 0.48 \n\nIn portland also they have setup a lot of locations that are free as well since the places that have the parking don't charge for it then.\n\nThere is a grocery story that has 2 charging point stations i go to for lunch or dinner while driving lyft called the Goatblocks that use charging point plugs in a parking garage basement and it its perfect. Every other location i try to use i have had people unplug me because they don't actually want EVs parking there. Like at hotels or resturants.\n\nGrocery stores, theaters, convenience stores, large retailers should all be mandated or at least highly incentivized to add 2 charging stations a year to their parking lots closest to the door. you slowly move down the line adding more and more till they are all charging stations and you can then used covered solar panel parking then that keeps even ICE cars cool.\n\nIt actually makes money for developments to put in the parking lots with solar panels and starts allowing for grid independence and turning blacktops in the green tops.\n\nNot only that the money the partnerships makes by say having it be subsidized by a municipal power company takes load off the grid and provides much needed capacitance and underground generator stations to help create a smarter less critical failure prone grid too. \n\nI mean also three phase power is also becoming a standard in new developments for this very reason.",

"comment": "I am getting solar installed in OKC next week\n I had called the OG&amp;E net metering rep and asked him a lot of the same questions. They want to have a year of service so that you size your system less than 110-120% of your total use.\n\nAs for credits for excess energy sold back to the grid, you will most likely be rolling over credit from one month to the next. OG&amp;E will only write you a check if your credit is greater than $100 or remains after one year.\n\nThe net metering tariff (rate) requires an on-peak / off-peak billing. When you sell energy back to the grid, OG&amp;E has an algorithm to determine an average price you paid for energy over the time period. This average price is the amount that you are paid for any energy credit. Thus if a majority of your energy was during off peak hours, your price for energy sold back to the grid is closer to the off peak rate.\n\nThe way their tariff rules are written is very difficult to understand. I had a lengthy discussion with the OG&amp;E rep and he was very helpful. He was certainly very knowledgeable about all of the finer details.\n\nTLDR: Spec your solar system to meet your needs, excess energy sold back to OG&amp;E will not make you much money.",

"comment": "Wow this is close to my story. I was an audio engineer for 5 years and decided last year to go back to school and change my career to something more directly related to climate change. Also thought about solar installation work.\n\nAs for advice - I decided to job hunt immediately. Why wait, ya know? I applied to 106 jobs hoping I could prove myself without a degree. Strongly considered solar installer jobs. Ended up getting the 92nd job as a lab technician for an optics company. The job is just basic machine operation and minimal office work but it got me into the science/R&amp;D/tech world right away. I'm planning on changing to something climate related later this year. But I found that it was a good idea to simply start with a science-related job in a more technical industry. With businesses opening up, you should be able to land something pretty nice if you're persistent. Technical/operator-level jobs are typically in demand, they make the world go round.\n\nYou should also consider how high of a position you might eventually like, since it would determine what kind of degree is needed. Night school for an associates degree or professional certificate is an option. I already had a bachelors in music so I decided to do community college and apply for a masters. There's different ways to do work &amp; school in a time-manageable way, so education might be an interesting thing to consider if you're thinking long-term.\n\nBut most important advice - Get to work asap. Start now, don't wait. Maybe consider leaving sooner than later. Think about the fastest way to change careers, and aim for that path as fast as you can so you don't lose any time.",

So I'm looking for a system that's going to last me a long time, my options are the SunPower A series or I'm looking at the LG Neon R, both are the highest efficiency, over 22%, 400w systems (I believe these 2 models have come out within a year or 2). I want my panels to degrade less than 10% over 25 years. I can probably get a simpler setup and save thousands... I feel SunPower/LG is a Mercedes Benz, but I can't afford a Mercedes Benz lol. Is that what I'm being quoted in the solar world? I'm looking for Tier 1 solar panels, not looking at Tier 2 level ones. I know I can get quotes here and there but there are specific panels I'm aiming for.",

It's over 3 times more energy efficient to just charge a BEV from that solar power than it is to electrolytize water to generate hydrogen, pump it into a tanker truck, transport it to an H2 filling station, pump it into the station, and then pump it into a car for it to burn to generate motive force.\n\nBEV has definitely won the passenger vehicle battle, and will *very likely* also win the ground transport battle. Air and sea are still up for grabs, though.",

They offer the security of being independent from the grid, they offer the satisfaction that all of the power you use is coming from the sun.  In a few places the net metering/time of use charges are so bad that it can be worth the money.  Most of the time it's hard to justify the $50k+ you'll need for as many batteries as you'll need based on money savings alone.",

"comment": "This!\n\nI ended up getting a large system of 100 panels and 10 powerwalls to basically cover car charging and do some rate surfing. The Tesla / pge virtual power plant program says they'll pay $2.0/kwh for what it draws from your powerwalls during anytime they need it. May not add up to a lot but it's something. I'm just hoping they start the program for SCE.\n\nGetting batteries now with your solar you'll at least get the bigger tax credit vs years down the line. And if you have enough batteries, you could power nightly and use solar in the day so wouldn't need to worry about net metering exchange rates in the future.",

"comment": "###[No Current, Viable Alternative to Fossil Fuels](https://www.cfact.org/2023/02/16/no-current-viable-alternative-to-fossil-fuels/)\n\nDuring his State of the Union Address, President Biden blamed high U.S. energy prices on greedy oil companies despite as former presidential candidate Biden having virtually pledged to put them out of business.\n\nDuring a Democratic primary debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden said:\n\n&gt;No more subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill — period, [it] ends, number one.\n\n&gt;No more, no new fracking.\n\nJoe has largely kept his promise, evidenced by an aggressive war against fossil energy which has included banning of the Keystone XL pipeline along with myriad other executive orders placing regulatory restrictions on drilling.\n\nIt is perhaps forgivable then, that Republican attendees loudly groaned at his ironic SOTU temerity when Biden said:\n\n&gt;When I talked to a couple of [companies], they said, ‘We are afraid you are going to shut down all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them?’ We are going to need oil for at least another decade.\n\nNo, we are going to need oil — and natural gas — for many decades, most likely centuries, because there is no current replacement source capable of fulfilling a huge supply gap.\n\nThose who believe in the existence of adequate non-fossil alternatives essential to achieve a “carbon-neutral” U.S. — much less global — energy balance anytime soon, or at any cost, are dreadfully misguided.\n\nFirst, for some much needed proportional perspective, consider that more than 80% of total world energy (not just citing electricity) comes from hydrocarbons, while much-touted wind and solar account for about 2% and 1% respectively.\n\nHydropower and nuclear combined add about another 11%, with just over 4% of primary energy from nuclear which faces cutbacks with about 25% of existing capacity in advanced economies expected to be shut down by 2025.\n\nBear in mind that it requires lots of that primary energy — again not just electricity — to produce all those solar panels and construct those giant fields of wind turbines.\n\nMaterials must be excavated by heavy machinery, transported to production facilities, melted and fabricated into parts, and then delivered to the installation site and constructed…..\n\nAnd don’t forget those “clean” electric vehicles (EVs) that are supposed to replace gasoline varieties. They need batteries too…really big ones.\n\nEach Tesla-class battery requires mining, moving, and processing more than 500,000 pounds of materials: **20 times more than the 25,000 pounds of petroleum that a typical internal combustion engine uses over the life of a car**.\n\n…..\n\nSo regarding the whole idea of wind, solar or EVs eliminating “carbon pollution” or climate change, don’t believe it for a moment.\n\nThe only thing “green” about any of them will come from pocketbooks of taxpayer subsidies and hiked-up energy costs and other inflation that fall heaviest upon the poorest among us.",

In 2005, Sears Holdings looked like they weren't going anywhere and by 2018 they were defunct (what's left is a different company that bought the name).  \n\nIf I took a SunRun lease, I would have paid $118k, buying the same system from a local installer, even with interest it's $58k.  If the local installer goes out of business, I can do a lot of repair work with that $60k savings.\n\nThe only thing to worry about is a bankruptcy in the short term - between payment and PTO.

"comment": "Thank you for emphasizing the importance of a holistic environmental perspective. Let's address the points raised:\n\n1. **Mineral Mining Impact**: You're correct that the production of solar panels, like many electronic components, involves the mining of minerals. Mining does come with environmental challenges, including habitat disruption and water pollution. However, the industry is increasingly moving towards sustainable mining practices. Additionally, research is ongoing to develop solar panels that use less of these minerals or substitute them with more abundant, less environmentally impactful materials.\n\n2. **Recycling and Reducing Waste**: The solar industry is also actively developing recycling technologies to repurpose used solar panels and reduce waste. As the industry grows, so does the emphasis on creating a circular economy where old panels are broken down to create new ones, thus minimizing the need for fresh raw materials.\n\n3. **CO2 and Its Role**: While CO2 is a naturally occurring gas and plants use it for photosynthesis, the current rate of increase in atmospheric CO2, primarily from human activities like burning fossil fuels, is leading to global warming. The natural balance is being disrupted. Too much of anything, even something as essential as water or CO2, can be problematic in excess. The rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 is a primary driver behind the current trend of global warming.\n\n4. **Broad Perspective on Solar**: It's crucial to remember that no energy source is without impact, but the goal is to choose options that have the least overall negative effects. When you consider the full lifecycle emissions of coal or natural gas — from extraction to burning — and their associated environmental and health issues, solar still presents a significantly less impactful alternative.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's essential to acknowledge the challenges associated with solar panel production, the broader context shows that they remain one of the most promising pathways to a sustainable energy future. Continuous research and innovation will likely further reduce their environmental footprint.",

"comment": "From the perspective of an economist working for a regulatory commission in a Caribbean country:\n\nNEM 3.0 makes sense. In fact, NEM 1.0 and 2.0 should have NEVER been approved.\n\nThe idea of one-for-one net metering makes no economic sense, especially in terms of social equity. It is essentially a subsidy for the wealthy, since they are magnitudes of scale more likely to adopt solar than low-income consumers. \n\nWhy it is a subsidy: Electric utilities have network costs to cover. Not only does the utility completely lose out on electricity it could have sold to the household with solar panels (this part is fine and fair), the utility also has to pay any additional electricity the household puts onto the grid, both the generation AND network cost portions of the utility (this part isn't fair). Keep in mind, if the utility went out to the wholesale market for that same quantum electricity, well, it would have to pay around the same as the generation costs ONLY.\n\nSo onto who does this additional network cost that the utility has to pay to purchase this rooftop solar get dumped on?\n\nOnto households that don't own rooftop solar, households that are predominately middle-lower class.\n\nIf one want to address the benefits of avoided carbon emissions, sure, go ahead and factor that in on top of the avoided cost to pay with the rooftop solar tariff. Anyways, thats what the Inflation Reduction Act is for. But to screw over a struggling family that may not be able to afford the up front costs of solar with higher utility bills, just to subsidize rooftop solar owners, is what I call incredibly stupid policy.\n\nA good article on the topic: [https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/2022/11/13/why-net-metering-is-such-incredibly-bad-policy/](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/2022/11/13/why-net-metering-is-such-incredibly-bad-policy/)",

"comment": "My math was off, I forgot we pay every two months not every month.\n\nStill I'd pay off the whole thing by year 5, 6 if global climate change changes the weather and I don't have 4 straight months of nothing but scorching heat and sun, and instead I get Hurricane over hurricane.\n\nyes the 12 canadian solar panels of 610w each and 20% efficiency + the Huawei 60kw inverter cost me a total of $108000 mexican pesos. Installation included that can withstand a cat 2 hurricane.\n\nOne downside is that they came without insurance against natural disasters, I have to get one through house insurance that I will have to budget starting next year. I am covered for installation issues through 1 year, and the inverter has an extended 10 year warranty that the provider has a deal on, and the panels are under 20-25 year warranty, I can't recall exactly.\n\nThe other quotation I got for a similar system but this one did had insurance was $130k MXN but I was really strapped on cash and needed the panels ASAP with cero export mode while the CFE  contract went through and I got the bidirectional meter.\n\nIt was scheduled for paperwork to take 4 months so I needed the cero export or I'd have the panels installed doing nothing for those 4 months (Utility company requirements of absolutely no generation until I get the meter change and they balance loads in the transformers).\n\nThis second company did the business analysis and tops it would take me 6 years to cover the expense and still have 10 to 12 years with no issues of power generation.",

"comment": "The big thing needed is a new narrative around green/clean products. Many conservatives don’t like the idea of subsidizing things for others, and don’t believe that clean energy can lower costs, or think it does at the sacrifice of modern comfort/life. \n\nI would love to see a new narrative spun around the benefits of clean energy products. EV’s can be better for many people compared to gas cars, because they’re just better and more fun to drive. Heat pumps are cheaper to run and give both heating and cooling. Heat pump water heaters have a longer life and are much cheaper to operate. Home battery storage is seamless backup, and also can be used to utilize time based incentives with their utilities. \n\nEnergy independence is a big thing as well. Realizing that US solar and wind production is increasing and that true energy independence is having it at your own home/business. Oil/gas production is at an all time high in the US, but the companies will sell where they can make the most money. People forget that just because there is more of a fuel doesn’t mean it’s the government selling it to Americans, it’s a business who is looking out for shareholders, which means selling it at the highest price possible. Solar on your home gives you 30-40 years of energy that isn’t subject to fuel price volatility. \n\nHaving something that can effectively show the positive impact on people, regardless of party or affiliation, would go a long way in helping the climate crisis without having to even mention it. \n\n(Side note- I’m all for public infrastructure and transit, but as a rural based American I recognize that EV’s will dominate here long before 15 minute cities or public transit is accepted. I love bicycling, having amenities close by, etc., but we have to be pragmatic in our approach and recognize where people are coming from first before we can make any change, never mind something that would be perceived as a major change)",

"comment": "Tax credits for solar panels can be pretty confusing at first. Essentially, when you install solar panels, you can get a significant tax break, which lowers your tax bill. The key is that the credit is a percentage of the total cost of the installation. For example, if the credit is 30% and you spend $10,000 on solar panels, you could get $3,000 off your taxes. It’s worth checking out how this might apply to you through a solar comparison website to get a better sense of savings. I went through this myself and it really helped reduce my costs.",

"comment": ">I am asking specifically if solar cuts off when the power is out, not about battery storage, but thank you to all who replied.\n\nPeople are correct so far - a \"solar system\" will shut off when the grid goes out **unless** it has backup capability.  Now, for most systems, \"backup capability\" means an automatic switch to disconnect the system from the street lines for safety, and batteries because it's difficult to run straight off solar without a stabilizing energy source.  Enphase has sunlight backup, whcih can run solar direct to the home with no batteries, you still need the isolation switch of course.\n\nSo the statement in the article is true, if a bit generalized, because most solar installed today is simple grid tied with no backup capability.",

"comment": "&gt;how come veg/vegans still get shit for wanting to help the planet, be healthier and save some animals? I just don't get it....\n\nHonestly, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this has alot to do with trying to force your ideals on non-vegans. Its similar to Christians who try to force their beliefs on other people, especially when it comes to homosexuality, abortion, pre-marital sex, etc. For example, I get frustrated as hell when I see people with pictures of aborted fetuses or verbally abusing women outside abortion clinics. It makes my blood boil, really. We get that you are pro-life but here in this country we have the right to make a choice. I don't think it's anybody's business to nose into someone else's business and choices. \n\nSo I think that people who choose to eat meat and animal products (not saying we aren't aware where it comes from) want to continue to do so in peace. Trying to force people to turn vegan and attacking them in an aggressive manner for not being vegan doesn't help. In fact, I'd imagine it will make more people that much more adamant about remaining non-vegan.\n\nClearly there are different viewpoints on the topic of what should and should not be eaten, but I think respecting each other's decisions and treating each other with respect would go a long way.",

They do Lent properly and they fast on Fridays or something. So restaurants ought to be used to cooking things without dairy and meat, but you'd have to make sure there was no fish, and probably eggs too (can't remember if that's forbidden or not).\n\nBecause meals are often meze style, it should be easy to mix and match vegan parts. And you're blessed in that the cooking fat is going to be olive oil a lot of the time and not butter. And I'm pretty sure they eat falafel there! I'm sure falafel have saved many a vegan's life (or stomach at least).\n\nHave fun :)",

"comment": "Adding on to everything else that has been posted already, I would highly suggest reading \"Thrive\" by Brendan Brazier. While he does have his own nutritional supplement and fitness line (Vega, which is very good albeit expensive), he has a lot of information about ingredients you should be consuming as a vegan athlete, such as hemp protein, maca, quinoa, and other foods that are very good for health and energy. Plus his recipes in the book are absolutely delicious and very easy to make. All his food and recommendations are completely vegan and gluten/soy-free. On [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Thrive-Nutrition-Optimal-Performance-Sports/dp/0738212547/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309978023&amp;sr=8-2), the book is currently less than nine dollars.\n\nI personally eat a lot of quinoa, beans (split peas are really high in protein), nuts, and of course fruits and vegetables. Also I have recently started drinking a \"superfood\" shake once or twice a day - 2 c. almond milk, 2 scoops protein powder (I use the Vega powder but hemp or rice/pea would work as well), 1 or 2 bananas, maca powder, chia seed, spirulina, mesquite powder, and a handful or two of ice. It looks rather disgusting (very vivid green), but it tastes pretty good; if the flavors are too strong for you, keep adding bananas.",

Have you even seen a 'free range' farm?\"\n\nI'm not trying to comment on the validity of humane meat. I'm just trying to say that those people are trying to make a change and that even if I think that the way they're going about it is a little misguided I can still see them as my ally.",

Cheese is outrageous expensive for something with so little nutritional value and a boatload of fat and cholesterol. When vegans want something creamy, we go for avocado or hummus. CHEAP. I can make a big pot of bean and veggie chili for like 5 bucks. Eat half of it through the week, freeze the other half for later.",

I'm just trying to establish that they don't fall under a vegan classification. I don't call people pregnant when they aren't, either. Like I said, you could be vegan on a daily or monthly basis. But if you know that, at some point in the future, you might stop eating in a way that classifies you as vegan, I don't think that qualifies you.\n\nI'm an English major. The accuracy of words matters to me. I know that people sometimes make mistakes, a friend of mine ate a vegan-sandwich-that-wasn't-quite-free-of-cross-contaminants and felt terrible over it. I wouldn't stop calling him vegan for it, but I would if he intentionally ate a burger or something.\n\nAs for being in difficult cultures, I'm in Japan right now, with a limited grasp of Japanese. I cook everything from scratch and I got a couple friends to help me find basics. I'm sure some cultures are worse, but people can adapt.",

Heck, I'd be willing to eat HUMAN meat if it meant not starving to death. But see, with your question you are acknowledging that we don't need to eat animal products to be healthy and we can do perfectly fine without them in normal day to day life. A better question might be why do you eat animal products even though you don't need them?",

If your reasons for avoiding other animal products also apply to avoiding wool and leather then you should decide to avoid those products as well. If they do not then I'm sure some of us will give you reasons why wool and leather ought to be avoided, but you shouldn't avoid them just because it is part of earning the 'vegan' title.\n\nAs far as how to be vegan. I recommend taking a long trip to the supermarket and trying out new foods. If you cut a ton of things out from your diet and don't replace them with anything new then you will be miserable. Luckily there are far more foods in the world than any person (even a vegan person) could ever reasonably try. \n\nIf you eat a varied diet with a reasonable balance from different food groups then you shouldn't have to worry about most nutrients; however, you do need to make sure you are getting vitamin B12 either from fortified foods or a supplement. If you are being extra cautious keep an eye on getting vitamin D, iron, and calcium in your diet as well (non-vegans also have to watch out for these).",

There are regular beheadings of children by ISIS in Syria and other countries right now as we speak. I wish I could offer more help, but there's no easy solution. We need to recognise that a behaviour that we hate (consuming animals) doesn't define the people who do it. In the meantime, look for ways you can be yourself and even fight back against the establishment. Maybe you should look on Facebook or Craigslist for other vegetarians and vegans in your community and makes friends with (or better yet, organise) them. And remember, things aren't always as bad as they seem. We're making progress - there are more people in your country following plant based diets today than there were yesterday, let alone fifty years ago. There are signs of change all around us, from computerised medical trials to lab grown meat. Don't drink to feel better - use the internet! Find vegan blogs or spend more time on this sub :)",

I am, however, interested in what makes you and others like you feel the need to drop in and tell us your utterly unoriginal points of view though.\n \nI'm simply interested in veganism and all sorts of associated things. We're doing no harm by having this conversation, even if you do think it's pointless lol. Maybe it is!\n\n&gt; No, I don't agree with that, and therefore I don't think that this \"disctinction\" that you see is remotely interesting, nor is it relevant to veganism.\n \nAnd as I said, you don't have to agree with me, we're each entitled to our own views and opinions, it's fine.\n\n&gt; Well I think you must be engaging in some extreme mental gymnastics to arrive at that conclusion. I can tell you without a doubt that there is nothing vegan about hunting at all. So, if that's where you arrived after looking into veganism, I would say that you must have either a reading comprehension problem, or you just willingly interpret things you see/read/hear incorrectly in order to make them support the point of view that you already hold. I'm sorry that spending time in /r/vegan has failed you so badly that you've so completely missed the point.\n \nI'm completely aware of what veganism is about. Correct me if I'm wrong it's about reducing the suffering and exploitation of animals for the purpose of food and all other animal related products?\n \nI haven't come here to be convinced that I ought to become a vegan, like I said, I don't agree with the ethical considerations vegans put to the killing of animals for food, and I think it's better to hunt if one is going to eat meat. This is simply based on my view of the reality in which we live, I don't think animals necessarily have the same rights as humans and as abhorrent as it may seem to you, I do see humans as being higher in the food chain and that eating animals below you in the food chain is a completely natural thing to do.\n \nBut, I completely welcome yours and others opinions on the matter and I think being vegan is a good thing to do, I put it up there with any attempt by humans to make this world a nicer, moral and safer place to live.",

I've been tempted to message the shop owner to see if they can make a similar pair in a different material, or even get a story about the horn. If the material was found, I'd be ok with it. \n\nI've looked around to try to find the materials to make my own vegan alternative goodies but eh...

When I tried to go low fat (and vegan) I was struggling despite getting enough calories, nutrients, etc etc. I just felt hungry and sluggish. Maybe it's not enough carbs, fats, or calories!

"comment": "hello there! I'm almost vegan and a feminist and I really cringe when I see this type of argument.\n\nFirst, because is an attempt to say \"I'm more of a feminist than you\", which is not an absolute thruth. In Brazil there is this actor who's a vegan and had beaten up his former partner, does not pay child support and go around sying there is nobody as feminist as him (Dado Dolabella, you can check him out). Many women out there are making a difference for other women's lives, and that does not disappear because of carnism. Of course, they should rethink the cruelty they indulge everyday, but we cannot say people are not good because they aren't vegans or the opposite.\n\nSecond, when a politician or a business person is pro animal exploitation, they do not have gender in their minds. They are specists, indeed, and have deep unethical ways of living, but when they indulge these practices, they are thinking on other things than gender. And being pro meat is not exclusive from far-right-let's-transform-forests-in-soybeans-plantation, but also in people from the left. But here, again, I'll fall on my previous argument on how improving people's lives won't be erased by dietary options - although they should try harder.",

"comment": "&gt; The point of contention there was that the person I replied to say that  we \"make them suffer\" as though it was part of the goal. I may have  misread that though or jump to the conclusions though because I hear  that statement a lot from vegans. \n\nI think the point is more that it doesn't matter whether their suffering is a goal or a side effect, if the animal's experience is the same either way.\n\n&gt;At best, what I eat, is already there, and would have been regardless  of my stance on it anyway, so I might as well eat it since it would have  gone to waste otherwise\n\nDo you mean that you eat meat, but refuse to buy it or have it bought for you? (E.g., finishing a friend's meal at a restaurant if it was too much for them, or accepting leftovers.) Or are you referring to the meat you purchase?\n\nAre you familiar with the economic concept of demand? This is from the [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp) page on it.\n\n&gt;Demand is an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire and  willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service. ... Think of demand as your  willingness to go out and buy a certain product. For example, market demand is the total of what everybody in the market wants.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Businesses often spend a considerable amount of money to determine the amount of demand the public has for their products and services.  Incorrect estimations either result in money left on the table if demand  is underestimated or losses if demand is overestimated.  Demand is what helps fuel the economy, and without it, businesses would not produce anything.\n\nSo, let's apply that concept to this case - the animal agriculture industry depends on people wanting to buy animal products, otherwise known as their *demand* for animal products.\n\nIf market demand goes up, the animal agriculture industry makes money by increasing prices and/or the supply of animal products - in the latter case, by breeding more animals. Conversely, if market demand goes down, they lose money on all the animal products that don't get bought - and they're forced to either figure out how to raise demand again (e.g., by lowering the price) or decrease the supply by breeding fewer animals.\n\nVeganism is, fundamentally, a boycott trying to reduce the demand for animal products by refusing to buy them - hence leading to fewer animals being bred, suffering, and being killed during the process of creating those products. It's the same kind of reasoning behind say, trying to avoid products made in sweatshops.\n\nNow, e*ating* meat doesn't necessarily raise demand. As you say, the meat is already there, and any suffering the animal experienced is already over. But buying these products *does* raise demand, and that means more animals are bred into the same circumstances, and suffer just as much.\n\nSo someone who only eats animal products that weren't purchased by or for them - as in my first question - would be far closer to veganism than a person whose diet consisted entirely of fruits and veggies, but who would purchase meat every day just to throw it in the garbage. It's really more about what you buy than what you eat.\n\nIf you want a closer look at an individual vegan or vegetarian's effects on demand, I recommend reading [this](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/dietary-impacts/effects-of-diet-choices/) webpage, which tackles exactly that.\n\nDid all that make sense? I hope I explained the concepts in a clear way, I've never done so before.",

"comment": "The majority of these people spent years eating 'fruitarian' (literally only fruit) or completely raw foods or did prolonged 'juice cleanses' or even did **water fasts** (starving themselves for weeks at a time). Even if they had incorporated more whole foods and protein recently, many of them still were eating a really restrictive and low calorie diet. I know specifically Rawvana was into 'Colonics' where she would **pump pressurized water up her ass to clean the poo out of her colon** then she complained about digestive issues and blamed veganism (??) Another guy tried incorporating staring directly into the sun for 15 minutes into his daily routine and **drank his own piss** on the regular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems to me that these 'influencer' youtubers were using veganism to try and hide serious eating disorders or other strange quests to be \"cleansed\" involving super restrictive diets, fasting, 'natural laxitives', weird poo treatments, alkalized water, refusing supplements, and just overall crazy shit. They then eat some salmon and all of a sudden feel 'better than ever' when I'm pretty sure a bowl of rice &amp; beans and a B12 pill could've done wonders.",

The only solutions are worse: keep the animal isolated so they can't breed (cruel), kill the animal so they can't breed (unjust and cruel), or let the animal breed (leads to worse overpopulation, more homeless animals, effects on wild animal populations, and generally more animal suffering). \n\nThe solution you propose is fantasy. Surely we should not be breeding animals to make pets, but taking animals in from shelters is one of the best things you can do. Those animals exist and they deserve happiness and health and safety. They cannot be returned to the wild since they didn't come from the wild anymore than you or I did. They cannot and should not be kept in some humane society kennel until death. \n\nVegans with the time and resources absolutely should adopt animals and spay or neuter them. The only way we can ever phase out the existence of pets is by doing that, refusing to buy bred animals, and persuading non-vegans to get on board as well.",

You might find yourself not wanting them and eventually fully transition. Or you might still eat \"normal\" thanksgiving dinner but eat vegan the rest of the time. I don't think this is a popular opinion, and I don't think people who still eat animal products should call themselves vegan, but I think any bit helps the animals and it's also super important to consider your mental health.",

"comment": "I'm a caregiver for a person living with cancer who is also vegan (and was vegetarian for many years beforehand). \n\nChemo is not among the treatments for her kind of cancer, but there are a few things her palliative care physician suggested for nausea (a symptom caused also by other treatments):   \n1. fasting before and after treatment (about 24 hrs prior to the treatment)  \n2. umeboshi plums (these are Japanese sour plums). Online you can find several ways of eating them, they are quite sour, so you've to find the way of eating them that is best for you. \n\nThere is no need to abandon your vaganism: what my person's dietician, integrative oncologist and palliative doctor all suggested was a plant based diet (though it was also a bit dishewrtening hearing that, since she got cancer even while being vegan.  But there are also several other environmental factors involved in developing cancer.)  It's difficult to give advice on what is best to eat (and keep down) while under treatment, as it's different for each person, but listen closely to your body and see what kind of foods it needs and which are hard on your digestive system. \n\nBe aware that chemo can cause mouth sores, which make it difficult to eat hard foods. L-lysine can help, oral probiotics can help as well. \n\nYou didn't ask about this, but I wholeheartedly suggest to find one or more support groups. My person has been immensely helped by attending a few of them. Sometimes the group might not work and it's ok to leave it,  but usually the support you get is very valuable. Being vegan has never been a problem for her in these groups, nobody ever questioned this. \n\nCheck out also cancer support groups. For instance [https://www.bayareacancer.org/virtual-resource-center/](https://www.bayareacancer.org/virtual-resource-center/) has a lot of information and programs (and you don't need to be in the Bay Area to use them). Also, the Cancer Support Community [https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/)  has branches all over the US and offers a wealth of information, programs and support. \n\nAll the best to you. It's a hard journey, but you can do it.",

I don't know about using the toilet more often; that doesn't strike me as normal, so I guess it could have something to do with diet. It's not some kind of normal vegan thing to defecate a lot if that's what you're asking. -I know a diabetic, omnivorous alcoholic who eats a typically southeastern US diet of junk food, gets drunk every night, &amp; he goes to the toilet... number two... more than anyone I've ever known. I don't know what to recommend to you; maybe your gut flora will change over time, or you'll just adjust something in your diet &amp; it won't be an issue. ---Don't hesitate to ask any other questions you may have here.",
