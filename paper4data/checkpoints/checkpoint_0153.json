{"transport":[{"comment_index":26200,"comment":"The Rav4-EV is the best deal out there for EVs right now, and it will be discontinued by the end of the year. However, the best deal on it is the 36 month lease with $16,500 lease cash, and out of state buyers are ineligible for that. Unfortunately, you're a little late to the game here; when I got my Rav last year Toyota offered $10k off on purchases, but after lots of non-Californians starting snatching them up they put an end to that.\n\nIf you purchase a Rav new, you only get $2,500 off, plus the $7,500 fed credit that you won't get with a lease, so you're effectively paying $6,500 more to purchase. So, as others have said, the best way to get a Rav for out-of-staters is to buy used. However, if CO EV incentives only apply to new purchases maybe they can help ameliorate some of that extra cost.\n\nI'd say go for the Rav anyway, however you have to make it work. Aside from the Rav, there are really only two kinds of EVs out there right now: There are super-expensive and super-awesome Teslas, or there's a Leaf-class car. Despite all the noise about the i3 and other compliance car EVs, they're basically *all the same* with their puny ~21 usable kwh batteries.\n\nThe Rav stands alone as the sole outlier in this bimodal distribution. It's effectively a 42 kwh Model S, for about 1/3 the cost of Tesla's cheapest car. And it's the only EV with an SUV form factor. Sure, it's a low-production run with a few quirks, and sure, there's a little bit of risk with the out-of-state servicing, but you can't say enough about getting a battery twice as big as a Leaf-class for hardly any more cost.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.020653631072491407,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16314058284257962,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2147002798058672,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20852166298108668,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29857471121511675,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22404945751574287,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17764970259735144,"ev_1":-0.16070426158716403,"ev_2":-0.14810814789456067,"ev_3":-0.2913966886949738,"ev_4":-0.03766987733736945,"ev_5":-0.0830300051251784,"ev_6":-0.15286721621067972},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

HVAC is another area that has significantly more GHG impact that diet.\n\n[Here's a breakdown of GHG emission sources in the US](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions). Electricity is #1, but transportation is a close second. Half of all transportation emissions are from passenger vehicles. 67% of electricity production is from fossil fuels, but almost 100% of our transportation is from fossil fuels. So about 13% of all GHG emissions are from passenger vehicles. I found that about 6% of all electricity is for AC and let's estimate about the same for heat (given that heat isn't all electric, we're pulling in some from the 'Commercial &amp; Residential' 12% section too. This puts personal driving and HVAC neck and neck for overall impact and together makes them 25% of all GHG emissions. Agriculture is at 9%.\n\nEven AC/heating are highly dependant on where you live. If you have access to solar/wind/hydro/nuclear power then reducing AC/heating (electric heating) won't have a big GHG impact.\n\nDriving a Prius (or better yet an electric car) is probably the biggest single thing anyone could do to reduce their GHG footprint. Getting rid of AC is not a realistic option for those places that have it, but reducing usage is a possibility. Smart thermostats are a great option for this effort.\n\nI agree that GHG is not the total picture of environmental impact and that veganism reduces water usage and waste, improves land use. My points were strictly about GHG as I've heard many people argue that going vegan will address climate change. I'm analytical and I like to look at the numbers. The numbers show that the GHG impact of going vegan is much less than getting a Prius or changing your thermostat (several degrees).\n\nGo vegan for a bunch of reasons, even environmental ones (especially water usage in some places), but don't be like OP and shit on someone driving a Prius as not a real environmentalist because he's not vegan.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2686731789805498,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10927537658917572,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20870484289147598,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19718852018316588,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.33503406293637283,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18663126719343895,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03955822674470255,"ev_1":-0.18769665170619376,"ev_2":-0.030696213059854927,"ev_3":-0.07459245105928858,"ev_4":-0.019793921328528086,"ev_5":-0.036245919517872004,"ev_6":-0.06326779211546334},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Don't really see LG chem distributed in the USA but they are the largest producer right now globally. Makes sense if you end up going with them.\n\nIt could change in he USA when Tesla ramps up pw2 production but... I'm curious if they'll even supply residential for some time. There are great grid-connected applications for lithium ion in the commercial market which I think would suck up all of the supply pretty quickly.\n\nIf you are comfortable running your generator as a fundamental system component, perhaps every cloudy day, then you aren't crazy for considering lithium ion. Its not like you're running the generator for more than two hours. But if If you don't want to rely on your generator but would prefer to coast off your batteries for the most part, then your battery bank is going to be at least twice the size and FLA is the tried and true path path.\n\nIt's not just about least lifecycles cost. FLA may cost $0.16 kwh over 3000 cycles and lithium ion may cost $0.13/kWh over 10,000 cycles. While replacing batteries will be a major pain in the butt, sometimes being able to pay for all those cycles on year one can be the downfall of a longer lasting battery.\n\nJust like solar. Sure it might have an effective generation rate of 1/3rd your levelized cost of electricity, but with a 30 year life, it's equivalent to paying 10 years worth of electricity one day one. Not everyone can afford it.\n\nWe're only going off grid because of the cost of grid expansion to the project site AND the client dislikes the utility. In many cases, taking advantage of the available grid connection is the best economic option, even if you spend a bit more on a complex switchgear to keep the pv and batteries \"off grid\" when you are grid-connected (which you might do in Australia if faced with steep monthly interconnection fees).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004864396845126369,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06160575107342083,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.220042246329331,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3546801478646645,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2297016532640219,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2064321455403233,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01905592628463637,"ev_1":-0.17337473244300242,"ev_2":-0.20120871761776976,"ev_3":-0.16543376740455643,"ev_4":-0.014945856033591554,"ev_5":-0.0016150220108102076,"ev_6":-0.1086275078679787},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Reality check needed here.\n\nThere is no one company or car which will deal a \"death blow\", as in displacing a significant amount of ICE cars in one go.\n\nBut there will be a car which will mark the breaking point, where the car itself is simply a better and cheaper than comparable ICE cars for most people. A car which will sell significantly even without government incentives. It may be blocked by infrastructure, but once that car hits the market, people will start to demand infrastructure.\n\nAnd yeah, that car could be the Tesla Model 3, if they deliver. I think the choice in battery size is an important bit which every other manufacturer misses. I'd be happy with 40-50kWh, but without the choice of 70kWh+, it's not going to satisfy more than 50% of drivers.\n\nIt's not a death blow in the direct sense, but maybe in the symbolic sense. The car that finally proves that EVs are simply better, for most people.\n\nEDIT: The Model 3 alone could obviously not satisfy more than 50% of the market, but I think that will be because you need more kinds of models, not because of the price or technology.

The point was just that the numbers are already declining and that I think it'll accelerate. But it'll be a decade before that'll lead to people getting any feeling of there being too few gas stations.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that most EVs are likely to be in urban areas, where the population density is high enough to have a reasonable density of gas stations for a long while. People living in rural areas are perhaps most likely to use ICE vehicles the longest, so despite the closure of one gas station being a bigger problem for them, it could take much longer for that to happen.\n\nI wasn't so interested in wether it's an actual practical problem for people though. I'm more interested in the psychological impact from the news generated by the closure of gas stations due to hybrids and electrics. You don't need that many closures, you just need to have a causal link that can be published as news.\n\nAnother psychological factor could be that people will start to see rapid chargers everywhere. There's a need for more of them, and it's also easier to put a few here and a few there. You can more easily combine them with shops and restaurants. McDonalds might not want a smelly gas pump right next to their entrance, but a charging station is no problem.

We currently have a 22 myp and 22 mxp and both are fantastic. Yeah sit in the a8l and you’re just bathed in luxury with diamond stitched nappa leather seats that wave massage you with multiple air bladders embedded in the seat. Heads up displays are amazing, leather stitched dash is nice but unnecessary, etc etc. then you compare that with the model x plaid which when you sit in it is pretty empty. Just a giant touch screen. It’s the magic behind the touch screen that makes it special and a luxury. Phone as a key, just hop in and go. Need something to do while charging? Netflix or steam games on to the go. Browser functionality whenever. So many quality of life features that make your day easier and no one in the car industry is even close other than maybe Rivian. Model x has doors that open for you when you walk up to it and close when you walk away. Tell me that’s not luxury. Teslas luxury is intangibles that you can’t perceive or understand unless you live with them for an extended period of time then go to another car without those features. You start to realize is that you could either live with a leather flip phone or a plastic iPhone. Those vegan seats are good enough for me and all the touch points are soft and comfortable. Nothing feels that cheap. \n\nI have 0 complaints of our 22 model year teslas. Sure older ones may have issues and may not be as reliable. This is a pretty new company that made EVs main stream. They defied all odds to show the masses that EVs were viable. Made EVs cool with the model S and showed the world you can road-trip with the supercharger network. Everyone else is trying to play catch up while tesla is perfecting what they already started. People new to EVs won’t understand the nuances that teslas has perfected over the years.

In the course of a long career he founded an IT company, and is an honorary professor at the University of Technology, Economics and Culture in Leipzig. As part of his work at the University, he deals with the energy industry and climate change. He served the German Bundestag as an expert in ‘Artificial Intelligence’. \n\nBut Professor Loschke is annoyed, very annoyed, as he demonstrated in this recent Facebook post.\n\n&gt;I’m sick.\n\n&gt;Or, to put it even more clearly: I’m fed up with permanent and increasingly religious climate ramblings, fantasies about the energy transition, worship of electric cars, horror stories and doomsday scenarios from Corona to conflagrations and weather disasters. I can’t stand the people who shout into microphones and cameras, or print it in newspapers every day. I suffer from having to see how science is turned into a whore of politics.\n\nIt seems that scientists like Professor Loschke are fighting back, tired of being abused and often ignored for scientific work that fails to conform to a fashionable political narrative. Last week, the Daily Sceptic highlighted the ongoing World Climate Declaration (WCD), now signed by over 1,100 scientists and professionals. Headed by the Norwegian physics Nobel Prize laureate Professor Ivar Giaever, the WCD says there is no climate emergency. Climate science is said to have degenerated into a discussion based on beliefs, not on sound science. \n\n###[1,200 Scientists and Professionals Declare: “There is No Climate Emergency”](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/wrr14n/1200_scientists_and_professionals_declare_there/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nOur story about the WCD attracted enormous interest on social media and is one of the most widely read articles we have ever published. Enormous efforts were made to trash the Declaration, and many of the people who signed have been personally abused.\n\n###[‘There is No Climate Emergency’ (1,107 Signatories and Counting)](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2022/08/25/there-is-no-climate-emergency-1107-signatories-and-counting/) \n\nThere are a lot of very smart people in the world. And most do not work at colleges and universities and pressure groups. They are curious free agents, free to think and even be politically incorrect.\n\nWhen the history of climate alarmism is written decades from now, there will be recognition about how a very able undercurrent of thought kept check on an intellectual/political/media elite declaring a dire emergency from the human influence on climate……\n\nAnd so more than a thousand intellectual, critical thinkers have signed a manifesto challenging the current orthodoxy that remains in political power.\n\n…..\n\nCOP27 is several months ahead. The world is recommitting itself to fossil fuels, while only government largesse keeps the wind/solar/battery gravy train going. Global Climate Intelligence Group’s World Climate Declaration stands as a beacon light to a wholly different approach of free-market adaptation, not government mitigation.\n\n#[Desmog: “Ross-who??” (Bury the Inconvenient Truths)](http://gelbspanfiles.com/?p=14080&amp;fbclid=IwAR0SubiX77LXobuxx5FTOhcBW3xmywa5SW3ZTgWQBBxsg7jvIwucxNaIQA4)\n\nFirst, hat-tip to Marcel Crok at Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) for bringing an 8/23/22 Inside Climate News article to my attention, “Experts Debunk Viral Post Claiming 1,100 Scientists Say ‘There’s No Climate Emergency’” which trashed CLINTEL’s 1100+ signatories World Climate Declaration. Mr Crok drew my particular attention to ICN’s labeling of the ol’ Desmogblog group as “an investigative climate research organization” and their supposed revelation of how CLINTEL “rehashes several well-known ‘climate denial’ tropes” and has “strong political, professional and financial connections to the fossil fuel industry”.\n\nIn my “James Hoggan’s Monster Journalistic Due Diligence Lapse” 2015 blog post, I covered how Hoggan openly admitted to not knowing a thing about climate science back when he created Desmogblog, but during the course of flying somewhere in a private jet, his reading of Gelbspan’s 2004 “Boiling Point” book all by itself was enough for him to form Desmogblog, so that it could expose skeptic climate scientist “liars.” That was not an isolated incident, he noted within one of his blog posts that Gelbspan was the inspiration for Desmogblog, while another book author said Desmogblog was built on Gelbspan’s work. \n\nAdding further insult to injury, climate scientist Dr Tim Ball’s 2013 WUWT guest post article about Desmogblog, “Public Relations (Spin Doctors) Deliberately Deceived Public About Global Warming,” featured a ClimateGate email from James Hoggan’s Desmogblog operations partner Richard Littlemore pleading to IPCC-associated Dr Michael Mann for science detail assistance, in which Littlemore confessed:\n\n&gt;… I am out of my depth (as I am sure you have noticed: We’re all about PR here, not much about science.\n\nThat’s rich, in more ways than one. As I noted in a GelbspanFiles blog post earlier this spring, one hallmark of enviro-activists is their phenomenon of psychologically projecting what they are as accusations of what skeptics of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) are. The only ‘rehashing of old tropes’ going on here is ICN’s rehash of an essentially 30 year-old accusation that any industry connections whatsoever completely taints what CAGW skeptics say. Their rehash was apparently fed to them by the disingenuously repackaged “Desmog” outfit, an organization self-described as a pure public relations people having no expertise in climate science, which was also self-described by one of its co-founders as being created entirely to expose CAGW skeptic scientists as industry-paid liars.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.14100752336283526,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3382214218477594,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.08189317646125953,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.024585540406405926,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06810295159844568,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.056534238159656525,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2722090069825451,"ev_1":-0.2006003199329488,"ev_2":-0.02240411360010815,"ev_3":-0.024503836645938765,"ev_4":-0.03066696432142635,"ev_5":-0.06880421873453695,"ev_6":-0.07325535732762016,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.17481882404808857},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author expresses frustration and annoyance towards climate discourse and EVs, indicating an opposing stance.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (Desmogblog is not a personal reference group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against.","1.3.3_second_order":"weak.","ev_1":"NO.\n\nThe text does not directly compare EVs to gas cars in terms of environmental impact.","ev_2":"NO.","ev_3":"NO.","ev_4":"NO.","ev_5":"NO.","ev_6":"NO."},"year":2022},{"comment_index":26279,"comment":"Yup, my test drive for the Tesla is scheduled this Sunday.

[This page](http://www.technomadia.com/2014/09/understanding-solar-panel-specifications/) gives a decent run down\n\nBut yeah assuming your load is indeed 260 watts the rest of your math looks mostly right and it would require 6 or 7 panels. If you only needed to make power while the sun was out you could get by with just one or 2 panels. \n\nAlso at 260 watts with 90% efficiency I think you would have to plan for 260*1.1 = 286 watts rather than 265. That gives you 6864 watts/day so 6864/4.2= 1634 or 1.6 kWh. \n\nTake the things I say with a grain of salt though because I don't have much experience with panels outside of just being interested in them.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00021258620836306363,"1.1.1_stance":-0.060017772163746486,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21639095347758944,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2685507144737213,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2939026479955698,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15868572645329146,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22672946191069343,"solar_1":-0.08896561818893516,"solar_2":-0.1426813071819528,"solar_3":-0.012240466884880638,"solar_4":-0.13542192172644718,"solar_5":-0.05049805817422263,"solar_6":-0.028064591032792425,"solar_7":-0.013183789451431949,"solar_8":-0.07275538634288144,"solar_9":-0.06795546541158615,"solar_10":-0.1647519130880634},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

How it all works or if you choose a good charger?\n\nThose are simple and combine the solar and battery into one. I recommend these types of solar and battery combinations for cell phone charging. \n\nYou will want to find out how many mAH your cell phone battery is, then you can figure out how many times this 5000 mAH battery will potentially charge it. Keep in mind that there are some losses. \n\nIf you wanted to design a solar system to charge your cell phone (without combined battery) you should find out what the charging specs for your battery is and how to get that proper voltage from the solar panel. You'll also want to be mindful of the max charging rate (Amperes) and not exceed that charging rate for your battery. \n\nOn a side note - that solar charger you linked to me. A few simple formulas to use are Amps = Watt/Volts and Watts = Amps*volts and you can manipulate data to find out the power specs. \n\nThe specs from your links show that this will produce 200 mAh - this means 200 milliamps per hour of direct sunlight. Generally places get 5 to 6 hours of sunlight (maybe a little more or less depending on quality) - this equates to 1000 to 1200 in a 5 or 6 hour day (direct light). That is only 1/5th of the battery size of 5000 mAh or it is going to take more than 5 days to charge this thing. Your phone likely can hold 1800 mAh to 2200 mAh and can potentially deplete it in 2 or so days. \n\nI wouldn't count on this for continual charging - but it would be fun to try and hack this to feed in more solar power form the USB port or another port into the internal battery.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002517366932200578,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29009624081744184,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23524177929698023,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0799805126171495,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.25852201965984767,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21158489425990115,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24386471857365286,"solar_1":-0.019803305534878746,"solar_2":-0.035623860501800664,"solar_3":-0.14348087962328768,"solar_4":-0.043272190683637746,"solar_5":-0.014058501614878574,"solar_6":-0.030867158362525515,"solar_7":-0.003806729980472786,"solar_8":-0.0017813109310130433,"solar_9":-0.05952545604272075,"solar_10":-0.17150067792714385},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

If you care to be absolutely safe you also need to place it some distance away from the house just in the unlikely case it goes boom (implying you can't just own a house, you'll need some land as well to place the tanks far away). On top of that, there is an expiration date as it will leak out so you can't really leave it stored and forget about it. To recap, it requires equipment to keep safe, you can't keep it indefinetly since it leaks out of every known material and it consumes even more energy while it's in storage. \n\nWhy does it matter? It matters because you will be spending more on solar panels for less fuel produced that is also a bigger hazard than batteries.\n\n&gt;There are also significant synergies with natural gas infrastructure, which is present. Hydrogen (power to gas) is an near-optimal way to store surplus renewable during production peaks.\n\nOh boy, do we love natural gas for a 0 emissions future. Wait, we don't.

And if you have a higher voltage panel string than your battery, you need MPPT or you're wasting gobs of energy.\n\nPWM just connects and disconnects the panels from the battery at the battery voltage.  Solar panels put out a constant amperage until a certain voltage, at which point their amperage drops off until you have 0A at the open circuit voltage.\n\nSo, if you have panels that produce 8A, and they're 12v panels, they may produce 8A up until about 14v, then drop off until at 18v they're producing no current.  A PWM controller will hook these straight to the battery, and you'll be getting 8A at 10v, 11v, 12v, 13v, 14v... whatever the battery is at.\n\nA MPPT controller would run them at 14v all the time - so you'd be taking in 8A at 14v (112W) and putting, say, 9.3A@12v into the battery bank.  This is radically more useful if you have a higher voltage setup - my office setup is strings of 4 panels, and current open circuit voltage is around 147v.  The system is taking in 1.1A at 145v, and putting 2.8A at 53.3v into the batteries (it's evening).\n\nBut for what you're doing, I'd save the money.  The gains you'll see with a MPPT tracker on your system are minimal, at best, and the $100 is better spent on something more useful.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-6.726869105477817e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1309438672991064,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26370761046806973,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22141325051213573,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1863649562865727,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.12125984383500413,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.294465813106702,"solar_1":-0.08747854968647382,"solar_2":-0.025427931133890525,"solar_3":-0.014167301277363245,"solar_4":-0.013249612032571653,"solar_5":-0.02364459998110154,"solar_6":-0.00503586464158919,"solar_7":-0.007829420996131375,"solar_8":-0.0053005311086356715,"solar_9":-0.045334750053790174,"solar_10":-0.03883760957978666},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

Our civilization has so many implicit dependencies on fossil fuels, and many researchers only use the 'primary inputs' for solar eroei: how much energy does a solar panel manufacturer use. There's lots of other hidden inputs that aren't counted though, because we just assume plentiful inputs. Making roads, pipeline pumps for the natural gas, making copper for the transmission lines, etc. You have to take a systems view; and right now our systems are permeated with cheap energy.\n\nIt would help to imagine using *only* solar power to bootstrap a solar-power manufacturing plant from raw resources in the ground like aluminum ore. No diesel mining equipment, no natural gas, etc. \n\nThen from the plant, make panels until you have to dedicate resources to replacing the panel factory.\n\nUltimately, I wager that PV solar is ultimately competitive with a fully efficient woodlot that is being sustainably harvested; especially when you consider that the woodlot sequesters carbon, whereas the solar panel is at best neutral. If you make the panels also deal with excess carbon, i believe they come out behind, and the future of dark age economics will bear this out — people will return to wood where possible.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012498526775743812,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1531630149007185,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2873468678340277,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27087458392538233,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3083716175062459,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29514972417520935,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13880063210187168,"solar_1":-0.1160237817365621,"solar_2":-0.2595496056743568,"solar_3":-0.08084990848727844,"solar_4":-0.051902553670723085,"solar_5":-0.0866435764352597,"solar_6":-0.01041432639855581,"solar_7":-0.011473646110971458,"solar_8":-0.008881364519766066,"solar_9":-0.015955143585294707,"solar_10":-0.13685696954095927},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

But my point was, it's not cost effective at all, so why would someone want it?  It adds at best 1 mile per hour.  At best.  In truth, it will probably be half that given the area of the roof and clouds.  So we're talking about parking a car for 8 hours and have maybe 5 miles more range.  And if you did this every day for a year, you've gotten 1825 \"free\" miles from the solar panels.  That's equivalent to about $60 in \"free\" electricity.  So on a daily basis, 5 miles on a car that goes 300 miles is nothing.  And on a yearly basis, you're paying off a $900 accessory at $60/year.  And that's best case scenario.  Most people aren't parking their Tesla outside in bright sun for 9 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nSo my point is, it's a frivolity with no real benefit.

You would have coated the inner walls of your workspace in dual junction III-V cells. But cost obviously matters. If cost matters, then the answer is the one I have given: don't bother.\n\n&gt;A few two-foot solar panels are not going to cast any noticeable shade.\n\nThey're going to harvest approximately the percentage I gave of 1 kW based on the shade they cast.

If I didn't have have Powerwalls I would have purchased a new AC setup for half the price this one cost us, and would have insulated the attic more already.   The AC was still 17/18 years old, so why keep spending money on it?   The next day something else could have broken on it and it'd cost us more money then.   I know I'm not technically \"saving\" money since the equipment cost so much money, but I'm okay with that.   My goal is to stay off the grid as much as possible, not have an electric bill besides grid connect fee, maybe build a credit with net metering (excess goes towards grid connect fees following year), have AC all throughout the night, and still wake up with enough power to get through the morning.  At that point the sun will be rising and able to charge the batteries again so we could live like normal.   I would actually like to be able to do that now with my Powerwalls if I can, just so I can stay off the grid period.

I won't try to talk you out of it, as this is the type of insanely large system I love to install.\n\nBut this really boils down to a data problem, you don't have enough.. Since you seem to have grid already, get a whole house energy monitor like neurio or sense, to see what your base load is, peaks and etc. You mention all these heavy loads, but don't forget all the other stuff that is running all the time as well, like lights, tv, computers, etc..\n\nBut here is what you need to consider:\n\n* Why do you want to take your house off-grid, and does that reason justify the cost?\n   * It is going to be expensive just to off-grid the wielder, much less the rest which will be like Ferrari expensive.\n* Higher base load is going to require a higher base inverter capacity.\n   * Extra load is going to further extend this, and don't forget surge ratings.\n* Batteries have a max charge and discharge rate, so the more loads you have the more batteries you may need to stay within the max discharge rate\n   * Days of Autonomy, you will need even more batteries to extend you runtime for bad weather days.\n* The more batteries you need the more solar you will need to charge it, because as you are charging THEM you also need to power your base load.\n   * If you want to truly go off-grid, you have to take into account your winter having a lot less sun as well depending where in the world you are. Which will provide less charging for the batteries, while your electric backup heat is kicking on.\n\nAll of that is further compounded by equipment limitations, some inverters may not be able to stack up to the AC Wattage you need, might not have enough space for the solar modules, may not have enough space for the batteries or they may not stack enough for your needs. That said, there are more than a few ways to do it, but I highly recommend against it without using a professional installer that has experience with this level of off-grid system just the permitting on this could be a nightmare. I would consider this out of the scope of most \"semi-pro\" DIYer's and even most general licensed electrician's.\n\nSince you have grid, would you mind sharing your yearly kWh consumption? That could give a pretty good idea of the amount of solar and batteries you would need at least.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004612512808913986,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2635908810926403,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2067393692489833,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3089457875803416,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14157600796781367,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30617064803597754,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21399842823545137,"solar_1":-0.13301424465316813,"solar_2":-0.12984487828604566,"solar_3":-0.031425097477040254,"solar_4":-0.17214495971954116,"solar_5":-0.025213644296551745,"solar_6":-0.407226304213206,"solar_7":-0.015667854992595192,"solar_8":-0.0303823022453192,"solar_9":-0.05332260276737344,"solar_10":-0.1978442892984959},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (the author is a solar installer and expresses love for installing solar systems, but acknowledges the challenges and high costs associated with off-grid systems and suggests getting a whole house energy monitor to assess energy needs more accurately)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Basically you multiply a fixed $ amount against the highest usage during a peak time period.  So where we are it’s measured on a 15 minute window - so if your highest load during peak is say 3.2kw, then you multiply 3.2*DemandChargeRate (it varies by season with summer being highest). This is an incentive to minimize demand during peak hours (summer 3pm to 9pm). In return per kilowatt rates are lower.  And also they’ve jacked the line maintenance fees up to ~$30/month...because in Az solar was such a good deal for awhile the utilities could see all their business going away. We do get credits for putting on the grid, but no checks. So bottom line is, in a state where every house should run on solar it’s been disincentivized. Be happy with the deal you’re getting.\n\nIn our case, we have 2 powerwalls and solar - our goal is to use the batteries to zero out demand charging each month. That is, during peak we run fully on solar or battery.  So far so good, we can mostly do it...except if I mess up with charging the car.

Right now my A/Cs are split across 2 200Amp panels.  I have not done the math but I don't think I can put both A/Cs on one circuit, I think that would overload one panel.  Should I get a third panel installed for the essentials (network, computers, TVs, fridge, freezer, lights) and put the rest on the other panels?

We have excess electricity during the daytime NOW and batteries are in short supply.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0018642150486509006,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17327414497467544,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19064096577638814,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.32188592661405674,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1888344523273076,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1766963499573928,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23868952602424542,"solar_1":-0.12844256579270932,"solar_2":-0.07584487615196799,"solar_3":-0.18114497336337496,"solar_4":-0.08173344877240438,"solar_5":-0.27551852465452004,"solar_6":-0.00545878563085959,"solar_7":-0.02616816949254523,"solar_8":-0.027757653542115197,"solar_9":-0.03430585410659859,"solar_10":-0.17164252783428915},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Basically the HOA can just install a big solar array where ever they want in the complex (on top of of the shared building, or in field somewhere nearby), that solar array gets it's own meter and then the HOA tells the utility all the accounts that want solar, the utility takes the credits from the solar array and apply it to the accounts of the people, and it's billed as if the solar was on their house. No further management required.\n\nMost utilities do allow it, though terms vary, I think PGE says the array needs to be on the same building, across the street, or in the same complex as the customers.

A modern grid isn’t a set of isolated plants; it’s an integrated system with diverse resources—production and storage alike—that together ensure reserve and reliability. It seems like you’re locked into an outdated view where reserve power has to come from a single type of plant, when in reality, we’ve moved well past that model.\n\n\nYou’re incredibly misinformed on this topic.\n\n\n> Once again, no, scalable renewables do not provide any reserve.\n\nScalable renewables absolutely provide reserve. Grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen are all proven ways renewables contribute to reserve capacity. Battery storage, for example, is increasingly deployed as a “peaker plant” replacement—exactly the role of reserve capacity. California’s energy storage fleet already covers thousands of megawatts, with plans to double that in the next few years, replacing what used to be handled by fossil fuel reserves. And pumped hydro, the original energy storage tech, provides vast amounts of reserve power and has been doing so for decades.\n\nRenewables aren’t standalone wind or solar farms; they’re part of a complex, integrated grid where multiple technologies, including energy storage, work together to provide reserve capacity. Your claim that renewables provide “no reserve” reflects an outdated and overly simplistic view of how modern grids function.\n\nYou literally don’t know what you’re talking about.

You sound like you have a good undetstanding of your energy and what you’re looking for.

I would be wary of anyone who didnt bring that up. Especially since in the comments you said you wanna charge your EV in the day - a SMART SPAN panel would be good for moderation.

The ethics of veganism aren't anything new, only the context has changed -- modern society has given us the opportunity to even consider that animals should be considered part of our circle.\n\nedit: grammar","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.17397720950382026,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1845691714210247,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15448152788798497,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2754047352318762,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28900510369304455,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2824236646246002,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.010247382839831213,"diet_1":-0.16057130354844654,"diet_2":-0.15707662939756387,"diet_3":-0.16396892057476484,"diet_4":-0.017614929526944916,"diet_5":-0.010095725921322204,"diet_6":-0.03821727361476709,"diet_8":-0.0069578139961474035,"diet_9":-0.0037688720088340233,"diet_10":-0.011612377832799817,"diet_11":-0.0039482760633499465,"diet_13":-0.016977687316587737,"diet_14":-0.1207902013071968,"diet_17":-0.01392775392984428},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I dislike the attitude of \"THAT GUY eats eggs sometimes, don't lump ME in any category with HIM.\" You're only separating yourself from other people, creating more boundaries and more labels.

I know this because I have experienced it. When I first learned I was wheat intolerant (before I was even vegan), I was astounded at how many things I just couldn't eat anymore. Things like pizza, bread and sandwiches, crackers, cookies, pasta, soy sauce, cereals, the list goes on, leave your diet immediately, and eating out restricts your options even more. Giving up these store-bought items often means you cannot eat anything but salad away from your home.

Why don't you tell *me* how the differences in cellular deoxyribonucleic acid and inert genes distinguish us from other vertebrates. This was the very focus of that article I cited, but I guess you didn't read it. \n\n&gt; I'll eat whatever the fuck I want, within reason.\n\nYes, you've made this quite obvious. As someone who is often accused of being elitist and holier-than-thou, I ask you again: what gives you this right? Why do you deserve to decide who lives and dies for your enjoyment?\n\n&gt; The reason being that humans are very different from tasty tasty animals.\n\nNo, they aren't. See above. This also does not excuse your ravenous appetite. *Chairs* are very different from humans, but I doubt you eat tasty tasty furniture.\n\n&gt; If you don't \"believe\" so then you're just wrong - the intelligence levels aren't even on the same scale. Science doesn't agree with you and you can't impose your opinion on it and believe anything different.\n\nEven though intelligence is measured in many different ways, *you* are very wrong here. The \"scale\" is relative, but many species have proven to be *more* intelligent (this is also a relative term) than human children. There are many cognitive skills possessed by animals that actually outdo even the smartest of people. Take Ayumu for example: http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/16832379\n\nHere are a few resources to help you reconsider your position on animal intelligence:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_intelligence\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/id/24628983/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/smartest-animals/#.UXhDJWOnbD0\nhttp://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/animal-cognition-96639212\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_efficient_planet/2012/11/birds_bees_and_traveling_salesmen_animals_solved_a_wildly_complex_mathematical.html\nhttp://cognitivepsychology.wikidot.com/problem-solving:animals\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928131032.htm\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347212005131\nhttp://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201103/empathic-chickens-and-cooperative-elephants-emotional-intelligence-expan\n\n&gt; I don't know you, so given how amazingly stupid you've been so far, I'm going to assume that you don't know that processed soy isn't good for you :http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=soybean-fertility-hormone-isoflavones-genistein. Any other organic compounds that are processed to mimic meat nutrients have the same problems of being biologically stable which means they will mimic something natural, often with very severe consequences.\n\nIt's no longer surprising to encounter reddit \"experts\" on nutrition that assume they're going to tell someone who *dedicates their life to maintaining a specialized diet* that they know something we don't. Do you think vegans eat potato chips all day? And regardless of how incredibly random and pointless and futile it is to bring up phytoestrogens in a conversation about ethics to try and undermine the essence of veganism, I could cite a dozen sources disproving this 4-year-old article. Vegans get shit about soy *all the time* and most of it is related to the quack-group of \"scientists\" known as the [Weston A Price Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston_A._Price_Foundation). (Do you *seriously* believe \"This will show all those vegans! Tofu is bad for them! Muhahahaha!\"). Good grief, the ethical foundation of a progressive movement is not based up a single food (even though it is unanimously agreed to be a healthy source of protein-rich fiber). I assume this is also the reason you see so many sensationalist articles regarding soy, as anti-vegans seem to believe destroying the holy-grail of plant-based nutrition will dissolve the entire philosophy. It's like arguing against climate change with a cold day in May. What these antagonists often fail to mention is that [98% of soy produced in the US](http://www.soyatech.com/soy_facts.htm) *is used for animal feed!* So most omnivores are eating far more soy-by-proxy than any tofu-loving vegan. In other words, if you eat beef and pork, you more than likely consume more soy than I do.\n\nBUT let me just give you this -- just for fun. Let's say that isoflavons can be proven to cause hormonal imbalances in humans (which they haven't). Let's say that some humans out there do eat amounts that could affect their reproductive capabilities and may just have some carcinogenic effect to boot. Hell, let's go ahead and say this: soy causes leg cancer. You know what? It's *still better for the human body than any high-intake meat diet anyone has ever eaten.* Soy does not increase risk of heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, ingested putrefaction, bacterial/parasitic ingestion, autoimmune disease, or impotence. The vast majority of meat also contains artificial hormones and a variety of antibiotic drugs. No one (presumably) eats soy in the amounts that the typical American eats meats, so any attempt to use this miracle bean against any three pillars of veganism is an exercise in futility.\n\n&gt; I feel eating a lamb is justified because it's a lamb, and I'm an omnivore.\n\nBy choice. You are not an obligate carnivore.\n\n&gt; I'm not saying I believe that I shouldn't take care to slaughter it humanely, but they aren't the same as humans.\n\nAgain, their inequality does not damn them to insentience. If you're wanting to argue the cognitive differences and relatively associated morality of predatory free will, then you're going to have to present a better case than this repetitive, rudimentary \"we ain't the same as them.\"  \n\n&gt; Yeah, I want to eat a lamb, and I'm smart enough to do it. So, yum!\n\nYes, but as I touched upon earlier, are you \"smart enough\" to kill one? Do you deserve to eat that which you have not reared? You may have the means to pay someone else to do the dirty-work, but you have not birthed, fed, raised, killed, and cleaned the animal yourself. And people say vegans are self-entitled...","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0021729300109048686,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1894440354292427,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1415593201915423,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18474931374581116,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3822010483237499,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30189474930482735,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07233187036278348,"diet_1":-0.09532501347212019,"diet_2":-0.3668401837212514,"diet_3":-0.06659155565227243,"diet_4":-0.3673093914985657,"diet_5":-0.027936852537093177,"diet_6":-0.02337578622002449,"diet_8":-0.03207124598944944,"diet_9":-0.09307052598645289,"diet_10":-0.1363490909958879,"diet_11":-0.2221852858884133,"diet_13":-0.09151933838923772,"diet_14":-0.09458983665293393,"diet_17":-0.17028005855778852},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (opposes specific instance of processed soy, but supports veganism in general)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear.

He was very rude to him, pulling him on his leash, the dog was not even able to walk but was pulled around.\nWhen his owner was inside, we pet the dog.\n\nThen he came out again and yelled at us what's wrong with us to touch his property.
