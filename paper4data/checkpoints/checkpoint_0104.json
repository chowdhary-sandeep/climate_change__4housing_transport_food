"comment": "It's a cost benefit analysis. The investment is letting a company use part of your home to collect energy and then sell you that energy at a slightly lower rate than you currently pay. Then they pocket the payments you give them, along with the 30% Federal Tax credit for the total cost of the system (a benefit that people who own their systems see).\n\nYou also enter into a lease agreement that must be transferred should you sell the home to another person.\n\nIf you actually buy the system up front, you can recoup the entire investment in 7-12 years (normally) and then you have free energy for the next 20+ years as electricity rates rise. Also, the value of your home increases when you own the system (approximately $5900 per kW installed)\n\nIf you have the money, owning the system is a no brainer.",

Long commutes = not very good right now unless I wanna drop 80K for a tesla. \n\nWeirdly enough, I've been a conservative breaker, so I don't replace breaks. My Taurus was given to me with new breaks, and it's been 3 years and so far, no harm, no foul. I did, however, warp the rotor because of going up and down so many hills - sucks living in a mountain region! \n\nI believe another factor with insurance is how likely a car is to get stolen. I don't have any tickets or accidents under my license, and I'd like to keep it that way. \n\nSo any car I buy - brand new - we'll say the price tag is a solid 30,000. I would apply for the tax break and get 7.5k back? In the end, the car would only cost me ~22.5k\n\nI'm sensing that there are limitations and model exceptions to this. (And not to mention loan and all of that interest and stuff). \n\nBut thank you very much!",

Your wish would never come true if he and others were not receiving massive subsidies to produce and sell them from the government. Almost NO electric vehicle would be sold with out the subsidy. Same with solar panels. Musk sucks the lifeblood of this country and the average person gets nothing. \n\nAs far as wood goes, England just tried tax breaks for renewal (wood) energy sources and additional taxes for petroleum based fuels. . They were cutting down entire forests in the American South to get wood fiber. Quite a bit of England has been denuded because of such nonsense. Effect on air quality? abysmal. No poor person is going to buy a $1500 wood stove with catalytic converter when Grandpa left them a stove sitting in the barn. I lived in the south where wood was used for heat in the winter. You could not breathe in a populated area in the 1960s. \n\n What are **YOU** talking about? Just STFU totally.",

"comment": "He touts SpaceX as a step towards Mars colonization. That's nuts. Mars lacks an atmosphere or magnetic field to deflect all that cosmic radiation, and its gravity is to low for human health but still a significant impediment to liftoff. Colonizing Mars offers no real advantage over the creation of completely artificial, free orbiting space colonies, like those proposed by Gerard K. O'Neil in 1976.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Frontier:_Human_Colonies_in_Space\n\nElectric vehicles do not provide much advantage if their electrical power is ultimately derived from fossil fuels. Some think that that the personal automobile must be abandoned altogether. Perhaps Tesla is the bridge technology back to trains and bicycles.\n\nThere is often criticism of the extensive public subsidies his endeavors receive, though I have no problem with that, as almost all of our advanced technology has resulted from public research and subsidy, especially as part of national defense.\n\nStill, I agree with Peter Thiel, that surviving the future will require more than just algorithms. It needs things with actual nuts and bolts, and Musk is attempting to provide them.",

Sure, there will be exceptions, but that is why they said \"for the vast majority of people\". Which is correct.\n\n&gt; but until range increases they limit your activities if you don't have another vehicle\n\nDid you even read the article? The data is about the *average* Americans habits. The overwhelming majority of those are ICE drivers. So there is no \"limit\" which you talk about. They make their assertions based on the habits of ICE drivers, not EV drivers. What you claim is illogical.\n\nThe one area where gas cars are much better than EVs is in long-distance travel, even if Tesla is working hard to change that, for their drivers. That's my concession, and EVs won't hit mainstream until they got that area covered as well. However, for the day to day useage, they are already good enough for the vast majority of people without needing to recharge during the day.",

I pretty much expect most of the quick lubes to go away, and the ones that stick around will be ones that are similar to a Pep Boys or Autozone that have a store for general car consumables (cleaning products, wipers, fluids, tires, batteries, etc) as their core business, and also a small shop to do AC recharges or swap your tires.",

The backseat legroom isn't great but my wife and I are empty-nesters so it's not an issue. And they're fine for the grandkids. I also find the console a bit cluttered and dated looking, but mine is now almost 4 years old. As for the premium gas it's really unnecessary. I get approximately the same mileage on regular as do others. The main advantage is that premium has a longer shelf life in the tank and many PHEV owners go months and months between fillups. \n\nGood luck on your research. Everyone has different needs so it's important to weigh all the tradeoffs. You might also consider that the electrics and PHEVs have much lower fuel and maintenance costs.",

Assuming a comparable basic vehicle to an ICE, it will experience similar amounts of weight transfer under braking, acceleration and cornering (the low COG counteracts the increased weight in these cases) but it will have the heave characteristics (hitting a big bump) of a heavy vehicle, since COG height doesn't really factor into that case.  You would end up with stiffer springs and possibly a slightly increased ride height to get similar heave behavior. Kind of like the Fiat 500e vs the ICE versions.\n\nGlad to help!",

"comment": "How close to a Tesla service/delivery center do you live?\n\nThe Tesla ownership experience seems to vary depending on how easy it is for you to go to a location in-person to complain when (inevitably) their complete and total lack of any ability to speak to a human remotely causes you problems.\n\nI would normally tell you to wait for what's coming down the line (the Mach-E is looking reaaaally good), but you seem to be in the same situation I was two months ago - with a car that was experiencing too many failures to continue to be a sole vehicle.\n\nI originally ordered a new Model 3 LR AWD, but it rapidly turned into the second worst customer service experience of my life.  I cancelled, filed a dispute with my credit card company, and won.  (Tesla promises pickup at the nearest service center - they do not honor this promise in central/western NYS)\n\nA week later I test drove a Bolt, loved it, and kicked off the purchasing process.  I bought it the following Monday.\n\nNote that due to Elon's obssession with full autonomy, Teslas are missing ADAS features that don't fit his vision of enabling a fully autonomous car and merely help the meatbag in the front seat.  As a result, you cannot get rear cross-traffic alert (standard in most newer vehicles nowadays), nor can you get a blindspot warning in your side mirrors in a Tesla.  RCTA is, by far, the ADAS feature I use the most in my Bolt.\n\nAlso, here's the tale of someone else who lived far from a service center and bought a preowned Model S:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fapb5d/ill\\_remain\\_a\\_fan\\_but\\_as\\_of\\_today\\_im\\_out\\_as\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fapb5d/ill_remain_a_fan_but_as_of_today_im_out_as_an/)\n\nAlso to note:  No EV currently on the market would have met my needs as a sole car here in central/western NY.  The Model 3 came close but not quite, so no matter what, I decided to keep my Outback when shopping.  (Keeping it on the road is MUCH cheaper/easier once it's no longer your only car.  Note that I used to do a lot of my own car maintenance myself, and now that I have a backup vehicle again, intend to return to doing so.)  So I can use the Outback for long trips.\n\nEdit:  Another possibility, depending on how long your daily commute is:\n\nThe now-discontinued Volt had one of the longest all-electric PHEV ranges on the market.  I was not wanting to go through the hassle of shopping for a used vehicle, otherwise I probably would be driving a Volt and not a Bolt right now.",

It was a bit more efficient, but not entirely sure why since it was about the same weight, had the same front surface area, and had the same drag.  \n\nThe model 3 isn't much more efficient, but is thee most efficient BEV; outside of the original Hyundai Ioniq EV.  The main reason being its superior aerodynamics.  The Volt doesn't have active shutters in the front air vents, which could have been used to improve high speed efficiency, improving its overall efficiency mark.  Being a shorter car doesn't exactly help with drag either for the Volt.\n\nThe real issue is that the Volt is basically just a modified Chevy Cruze.  They certainly put some effort into improving aero, but it's nothing compared to designing a purpose built platform that concentrates on aerodynamics and weight.\n\nThe model 3 long range is slightly larger and weighs about 300 hundred pounds more than the Volt, yet uses significantly more aluminum to keep its weight in check.  Imagine what you could drop the weight of the Volt to using the same amount of aluminum that the model 3 uses.  Of course, it wouldn't make sense to do that since aluminum also raises the costs.",

"comment": "Correct, but we are talking about resale value after 6, 8, 10, 15 years here. We have two Toyota hybrids in the family of which one is now 12 years old with the original battery. The batteries for these are not that expensive (around 2000 USD at the dealer for a brand new one) but still, if I were to try and sell it now, people would be put off by the battery age. Now, for a Tesla where a battery replacement is $20k+ it is a bit risky buying a used 2013 model. This will be true for most EVs in the future if they do not come up with batteries that can withstand 20 years of use while being charged 0% to 100% each time.  \n\n\nA real life example: I have been trying to sell a used ebike battery that has been on the bike for 400 miles. In half a year (for half the price of a new one) I have gotten exactly 0 calls or messages. People are just weary of old batteries and for a reason.",

"comment": "So your electrician is apparently not up on chargers. You can install an EVEMS (electric vehicle energy management system) charger that charges based on the actual electrical load on your electrical service minute to minute. When it’s the middle of the night and nothing is using power, the charger can charge at a high current. When there is demand for power for other things it charges more slowly. A device is installed to measure the total amount of power being used and is set to your home’s limit (200A or 100A or 60A, etc). They are not much more costly than a normal charger. For example the Emporia is $400 for a dumb charger and $600 for EVEMS.",

Take a look at like the 20 2 to 4 series models by BMW. \n\nLegacy is such a silly negative spin on companies that have been in automotive for a long time. It just feels like a cheap shot. \"Entrenched\" is about as accurate. Legacy implies they've been superceded. \n\nTesla made a great platform with the 3/Y but it's rapidly aging and limited margin to maintain market share. The numbers are impressive but they're a drop in a big bucket. Their market seems to be pretty well formed too, whereas BYD poised to break into Indonesia, India & eventually North America. \n\nTesla would be fighting on their ground as well as upscale with a $20-25K entry level model. They can't go that cheap. Those are sales lost to cheaper competitors.",

This means you can charge at (1) most non-Tesla chargers, and (2) Tesla chargers that have a \"magic dock.\"\n\nTo find these, install the Tesla app on your phone, tell it you have a non-Tesla vehicle, and do \\*not\\* check the \"I have a NACS adapter\" box.\n\nThere aren't many magic dock stations yet, but most or all of the new ones have it, so the number is growing.\n\n\"But can't I buy a NACS adapter for my Audi E-Tron?\" Sorry, not yet. Audi is signed up for this, but Tesla is admitting cars from one manufacturer at a time, and they haven't got round to Audi yet. Google suggests sometime in 2025.\n\nOnce Tesla does flip the switch for Audi vehicles, you'll be able to use a NACS adapter at Gen 3 supercharger stations. But, the cord is extremely short as I noted above, so you may have to double-park unless Audis have the charge port in a spot very close to the center at front or back of the vehicle. \"Front left side\" like a Bolt won't cut it.",

Time is obviously a huge factor here, with 2017 closing in.  I am however curious as to why it took ~6months for equipment?  Were you getting custom equipment, or China equipment?

The bigger problem now is in the soft costs -- the labor, the permitting, etc.,. moreso than it is in the panels.\n\nAlso, solar panels aren't like smart phones where having the latest and greatest makes sense.  With panels, the only thing that matters is that you install an array sized to meet your needs.  I have a 9 kW array.  It fit on my roof and garage okay.  Now, if I had space issues or shading issues, maybe I'd care about getting 330 watt panels versus the 250 watt panels I have.  But, frankly, investing in solar is far more like investing in a 401(k) than it is like buying a smart phone.  The sooner you do it, the sooner you get your ROI.  So waiting on the sidelines trying to time the market (or waiting for new technology) from this perspective is silly.",

Financially and environmentally it makes sense to do in a lot of situations and I have no problem clearing up any misconceptions pr questions you or the original commenter might have. \n\nSolar has a bad name right now and it is due to these misconceptions and combined with the technical and complex nature of the science behind turning the sun into usable power and attributing a value to that power while factoring in future market changes and time value of money it leads to an really bad taste in a lot of  consumers mouths. \n\nBut I can tell you, myself and many other professionals have gone through the data and can confidently say that there are times when going solar makes sense. \n\nThe industry is a lot farther along than a lot of people realize but at the same time consumer expectations are very far out of line with the reality and with the affect it has on them and making a real decision. \n\nMy point : it takes a hell a lot less time and effort to just pay your electric bill over and over than to research and study about how putting solar panels in certain configurations on your property can lead to a financial benefit for you. Because you literally need to understand and learn a lot of new and potentially unfamiliar subjects. Examples would be: solar geometry, current and changing panel technology, inverter, racking and mounting technology and techniques, local permitting and regulations  national regulations and permitting, local codes, utility information etc. \n\nTo make blanket statements about solar and \"if it is worth it\" is just nonsensical back and forth that does no one any good without being fully understood and evaluated by someone that is technically qualified.",

Currently, only 20 kW commercial systems can net meter. Systems above that can only reduce their own demand via installed solar - any overproduction is thrown away. We're working to raise that ceiling to 1MW. \n\nWe had a good meeting at the Electric Utility Commission last night and things are moving forward. Will post updates.",

"comment": "&gt; Where are the plans to force china\n\nWhy force them? They are already doing more than anyone else in terms of investments and increasing energy intensity, while still only sitting at half as much per capita emissions than the US.\n\n&gt; Where is the action against the thousands of tonnes of plastic wrappers\n\nBans on plastic bags, or at least a plastic bag \"tax\" if you so want is being imposed in increasingly many places. \n\nBut this line of argument is a fallacy anyway: just because there is an issue Y, we shouldn't do anything about issue X? I can assure you that all of those issues are being looked at in some context.\n\n&gt; Why is it that Carbon is evidently seen as the only form of pollution that exists?\n\nThat's nonsense. We have regulations for all kinds of pollutants, and those regulations usually helped clean them up. And every time, people like today's \"climate skeptics\" showed up decrying that those regulations (clean air act, clean water act, etc.) would lower their standards of living.\n\n&gt;  hardly over a single point of percentage, if that\n\nWhere? Not in Europe, not for *electricity* which is their primary purpose. Yes it will take a while longer to also make that count for *energy* per se but that's because technology for electrifying transport is lagging behind. But higher fuel standards are totally possible and there is a huge difference between countries still.\n\n&gt; to the degree that they fall under cap and trade in regards to emissions regulation\n\nHuh? It still emits far less than the equivalent capacity fossil plant. And yeah, most solar CSPs are supplanted with gas. What's that supposed to prove?\n\n&gt; Billions of dollars have been spent on now defunct of bankrupt solar companies\n\nThe nature of funding disruptive startups is that only a small fraction will survive. That's true for all sectors and you're applying the typical cherry pick of pointing to the non successful ones while ignoring those that succeeded. \n\nOverall, the solar market in the US is a huge success, having the amongst the fastest growth rates of *any* sector, easily in the double digits year-on-year.\n\n&gt; Green energy isn't there yet.\n\nWell, if you fight it tooth and nail because your fossil overlords tell you so than it will take much longer to arrive.\n\n&gt; Trying to force\n\nWho's forcing you?\n\n&gt; f humanity to rely on the 1% of green energy\n\nI don't know where you get that number from. Look, Germany increased their renewable electricity generation from 6% to almost 30% in about 15 years. They did that through expanding solar and more importantly wind (and wind is now already the cheapest power source available), and by improving energy efficiency. \n\nThe question here is do you really believe that the German's have faced incredible hardships to get to that point? They are still the third biggest industrial exporter, their growth is consistently high in Europe, and they have amongst the lowest unemployment rates. Other countries are on similar trajectories, without breaking a sweat.\n\n&gt; removing incentive to improve by dumping subsidies on them\n\nYou need those incentives to break into a market which has been dominated by fossil fuels for more than a century. The cumulative subsidies that fossil fuels and even nuclear have received over that time absolutely dwarves the pittance that is being spent on renewables even today.\n\n&gt; isn't helping.\n\nOf course it's helping. Massively successful, in fact. Without the German Energiewende which promised people a return on investment on solar and wind, we wouldn't have seen the incredibly rapid drop in price of solar PV installations, and indeed of wind turbines. Btw., it was this enormous success that made some solar companies unviable eventually: they weren't able to move at the require breakneck speed. Which sucks if you're that company, but ultimately was a good thing for us consumers.",

The price up front seems very extensive, however, after all the tax credits and the value it adds to your house, it's very worth it in my opinion. The guy who originally came out was very knowledgeable and actually encouraged us to get other quotes so we could make sure we were getting a good deal.\nIs there any specific questions you have about them?",

Once automated driving becomes the norm we will probably build huge parking lots way outside the cities maybe under a large solar roof or next to a power station. Thus the cars can go drive there to charge and don't use valuable space in the city. This will at the same time most likely be the end of individual vehicle ownership.",

"comment": "An inverter is required to move the power around with minimal loss. Transmitting DC over conductors of any length greater than 20', if your panels are distant from your maximizer, would lead to voltage drop in your wires and lead to transmission losses. The simplest thing to do is to invert right at your panels with micro inverters, unless your energy storage medium was located right next to your source of generation. Now, no matter what, you'll have to go through an inverter to produce the required voltage and current required by a level 2 charger. \n\nI highly doubt anybody would want to try their hand at doing a residential level off grid solar power system with a level 3 charger tacked on. For how large your DC array would have to be AND the size of the battery bank to support all of the loads (level 3 charger, house, and reserve capacity) you might as well as go commercial scale and sell charge time to whoever.\n\nRemember, Tesla is producing cars with 90kWhr batteries and made them capable to take an 80% charge in 30 minutes. Thats 90kWhr*.8= 72kWhr in 30 minutes or 72kwhr/.5hr=144kW. &lt;==== Thats a HUGE stinking array!!!",

"comment": "Energy Management advisor here from Australia.  5.6 is your magic number.  That is the amount of solar hours you have on average in California.  \n\n\nEg if you're installing a 5.2kw system you multiply your capacity by the number of solar hours to get your daily total.  So your system on average will produce about 29kw power day. \n\n\nI recommend my clients to forget all the little numbers and payback periods and approach an investment as you would any other eg buying stock on the stock market. \n\n\nTotal investment v return on equity.  Two things you need to be cognizant of, the first is that savings on energy bills are tax free.  You don't need to earn the money to pay the tax to pay the bill.  That way you should add tax to your potential ROE calculation.  Roughly this means that if you're going to save $3k per year you probably need to base your calculation on $4k because of the tax free status of your investment. \n\nRule of thumb.  Work out how much you want to eliminate from your bill.  Then reduce consumption, Produce your own power and modify your consumption patterns. \n\nSolar panels are just your fuel tank.  You need to reduce the size of the engine.  Make sure your house is fully insulated, LED lights and energy efficient hot water.  There are energy efficient heating and cooling solutions as well.  Explore these then calculate your consumption and work out your ideal PV system size. \n\nTLDR if you are spending $30k you would want to save at least $3k p.a that's a tax free, risk free investment with a solid rate of return indexed to inflation.",

But, my guess is that installing the batteries on the original system in the article would have removed the system from net metering.  \n\nIn 2016, Hawaii stopped allowing new PV systems to be under the net metering program.  The ruling also said that existing PV systems can't be expanded, and if they are, they won't be under net metering anymore.  My guess is that adding batteries to an existing system also ejects that system from the net metering program. But that's just my guess of why the batteries are not connected to the main system.",

I suppose high voltage and gas don't exactly mix but I think it'd be super convenient to know that every gas station has 1 or 2 EV chargers.\n\nMy other dream is that malls and businesses place chargers at every parking spot with solar panels above. So it doesn't matter if there's an EV parked there or not. The electrical grid and infrastructure would probably need an overhaul to support that sort of load, parking lots would need to be redone to lay the cable, and it's probably cost prohibitive over the near future.",

And none of these choices make any difference juxtaposed to Nestle sucking aquifers dry, or Epic printing out millions of pages of medical records, or NRG burning God-knows how many tons of coal every day.\n\nMost people can't make a choice to buy most things in sustainable, ethical ways. Every grocery store around me (and probably you too) imports their produce from hundreds if not thousands of miles away. Almost all electronics, automobiles, and loads of other stuff people need come from other countries with horrible environmental and labor laws, arriving via a cargo ship that pollutes more than millions of cars. The idea that individuals even have the opportunity to influence large scale problems like climate change is wishful thinking.\n\nI'm vegan largely because it has a huge environmental impact, but it's one of the only reasonable choices individuals can actually make which does.

"comment": "Sure.  It was a number I came up with a while back when comparing the proportion of average solar PV output against a bunker oil container ship at an ultra-slow shipping speed option.  Imagine monocrystalline-clad cargo containers using remotely engaged electrical grid (like an SMBUS) connected at their mount points.  Already you can see that this is becoming a tall order.  I don't think I kept or published my notes since they were rough and mostly uninteresting.  The yield was abysmal, but at least it helps to supports the idea of windjammer freight returning to the seas.  My relevant post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/76kkad/til_cruise_ships_emissions_can_equal_the/dof78l2/?context=1).\n\nWhat it comes down to is that the larger the vessel, the more drag and need for significant power to overcome both sea and wind drag.  So while on a perfectly still season, 1% of bunker power could in fact deliver a fully laden container ship several weeks late at the ultra-slow rate, it's not an electric-only option due to other natural risks.  For fun I scaled it down to something like a seabus or small ferry and the numbers become much more promising (up to 4%).  However, an entirely solar option never really becomes viable.\n\nThe great example provided by /u/Dutchlawyer uses a triple hull, foil design with an exaggerated surface area of panels (537 m2).  The power proportion is likely very high in this case due to being on stilts, but with average speed somewhere between 5 and 10 km/h and being insanely expensive, it's beautiful and inspiring, but only useful for very special applications.\n\nBottom line: You just can't ignore the wind when at sea.",

"comment": "&gt; under good conditions...  \n  \nA roof over a bus’s parking spot will be bigger than the bus’s roof, and can be angled to match the sun’s movement. It’s also in direct sunlight all day (assuming bus parking facilities are now, or will be in future). Those are the good conditions you’re talking about. Without those you’d get half or less. If they aren’t in direct sunlight, then the schools themselves probably are, and they usually have flat roofs, so you can at least make the system carbon neutral by generating at the school and charging from the grid wherever they park. On the other hand, a bus roof is curved, has emergency exits, has to be safe in a crash, has to be water tight, etc.. Also solar panels last 50 years or so, while busses last 15-20 years. They could reclaim the panels and install them on new busses I guess. And again, a solar panel is about 15kg/m^2, so about 375kg per bus. Not huge, but why carry that around?",

"comment": "I was the person who started the thread referenced in this post. Today I got an email from my installer telling me that SunPower will come out and replace all of my AC250 units with new AC350 units. Even after they replaced the microinverters a year ago I was still having production issues. I can't see the panel specifics on my end but the dealer contacted me and let me know they were working to resolve the issue. Here are the last two emails I have received from my dealer:\n\n This was June 22nd, 2018.\n\nGood afternoon,   \n\n\nI wanted to take a moment and reach out to you about the Sunpower microinverters that have been experiencing issues. We have been in constant communication with Sunpower over the last several months as they worked on a better and more efficient solution for the failing microinverters. They acknowledged that they jumped the gun and replaced faulty microinverters with the same batch of microinverters that were giving us issues previously. They are now rolling out new, more efficient, and fully capable microinverters that will eliminate the failures you are currently experiencing. They will also reimburse you for the production you have lost while they worked on the problem.   \n\n\nThey will be shipping out replacement micros over the course of the next month and, as soon as they arrive in our warehouse, we will contact you to set up a date for a micro-swap.   \n\n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to work with Sunpower to give you the top quality modules you've invested in.   \n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAnd this came today, July 30, 2018\n\n Good afternoon,\n\nFirst, I would like to thank you for your patience as we continued to work with Sunpower on how to handle the failing microinverters.\n\nSecondly, Sunpower will be installing brand new Sunpower 350 modules to replace the current underproducing/failing modules.  They will dispatch their own installation teams to remove your current panels and re-install the new 350s.  A Sunpower representative will contact you directly to schedule this installation.\n\nLastly, we will be quantifying your production loss during this time and advocate for full reimbursement from Sunpower on your behalf.  We sincerely apologize for the issues you've had recently and will take all measures to make this correct.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or concerns.  Thank you!",

"comment": "Depends on what type of unit and what you have currently. \n\nEarlier this year I had a 23 year old gas furnace and matching air conditioner replaced. It was only a few hundred more to upgrade the outside air conditioner unit to a heat pump. \n\nAs I still have the gas furnace part, what I have is a dual fuel system. This means that when the temp drops to below the efficiency range of the heat pump, gas takes over and the heat pump gets a break. \n\nMy gas usage has dropped like a rock so far this heating season. My electricity, that’s a whole ‘nother story. Between the 1st floor heat pump and the electric boiler for the garage floor, let’s just say I didn’t plan on enough solar panels!",

"comment": "Electric is better I feel because in 20 years time most homes on this planet will likely have efficient solar panels on the roof to power their home and their car, and no refuelling from any station is necessary. BWM are in denial because they want to keep cars with engines just like now (albeit, different engines and different fuel—but engines), so they don't want to do the hard work of starting from the ground up on battery. IMO if they tell us they are doing both they don't have the confidence to commit. They are playing to their historical strengths and it may be their downfall in slowing their adoption of the reality of an EV world. \"Why do you drive a BMW when you can just power your car yourself at home?\" \"Really, and what range do you get?\" \"500 miles\" \"What?\"",

Net billing is where you buy all the energy you use but sell all the energy you make but at a lower rate than what you buy it at. I may not be 100% correct on this. Still trying to learn more about it.",

"comment": "There's a few things that other people didn't mention. I also live in Canada. While a space heater is a bit of a big ask, other small appliances (laptops, lighting, phones, fridges, and freezers) use a lot less power.\n\nIf you are simply looking to turn solar power into heat, the easiest thing to do is to buy dark curtains, and good, large windows, so that the sun's light gets absorbed by the curtains and turned into a passive heating source. In the summer, swap out the dark curtains for white ones.\n\nYou can also, for really really cheap, put a small, maybe $100 system onto your roof, point it south at about a 45deg angle from the ground, and then run wires to the heating element of a space heater, or some good durable resistors on a heatsink. That will passively heat your house without any battery or controller.\n\nYou could also buy black tubing, fill it with water, and then pump that water to a radiator inside your house. In this case, there isn't even electricity involved. As an example of this, you can see this video which uses this kind of system, oddly, as an air conditioner:  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w4rg3UcsgI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w4rg3UcsgI)",

"comment": "At the end of the day, what kills almost all shingle systems is sunlight. The panels will surely cut down on some the inherent wear and tear that shingles experience. If you can replace shingles beforehand that's certainly worth doing. Although you will have to think about other issues like leaves blowing under the array and catching snow and water. Things of that nature. If you do replace your roof, consider a metal roof. Barring baseball size hail, they should last much longer than a typical asphalt shingle roof. We had an asphalt roof on the house and a metal pole barn at my house growing up, and we've replaced the shingles once and they're due again. The metal buildings have had no problems at all.\n\nSource: Solar installer, been on lots of roofs.",

"comment": "You said 16 x 315 which is a 5kw system not 10kw. So $1.20/w in material which is dead on industry average excluding sunrun and Tesla. A very rough way I look at it is 1/3 of price is material, 1/3 labor, and 1/3 all of the other variable and overhead costs including the profit. Thank you for your breakdown that is helpful!! You started installing solar in 1990!? You're one of the OGs!",

"comment": "Good question! It’s complicated because there are political and market forces. Overall production is getting cheaper because wind and solar are now the cheapest form of production and they will keep getting cheaper. \n\nHowever, most of the world’s electricity is not yet made by wind and solar. And depending on where you live, there may be complex market and political hurdles.\n\nIf perovskite based solar lives up to the expectations, rooftop solar will get much cheaper. But that may take some years.\n\n…but once  solar is 1/4 the cost of coal, we can hope that most regions will see cheaper electricity for end users. \n\n(P.s. one of the reasons perovskite panels will bring down costs so much, is that they are flexible and a fraction the thickness and weight of silicon based PV. Thus installation will be much easier and cheaper.)",

"comment": "Um, most hoods and roofs are closer to 2m than 1m. Usually under 2m, but close to it. Calling BS using completely absurd estimates is pretty silly. The car is 5057 mm long and 1898 mm wide. That gives a total area of about 9.59 m^2 on the top of the car. Less due to shape, but close to it. Since it has panels on the roof, hood, and trunk saying that about 50% is solar panels isn't outlandish.\n\nThe lightyear one is 1898 mm wide, 1426 mm tall, has a 0.20 cd, and weighs 1300 kg. The model 3 is 1849 mm wide, 1443 mm tall, has a 0.23 cd, and weighs 1600 kg. That works out to frontal area pretty much within a percent of each other so the lightyear one will have much less drag and weigh much less.\n\nYou can call BS all you want, but to me your estimates are much more BS than the published numbers.\n\nEdit: Oh, and also it actually doesn't have a back window. It's all panel.",

LG solar panels are great panels.\n\nI assume everyone is dealing with supply constraints on equipment due to Covid, tariffs on imported solar panels, and semiconductor/chip shortages. Doesn't surprise me that they might need to switch out equipment, and it shouldn't impact you at all.\n\nI personally think the price is a little on the high end - although really depends on where you live and the particulars of your installation. It's not totally out of line, just a bit higher that I've seen lately for a system that large. LG solar panels do command a premium, so that may explain it.",

This was a package discount, applied at the time of quoting, which was December 2021. Install in Phoenix, AZ.\n\nOne of the other bids I got was from the Costco affiliated solar company, which was charging $15k each for the powerwalls. That company's total bid, including 17kw of panels, was about double what Tesla charged.\n\nIt took a year and customer service was lacking, but I love my system and the price was unbeatable. We'll see how I feel in a few years, but so far, generally very happy overall.",

"comment": "If you use Lithium batteries 35 kWh worth of storage should be about 5,500 lb on its own.  \n You would need about 7 KW of PV panels to recharge on an average day so 20-24 residential solar panels, about 450 Square feet of space.  So \"portable\" isn't really in the cards and material would cost approximately 40,000 USD.  \n\nWhat you are planning is a great idea and a very generous thing for you to do for your friend-- but you'll need to double-check what your goals are ultimately.  It sounds like where you started from is \"how much power do you use\" and that's the only info we have so far, 35 kWh per day.   \n\nTrust me, the difference between nothing and 1 kWh per day is huge. Communication, lighting, all that is really easy.  Living rough, but able to charge your phone and maybe even pump some water.  4-5 kWh per day and you could be running a fridge, laptop, satellite internet, etc.   35 kWh per day would be air conditioning, water heaters, electric cooktops, I don't know what else but it's above and beyond basic needs for an emergency situation.  \n\nLook into the portable kits from Jackery, Ecoflow, or GoalZero.  Should be able to get a kit with 1-2 kWh of storage, 200-300 watts of PV panels and it's a very user-friendly system, pretty plug-and-play.   It's going to be easier to ship there and it's going to be easier for them to use without finding an electrician to put everything together.  They'd be able to toss it in the back of a car and go anywhere.  I might be wrong but I think that's what you're looking for.",

"comment": "I'm not sure this is going to be a popular statement, but a few answers to your questions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Rooftop solar is *more expensive* than land-based utility-scale solar. Utilities install 10s of MWs much more efficiently than building custom systems on small rooftops. There are other benefits to rooftop solar, but there are real costs. \n2. If a traditional utility did this, then who owns the system? Your proposal sounds like the utility owns it (customers are being charged), so they will need a right to go up on the roof and maintain it. They will also need to pay for the equipment and maintenance over a reasonable timeframe (10-20 years), plus a return on capital. It's likely that utility costs will go up and not down from this versus other scenarios. Again, the costs might be worth it, but this is not a money-saving venture. \n3. If the utility owns it, then why does the homeowner get a deal? Shouldn't all ratepayers  (who are funding it) benefit from the energy? You could certainly imagine some scheme to lease payment for the rooftop space, but remember a utility can lease cheaper space (land) with better sun (no annoying shade trees) in a central location. It makes no sense that the lucky homeowner gets the cheap energy. (Note: Homeowners are, on average, a wealthy class of utility customers versus renters and apartment dwellers who could not access this program.) \n4. If it's a \"gift\" to the homeowner, then the government would have to pick up basically all of the tab. The government typically doesn't want to do this for a variety of reasons, including the cost, fairness and the potential for fraud/corruption. (For example, think of installing a system in a forest because it's free.) The government, with limited dollars, also probably wants to use fewer dollars per system to maximize its impact. \n5. Solar is growing and going to be a big part of the energy future, but a distributed solar grid is not a panacea. The grid needs energy storage (from grid balancing to seasonal peaks), alternative carbon-free emitting resources etc. [etc.](https://etc.It) You also need to pay to get the energy from place to place. \n\nSo, anyway, the reason is it would cost a lot of money and not save money and still leave major problems. That's not to say that utility-led rooftop solar deployment couldn't make sense, but you have core assumptions here that are wrong.",

Those computer certifications aren't anything to brag about. Microsoft certification isn't too hard and the other one is one of the easiest certifications to get. There is no reason to list them unless it was to pad the rest of his supposed credentials, so uncurious or intellectually lazy readers are more likely to take him at his word. Welcome to the Internet where human nature is easily duped and manipulated.  \nThe person who posted this supposedly from Erath County, Texas, a declining oil and gas producing area, so it's not a stretch to imagine some bias in there. They could be from New Zealand. You have no way of knowing. They could be a mental patient for all we know. Regardless, it seems they aim to cause distrust and create a negative image of renewable energy, while failing to mention the massive amounts of harms caused by non-renewables. Their motivation is conjecture on my part, though, so I won't go further.  \nLet's focus on what is not conjecture. The stated efficiency is outdated, and isn't even a bad relatively speaking, but he wants you to think it's a bad thing because 20% sounds pretty low. For example, plants only convert solar energy at a rate of maybe 1%. Older solar panels might reach 20%, but that's 20% conversion efficiency of a totally free, unlimited, non-polluting energy source. You can't say that about anything else that's not renewable, like wind, hydro or geothermal.  \nNewer solar panels have been created to absorb and convert UV radiation, and other traditional versions are now pushing 35% efficiency, while others under development are close to 50% efficiency.  \nTo compare, while the most efficient power plants (combined cycle power plants) might reach 60%, most are between 30% - 40% efficiency. They also put out massive amounts of pollution, heat, and use up vast amounts of water to do it. Not to mention the resources, energy, and pollution released just to get the fuel to the power plant.  \nModern gasoline engines have a maximum thermal efficiency of more than 50% when operated under ideal conditions, are only about 20% to 40%. That doesn't include externalities, such as the enormous amounts of resources and pollution producing energy just to create the gas and get it to the pump to put into the gas tank.  \nHere's the big one the author conveniently left out - Solar doesn't emit greenhouse gases the principal drivers of climate change. This not to say that none are emitted in the manufacturing and installation processes, but that's where it ends. Conversely and inconveniently, all fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases throughout extraction, refinement, and combustion.  \nBlack body radiation! Sounds serious. It's a real thing, but he totally misapplies it to drive up the fear factor. I could say that you should beware of dihydrogen oxide because it kills thousands of people and they put it in everything! That sounds serious. Dihydrogen oxide is water.  \nBlack body radiation is not bad, it's just a matter of physics. It has existed for as long as radiation from stars hit other objects. Also, black bodies don't actually exist outside of theory, they are just an explanation for natural absorption/ radiation processes. Every object in the universe that absorbs and/or releases heat emits black body radiation in the form of infrared energy, what we call heat.  \nTherefore, you are a source of black body radiation. If you didn't emit blackbody radiation, you would continue to heat up until you died. It just sounds more scientific when he says that's how satellites stay cool because it sounds so technical. It's not. Incandescent light bulbs are a source of black body radiation. Cats are a source of black body radiation. So are stoves, tv's, night vision goggles. Heck, the device upon which you are reading this is a source of black body radiation.  \nSee, it's not bad, it just sounds serious and scary which is why I said that he used it inappropriately. If it was truly a problem, we should start tearing up every piece of asphalt and painting all dark colored roofs white. If what he was implying was true, there would be microclimates (not heat islands) with thunderstorms and tornadoes over every asphalt parking lot and building with a black or dark roof, but there aren't as you have witnessed with your own eyes.  \nFinally, cooling the air during winter does not worsen climate extremes. Quite the opposite! That removes energy from the climate system. Increasing air temperatures during winter adds energy to the climate system, which increases climate extremes. He made an incredibly basic misunderstanding or misstatement of the facts. Humongous red flag!  \nLook at it this way. No one knows who this George Franklin is, so the intention is for enough people to simply accept his expertise based on the gobbledygook of credentials listed. If you found that written on a piece of paper in the street, would you treat it as seriously as something you found on the internet?  \nEven if he is an aerospace engineer, he's not a climatologist or a materials engineer, so he has no professional expertise in the solar or climate fields. His laundry list of credentials is meant to create an illusion of field-crossing professional expertise. It doesn't. Fishing reels? Come on. Maybe he read stuff about solar panels. Maybe he didn't. We don't know. We are supposed to nod and repeat.  \nWould you take the word of an aerospace engineer on neurosurgery over a neurosurgeon without verifying what was said? Would you take advice from a proctologist on heart surgery over a cardiologist? I certainly hope not.",

"comment": "Definitely that buy in bulk thing. But the pure battery part is of a home installed battery is just a piece of the puzzle. Just looking at the pure battery cost of something like a Tesla Powerwall and thinking you can back into a price is a bit like looking at the battery cost in a laptop and thinking you've backed into a fair price for the laptop. You really really want your home battery to do smart things like (A) not kill itself in a year or two, (B) charge when convenient and discharge when needed, and (C) not catch fire. These home batteries are pretty powerful pieces of electronics and energy control and them costing something on the order of $10,000 a pop doesn't strike me as crazy at this point in the tech adoption curve.",

"comment": "Maybe I'm not interpreting your post right, but as I see it your App told you how much you produced, 3692, then how much your home consumed, 2898, then did A - B for a relatively meaningless net number of 793. That is over the course of a month. That isn't the same thing as how much you sent to the grid. This is because your will send a lot to the grid during the middle of the day (example: sunny hour in the middle of the day and your solar is cranking at 10kWh, but the home is using 4kWh, so you are sending 6kWh for that nice production hour). And of course you use electricity from the grid from sundown to sunrise. The utility will see what you sent to the grid (giving you net metering credit for it) and will know what you drew from the grid (and charge you for that minus your net metering credits). This is how your bill gets computed. But this isn't what your App is set up to report.",

"comment": "The price is fair and at least you’re using a HELOC so the interest is tax deductible effectively lowering it. \nI would caution you on a single powerwall though. Not sure if it’s a power wall or a power wall + with one you only have 5kw or 5.8kw respectively which isn’t enough to power a whole house so you’re going to have to choose which circuits they hook up to be protected by the batteries and they’ll move those to a new electrical panel. Depending on your house you may need 2 or 3 PWs in order to be able to backup your entire panel. The nice thing about that is when the power goes out you don’t even know until you see the alert on your phone. It’s seamless. Also with 2 or 3 you get additional capacity to survive longer outages. When adding additional power walls the cost per will drop as the first one includes the cost of the gateway and wiring, additional power walls just stack together and leverage all of that cost.\n\nDoes your state have any monthly/annual incentives centered around the battery where additional power walls would actually accelerate ROI? Yes it would be a larger upfront investment but the math may support it. In my case the state incentives for batteries made it so every PW I added accelerated my ROI/breakeven point. My installer topped out at 3 PWs before there was no more price break so I went with 3. For reference it was 13,500 for 1 and 27k for 3.",

Could have been the cash price was $26,000, or $5.42 per watt, which is still terrible, with a 35% dealer fee of $9,100 to buy down that interest rate, for a total of $35,100.  $7.30 per watt financed is still terrible!\n\nStill though, you made no mention of kWh peak, # of panels, net metering, azimuths, actual estimated production.  All important factors.\n\nI don't know your area, but someone posted in here recently getting something like $2.30 per watt in NY.  I installed at $2.50 / watt.  Get that cash install price down and arrange separate financing.\n\nGood luck!",

"comment": "The Tesla battery pack in South Australia has proven to be incredibly effective at evening out supply from wind/solar - it switches so fast, that it improves the quality of supply.\n\nBut we do need other forms of longer term storage, such as heat storage, pumped hydro storage.\n\nWe also need power grid upgrades, so power can be moved around the country, which evens out supply and demand.\n\nOne of the great things about residential consumer rooftop solar panels .. is they provide power at the same time the household uses a lot of air-con .. so supply and demand match in hot summers.\n\nI think geothermal is actually very promising for places that are not well suited to wind and solar .. but thats not many places with large populations .. they probably cant justify nuclear anyway due to the expense .. but could afford a geothermal plant.",

"comment": "This will be a long explanation but hear me out. California currently sells or actually pays other states to take their excess electricity produced from solar, so we already have an abundance of it. A program that I listened to back in 2001 discussed how much solar panels would be needed to supply the United States. It was calculated to the square miles needed which was actually quite small. The idea though did not involve creating huge solar farms on open land, but instead calculated the amount by installing them on existing homes and buildings which would then make solar farms unnecessary. In order to do this you need to rethink centralized power plants providing power and instead build a decentralized system. Power companies then become the buyers and purveyors of our power and send it where it’s needed. This is obviously unattractive for power companies and they are the biggest reason for solar not making gains (they pay little to nothing for your excess solar energy). \n\nThat is the first step along with the need for an improved grid. The other problem with solar is storage for nights. This problem would be solved with electric cars as your storage system.  (Of course you could have a battery backup in your home). This would require charging infrastructure at places of employment and homes, etc. and cars then would be programmable (some already are) to both receive and give/sell power. Our car has about a 80 kWh battery. Home energy consumption averages 10-30 kWh a day. If you want to sell power at night because you don’t need that much energy to get to work then you program for that. You just program for your needs and choose when and how much electricity you can sell to the power company. \n\nWith that system you are making your own electricity and using it to power your car and sell any excess you have or want to sell. You charge up at work and that would also be a point to sell or receive electricity. And transportation and power companies no longer need fossil fuels.",

"comment": "And this is the problem with the rhetoric of the recently emerged abolitionists. It ignores *decades* of activism, lessons learned from psychology and sociology, and the history of the vegetarian &amp; vegan movements at large.\n\nTransitioning society away from a view of animals as property &amp; resources will be a multi-generational shift. And in the mean time, any reduction in consumption of animal products means less economic input and support of the system. A vegetarian's contribution to the system is much less than a typical meat eater. It's a step on the path towards compassion, and a meaningful one. \n\nAnd most vegans acknowledge we aren't perfect, and shouldn't claim to be. Books, bike tires, and the millions of animals that die as \"collateral damage\" as a result of the harvesting of the crops we eat, the shipping of our food, and even as a result of our own transportation.",

"comment": "&gt; Not all of them do. If only they would!  \r\n  \r\nWell that's too bad. A whole term was created for them and they aren't using it correctly. They're in the minority and probably haven't started a movement to take the term they're incorrectly using because they learn about the other word that already exists for them.\r\n  \r\n&gt; wrong again  \r\n  \r\nSo there *is* a movement of people who eat steak and call themselves vegetarian?\r\n  \r\n&gt; EXACTLY! And it's the SAME thing with \"vegans\" who aren't.  \r\n  \r\nAs I've said, no, they're not. The analogies you're making are people calling themselves something they aren't while another label already exists for their diet. Vegan-dieters don't have a one-word way to describe their diet, and, as I've discussed, it's the evolution of language that's allowing them to say they're vegan at the dinner table-- think about it, language evolves out of convenience, adapting old terms to take on new meaning, and it's convenient to say you're vegan at the dinner table (albeit wrong *FOR NOW*) and have that be it. You're constantly asked what you'd like to eat at a friend's house or at a restaurant, but you're rarely asked what you'd like to wear. So it's convenient for these people to use the term \"vegan.\"  \r\n  \r\nI understand that you're not happy about it, I understand that you and I both know that \"vegan\" applies to a lifestyle of excluding animals, not just at the dinner table, and I understand that convenience can come off as lazy, but in fact [it's just a part of evolving](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2010/nov/16/idea-time-come/ \"this is a great podcast on the evolution of people through technology, including our language\").  \r\n  \r\nWhat is wrong with calling yourself a \"strict vegan\" and letting these people have the term \"vegan?\"\r\n\r\n&gt; They are vegetarians.  \r\n  \r\nBut they can't call themselves \"vegetarians,\" vegetarians are universally understood to eat dairy.\r\n  \r\n&gt; They don't NEED a special label. If they want one, they can make up their own, but vegan is already taken.  \r\n  \r\nNot taken strongly enough, if you and I are having this discussion. If you want to be in the group that's trying to defend it from becoming an umbrella term, this is where we'll agree to disagree.  \r\n  \r\n&gt;  If I thought that was hard to do I would be ashamed of myself because a CHILD could do that.\r\n  \r\nDid someone say it was difficult to order vegan food? Why are you making this point? I'm a little confused on this one. \r\n  \r\n&gt; And heck, there's even a label for the Dr. Fuhrman folks who are eating a plant-based diet for health: nutritarian. Some of the \"vegan for health\" people have already started switching to that term and I hope others follow their lead. \r\n  \r\nThat would be great, but I don't think that term will be adopted; \"vegan\" is already understood as someone who doesn't eat animal products at the dinner table, \"nutritarian\" sounds like... I don't know what it sounds like. Someone who eats nutria? Or nutritious foods? But that's too broad of a scope. \r\n  \r\nAre you doing okay? I'm enjoying this debate, but I get the feeling you're actually kind of pissed off at me as a person. I just woke up, so I'm gonna go eat stuffs. Lemme know if you wanna keep going.",

The day I stopped eating animals was the day I found out about castration and branding. That really was enough. As far as advice goes, you don't *need* replacements. They can be fun, but you can have a wonderfully healthy, interesting diet without them. Also, if you do want treats, you might be able to buy them online. veganessentials.com has some nice stuff. But veganism doesn't have to be about replacements. It can be about fruits and veggies, whole grains and legumes, nuts and seeds, mushrooms, etc. A lot of sauces and marinades are already vegan and go very well with rice or pilaf. You can make some kickass rice dishes, hearty soups, amazing burritos/tacos, sandwiches, etc without resorting to replacements at all. Porridge is nice, too. You can buy a box of egg replacer online and then you can make all the cookies and cakes and whatnot you desire. You can make pancakes, waffles, biscuits, shortcakes, and dumplings for your stew from bisquick.",

Isn't that animal cruelty too (eating a banana that involved animal labor).? I, for instance avoid to consume products (here in america) that are not local because of that and because the more local the less environmental impact. But I still don't understand why not honey, bees are also super important for our plants to reproduce and I guess beekeepers help on that (Or maybe I'm wrong).\n\nAnd yes, I think honey is very very important nutrition wise (of course we can get that from other sources like agave and so on, or even molases which I love... wait... I'm convincing myself to stop consuming honey, lol)\n\nBut seriously, I need a more good argument that cause I used to be a vegetarian before and watching a very convincing documentary help me a lot to become a Vegan, but the honey part was missing (I'm talking about earthlings and fork over knives )\n\nThanks for your time! :)",

"comment": "Glad to hear it! It's such a shame that anarchism has so much negative stigma attached to it. Just to clarify it does not necessarily have anything to do with violence, rather only with (what I believe are) the most consistent actualisations of concepts such as freedom, justice and democracy.\n\nI haven't actually read that post in its entirety so I can't vouch for its factuality.\n\nIf you're interested, I'll post a fairly recent post that I composed specifically about VegAnarchism:\n\n\"Can I ask how many people here are interested in anarchism as a political movement?\n\nI think that those of you that are unfamiliar with anarchist philosophy, holding the principles of veganism close to your heart, should find looking into it at least a bit interesting, and at best a momentous event in your life.\nAnarchism can be broadly defined as the political ideology that deems the institutions of authority, including capitalism, to be inherently violent, coercive, undesirable and unnecessary. Veganarchism is the acknowledgement of both ideologies as being fundamentally the same, or at the least mutually complimentary. The vast majority of anarchists that I come into contact with are vegans.\n\nAnarchists are often inclined towards veganism because, as far as I believe, the world that anarchists strive for could not exist without it. Veganarchists recognise that in hoping to maintain integrity whilst advocating their principles of equality and freedom from exploitation for all individuals irrelevant of class, race, gender, religion, sexuality or age, that this must be applied to non-human animals as well. The vulgarity of profit and authority shows itself in everything that makes this world a worse place to live in, and it applies perhaps no more horrifically to the slaughterhouses that rape, murder, experiment on, steal from and destroy the most vulnerable members of our common society.\n\nThis compares to the vegan perspective, which usually holds the beliefs that an animal cannot be commodified, nor can it be treated devoid of respect for the value of its life in itself. It appears logical to me to apply this view to humans as well. I do not believe that the principles of veganism could be applied successfully to a society without creating anarchy, whether it is intentional or not.\n\nI should clarify that the usage of violence is not an integral element of anarchist principle. Some anarchists do propose it, but this is a matter of individual practice that should not be confused with the face of anarchism as a whole. Personally I do not believe that violence is compatible with a world in which humankind, the animal kingdom and Mother Earth are harmonised, but this is a decision that all must make for themselves.\n\nI hope I don’t come across trying to force anything unwanted upon you, and go ahead and ignore me if this isn’t for you, but I must say that discovering this information for the first time was nothing short of priceless and infinitely crucial in the course of my life.\"",

I do understand that much of the pet food sold in stores is produced in terrible ways. Of course this bothers me greatly! In all honesty, I wish my cats could be outdoor cats, so they could hunt in the most natural way. Unfortunately, there are too many risks in having outdoor cats. \n\nAnyway, I'm a strong proponent to keeping cats on their natural diet, which is mostly carnivorous. As a human, I can make the conscious decision to follow a vegan diet, and my body is more tolerant to it. Cats cannot get the essential nutrients they need on a purely vegan diet, and quite frankly, I think it's rather selfish to subject them to such a diet. Physiologically, they are more adept to a carnivorous diet. I'm sure there will be people who disagree with me, but this is my opinion. Cats don't destroy the planet with their factory farms, that's us humans.",

You can't brush off animal rights, veganism, and all other modes of ethics as if it were common sense.  If you can't have debates about what constitutes sentience, what rights actually are, moral significance, moral consideration, then what can you have a debate about?  Debates usually mean that the people involved have a respect or interest for both sides anyway.  A person using a moral relativist  approach is not the same as someone using the bacon defense.",

It is clearly not just \"I respect your diet so you should respect mine\". It is a case of rights that involves the actions of not just the vegan themselves but everyone on the planet. Much the same as human rights activists. I'm sure that is simple to a \"preachy\" vegan and while it tends to irritate meat eaters I can definitely respect a vegans supposedly preachy attitude if it is based upon relatively sound reasoning.",

They are high in starches and legumes, yes. But they are not necessarily plant based. Another thing these Blue Zone diets have in common is a lower average calorie intake. Something a lot of western vegans suck at. \n\nIn other words claiming that a plant based version of the Blue Zone diets for the sake of health and the environment is vegan is bullshit. It makes assumptions that you are not vegan if you eat unhealthy and that you can be vegan without taking a stand against animal exploitation and cruelty to animals.

I think it's been a couple of years since I went vegan and my family is slowly understanding why I made this change. They're also being less traditional when it comes to holidays in general (last Christmas we had Greek food catered- and most of it was vegan too!). My mom has actually been saying things like \"I'm so glad we're not going to have to deal with cooking a turkey!\" I'm hoping this may become a new tradition if it goes over well. \n\nLeading by example and normalizing it worked for my family, I guess? I'm interested to see if they warm up to veganism even more after this. I'm really optimistic about this!",

Start with the simplest things and move up from there. My favorite lazy dish right now that is fairly cheap is pasta, heat up some frozen veggies with salt and pepper and lemon juice or vinegar and then mix that all together with a mashed avocado. Simple but tasty and doesn't use a ton of dishes. I watch youtube videos about vegan meals people make to get ideas on this since it has helped me when my brain is too fried to think of what to eat.  I'm also going to agree with other posters that spices are your friend. Even if you just buy those premade spice mixes or sauces it makes a world of difference.",

"comment": "**But an essential part of their recovery and well-being is being able to learn to eat again.**\n\nI went to an IOP for ED years ago. Veganism was not allowed at my clinic either. \n\n“ED head” is what you call the part of your brain that has been tainted by the eating disorder. So your anxiety, your self loathing, your lack of ability to think in healthy ways. \n\nEveryone had their trigger food. Something that they were afraid of eating. They were afraid to eat it because they thought it was fattening, or they were afraid to eat it because they loved it so much they thought they’d spiral out of control and binge too much of it. Mine was mashed potatoes. \n\nAfter a couple of months into IOP, we had to sit down and try to eat our number one challenge food. My best friend in the class really struggled with a cupcake. She was able to eat the whole thing, but then spent the next 2 hours of clinic talking about the guilt and anxiety it gave her. Most people would say that’s not a normal reaction after eating a cupcake. Sure maybe a normal person will think “aw I didn’t need to eat that whole cupcake” but they wouldn’t dwell on it for hours after, thinking about how they’re a terrible human with no self control and nobody will love them because they’re a cupcake eating monster. I’m not even exaggerating that much when I tell you that’s what my friend acted like after eating a damn cupcake. \n\nAnyway. Almost all of us were vegetarians,  which was okay, but they wouldn’t allow us to be vegan while in the clinic. For one, a lot of people mask their eating disorders with veganism. So there was this one vegan girl who’s challenge food was to eat an egg. Cupcake girl groans because “I had to eat an entire full sugar, full carb, chocolate ganache cupcake and she just has to eat one egg??” Vegan girl chose to eat a hard boiled egg which blew my fucking mind because if you’re going to eat an egg after not eating eggs, then why go with the most eggy of egg forms? Like try it scrambled or in an omelette with some of your favorite veggies. Hard boiled eggs are weird and gross unless you’re turning it into egg salad or deviled eggs or something. \n\nEgg girl LOSES IT. Peeling the shell off the egg she’s crying already. She can’t get it up to her mouth. She’s bawling. We’re all giving her words of encouragement. She’s gagging. We suggest maybe putting some mustard on it? Maybe mash it with a fork instead of eating half a fucking boiled egg in one bite with that dry ass yolk. Maybe it’s because we’re watching? She hides under the table. You can still hear her sobbing and gagging under the table. We sit there for AN HOUR AND A HALF and she couldn’t do it. She had to stay later that night to get one on one therapy for her egg induced mental breakdown. \n\nEating disorder clinics try to help you combat your negative thinking when it comes to food. Try to minimize your ED head to a normalish level. A “normal” person doesn’t eat a cupcake and cry for hours that they’re going to become so fat that nobody will ever love them and proceed to vomit it up. A “normal” person doesn’t cry for an hour and a half over eating an egg once. Even a “normal” vegan probably wouldn’t have *that* extreme of a reaction. Even if I was forced to eat a bite of steak, which to me is the grossest thing I could imagine, I still don’t know if I would react like that (anymore). Especially not if I was forced to do it by a trained doctor who’s trying to help me recover from a mental disorder. OP should realize that she’s not a terrible person and that she’s doing this to better herself on the behalf of doctors advice. Not that she’s going to be like this or be forced to eat eggs forever. Just this once. \n\nIn IOP we had to take CBT classes twice a week. Which stands for Cognitive Behavior Therapy. This is where we learned to make note of our negative thinking patterns, so that we could notice when it’s happening and why it’s happening and try to reroute it to be more positive thinking. [We used this chart a LOT](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/95/b2/89/95b2899c548fc3883ca65fbae90f7302.jpg) \n\nOP had some statements that could fit into almost all of these. She expressed guilt, hysteria, self hatred, and that she kept envisioning 400 billion baby chicks being ground alive. \nThis is over-generalizing- she is not a bad person because one time she ate an egg salad sandwich. \nThis is also a mental filter- not being able to see the huge progress she’s making in her recovery, or the amount of chickens she saved before as a vegan, and only focusing on this one instance. Which is also magnification. Because she ate one sandwich doesn’t mean SHE just killed 400 billion baby chicks. \nEmotional reasoning- because she feels guilty, she must be a total hypocrite. Which is also self labeling.\nPersonalisation- it’s not her fault. She didn’t chose to eat the egg on her own free will. She shouldn’t blame herself. \n\nEtc etc etc.",

Horses, cats, and dogs, these animals usually have some purpose beyond their meat, so people avoid eating them, but that's mostly in the west. Go east and you'll find horse meat is eaten much more commonly. \n\nEating meat is just the way it goes. A lion eats a gazelle, that's nature. A human eating a cow is also nature. Why do vegans think we're different? Because we farm meat instead of hunting it? That's simply human efficiency. If lions could farm gazelles, they likely would as well. \n\nDon't get me wrong here. If you don't have the stomach for killing, then go on and eat your berries. Humans are omnivores after all, so you sure as hell ain't gonna die from a lack of meat in your diet. But we do have the stomach for it. We like it. It tastes good. It's got plenty of nutrients and as long as you don't go overboard, you won't get sick from it either. Meat is good.",

And she only worked 20 hours. So it was a more than fair arrangement.) She didn't have an issue. I think she actually enjoyed it. I'm sad at times she died. \n\nShe made amazing prepped food..usually made 2 peoples worth of food and just separated it into to go boxes for us to both take to work. \n\nThe diet is limiting, even more so to somebody with nut/soy allergies who can't eat a lot of bread. \n(I'm  allergic to soy and several nuts. )\n\nThe us vs them mentality though that people have is moronic.

"comment": "I often think about how it was before I was vegan.  Because I am sure I was just as resistant to the whole idea as anyone could be.\n\nI think that aside from that first inner thought that of course, veganism is better (a thought that was silenced and pushed into the mental background, because I don’t want to think of myself as a bad person), the next instant reaction was an almost visceral reaction to having to force myself to eat food that I wouldn’t like very much, and that couldn’t possibly let me feel satisfied.  Not something a person can really admit, because of course, you know everyone is going to jump all over you for being wrong. But deep down, I felt like I was right.\n\nI live in a household of both vegans and non vegans, and it’s very interesting to observe our attitudes.  The non-vegans say that my vegan food is great.  And they will try the faux meats and say they are great.  But have a bbq together and let them choose either and they will always pass on the vegan option.  I don’t think they even know why.  Even if the taste was identical, I think they would choose the meat.  That’s how deeply we get conditioned.  Not sure why.  Are we scared we might have a normal bowel movement or something? (sorry, that was /s).\n\nI’ve seen people discuss whether meat is an addiction and that’s about the only thing that would justify this behaviour.  Yet, nobody who is addicted would ever believe they are addicted, at least not in my experience. \n\nI used to feel that if I could just figure it out, I would know the answer to how to help people make the connection.  But I’m not sure if there is a good answer.",

Well, the person who booked the dinner chose a restaurant that specializes in meat. I felt embarrassed for them (the one who booked) but happily the restaurant owner adapted a couple of dishes so that also our vegan colleague could have a proper apps and entrée.

"comment": ">That’s simply a skill issue.\n\nIt's actually not a skill issue. I was raised very differently from most vegans, and seemingly from most anyone anymore, in that in my subculture they see how well you face killing animals at a young age. The purpose of this is to determine what people are naturally more suited for. Folks like myself who love animals a great deal see how they respond to killing. When you put someone to the test, they have something about themselves revealed. \n\nI have killed uncountable thousands of animals, both for food and for work. So obviously I was suited to it. But there are others that are not suited to it, and so for them to kill would be a mistake because it doesn't work. I don't really understand it because I am not that kind of person. Among my family, this is just considered a part of who you are, like your face or your heart, and like those things there is no shame in being one that kills or one that doesn't. We are taught that each has their places and their value to the Tribe. \n\n>Even people who are morally ok with it don’t revel in the act.\n\nThis I can agree with. Killing is an ability and a skill like any other. So one can take pride in doing a job correctly, without reveling in it, as you phrase it.",

Others, I expected would be nice, compassionate and respectful due to their vegan beliefs, which was perhaps foolish of me as some of them did quite hurtful things. \n\nThen I met my current partner and was kind of upset I liked them so much despite them not even being vegetarian let alone vegan. However, I think their willingness to try vegan food and they respected the fact I had a vegan home really helped. They don’t actually eat meat at all really now and they’re completely dairy free. It isn’t even something I insisted upon but happened naturally so that’s made it easier. \n\nI know for some people it would be a deal breaker, getting with a non vegan after being vegan so many years but for me it wasn’t (probs due to bad experiences dating vegans, which I know is down to those particular people but it can be disheartening) \n\nI think I also made it quite clear that whilst I would never stop them doing what they wanted to do in their own time, I wasn’t willing to compromise when we spend time together and they accepted it. As in I said there is no way that I could accommodate you in terms of eating meat and diary but you will have to accommodate me being vegan or it won’t work. If someone is willing to do that, and does it enthusiastically I think it can work!",

"comment": "Hi, very sorry to have not responded sooner.\n\n&gt; I would definitely agree that it's true that they don't exist in great number, it's rare to find a vegan who would not personal eat dumpster meat out of disgust but not condemn someone else for doing it, let alone completing that logic and furthering that to human animals.\n\nSorry, what I meant here by person, and perhaps I should have specified, was any person whether they were vegan or not. I just have a hard time believing anyone, even if they consume meat daily, would be fine with even seeing someone *else* consuming a human being.\n\n&gt; I would disagree that the factor here is aesthetic only, again going back to resistance due to brainwashing and biological predilections as you put it.\n\nI agree. I take aesthetics to mean disgust, and I don't think it's just disgust, I do think it's the other things you mention as well. One of those things would be speciesist thinking, too.\n\n&gt; I don't really see though, how it's relevant how *many* people have this sort of moral consistency, all that matters is that they do. It seemed to me that your original opinion was that you doubt anybody actually thinks that way and that it's a pure theoretical, which I disagree with. \n\nI think I said in my original post that I thought 'most' people would be in misalignment here.\n\n&gt;  I'm an example of someone who doesn't owe the demonstration of personally doing it to claim that it is morally sound to consume the flesh of animals as long as in doing so no harm was caused, regardless of species.\n\nSorry, could you rephrase this? I am having a bit of troubling parsing it.\n\n&gt; tampering with evidence and consuming the meat of a victim who's family still has a chance of receiving closure by having the crime solved, seeing their loved one again and performing rituals would fall under \"harm\" under my definition.\n\nI suppose so, but isn't this also true for other animals? When we butcher them, we render them unrecognisable. I'm not sure if animals can recognise kin if they have passed away but I imagine they do.\n\n&gt; Consuming it will not bring greater harm, is there is no way to mitigate the damage that has been done by doing anything else with what remains.\n\n&gt; It's difficult to say if removing the body is the correct thing to do, but if the body is removed I don't think that any further harm can be inflicted by eating it.\n\nJust to say, I didn't want to reply to these parts fully as I felt I covered my thoughts on this with respect to the notion of commodifying the flesh.\n\n&gt; However, I still firmly believe it is not morally reprehensible for others to do so. \n\nI'm not sure I view it as morally reprehensible, but it isn't virtuous to commodify someone and eat them without their consent, I think. \n\nBut I think, on a more practical level, consuming someone who had just recently passed away due to natural causes or disease would probably not be good for us anyway.\n\nI also just wanted to say, on emotional bias, that I do not think this is a bad thing when it comes to moral reasoning. Actually, I think it's necessary. Not to say you don't, just wanted to make my position clear on that.\n\n&gt; I think this is an interesting point and possibly the thorn in my argument. \n\nI will just say on this that I think we should aim for total liberation when it comes to this kind of thing. There's actually a very short book on this subject you might find interesting [here](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/total-liberation-anonymous-english).",
