Not great, but it could help you get home if you need just a little extra.\n\nBtw even if you could hack the wiring required for supercharing the vehicle would still need to be authorized which would require you to spoof an authorized Model S - and then Tesla would probably notice because they keep computerized records of supercharging access. Perhaps you could salvage some hardware from a crashed Model S 85...",

EV-TOU2 rates are outright criminal.  During the summer (somehow it's may through october for sdge) it's $.48/kwh between 12pm and 6pm.  So good luch charging during the day ... makes driving on the weekends especially difficult.\n\nThey only give EV users 5 hours per day to charge at a discount rate, and even that is only .17/kwh.  Gas doesn't have to drop much lower for that to be cheaper than driving an EV in California for fuel costs.\n\nSo for EVs to be cost effective you have to have solar?  That's not going to help EV adoption.\nAlso, you understand that solar energy is not free.  You're just prepaying for your power.",

"comment": "I would rather have a solar roof then solar panels.  It just makes sense.  I worry about the price. Dow had solar shingles and they were expensive and I heard didn't perform well because they got hot.  I read they have been discontinued. Solar panels are raised above the roof and get air flow under them.\n\nThe solar shingles could be less effective if you had better coverage, i.e. all the roof, to make up for it.\n\nI am not against waiting on technology.  I tend to be an early adopter, and I plan on solar, but it's expensive, getting cheaper all the time with better products.  Plus my electricity is cheap (9.3cents a kwh) so I want to do it more for the environment then to save money.  Well and when I get my electric car, I want to power it from my roof so my fuel is basically free.",

"comment": "Interestingly, all 4 commissioners voted in favor. My understanding is that if one of them voted no, they would not have a seat at the table when the actual penalties are decided. So all 4 voting in favor may be more of a procedural issue than anything else. The penalty might end up being very reasonable.\n\nFurthermore, Suniva and Solarworld did NOT file any plans as to how they would rebuild their companies, were the penalties approved, which they were obligated to do. This does not speak well for them, but I think everyone in the industry knows that these two companies are not well run. \n\nFinal comment: at SPI in Las Vegas, many developers are pushing projects into 2018. However, they see the whole trade case as a blip on the radar and that after a few months things will settle down and that the investment tax credit will continue to drive solar growth in the US the next few years. \n\nI work in utility-scale solar, so my views reflect that market segment.",

Might not be a big plus two years down the road if Tesla has full driverless capability.\n5. Bolt has more knobs and buttons that makes it easier to adjust things rather than finding the menu on the touchscreen interface.\n6. Guaranteed EV tax credits.\n7. Heated seats on Bolt cost $500 and $5K on Model 3 with premium package.\n8. Bolt has known quality.\n9. Android Auto\n\nModel 3 advantages:\n\n1. Better at long distance travel because of super charger network and lower drag coefficient of 0.23 versus .308.\n\n2. Doesn't look like an econobox.\n3. Better performance.\n4. Autopilot upgrade. How long before Bolt has adaptive cruise control?\n5. No dealer hassle\n6. Comfortable seats\n7. OTA updates\n8. Ability to upgrade to bigger battery\n9. Dual drive upgrade\n10. Model 3 safer.

They will introduce a 300+ km range option and bring in thermal management, which will prevent the battery from degrading.\n- Hyundai Kona (~400 km range).

"comment": "Why would we need more nuclear power plants to sustain EVs?\n\nWe already use heaps of electricity to produce fuel for fuel-burning cars (the fractioning process is electrically heated, the pumps are driven by electricity). We already use heaps of electricity for air conditioning offices and homes.\n\nOverall, consumption would rise about 20% if all passenger cars switched to BEVs, but there would be no changes required to our electricity infrastructure. This is because of the \"duck curve\" where demand peaks during two main periods of the day and is pretty low the rest of the time. Charging EVs can happen during the quiet times.\n\nEven better, if EVs are connected to the grid any time they're parked we can reduce peak generation capacity by filling batteries during quiet times and drawing power out of batteries during peak demand.\n\nSo we'd be shutting down gas peakers and nuclear power plants, if everyone switched to EVs.",

"comment": "At some point you have to accept that all cars have leaks.\n\nThis isn't whataboutism, this is \"object made by humans are imperfect.\" Tesla isn't helping themselves by having an opaque service department that tries their best to avoid fixing things, nor are Tesla owners being particularly helpful by publicising their problems, while BMW or Mercedes will schedule an appointment and owners of those cars are usually happy to wait for the service appointment rather than post about their issues on social media. Plus most journals will avoid negative press for easily remedied problems because they don't want to harm their advertisers.\n\nWhile you're claiming \"whataboutism\" perhaps find some indications that leaks in Model 3s are actually a serious problem, and not a handful of complaints which have been heavily publicised.\n\nRemember when one Tesla in China \"spontaneously combusted\" and everyone got onto the \"Teslas are a fire risk\" bandwagon? Where were those people when Jeep had a relatively common issue with Wranglers spontaneously catching fire? Oh … that's right it was an issue that affected about two dozen Wranglers so everyone dismissed it as not even worth reporting.",

"comment": "fear of needing to replace batteries is one of the biggest impediments to EV adoption. this thread is a perfect example of that, with topics like this popping up even though there isn't an appreciable history of EV's being junked because of the batteries. \n\nno manufacterer that is trying to expand EV sales is going to purposefully legitimize those concerns. it would hurt the EV industry in general but, more precisely, it would completely destroy *that company's* ability to sell EV's in the future. customers can have long memories - i have never bought an American car, even though it's been decades since American cars were just inferior to imports.\n\nand unlike smartphones, there's just too much competition. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartphone market while the market for autos is much more diverse. the more competition there is the more likely it is that one or two manufacturers refuse to collude. if everyone else has car batteries die after 10 years while Chevy has EVs with batteries that last 20 years then Chevy would dominate the market.\n\nand lastly, many US consumers expect their phones to last 2-3 years and don't intend to sell them at the end. with cars US consumers either expect them to last 15 years or expect to sell them before then. car batteries that die unnecessarily early would tank resale value, which consumers would not abide.",

"comment": "Thanks for the good links. Yes I tried google but they give low info articles that aren't convincing (E.g. Explains batteries can be 95% recycled, but won't mention if it can be done on large scale and for a viable price to compete with raw materials). Sometimes it's easier to find the folks closest to the data.\n\nHaven't been keeping up with Tesla as much since they are well established now. I didn't realize how well their battery performs.\n\nThere are still benefits to hydrogen just due to the energy density and hence the potential range. Also refill times would be way faster than current battery tech. So anything needing quick turn around times (think a full day road trip or industrial applications where time is money). \n\nThe energy company thing is a little hand wavy though. If it's better than the old tech then it is still innovation. It wouldn't be hard to force them to disclose if the H2 at the station is derived from natural gas, if that is what you are worried about. Most homes are powered by natural gas though.",

Technically, there is no lead Tesla has in that department other than being able to produce them at a massive scale. There are 13 battery factories are under construction in the United States alone and most of them will come online before 2025. It’s a huge uptick in supply. \n\nPeople want to believe that Tesla is a tech company, it’s not. They are just another car company without dealership model. EVs are like iPhones/Smartphones back in the day, super popular, super trendy,  but in the end when the hype is over. It’s just a tool for a job.",

We taken him in the back for a couple of weekend trips, about 4hrs each way and he does just fine.\n\n&gt;I like the EV6 and Ioniq 5. They seem like more bang for buck. They fall short on cargo space. \n\nThe ioniq 5 would be better than the EV6. It has a taller rear cargo area that would be more comfortable for a larger dogs. \n\n&gt;Love Rivian but the price and space utilization don’t work for us. Unfortunately.\n\nR1S is nice but getting a wait list now, you'll be waiting a year or more to get one plus they are adding that $20k price hike on new reservations. That really kills it as a viable option to me, the price would be crazy for the size and capabilities. \n\n&gt;Never thoughts I’d say this, but the Cadillac Lyriq looks compelling. \n\nThe Lyriq is nice but the over all shape is more wagon than crossover, the rear cargo hatch slopes down early that really cuts off the possible height in the back. Taller dogs I dont think would be too comfortable trying to stand up in the back. \n\nYou'll also be waiting quite a while for the Lyriq. Gm hasn't started production yet, expected to be around May, and they have the first year production already allocated for existing reservation holders. So it would be probably mid '23 to get one if you put in a reservation now. \n\n&gt;Mustang Mach E - maybe.\n\nThe Mach-E I would say is a good option. The rear cargo hatch has kind of the same issue as the Lyriq, in that it slopes down cutting off the height of the rear cargo area just not as much as the Lyriq.",

"comment": "level 1  \nRich-Position2776  \n·  \n2 days ago  \n·  \nedited 2 days ago  \nHaving just arrived home in my Taycan Turbo from its umpteenth week long stay at the dealership, I cannot tell you how much I wish I had bought the Tesla Plaid. I have had my Turbo for 18 months and I don't think there is a single one of those that it didn't need a trip to the shop, a visit to Electrify America when my Porsche Mobile Charger Plus failed, and then an hour-long experience on the phone with EA when their column wouldn't recognize my vehicle at the public charging station.\n\nIs it a beautiful car? Does it drive like a Porsche? Is it built solidly? Yes.But you better be buying it to drive fast, not to be comfortable -yourself or your passengers. And you better HAVE a passenger because there is almost nothing in the CRM that you can activate with less than 3-4 button pushes.\n\n As a former Tesla Model S owner, I can assure you Tesla is way out front of Porsche in anything and everything electronic. Understandable since I imagine the C-Suites of Lexus, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz must have freaked out when Elon Musk didn't fall on his face and then rushed a half-baked EV mess into the marketplace. OK. I realize these things are going to have to be worked out, just like ICEs were pretty unreliable in the early days.But wouldn't you then expect Porsche to be apologetic, solicitous, and accommodating?\n\n  \nBut my experience has been one of ongoing denials, poor customer service, and \"You should be thankful you have a Porsche\" preening. And never-ending finger pointing to blame anybody but themselves for the constant charging problems that still plague the Taycan \\[\"You must have accidentally set the maximum to 10%; we are not connected in any way with EA; Do you know how many Tacans are ahead of you waiting for that part?\"\\]\n\nThe fact that my Taycan Turbo cost nearly twice the price of the Tesla S must be God's way of telling me that over-paying for high performance, prestige and glamour is worth neither the cost nor the ongoing disappointments. What more can one say about an EV with \"turbo\" in its name and a button for an artificial ICE \"vroom\" sound?",

Manufacturers have adapted to the slowing economy (not every household is making $200,000 and up and have lots of disposable income to throw around when mortgage rates are going to be higher at renewal) by increasing MSRPs and now because things are slightly slowing down are back to the environment of selling below MSRP and subsidizing via lower lease/finance rates.",

"comment": "FCs aren't even the best way to use wasted biomass (presuming we could power an economy with waste biomass, which we can't, because solar PV and others are more efficient use of light by an order of magnitude than photosynthesis).  You need pure H2 for an H2 FC.  So you have to think of safe and perfectly sized paths for all of the other things that come from the biomass in question (like the CO2, dummies).\n\nI'm all for this technology being used to its fullest extent where appropriate.  But electricity is going to be THE backbone of the transport energy infrastructure in the coming decades, and others are going to fill niches.  With electricity we don't have to inherently worry about by products and inputs on a a very specific process that when scaled to the size of national fleets might give us gargantuan problems to deal with.  Electricity is simple and flexible, it comes from ANY ENERGY SOURCE.\n\nHydrogen and other specific chemical fuels versus electricity is like analog signaling versus digital computers.",

If not then how much value would solar panels add?",

"comment": "http://imgur.com/NzPgp4d\n\nMy DIY electric truck, solar powered.  \n\nIt's a stupid idea based on my grasp of the physical world.  Even with 100% efficient solar panels a car isn't a good place to put them.  The energy used to overcome aerodynamic drag at highway speed is enormous. Were talking tens of thousands of watts in my super-efficient Tesla.  You've got a few square meters of surface area at most.  The sun only puts out a certain amount of power. Around 1000w/sq meter at noon.  Any angular misalignment reduces that substantially.\n\nDo you want to drive slow, or drive very infrequently.  Pick one, otherwise your solar car needs to break the rules of physics.\n\nElon originally planned a solar roof as an option for the tesla.  He decided against it, impractical.  I'd love to watch you argue with elon over the physical possibility of a solar powered car that would make it in the real world.  Crash tests, high speed capability, inconsistency of solar output would all undoubtedly be among his first points.",

"comment": "One can discern the serious nuclear proponents from the rest by seeing which ones support a growing substantial price on carbon emissions with dividend, then letting local governments, utilities, and the people decide which low carbon mix is preferred.  Likely we'd see some substantial all-of-the-above mix replacing fossil fuels, with a growing share of renewables vs nuclear as the century progressed (you correctly note that renewable costs keep dropping).\n\nThere are good arguments for nuclear power and an all-of-the-above approach, but nuclear-only advocacy often derives from history and political tribalism.  Environmentalists were first to seriously promote renewable energy while traditionally opposing nukes (military or electricity) while Reagan and political conservatives was pro-nuke and stripped those pie-in-the-sky solar panels off the White House, so some are vested in ensuring the \"renewables aren't realistic\" narrative continues indefinitely.  It's also a way for climate science deniers to feel better about their positions by discrediting some of those who accept climate science but oppose nuclear power.\n\nSome Reaganites have moved on.\n\nhttp://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/george-shultz-climate-change-mit-talk-1001",

"comment": "Obviously you didn't like my example of a fake news story.\n\n Elon's company (ies) are selling electric vehicles and solar panels and electric storage devices for solar installations to the public. Your wish would never come true if he and others were not receiving massive subsidies to produce and sell them from the government. Almost NO electric vehicle would be sold with out the subsidy. Same with solar panels. Musk sucks the lifeblood of this country and the average person gets nothing. \n\nAs far as wood goes, England just tried tax breaks for renewal (wood) energy sources and additional taxes for petroleum based fuels. . They were cutting down entire forests in the American South to get wood fiber. Quite a bit of England has been denuded because of such nonsense. Effect on air quality? abysmal. No poor person is going to buy a $1500 wood stove with catalytic converter when Grandpa left them a stove sitting in the barn. I lived in the south where wood was used for heat in the winter. You could not breathe in a populated area in the 1960s. \n\n What are **YOU** talking about? Just STFU totally.",

All that it would take to make this safe (although not legal and not compliant with the energy company) would be to land the wires on a dedicated backfed appropriately sized circuit breaker.\n\nIf you add a disconnect and get the power company to set a meter you have a legit solar array.  There are a few more issues like permits and wire sizing etc., but solar is really not that difficult.",

"comment": "My opinion is that you should build a quality solar array as large as you possibly can and sell the excess back. \n\n1) if retail is $0.20/kwh the buyback rate must be pretty reasonable\n\n2) economies-of-scale begin around 8kW IMO. \n\n3) Filling up all the roof means it will age and wear evenly\n\n4) You can never have too much electricity. If the buyback rate stinks, and you have net-metering, then buy enough bitcoin mining rigs until your consumption = your production. The rigs will pay themselves off right when they become obsolete in 3-4 years. in the meantime, free heat in the winter. After that it will be battery time.\n\nEDIT: Looks like you have virtual net-metering, meaning your buddy can get retail credit for the outflow (I think). Find a nearby friend and sell him your surplus at 70% off retail.\n\n5) I have successfully implemented a scalable solar project. After the first 8kW, the client self-installed the second 4kW three years later (just recently). This was an Enphase M215 system, which I hate, but they're great for this purpose. For the original project, I suggest a minimum 60A fused disconnect through a supply-side connection, leaving enough room on the wall for a automatic transfer switch and electric service panel down the road. Size your conduit, conductors, and combiner boxes for the expansion. Run all the circuits together. Simply don't buy the extra racking, modules, and inverters. \n\nHis first project was from a turnkey installer I consulted with for $4/W. His second project he DIY-ed for &lt;$1.60/W still with Enphase, all-black mono and a black anodized racking system. It was only possible because we planned for the expansion in advance.\n\nPS. We almost waited too long. We got the \"old\" modules at a great price, but in a couple years they simply won't be around. So you want to expand within a few years. All black modules helps the aesthetics together.",

"comment": "It's complicated. I'm not suggesting that solar is cheaper than coal or natural gas today, so your case 1, regarding the costs doesn't really apply. I do think that solar can be cheaper than other forms of electricity *in some markets* and of course, we don't know what the future holds. I was really just addressing the technical feasibility of collecting energy during the day and using it later to charge vehicles, or alternate, selling the energy when it is collected and buying energy back later. \n\nIn Great Britain, where they have cold, dark winters and they might very well use electricity to heat their homes at night, solar power seems to be a very poor single source of energy. Wind, on the other hand, does still blow at night during the winter. Also, I agree 100% that nuclear energy should be part of the conversation. \n\nIf, in some markets, cold winter nights are peak energy usage, then late at night isn't the best time to  charge a car. Here where I live, the grid demand at night is significantly lower than it is during the day.\n\nIn the US, an average daily drive is about 30 miles. That means between 7 and 8 kilowatt-hours of electricity needed.  For calculating solar panel usage, that's a yearly average of about 1500 watts of panels. A yearly average is a poor way to figure it, though, because summer and winter are so very different in solar energy production.\n\nI figure a 1000 watts of panels can charge my car during spring and fall, with less needed during the summer, and way more needed in the winter - maybe three times as much in the winter. I would guess Great Britain will be even worse in the winter.\n\nSo, I am not saying that solar is a one size fits all solution to all automakers power questions. Just that solar should be considered as part of the solution, when and where it makes sense.",

If they can't, they aren't playing their distributors right.\n\nIf your roof is big enough, you don't need super high density panels, but 27 is right at that cusp of big enough depending on what your usage is.  But if you're only looking for a 'best bang for your buck' option, rather than a 'zero out bill' option, then start asking after 260's or 280's.  \n\nI dislike sunpowers because of the super-high premium they make customers pay.  fine, if you need the wattage and have a small roof - sometimes we just can't touch that if the customer wants that 'power'.  but if they want a reasonable investment, we can talk them away from that all day long.\n\nIt'd be too tough to list off a litany of options, but so long as they are \"teir 1\" (and they likely are) you'll be okay.

"comment": "Thanks for this. I guess I misread to \"optimizers\" in the SE system to be a microinverter hybrid thing. So it's just a smarter string inverter?\n\nAnd yeah, I have more space than I need on my roof, with no shading at all. The only reason I'm considering SunPower is that their discount to get into the local program was bigger than the others--the after-rebate $/W is $2.49 compared to $2.35 for the Solaria system with SolarEdge. The longer warranty (with labor) and slower power degradation and microinverters (etc.) seemed worth it. Given what I've read here, the $0.14/W is an unusually small price difference for SunPower. But it looks like even that might not be worth it?",

Can that be right?\n\nAlso, I see no rating there for kWh/year which is probably going to be far more impressive for plants like these than can be reflected in the total capacity. Anyone have an idea what the kWh/year for this will be relative to less optimally placed plants?",

You'd want to run antifreeze to prevent freezing and/or steam in the system, both of which can lead to great sadness, and exchange the heat into the water. \n\nWhen I had my PV system put in, my PV installer said they did water systems but he advised against them.  A similarly-sized PV panel can generate enough power to offset electric hot water and net metering means you can generate that hot water when needed.  Plus PV is mechanically very, very simple and has no pipes full of liquid to leak.\n\n  If you are already considering PV, I'd think about just adding a couple of panels and switch to an electric hot water heater if you don't already have one.",

I.e, in summer on a clear day, if the car is outside the whole time.\n\nOf course you'll get less under various less ideal conditions, but I think that goes without saying.\n\nMy opinion is that this, along with the outlet, makes it something that's mostly useful for people who take it camping in summer. I've had problem with the 12V battery draining on my car, so it could help avoid that, if it wasn't for the fact that it's always parked in a garage. My commute to work and back happens to be 30km, so on some days I could get the trip for free essentially. But again, the parking at work is in a garage, and the price of electricity is cheap. \n\nI think the idea would be excellent if solar panels were dirt cheap, but right now I fear it's not worth the cost for the vast majority of people.",

We would probably place at least 2/3 of the panels on roofs of existing buildings. ~~And it's not like solar panels really screw up habitats. We're not plowing down rainforests, just mounting the panels on some supports on flat ground in the middle of nowhere and creating shade underneath. Oh no.~~ &lt;--- OK I was wrong about this. But still, worth.\n\nThe point I most agree with is having to dig and lay more electrical lines. This would still be worth it. It'd be crazy expensive and more destructive than erecting the panels themselves but after it was all said and done the infrastructure would be set and ready to go for decades upon decades.\n\nSchlepped to the NE? Electricity travels near the speed of light. Yes obviously solar panels are made by mostly coal power. That wasn't a real question, it went along with my next rhetorical question right after. That's the only way to build them as of now unless some 100% renewable solar manufacturer comes along. But the more solar in the world the less coal powers our everyday needs. How the hell are we ever going to achieve 100% renewable energy without some carbon cost? We aren't. But there isn't any better way to spend that carbon cost than on the road to renewable energy.\n\n80% output over 20 years is nearly negligible, 80% after 20 years is very good. By that time we'd have more than enough clean energy from those solar panels to cover the manufacturing for the 20% decrease.\n\nI mean what's the alternative? We just keep going with coal and oil with no push for solar/wind because it'd be expensive and damage the environment a bit? Better to eventually hit 100% renewable at a low carbon cost than keep going with our current shit show of a situation with coal and oil powering everything, polluting every day.",

You can install them in buildings for example (what Tesla is doing with its Powerwall). And at the end of they really long lifetime, they can be recycled. Just like we knew how to recycle solar panels 20 years ago, we know how to recycle batteries now. There is just no plant to do it, because there is no battery to recycle yet.",

"comment": "But what if the guy is producing enough during the day to already cover night usage through the utility?  Why buy a powerwall? Or let's say he's covering most of his night use? At this point he's at least covering his daily use, let's hope. And likely much of his night use. So the number crunching is utility cost after that versus a $10,000 powerwall which is ONLY 14kWh.  If his total daily use is 50KwH that's 28% of his total. Or at best 1/2 of his night use. \n\nYou'd definitely have to crunch some numbers, but you'd likely need 2 Powerwalls to cover all usage. $20,000 versus paying say 1/2 your night use or 1/4 night uses?",

Are both parts and labor covered for 25 years or just the parts?\n\nEnphase is definitely the way to go for micro-inverters.\n\nIf you want the cream of the crop, SunPower's Maxeon panels and REC panels have slightly higher efficiency 22 - 22.8% and 92% output at year 25. You'll pay a premium price for Maxeon and REC though.\n\nI'd say there's no reason not to pull the trigger.

"comment": "A 5-6kw system should be good for you if you are southern facing and still want to be hooked up to the grid. A couple things. Electricity rates are only going up so factor that in. I would honestly guess 50% more in 10 years. Also, your house will be more valuable with solar and that should be factored in when you sell on your return. Not sure if you have gas, but you could always have a little space heater when Temps dip below 50 in winter and save there. You could add a small power wall later to act as a generator when the power goes off. The panels are pretty much maintenance free in the mid atlantic where rain washes off the pollen and dust. Don't know about So. Cal. They are warranteed to produce at 85% after 25 years. I have found that the solar panels shade my roof and my AC doesn't come on as much. I don't know california rules and regulations about charging you to hook up to their grid but I heard it is ridiculous. The east coast has SREC credits that pay you. Big difference. Lastly, at $6 / gallon for gasoline, free solar charging an electric vehicle will get your return much faster. Just my thoughts.",

"comment": "I mean this in the nicest way possible hopefully you don’t get upset but double check his quote to understand what he is being offered nefore commenting or if you did see you are spreading false information. \n\n$3/watt or under is for a cash deal installation, that equates to solar panels and inverters being installed and that’s it. The moment someone needs an MPU upgrade, ground mount, battery, really ANYTHING extra $3/watt is out of the window. $3-4/ watt is a good range when the system is financed but then again, as soon as you add something else, the that range means nothing. Do the math on his system alone, it comes out to $3.1/watt if my math was correct. We don’t know where OP lives as far as I am concerned so 3.1 is a good price depending on where he lives, maybe he has room to drop it a bit more but without knowing where he lives, it’s impossible for us to know.\n\nAgain I hope you don’t get upset, maybe you weren’t aware or didn’t understand the numbers but now you do. I’m just letting you know because for some reason a lot of people in this sub have started just posting everywhere “your quote is not $3/watt or lower you are getting f*cked by the solar company”.",

Or am I not understanding it right ?\n\nNo, not quite right, but this community can help with that :-)\n\n&gt;based on the docs it’s a 9kwh pannel .. I don’t have the gateway unit to track and on my utility bill I see just 73 KWH generated per month .\n\nYou don't rate a system size in kWh, it's kW(usually DC peak, but can be AC) or you can say how much that system produced in a time period -  day/week/month in kWh. \n\nFrom what you have said so far, it seems you have either a 9k**W**p system or a 9k**Wh** producing system - big difference in system size...\n\nThe first (kWp) is the peak system size in DC kilowatts, and is the number of panels you have x the panel wattage.  You might have for example 36 x 250W panels = 9kWp.\n\nThe second (kWh) is power used over a time period - e.g.  more like an 8 to 10 x panel system would produce in a day. That second (kWh) figure is a bad way to represent the system *size* because it changes based on clouds and so on day to day, and seasonally.\n\nThe next number that is important is your production - you say 73kWh \"per month\" - that number on your utility bill is not production, it is the *excess* production you sent to the grid after any that you used in the house during the day. That's assuming a fairly standard setup i.e. a single smart meter.\n\nSo you may have made 10x that much and used most of it - the meter only sees the excess so this reading is not a great indicator of your system performance unless you happen to be out of the house for a week or more.\n\nSo without knowing more about the system, like confirming the total size, it's hard to say if that is a reasonable excess amount to sell back to the utility.\n\nThe big question to me is *why is this a problem now* \\- have your bills suddenly changed? Or is this an installation you have come into with a house purchase and you have no history to compare it with or something like that?\n\nIf it's a new (to you) house and install, the gateway could always be hiding somewhere that you haven't found it yet, or the previous owner mistakenly packed it away or took it :-)\n\nCheck the documentation you have - hopefully there's an inverter model, or panel model, number of panels, or estimated production figures. Permit usually require that kind of info.\n\nFor ongoing monitoring you could look for a used envoy, or there are third party monitors like Emporia and Sense. The advantage of the enphase envoy is you get remote troubleshooting access, but the third party options could be cheaper.",

"comment": "Thanks for the input, I have a north facing house and the neighbours house to the west is two stories so it does cast some shade in the mid afternoon. \n\nThe Enphase quote has the solar panels out of the shade towards the front (north) and back left (south west) but the Sungrow quote has the panels diagram all along the west side of the house and at least 7 of them would be affected by the shade. I'll have to chat with the installer to see if we can move them to be more efficent out of the shade.\n\nIt is a colourbond tin roof and in this part of the country our summers get to round about 40 degrees celsius (about 104F) so I could only imagine how hot the roof would be. It's winter here at the moment and some nights we have been getting -3 (26F) so I wonder how much the cold weather would play a factor into the panels as well.",

Billions of people would die in a matter of months. Is that what the UN is hoping for?\n\n➖➖➖\n\nDr Vive states the opposite of reality. She implies climate scammers are tired of being being ignored.

I suppose if an individual is so deluded as to believe there really is a ‘climate crisis’ is quite incapable of objective reasoning.\n\nI recall this is a ploy used by the Nazis, claiming the German people to be victims of the very people they were in reality oppressing. This method of inverting the argument has a name, but I can’t recall what it is. The polite name for it, that is.\n\n• Gordon Vigurs",

"comment": "> 1- solar has other costs incl transmission and balancing and storage. For Germany that's huge. 500bn are planned for transmission alone. And you don't need just 'a battery' You need lots of them. Sunny California, looking at their current grid would need about 140gw of battery storage for good weather conditions, much more if some consecutive cloudy days. For Germany with dunkelflauten it's much harder\n\nI have several issues with this. \n\n1. 500 bn is a huge number, but in relation to a power system the size of Germany it's not that much. In particular if we are talking about a timeframe of over 20 years (until 2045). To put this in relation: Germany imports fossil fuels worth a 100 bn euro every year. How does 500 bn sound in contrast to that?\n\n2. Again, how much is 140 GW of battery storage? Not that much it turns out. There are roughly 1 million electic vehicles in California already and that will come close to 100 GW already. Germany has already over 10 GW of stationary batteries and they are mainly installed in private homes with private money. Batteries are still falling in price and sooner or later it will click and we will see a lot more grid storage added. The writing is on the wall. Everywhere.\n\n3. No one is trying to bridge \"Dunkelflauten\" with batteries only. That is where the gas powered plans come into play. When talking about Dunkelflauten you have to make yourself clear, that you're talking about something like the last 10-20% of emissions. It's not that important how to cover that, look at France. They use gas as classical peakers and it's just fine. For the future those gas powered plants can run on RNG (Germany actually produces enough of that gas to cover Dunkelflauten) or hydrogen. But that is a topic for beyond 2030. The goal now has to be to cover the first 80% of the emissions as fast as possible.",

"comment": "All the installations of wind and solar energy won't spontaneously be shut down. Our emissions will still be lower in 2025 than they were in 2015. Sure, Trump will do what he can to stop any further transitions to renewables but I doubt even he will go so far as to order the destruction of wind turbines and solar panels. Plus, Elon wants to sell more electric cars and backup battery installations.\n\nThat said, Trump will absolutely open ANWR for new drilling which will eventually lead to more petroleum burned in the U.S. So the next 4+ years are gonna suck, but I'm hopeful it's just a pause and not a huge step backwards for the climate.",

"comment": "&gt; The alternative to killing thousands of animals in vegetable planting is killing probably less animals in animal farming. So this argument just doesn't work.\n\nWe are going to need to eat vegetables even if we farm animals. It is certainly not vegetables vs meat, but rather vegetables and meat vs only vegetables.\n\n&gt; Roads vs. Not Roads\n\nThat was certainly not the point of the analogy. It was about unintentional killing vs intentional killing. The analogy was that planting vegetables is similar to building a road, in that both activities most likely will lead to harm as an unintended consequence.\n\n&gt; killing thousands of animals in vegetable planting\n\nThat's a pretty vague number.\n\nJack Norris discusses these numbers and the argument itself :\n\n&gt; Vegan Outreach calls vegan foods “cruelty-free,” but all foods involve some animal suffering. Why is it not cruel to kill animals to produce crops (displacing them from their habitat, shooting and poisoning them to protect the crops, grinding them in the thresher) but is cruel to kill animals to eat them as food?\n\n&gt;I will refer to the argument that vegans kill more animals than they prevent from suffering as the “collateral damage argument.”\n\n&gt;The collateral damage argument only applies to eating grass fed animal products, with grass-fed beef being the food normally discussed. If an animal is fed grains, then people who eat the animal foods are inadvertently causing more plants to be raised than are vegans. So by going vegan, you will increase the amount of habitat available for wild animals.\n\n&gt;The collateral damage argument gained some momentum around 2000. At the time, a woman from Garden City, MI posted a survey she did of 40 crop farmers throughout the country to the Vegan Outreach message boards (which no longer exist). The overwhelming response to her survey was that vertebrate animals are rarely killed while harvesting crops.\n\n&gt;In 2003, Oregon State University professor of animal science Stephen Davis published the paper “The Least Harm Principle May Require That Humans Consume a Diet Containing Large Herbivores, Not a Vegan Diet,” (Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics 16, no. 4 (2003): 387–94). He argued that someone who eats grass fed beef kills fewer animals than someone eating a vegan diet. There have been two academic responses to Davis’ paper.\n\n&gt;Gaverick Matheny (Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics 16: 505–511, 2003) argues that “Davis makes a mathematical error in using total rather than per capita estimates of animals killed; second, he focuses on the number of animals killed in production and ignores the welfare of these animals; and third, he does not count the number of animals who may be prevented from existing. When we correct these errors, Davis’s argument makes a strong case for, rather than against, adopting a vegetarian diet: vegetarianism kills fewer animals, involves better treatment of animals, and likely allows a greater number of animals with lives worth living to exist.”\n\n&gt;Andy Lamey (Journal of Social Philosophy, Vol. 38 No. 2, Summer 2007, 331–348) argues that the numbers Davis uses to estimate the animals killed in growing crops has some flaws (one being that he uses numbers from alfalfa farming and vegans do not eat alfalfa). Lamey sums up his findings by saying, “After reading the same studies as Davis, my own conclusion is that the science of estimating field animal deaths is still in its infancy, and is not a good basis on which to make large-scale recommendations. Davis himself concludes that more research is needed in this area. But we do not know enough to make even the rough calculations that Davis offers.”\n\n&gt;If we were to have a society that largely cared about animals, there are probably ways to prevent a great deal of the animal deaths caused by plant harvesting. The vegan movement is striving for a day when society values the lives of animals and being vegan is a good step towards achieving that goal and lessening the most animal suffering over the long term.\n\n[Interview With a Vegan: Jack Norris RD](http://letthemeatmeat.com/post/938318830/interview-with-a-vegan-jack-norris-rd)",

Studies like this aren't meant to be applied to individual people- it's averaged across entire groups and, again, can be easily explained by other factors either not pertaining to body fat or having to do with privilege/socioeconomic status/race, etc. Even social pressures may contribute to the types of people who go vegan to begin with. and, as i already said, one study actually just excluded fat vegans all together. you don't take studies that look at averages and apply it to individuals- and you certainly don't take the most extreme study out of several and decide to use only it.",

"comment": "The problem with debating over ethics is that you are debating over.... ethics. Everyone has them but no two people will ever see completely eye-to-eye.\n\nFor instance I am a vegan (like 350 days out of the year, at least) because of the proven dietary benefits (chance of reduction in the development of cancer, heart problems, and other disease) rather than any specific animal cruelty slant (though admittedly I do lean toward vegan ethics in this regard). Unfortunately this makes me the minority (a vegan purely for health, not for morality reasons).\n\nIn many ways veganism is akin to a religion, where its tenants limit their actions, intake, and choices based on belief and (usually) ethical stances. And much like religion, vegans will debate and uphold their beliefs even in the face of facts proving them wrong (though I have to say this is rarely the case with diets, as they are statistically some of the healthiest people studied). Meat-eaters/omnivores do the same, and even when faced with proof that a whole foods, plant-based diet can save their life many will not see it as a real study or a real option because they have been conditioned to eat omnivorously.\n\nIt comes down to, really, whether or not you think you can change people's belief systems and ethical reasoning - which is incredibly difficult to do if not downright impossible (in the end they're the one changing, not you). I find it easiest to just not mention my veganism (as most people will, like Christians to Muslims, Muslims to Jews, and Jews to Christians) look down on you for no damn reason.\n\nThe argument that a vegan lifestyle is healthy is not adolescent - it is true. A statistical, objective fact. Do you also not believe in GReenhouse Gas effects? Because they are proven and they do happen (this is not directed toward evsnow, but just a general, colloquial \"you\"), whether you want them to or not.\n\nForcing beliefs down someone's throat is why PETA is shunned, why political parties are rivals, and why humans dislike other groups. Vegans fall prey to this as often as omnis, they just have an actual scientific basis for some of their claims (nutrition).\n\nBut then you have their subjective claims to animal rights - which I will not even begin to breach on a vegan subreddit, since I imagine we all vaguely agree with each other - which are very much matters of ethics and philosophy, the natural sciences - AKA things we made up in the first place.\n\nTL;DR: It is - all people are dicks, all lifestyle choices are subjective. It is impossible to judge them subjectively and difficult to change people's mind - you are only really a \"jerk\" when you attempt to shift someone's ethics.",

"comment": "I think it is possible that we put an unreasonable amount of pressure on ourselves. When I initially made the decision to go vegan (for health reasons), all my friends were in my face about it - which I couldn't believe in the first place. Every time I made a mistake or made an \"ignorant\" decision they were the first ones to jump on my back. I felt guilty all the time, like I had to prove to them what kind of vegan I was. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I don't owe them an explanation or constant update on what I am eating/doing/making decisions on. My point is that I started trying to do what made me feel good and made me feel passionate. It's clear what your passion is, and I think a major part of coming to term with what your passion is includes the sacrifices that are necessary. There is a level of veganism that you have adopted into your current lifestyle that is obviously very important to you and your wife, but there also needs to be somewhere that you draw the line. She is concerned about how to convey to your child the importance of being an ethical vegan - what would concern me is the extremism. I don't argue with the value of ethical veganism, I understand it, but the future your daughter faces if your wife can't come to terms with which film to use for photography is going to be stressful. There needs to be some compromise. \n\nDo not sacrifice your passion - despite what some others are saying. Don't change your major. Do not do it. If this is your passion you are going to regret it later.",

So I'd look at mung beans by the metric ton, noodle variants (fresh udon is a favorite of mine, as are rice noodles for pad thai), a variety of different sauces for different purposes (black soy, mushroom soy, and tamari are all very different critters and add different flavors to your dishes.) Rice wine vinegar is a must; as are vegan-safe \"fish\" and \"oyster\" sauces (they exist-- though if that particular grocer carries them is a crap shoot).\n\nFresh tamarind is awesome, and often carried. Monk fruit and jackfruit too.\n\nOh, and tofu. I've pretty much always found it to be both less expensive, and in all varieties in East Asian grocers than in conventional American ones.",

One group disrupts businesses and public spaces which profit from the enslavement of nonhuman animals in an effort to start a larger conversation about animal liberation, advocating for the rights of those beings, while the other group protests funerals and preach that a fictional man in the sky has a rulebook for how humans should behave, and eating meat and stoning homosexuals are among those rules. People don't like WBC because their message is fucked from the start, and no rational person would agree with them. \nAnd if, in the course of you \"minding your own goddamn business\", you commit murder, kidnap a child, enslave billions, or mindlessly contribute to any of these things, sorry I'm not sorry for being a mild inconvenience in the course of your day. You don't like me? Cool, not my problem. My protest makes you more uncomfortable than the fact that you're paying for tortured animal flesh to go home and feed your children? Maybe we should both sit down and think about that for a bit.",

"comment": "I really hope I'm not overly cynical. But even if everybody went vegan overnight, the climate crisis will only be pushed back slightly, not solved by any means. \n\nI completely agree that veganism would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, maybe significantly so. We would surely use less agricultural land, and thus less tractors and less fuel. If we're smart about it and make food systems more local maybe even less trucks for food transportation.\n\nBut even if greenhouse gas emissions are cut severely, the climate crisis would hit just as hard, just a bit later, unless we go all the way to zero emissions. To this day, no industrialised society functions without fossil fuels, even a hypothetical 100% vegan society wouln't. \n\nAgriculture doesn't work without fossil fuels, at least not the industrialised version that has enabled 98% of the population to do something other than farming.\n\nTransportation doesn't work without fossil fuels. Electric trucks and cars are still not a real substitute in terms of range and price, and the scalability of battery production to the whole transport sector is also questionable. And don't get me started on planes. Electric planes are just not possible with today's energy densities. And even if modern planes were propelled with synthetic fuels made from nothing but air, water and renewable electricity\\*, most of their climate impact would remain unchanged despite zero net CO2 emissions, because condensation trails contribute more strongly to radiative forcing anyways. \n\nConsumerism wouldn't work without fossil fuels. Producing goods cheaply in factories, rather than expensively in small family businesses, is only possible due to the availability of cheap energy, be it for automation of production or transportation of goods, enabling centralised production, leading to efficiency gains due to economies of scale.\n\nMost importantly, heavy industry doesn't work without fossil fuels. We couldn't melt steel and glass or make concrete without coal. Without these materials, houses and roads would literally look like they did in the middle ages. Cars and airplanes would not exist. Pretty much none of today's machinery would exist. \n\nSolving the climate crisis can be done in two ways: Either we give up pretty much all of this prosperity, or we find ways to maintain at least some of our living standard without greenhouse gas emissios. \n\nVeganism is a great way to reduce our individual resource use and greenhouse gas emissions. But avoiding the climate crisis, if this is even still possible, requires much, much more. \n\nTo be honest, I've kind of lost hope, but will continue to push for regulations that make it easier for carbon-neutral technologies to be developped, and work on them myself.\n\n\\* this is actually possible, see e.g. Samavati, Martin, Santarelli and Nemanova, 2018",

I'm speaking from personal experience here.\n\nI've seen more vegan signs throughout my life than I can count. Not one of them has done anything to change my opinion, not because I didn't care, but because I didn't know how to go about making a change, and I didn't have the motivation to try.\n\nYou know what *did* get me interested? Stumbling across Julien Solomita's Aries Kitchen. I suspect that if the goal is to get more people eating vegan, you'll have far more luck showing people how awesome vegan food can be than you will by making them feel like shitbags.

"comment": "People claim to vegan in the past when they were never one to begin with. My mom was \"pescatarian\" for two years when I was a kid(although she would cheat, so not actually), and a few months ago she claimed to be \"vegan for years\", even though when I went vegetarian at 12 and then vegan at 16, she literally didn't understand that it was for moral reasons(told me I was doing it to lose weight) or that I couldn't have any animal products when I became vegan. I would have turned vegan earlier if she hadn't told me that cows die if they aren't milked. Luckily the internet told me the truth. \n\nI highly doubt this person was ever vegan, especially since she claims it was for over 40 years. Vegans did exist in the past, but the people who were vegan in the past were quite exceptional because they became vegan with very little knowledge, access to information, and guided entirely by their conscious. So for this person to go back to pescatarian after being a moral vegan is most likely a lie.",

How much water is used to sustain them. \n\nAnd then the disregard for workers in animal agriculture. The PTSD of those who work in slaughterhouses. The horrible conditions they are exposed to.\n\nWhy is it so hard to want a better life for all workers and animals?

Still fucking hungry?? Maybe you'd prefer to bury this last little piece of your child and hold a ceremonial service instead like someone who isn't fucking crazy.\n\n\nIdeating animals as food is the reason why veganism exists as a response to animal torture and death it requires to satisfy. If you find nothing wrong with the result of this ideation which is 200 million land animal deaths per day, then you've really no business calling yourself vegan. You're an omnivore and that's normal. But don't mis-use this special term which defines people who honor animals and not people who say, \"welp, already dead, into the pooper for you.\" \n\n\nHope that resonates.",

No one wants to hear a lecture about how eating butter one time disqualifies them entirely from being a vegan, while the person saying that is most certainly typing that on their smartphone (which has also caused the exploitation of living animals, children at that). Humans are also animals. Cruelty is cruelty. The human who made your smartphone in impoverished, near-slave conditions did not have full autonomy or choice in their life and they suffered for your gain (if you own these products). If you are vegan, you also need to be against the mistreatment of humans for the gain of others. If you feel that strongly about the one-time use of butter, I would certainly expect that same energy about human, and particularly human child, exploitation. An animal is an animal, even if some vegans think they can omit care and kindness to humans for some reason and still call themselves vegan...",

"comment": "That website is operated by the group that originally coined the word, The Vegan Society, and they coined it specifically for reasonings of animal rights. It’s their word, and I think they’re allowed to dictate what it means. I’m entirely comfortable being a linguistic prescriptivist in the sense that this label was created specifically to describe this particular niche. There are more appropriate labels for the other things you’re thinking of, like “plant-based dieting”, so there’s no need to bastardize words that already have clear meanings. Language can expand and evolve, so try coming up with your own word instead of trying to come up with 24 new different meanings for one word that already exists. Otherwise you’ll only end confuse people more than you’ve already confused yourself. \n\nYou were right about **one** thing though:\n\n“Not everyone cares about animal welfare” - Correct! We call these people ‘non-vegans’.",

I don’t believe any of us can forget the mouthfuls of flesh and oily animal fat that lingers. Bc when I woke up from my own unconscious infliction of cruelty and exploitation of animals for mere pleasure sensations, I felt such strong intense regret that spiraled into all sorts of feels. \n\nAnd until I sorted out my shame of having eaten animals for 29 yrs, I won’t be able to have a civil discussion where anger does not rear its head and spin the convo into a fight. It may be why it’s so hard to read “I eat meat, bc I love the taste of it,” when constant images and videos of animals being exploited are playing in the back of the mind.\n\nIt’s a skill to learn how to communicate the importance of being vegan in a meaningful manner.",

"comment": "Capitalism is what causes factory farming and agriculture to be as horrible as it is. An endless cycle of exploitation of both people and animals. Humans suffer in slaughterhouses too, and it’s still vegan to bring that into conversations about veganism. Capitalism makes sure you are comfortable at the exploitation of whoever is at the bottom. Sometimes it’s people, sometimes it’s animals, sometimes it’s both. \n\nBe mad at capitalism. \n\nCheck out the book Every Twelve Seconds: Industrialized Slaughter and the Politics of Sight by Timothy Pachirat. \n\n“The author, political scientist Timothy Pachirat, was employed undercover for five months in a Great Plains slaughterhouse where 2,500 cattle were killed per day--one every twelve seconds. Working in the cooler as a liver hanger, in the chutes as a cattle driver, and on the kill floor as a food-safety quality-control worker, Pachirat experienced firsthand the realities of the work of killing in modern society. He uses those experiences to explore not only the slaughter industry but also how, as a society, we facilitate violent labor and hide away that which is too repugnant to contemplate.Through his vivid narrative and ethnographic approach, Pachirat brings to life massive, routine killing from the perspective of those who take part in it. He shows how surveillance and sequestration operate within the slaughterhouse and in its interactions with the community at large. He also considers how society is organized to distance and hide uncomfortable realities from view. With much to say about issues ranging from the sociology of violence and modern food production to animal rights and welfare, \"Every Twelve Seconds\" is an important and disturbing work.”",
