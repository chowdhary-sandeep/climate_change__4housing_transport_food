The Nissan Leaf also seems to be a great buy. \n\nBecause of your charging situation, my suggestion would be a Honda Accord Hybrid. They have Prius like mileage but with nearly 200 combined hp and they're big, safe and cushy. Hondas are largely built in the US if you're concerned about that sort of thing and they are, of course, reliable, long lasting and have great resale value.",

I only asked the question because I was hoping you were working for a major manufacturer, which would add more weight to your statements.\n\nAs for the legions of pro-Tesla fans, it doesn't really matter.  Just like with gasoline-engine based cars, there are always owners who believe every other car is crap, that's nothing new (go ask a Mustang owner how he feels about a Camaro, many will reply the same way).\n\nPersonally, I'm very open-minded, but I don't agree with everything you are saying about the advantages of fuel cells.\n\nI'd love to see a thread which could discuss in detail the pros/cons of fuel cell vs battery, but that won't happen if folks can't keep emotions out of it.",

How the hell did they make it leave me full of questions. \n\nNow I'm thinking, how BMW (or other manufacturers) would modify their cars to accept the Tesla standards ? Will it be only for new models? Will it need an adapted? Will it be limited in current? I would love to get some answers about that in the following weeks (months?).",

It's easy to explain why, it's currently the number one weakness for EVs and it won't be completely answered until the very end of the next decade or a little later. It's not only that the energy density per litter has to double a couple of times, the price also has to decrease several times. Additionally, the capacity will also determine how fast it can be recharged. The larger the battery, the more energy it can replenish in a given amount of time, ofc provided that the electronics and the charging infrastructure can deliver it.",

Luckily it has CHAdeMO (which has pretty decent coverage here in Europe) but I do expect it to require quite a bit of planning to do.",

It's equivalent to MPG (that's the \"e\") and MPG definitely doesn't get better with a larger gas tank.   In fact, bigger gas tanks generally come in vehicles with much worse MPG.\n\nReported range ***AND*** MPGe come from \"watt hours per mile\" which is efficiency.  \n\nLook at a Tesla 90D.  Range 294 miles out of 90kwh.  Then look a Jaguar i-Pace that has a 90kwh battery and 234 miles of range.  MPGe is different because of efficiency - whm  - not capacity.  Add 18 kWh more battery to the Jaguar and it has the same range as the 90D, but its MPGe goes down, not up...  because efficiency decreases with 20% more battery weight.\n\nReported range  comes from whm (efficiency), it doesn't feed that number it results from it.",

Its a funner word when you say it like doc brown heh.\n\nYa its definitely a long game/bet.  I got a little off track but the point I was trying to make is installing a dc fast chargers isn’t currently a profitable add on to any existing business.  Having a positive roi depends on having a utilization much higher than what is realistic.  A lot of people don’t realize what the roi looks like and think installing a fast charger is easy money.\n\nI have access to free charging at work and dirt cheap at home.  Tesla was the only fast charger within 100 miles when I bought my phev.  There are a couple now but not many where I live, and the closest non tesla is maybe 15 miles.  Meanwhile there are 10 gas stations within 5 miles.  I have yet to see anyone plugged into a non tesla dc fast charger, not that I sit around waiting, but I always look for them when I take a road trip out of curiosity.  Id like to see them used.",

They want to offer the cheapest EV with that amount of range in that class, they have to save money somewhere. Using touchscreens instead of buttons is one way to achieve that.\n\nThe screen behind the steering wheel will mostly just show the speed and range, so it doesn't have to be huge. But in my opinion it's still better to have that right there instead of having to look to the center screen all the time like with the Model 3.",

"comment": "I feel you. We’ve still got an ice in my garage that my wife drives (about 12 miles a day). It’s a 17 year old jaguar xjr I haven’t had the heart to get rid of. She’s my baby. \n\nIt doesn’t get much use, but every so often we take a trip across state lines and it comes in handy :).\n\nI imagine my next electric car will have substantially more range, and the electric charging network will be better developed, totally eliminating the need for an ICE for our household.\n\nIf we wanted a 7 passenger vehicle there’s definitely no super cheap options right now. I briefly considered the Pacifica plug in hybrid for that purpose to replace my jag. It’s lacking in range, but there’s plenty for most small commutes and everyday driving my wife does, and the Pacifica gets great gas mileage on the road even after the engine kicks in so it could be a good road trip van. It’s certainly a less expensive option compared to a Tesla that might do mostly electric driving for us, but it still has an ICE. Maybe I’ll buy one in a few years as used prices settle down :)... so maybe I -will- buy another car with an ice in it...\n\nI’ve also considered replacing my jag with a volt or Honda clarity if something happened to it. Those have gas engines, but they have enough electric range that they’d only be used on road trips. A best of both worlds situation to carry us until long range coast-to-coast capable EVs are more affordable.\n\nI look forward to 7 passenger full electric vans and SUVs. I imagine they’re coming in the next 5-10 years from pretty much every manufacturer. The writing is on the wall. The EV revolution is here.",

Dont know £ prices)\n\nThe iPace with less power (320 instead of 400hp) should be the £ equivalent of 60k€, so around the merc.\n\nFrom the three cars in the list, I d personally go for the model 3.

"comment": "After a year in a Tesla with a Tesla Model 3 SR+ I have only found 2 annoying things. (40000 km, &gt; 25 trips of &gt; 400km with ladders, tools, chainsaw). I still tell \"Ernie\" how much I love him each trip ( Yes I'm that sad, he's that good)\n\n1) The load bay is not great for large items. The trunk volume is good, and the seats fold but the parcel shelf is low and does not come out. It's the first car I have had when I can't put my road bike in without removing the front wheel. \n\n2) Turning circle is big by Europe standards. 11.6m  A VW Golf is 10.9, ID3 is 10.2 (very good)\n\n   This does not sound a big difference, but Europe junctions and car parks expect a Golf turning circle and it's surprising how often you need to stop, reverse, forward when a Golf would take it on one turn.\n\nOtherwise it's the best car I've ever had by a long way ( BMW 3, Audi A4, VW Golf)\n\nIt's quiet, ride is great, very cheap to run, incredibly quick in real world driving, gets better with software updates, best available SatNav, Autopilot makes highway drives more relaxing, the Supercharger network is a big plus. \n\nIf you don't need to load big things or often park in tight corners get the Tesla, but the others are more practical. All three will be good cars. Test drive and load up the trunk.\n\nI'll get a model Y once they are available in the UK.",

"comment": "I love EVs (Bolt owner) and I love airplanes (currently shopping for my first). Maybe equally. But this... has probably the most limited market I've ever seen, and I see no point in it.\n\nIt can only carry 378lbs, meaning you cannot carry two grown adults unless y'all are small. In ICE aircraft, you can just reduce fuel quantity to make sure you fit inside the weight &amp; balance (CG) envelope.  With this, you can't change the useful load due to the fixed weight of the \"fuel\". So it's basically a single occupant airplane. Even with that...\n\nIt effectively has a range of 86 miles (50min x 90kcas cruise speed). The short range and duration means no cross countries - pretty much local or pattern work only. Since cross country work is a requirement for training (at least in US), this effectively rules out the Velis Electro as a trainer.\n\nSo... what is it? Is it for people who want to spend $200k on an airplane, only to fly it around the neighborhood for 30 minutes?  I get why this is an important jump, but for 99.999% of pilots, this thing is utterly useless.\n\nIf anyone has some alternative perspectives, let me know. I'd love to open my mind about this thing!\n\nEDIT: I work in aviation. I know that in the US, the cost of certification is a HUGE factor in aircraft cost. I'm not sure if EASA certification is cheaper, but even so, it hardly makes sense to seek certification for an aircraft that really doesn't have a market.",

Regen isn't perfectly efficient so it's not totally even up vs down, but it's quite good.\n\nYou might be just a bit early for your budget.  e-up is a good option if you can find one (they didn't make many).  Older Zoe might be available in your range as well.  There are also some EV minis from the 3rd gen (2013-2020) that you might be able to find in budget.  e-golf is a little big for your stated size, but is an excellent car.  BMW i3 has some city car appeal (though shockingly big inside), but can be extremely expensive to repair and can be painful to own out of warranty.\n\nOther smaller EV cars are the e-corsa and e208 twins, the new EV mini and fiat 500e, but they are so new prices on the used market haven't had time to come down.\n\nAs for performance, you'll find pretty much any EV will make your excellent little swift feel very slow.  With all the torque available right away and no gears to change down before power is available EVs feel very quick, especially around town.  Pulling away from stops and coming out of corners EVs leave gas cars for dead.",

I wish tesla would let go of their failing solar initiative (or acknowledge they're not going to profit on it) and focus on batteries.

EVs are one of the most desired consumer items being sold and the supply is small.  \nAlso people don't understand how big of a project it is to create an economy of scale for an industry the size of the auto industry and the complexity of a car.  \nThe product cycle from design to production on a car is very long relative to almost any other consumer item, which makes the process of innovation slower, even for ICE vehicles. Add in the fact that while EVs look the same as ICE cars, the look is deceiving. They are almost a completely different product.  \nAs has been said many times before, manufacturing is hard. And auto manufacturing is harder than most other consumer products.  \n  \nCompared to the ICE car industry, the development of EVs is happening very fast. And the production and ramping up costs are  incredibly expensive and capital intensive in comparison to most other consumer products.  \nIt just doesn't look fast from the consumer side, where we are accustomed to near instant satisfaction and many products have their costs externalized in horrific ways in order to satisfy out desire for convenience at an unnaturally low price. There are less shortcuts of this type in the EV industry, and that is a good thing.",

Look at states passing EV registration fees in the hundreds of dollars to replace the gas tax. Seems fair at first glance, right? Well, crunch the numbers, and it turns out you need to drive your car for 10s of thousands of miles in a year in some states to reach the equivalent spend a gas car would have! It has a nice side effect of making EVs seem like a bad decision, though.\n\nAlways remain vigilant against this kind of shit.

Most people that bought EVs early were enthusiasts and therefore were likely to keep buying EVs.  Most EVs (in the US) were bought in the last few years and you're likely only now getting to the point where regular people are buying them.  It's more important what non-enthusiasts do with their second car purchase rather than what enthusiasts do.\n\nThere are still significant barriers to EV ownership in the US and they may drive some people to go back to ICE until they are addressed.",

"comment": "To answer your bolded question, I have not personally heard of any major negative reliability issues with the Bolt outside of the battery recall. If you can get your hands on one with a replaced battery, or one made after the recall, you'll likely be just fine.\n\nTo answer your overall question with my own question: have you considered a PHEV? With a 15-mile average daily drive distance, you'd be able to do the vast majority of your driving on electric, while having the freedom to drive anywhere a gas car can go for long trips. Plus PHEVs tend to be a bit cheaper than full BEVs.\n\nThat said, if this is a car you plan to keep for 10+ years, that gas engine may eventually become a liability, rather than an asset.\n\nIf you want a killer deal on a brand new EV, though, and that \"ASAP\" timeframe is really ***ASAP***, you might try snagging a base Model 3 in the next few days. If you take delivery before April 1st, you'll qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit, dropping the cost down to the mid-$30k range. But if you're not in *that* much of a hurry, the base Model 3 is going to *lose* that credit either immediately on April 1st, or shortly thereafter: whenever the IRS finally releases their guidance on which EVs made in the US qualify for the full/partial credit, based on battery materials sourcing requirements in the IRA.",

I wanted to get a better understanding of why it isn't working and see if I could work around it before returning everything.  \n\n\nI don't think that the TeslaTap is doing anything unique. The adapters are passive, and the only pin that the adapter might manipulate is the PP pin but it doesn't seem like the Tesla connector responds to resistance inputs on the PP pin. As per the j1772 signaling diagram on wikipedia, the PP pin doesn't even connect to the controller in the EVSE.",

"comment": "These are the kinds of arguments that only people who are ignorant of how EVs actually work would make.\n\n> Mining the minerals to make the batteries is still harmful to the environment and even the leader in the industry has acknowledge this fact.\n\nWhat matters is the *relative gains* from switching from fossil fuels to electric power. EVs are radically *better* for the environment than gas cars, *even considering the dirtier manufacturing*. It's not even a close comparison. This common argument falls into the trap of letting \"perfect\" be the enemy of \"better\".\n\n> Many people do not buy brand new cars even when they are cheap because a used vehicle is still cheaper. This locks many people out that are buying 5k cars.\n\nThe transition to a fully electric transportation sector is going to take *decades*. I'd be really surprised if we don't continue seeing gas cars on the roads well into the 2040s. Folks who can't afford a car more expensive than $5k will be able to get an EV when used ones start to cost that much, which I think will start to happen late in the 2020s. \n\nAnd the nice thing about used EVs is that they last longer due to being simpler, and thus needing less drivetrain maintenance. So an EV sold new in 2020 will likely still be a perfectly viable form of transportation in 2035 and beyond.\n\n> Charging time is still slower and not everyone plans ahead. Some people work and pass out and forget to fill up their tank. It will take much longer to charge their car compared to filling up their tank. Many apartment complexes do not offer a way to charge their vehicle at night.\n\nEVs will literally \"plan ahead\" for you. Put your destination into the GPS, and it'll figure out when, where, and how long you should charge for. \n\nIf your apartment doesn't offer charging yet, *advocate*. Convince your landlord to install chargers, because it'll make them more money in the long run. It'll attract more well-to-do tenants who want to charge their EVs overnight. And they can make a profit from the sale of the electricity, too.\n\nAnd if you can't charge overnight at home, advocate for your employer to install them at work. Your car sits in your work's parking lot for 8 hours a day, which is prime charging time.\n\nAnd if neither of those options work for you, there are tens of thousands of public EV charging stations out there these days. It's far from ideal, but if you want an EV today, it's a functional alternative to home/work charging. The cost is higher, but if that's a problem, just stick to your current car until home or work charging become viable options.\n\n> Charging stations exist and that is great the network has grown thanks mostly to Tesla, but it is still smaller compared to gas stations on every single corner.\n\nThe charging station segment is smaller than the gas station segment because the EV segment is so much smaller than the gas car segment. EVs make up just over [1% of the vehicles on the road](https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/how-many-electric-cars-in-us.html) in the US these days. That'll change over the coming decades, and EV charging stations are already growing at an even faster pace than the EV market itself. Tesla *alone* has been doubling the size of the Supercharger network every year, and they're far from the only provider of EV charging.\n\n> We also need to ensure the electric grid at least in the USA can withstand that level of charging and the energy that is used actually comes from positive sources like Nuclear or other large scale energy infrastructure if they can't install solar on their home for whatever reason.\n\nThis is an old, tired argument as well. We're not going to suddenly go from 100% gas cars to 100% electric cars, causing a massive electrical grid failure. As mentioned earlier, the transition to electrified transportation will take *decades*, which is giving electric power providers plenty of time to shore up their infrastructure. \n\nRemember, they're *very strongly* financially incentivized to do so, because they'll get to *sell more power* to all these EV owners. They certainly don't want their grids to get overloaded, and thus lose the ability to sell power to their customers, so they're *already* working to expand and improve the grid to prepare for the increasing amount of demand from the transportation section over the coming years.\n\nI, too, wish Nuclear hadn't gotten the undeserved bad reputation it has. Chernobyl has likely killed millions more people than those who were directly affected by its fallout; people killed by the long-term effects of air pollution from coal and gas plants that might have been built as nuclear plants instead, if not for the public fear.\n\nBut we live in the world we live in, and *even when powered by a coal plant*, most EVs are less polluting per mile driven than an equivalent gas car (go [here](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric-emissions) and choose a state like West Virginia to get an almost entirely coal-powered comparison). And with the massive surge in both renewable energy sources and battery storage in recent years, we're moving past the necessity of nuclear. Soon, it won't matter that the sun doesn't shine in a given spot all day, or that the wind doesn't always blow, because we'll be able to store the excess power generated during times of low demand, and push it out to the grid during times of high demand.\n\nThe future of electrification is actually quite bright. We just need to keep up the pace.",

This last battery and tech bump for the Ioniq 5 sold it for me. That and the missing rear wiper. I will likely lease though, to still get all the tax incentives on lease. I figure in 2-3 years we’ll see some next gen battery tech that might bump the miles more. I’m also hoping for some industry standard V2H, V2L, and V2G options. Then I’ll buy instead of lease.",

How can I possibly verify this myself? Then it occurred to me. I do not know where lake Baikal is, but I do know what smoke looks like in a  [supercomputer model](http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/chem/surface/level/overlay=cosc/orthographic=103.44,42.71,410). \n So I looked for any signs of smoke and sure enough there is dark mass of carbon monoxide on top of what seems to be a lake.  A quick Wikipedia search later what seemed to be a lake is clearly Lake Baikal. Given what is going on in Washington and what went on Alaska as far as wild fires, this is very much in agreement with what is happening around the globe. Climate is changing.",

However what you say is the point of multi junction solar cells, with junctions of different semiconductors sandwiched into a single cell for take advantage of more light, however they are more expensive thus most solar panels are still made of silicon. In the end, when the fuel is free efficiency isn't a big concern, is more cheap to install more of the less efficient panels than go for the expensive ones.\n\nEdit:\nAbout using wavelengths other than visible light, as you can see in [this chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png) most of the solar power that reaches the ground is visible light, so not much point in going too far out of that range.",

"comment": "&gt; they have to go to a supercharger every day?\n\nNo, would not need to, 10kW with 100,000 vehicles (1GW) in an urban area like Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco ... is plenty.  The utility may want such capacity provided by Superchargers, rapid ramp, in certain markets and may install a strategic number of them at certain locations.  At 10kW the Tesla gets a little over 24 miles of charge per hour.  The leaf gets roughly the same at 6.6kW.  So even with those charge rates the utility can pull at 10kW in the evening for an hour or two and push after midnight for an hour or two.  The owner wouldn't even notice.\n\n&gt;you're actually introducing quite a bit of inefficiencies in the system\n\n\nYep, about 20 - 30 percent, roughly the same as hydro storage losses.  But we're talking about peak offsets, not the entire plant load, so much less than 5 percent of total power usage.  Remember that hydro has the disadvantage that it is often far from point of use, so they have larger T&amp;D losses.  Electric vehicles are located very close to point of use, often at exactly the same point.\n\n&gt;can only see this working if there is a significant overcapacity of solar power\n\nWhich is exactly what is beginning to happen, overcapacity is expected to increase at such a rate that some utlities are very worried about mid day excess.  Nice graph here https://www.solarelectricpower.org/examine-issues/technology/energy-storage/californias-bold-move-to-advance-energy-storage.aspx\n\n&gt;grid\n\nThe grid sufficient to meet 10 percent EV fleet and 15 percent generation, 40 percent mid day, is more than sufficient for distributed storage.  The power won't get beyond the substation most of the time.\n\n&gt;But I can't think of a scenario where a good portion of the population would want  sell battery-stored power on a nightly basis, and keep that sustainable over a long period of time.\n\nWholesale prices can hit 50 cents per kWh at peak demand, if a utility gave me half of that I'd be very interested at 100kWh per month, $25.  That would be about seven days per month, 15 kWh per usage, 90 minutes on a 200 mile range vehicle, 60kWh battery.\n\nThis is not some original idea of mine, there is huge interest in vehicle backed, and used vehicle battery backed storage.  The math does indeed work.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid\n\nhttp://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096359_as-solar-installations-soar-utilities-confront-distributed-renewable-power",

Modern cells probably perform better; SunPower estimates its newest generations are at significantly less than -0.25%/year, and it is probable that the industry average has also improved.\n\nFor an independent test (non-quantitative) of simulated rather than field-tested reliability, you can look at [Fraunhofer's PV Durability Initiative report](http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2013/07/pv-durability-analysis-from-fraunhofer.html), in which SunPower was the only company to get the highest possible mark on every accelerated life cycle tes.",

"comment": "Of course facts matter, but getting people to study a few years to get to the level of a scientist is not an effective way to convince people who do not want to be convinced. \n\nIf the American mitigation skeptical movement thought those 3 points were convincing, they would not focus so much time on claiming there is no scientific consensus and making up bogus claims against the scientific evidence. \n\nBut be my guest. You do know that solar power is already cheaper than coal power in India, even ignoring the environmental damages of coal? And that nowadays the energy sector is just 6% of the GDP?",

"comment": "Are you asking whether there’s any benefit to me generating more power than I use? If so, then yes, I think so. My understanding is that my utility supports net metering. Therefore, any power that I generate but don’t use right away will earn me a credit of equal power that I can use later (e.g., at night, in the winter, etc.). If I have excess credits that I don’t use, I will be paid a wholesale price for them (about 50% of their cost). Therefore, while a larger system that generates more than I consume is not a total waster, it’s not exactly a money maker. Thus, my goal is for my system to closely match my consumption. If I need to pay my utility for a little extra power once in a while, that’s no big deal. From your knowledge, does what I say sound accurate and make sense?",

From the limited info, it sounds like Sunrun put panels on a house for no down, owner leases the panels from sunrun and they cover the electricity use or a portion thereof. lease cost covers the cost of the panels over term and lease is cheaper than buying power from the utility. Then, owners prepaid the lease and sold the house to you. Sunrun has been \"made whole\" 17 years early but need you to agree to whatever terms to provide electricity from their panels to you but I could be mistaken.\n\nIt seems like they have all the leverage. They got paid 17 years early and are obligated to provide power but you need to agree. If you don't agree, they come pull the panels and they made 20 years of money in 3 years and you pay for power from the utility instead of getting power from their panels.\n\nthe guys at solarpaneltalk may have a better understanding of Sunrun's PPE.",

If so and you use Xcel, a 20kw system is too big.\n\nFrom [https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/xcel-energy/](https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/xcel-energy/) \n\n&gt;What are Xcel Energy's rates and prices for net metering?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The size of a solar panel system allowed on a customer's residence is determined by the customer’s total electricity usage from the previous year. The total output of the system must not be greater than 120% of the energy used by the customer. For most homeowners, this means that their solar panel systems are Level 1 and generate 10 kilowatts (kW) or less.\n\nSo a 20kw system is 200% of the average 10kw of usage. I think you can get the system but you could not use it with Net metering. Which is kind of the point, right? I personally plan to build a home in 5-7 years and get a \\~10kw system, while using something like the Sense electricity monitor to see what can be turned off. Also, I plan to buy appliances that are the lowest on the EnergyStar scale (but still meet my needs), as this is the best way to cut kw usage.",

"comment": "I’ve been learning some solar stuff for work recently and I can help to understand more from a conceptual standpoint. \n\nkWh - imagine 10 lightbulbs that are 60 watts each. Running those for 1 hour is 600 watt hours (.6 kWh, or $0.06. Assuming .10 kWh from electric company)\n\nIt’s much easier to not worry about charging a battery and determining size. But you might like a little insight just in case:\n\nBatteries are rated with Amp Hours (Ah).  Amps are determined from watts divided by voltage (remember that standard outlets are 120v). 10 lightbulbs at 600 watts would be 5 amps. (**only for 120v systems**) You would need a massive massive battery to cover all that power. Like $10K+ for good usage time. \n\nA 120V battery that is rated for 20 Ah will let you run those 5 amps of lightbulbs for 4 hours. (20Ah / 5A = 4 hours).\n\nYour average home power is 1,100kWh per month \n\n&gt;(1,100,000 Watt Hours). \n\nDividing by 30 gives 36.67kWh per day\n\n&gt;(36,670 Watt hours in 1 day). \n\nIf you take an average day minus sleeping (16 hours) this means that each hour you are using 2290 watts. (I took away the ‘hours’ part because we finally got down to 1 hour of power) This means that for a 120V system, you are drawing 19.1 Amps over an hour. (Don’t compare this number to ratings on equipment. Normal amp ratings on electrical systems are much smaller than this.)\n\n###It’s important to note that these calculations are for steady state power. In practice, especially with an EV, you might be pulling 25 amps over 30 minutes, but only 5 amps the next 30 minutes and then 50 the next hour. This is where the contractor comes in to determine the correct equipment and set up to compensate for maximum loads and safety equipment. \n\n—-\n\nHere’s the tricky part. solar panels will be generating a voltage in DC, not AC. That DC energy feeds into an inverter that outputs 120VAC (Volts AC) at the Amp rating you need. The panels I have at work are about 39v 8.8Amp. After conversation to AC, this gives 120V at 2.86Amps. (Tip: multiply voltage with amps, then you can divide that number by the voltage you *want*, to determine how many amps it would give.). \n\nAs you might see, we are already getting close to how many panels you might need. Inverters can take 48V dc (others can take less) and output 120VAC. With my panels, you’re looking at *about* 8 panels. Without batteries, your goal is to have just enough panels to cover the average power draw of your house, but not too many to where you’re wasting money on panels when you won’t use the energy anyways.",

"comment": "I understand your logic, but still seems like a questionable investment when you have such cheap electricity.  You're still looking at having to raise $12,000 in extra cash out of your own pocket over the next 4 years.\n\nAlso, what happens if for some reason you decide to move in the next 5-10 years?  Stock market investment is 100% portable.  Solar panels are not.\n\nUltimately, its a question of what is the return on investment under different scenarios.  Ultimately, solar makes financial sense in the long run, but you may be able to get better return in other ways, and solar can be risky if you end up moving before you have a chance to recoup your initial investment.  Just making sure you're considering everything.   If you do decide to go solar, I don't think you will regret it.",

"comment": "TileTrac from ProSolar was the ONLY thing out there for concrete tiles in 2009 when I started doing this full time.  The newest, and best, thing out there currently is a tile replacement mount. If your solar installer has a source for replacement tiles, then the hooks are in second place. The problem with hooks is that every install on a concrete tile roof results in multiple broken tiles from installers walking on them. With a tile-replacement mount, you have a source of original tiles with which to replace them. With TileTrac or Hooks, what ends up happening is that the installer will glue together the broken tiles and hide them under the panels. That glue will eventually fail and lead to leaks. Concrete tile manufacturers are pretty specific about how big a crack can be in order to be eligible for repair (it has to be 1 - 2 \", and located only in the corners). Again, tile replacement mounts may add $300 to a typical install hardware costs.",

"comment": "&gt; The RCP buyback is currently $0.1045 per kWh while the EPR6 buyback is currently $0.02895 per kWh. Scratch that, EPR6 is not eligible for residential solar. It would only be RCP.\n\nMy question was how the bill aggregates the meter readings to decide how many kWh you used and generated.  In my case, the meter is allowed to run forward and backward for 12 months, and at the end if the result is negative they pay me the wholesale rate for the excess I generated.  In other utilities, that \"true-up\" is every month, so you can save \"credits\" from one day to the next within the same month, but at the end of the month you get paid wholesale for any net excess.\n\nPunitive systems will shrink this time period, but because of the technology they usually can't make it zero.  It's a lot easier to calculate your expected return if your meter acts as \"net\" within each hour, rather than looking at your power flow from second to second.  It's not clear from the blurb on RCP if it is net for one month, or simply billed monthly.\n\nThe RCP buyback rate means you are only really penalized if you choose \"Saver Choice\" and use lots of on-peak grid power.  If that $0.10 rate really applies when you have the \"Max\" plan, then they expect you make a *profit* if you sell during the day and then buy back at night, as long as you control your demand charge.  For most people, I'm betting they all come out about the same unless they really try to shift loads or own batteries.\n\nRough estimate, if your two air conditioners pull 6kW together and the sun goes behind a cloud for an hour at least once a month, you could have a $102 demand charge nearly every month!  That would pay off three Powerwalls in 20 years, which isn't great but doesn't include the gain from storing excess production and the value of built-in backup power.",

So, not nearly as 'bulk'. So you get a worse pricing per KWh. \n\nAlso, the 'home battery' has to have management stuff, inverter, etc.; Just like the EV battery isn't the entire car, the battery in the 'home battery' isn't the whole unit.

"comment": "The companies that advertise free solar panels, they push PPA( power purchase agreement), they offer the solar for \"free\" you just pay for the power produced by the solar system.  It is a little bit cheaper than the grid, but a lot more pricey than if you purchase the system. \n\nLet's see for a 6KW solar system you will pay $18,000, you will get 26% tax credit so the net cost will be $13,320.  A 6 KW will produce on the first year on the south roof 9,000 kWh. Over the next 25 years will produce 202,500 kWh.  Net cost/kwh for 25 years = 6.5 cents/kwh or ( $0.065/kwh). \n\nA PPA of $.18 ( or 18 cents/kwh) with a 2.9% escalator for the next 20 years will be $0.36 at year 20, or an average of  $0.27/kwh, which is 4 times more than when you purchase the system.",

"comment": "This is a great chart, thank you for sharing.\n\nI have yet to see the Powerwall software actually communicate with their vehicles/chargers although I’m sure it will happen at some point.\n\nThe reset time after overload is important and it is something I wish to see in action on both products. It would actually be huge for installers and consumers if there was 100% confidence that these systems can be slightly under-designed and not have harmful effects to system. As an installer, we know there’s a difference between what the marketing team promises and what tech support says is possible after shit has already hit the fan.\n\nThe Enphase system will be a different kind of animal when the IQ8 micros become available for the roof (which is supposed to happen q2). Being able to throttle down solar power as needed means that HomeOwners can possibly go with smaller battery systems as the solar to battery ratio will be less of a concern. Also, there will be less energy lost compared to frequency shifting. I’m a bit hesitant though since enphase announced the iq8 for solar 2 years ago and it still hasn’t been released.",

"comment": "Hmm there's a lot there to dissect.\n\nYes, the AC output of my solar inverters may feed into my battery inverter when there is more energy being produced than what my home is currently using. The battery inverter I have allows for this backfeeding back into my batteries.\n\nSome solar inverters are smart and can curtail their output based on certain conditions. For example, SunnyBoy inverters can curtail output based on tiny adjustments to the output frequency of a battery inverter to prevent battery overcharging. It's not how my system works, but it's viable if you've got all the right equipment talking to each other.\n\nGrid tied solar inverters will cease production if voltage/sine wave falls out of a certain tolerance and sometimes that it adjustable.\n\nI'm not sure if I answered your question, though.",

"comment": "You have a couple of hurdles to deal with hanging onto that pump.  \n\nFor starters, the most annoying hurdle is your pump motor is designed for AC power only - alternating current.  Solar PV produces direct current.  There are a few AC motors that will tolerate - or work - using DC voltage (an electric chain saw with a cord, or a simple on/off controlled food blender), but I bet your pump motor is not one of these.  You could go to the trouble of adding an inverter to the system, but yikes, there's that cost.  \n\nThen, even though there are plenty of PV modules that will produce 230V, that 12 watt power rating on the pump is a bit problematic in that most 210V to 240V PV modules are looking to generate currents in the range of 3A to 5As.  You already recognized this, but to spell it out some, the pump is only going to use an itty bitty 0.05 Amps (12W/230V).  What this means is if you buy a big ol' 230V module it will be way too big for that little motor.  The motor would run (assuming it can run on DC voltage), but there's a lot of wasted cost in that big ol' module.  \n\nIn the end, it will cost more to marry that pump with a stand-alone solar PV system than it will to simply replace the pump with one coupled or matched with a PV module chosen or sized for the pump.  Such systems are available - I have one myself that once circulated water in a small fish pond but now does the same thing for a bird bath.  20 years old, but still doing just fine.",

"comment": "America is sprawl and that appeals to a lot of folks.  But there's a cost and risk to that sprawl.  And there's also benefits.  America could stand to be more unified in it's approach to infrastructure and cites.  I love the rural aspect of many places in America and how different parts of the country are.  But as a whole, there are massive problems with hard and soft services.\n\nEV charging is one of them.  Where is all the power coming from?  Why aren't there more incentives and initiatives for solar power on apartment complexes, townhomes, condos and detached housing?  That could offset the energy demands  of an extensive EV charging network and make power more sustainable for our usual needs.  I've seen enough videos and ran the math for my own home.  Unused power goes back into the grid.  In areas with lots of sun, MOST of that power goes back into the grid.  Multiply that by the potential dual purpose surfaces on which solar can be installed - geez.  \n\n\nHighway rest stops that provide shade and maybe a couple of EV chargers at each stop.  When not charging, those things give power back to the system that can be used else where.  It takes about 10-12 modern high output panels to produce enough power to an average home including EV charging.  Encourage electrical companies to credit user accounts for kwh put back into the system.\n\nWe have the means.  We just don't make it happen.  And federal \"tax credits\" don't fucking cut it.  Don't get me started on the cost of doing business in America either.  America taxes a lot and doesn't give back enough value IMO.  As much as I love America in many ways, it makes me nervous as fuck to live here.  \n\n\nOne of the major power companies in MOntana actively lobbies against installing solar equipment on homes.  Against.  Because they earn less money.  Said company does pay the user in account credits for energy produced.  But the fact they are also lobbying against solar is myopic non-sense.  Find another way to make money.  Fina a way to co-exist and support a future that is more energy sustainable.  We can't afford this crap much longer in the grand scheme of things.",

"comment": "\"The Grid\" as a general idiom/term is just the infrastructure that PG&amp;E (or any power company) uses to generate and transmit power.  So the Grid is what most normal customers use to get access to energy.\n\nFor solar customers that have no batteries, \"the grid\" is where extra energy is sent during the daytime so neighbors without solar use some of the clean solar power.   So at noon, a solar-homeowner could export power to PG&amp;E and get a credit at whatever the rate is at that time.  Then at 7pm when the sun sets, the solar customer takes from PG&amp;E at whatever the rate is at that time.\n\nWhat PG&amp;E is doing is using their \"grid' as a hypothetical battery.  But PG&amp;E is constantly widening the $ they pay the homeowner during the daytime versus what they charge the homeowner for electricity after sunset.  But this hypothetical battery is unavailable if PG&amp;E transmission lines go down or you're in a PSPS.\n\nSolar marketing brochures don't mention this very often, but if a house has solar-only, then the solar goes offline if the Power Company Grid goes offline.  This is to prevent \"islanding\" where a house is live/hot when the grid is down.  This protects line workers from electrocution since they need a dead grid to work on.  I know many solar customers that suddenly get pissed when PG&amp;E goes dark and they're like \"but I have solar!  Why can't I run my lights??\"\n\nBatteries let a homeowner create a \"microgrid\".  This means the solar can feed the house and batteries if the power company goes offline.  Since this \"island\" can be completely shut off from the Power company via an automatic disconnect or relay, it can remain energized even if the Power company grid  is unavailable at the location.\n\nSometimes the whole house is part of this mini-grid.  Other times, a homeowner can backup and charge only a few selected loads (like a well water pump, kitchen appliances, and a refrigerator).  But this micro-grid is usually just one home.\n\nSome communities and neighborhoods are also creating mini-grids where a whole community can be backed up with larger batteries and self-generation.  But these are more rare.",

Once the car is charged the batteries start charging. With your system you batteries should be charged in like 3-4 hours and the rest gets sold back.\n\nAnd in a grid down situation I'd let my battery get to atleast 75% and then plug the car in to charge as slow as possible at 240v until the panels stop producing.",

Due to the solar panels on the house, it’s obviously less (in September I’m still producing about 4x what is required to power the car).\n\nFor-fee chargers are charging a 30-40% premium, but there are also some free charging stations around town. The local supermarket has a pair of 32A level 2 chargers free for customers (they’re usually taken, though).\n\nHome charging is going to depend entirely on your utility provider and plan.",

At most would you a HELOC until next year tax time when you can use your solar tax credit to pay it off. When you finance solar or pay a company to do it turn key you lose most of the payback. As many have discovered selling a house with a solar plan is damn near impossible, and often times you end up paying the solar loan off out of your proceeds and they get a solar system for free.  In your situation they are looking at cutting $30 off your electric bill for a fairly sizable capital investment. I personally would wait until your can afford to pay cash for at least the majority of the system. Just my two cents.",

"comment": "Ouch 18% is rough, I don't envy homeowners down there especially combined with the proposed net metering changes. Seems the utilities want to increase rates at will and try to destroy the only available avenue for a homeowner to avoid them if possible. Can understand your plan of production by any means necessary. \n\nI typically pair the rec 405 with iq8m and use the iq8a  occassionally on perfect south roof planes with no shade. Module output is based on stc values which are absolute perfect conditions most systems never see. So panel rated at 405 will likely never actually produce that much at a given time, and if it does is very rare and inconsistent. The iq8+ I will trot out for lower tsrf value arrays when the output will naturally be even lower. For me the iq8+ is about 30 dollars cheaper per unit than the a, with the m falling right in the middle. 30x12 is obviously not huge savings when considering total system cost but the solar nerd in me loves to analyze the small details concerning both system and cost efficiency. As an installer the max string size of 11 for the iq8a would also be annoying but hardly something to worry about on your end :)\n\nYou're getting top of the line equipment so if you feel good on the company I'd definitely do it! Rec is the best manufacturer for mods imo, I have moved away from quoting them currently as they are about .30 a watt more than a close replacement but with more shipments inbound for q4 hopefully that comes down a bit.",

I calculated that an acre can generate about $40,000 of power annually at net metering rates of 12 cents, but only $10,000 at 3 cents.\n\nIf incentives and rates have fallen, then leases will fall too.\n\nI had a similar issue on the other side of the country - they're still offering $1500 based on net metering community solar, but with insufficient inflation indexing (2% escalator after 10 years).

Fortunately for us, the SunPower contractor also gave us a bid on a system using LG Panels with a Solar Edge String Inverter and their Optimizers for about $10k less at the time.  We went with that\n\nLastly, you shouldn't get wrapped up in how many panels, etc.  All you should care about is the estimated annual output in kWh.  I have a 12.48 kW system that produces over 20,000 kWh a year for the last 6 years\n\nIf your in the San Diego, Orange or Riverside County area, give Baker Electric a call.  \n\nhttps://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/16/03/p7768721/baker-electric-solar-honored-with-sunpowers-2015-residential-national-t",

You might live somewhere where clouds always come midday. Also check the panels when it's happening, could even be something like a reflection off a neighbor's house.\n\nThe import/export looks it's just the battery doing a poor job at responding and it's probably not the cause",

We were told that the system production will fluctuate throughout the year. So during the months it produces more we'll bank that extra and use it during our lower production months.  Did the previous owner say anything about the installed location? They may have agreed to it which would further tie your hands.",

"comment": "Batteries can be added without losing NEM1 or NEM2. \n\nThe issue here is that the Powerwall3 is not just a battery, but a SOLAR inverter as well. Ties directly into the meter. Because of the inverter, it counts as a substantial change to the system, thus pushing you into NEM3. \n\nThis not a battery I would ever sell to an existing customer, this would be a for a new system. If you have an existing system that’s enphase, get the 5P. If you’re on any other kind of inverter, get a Franklin.",

"comment": "I would think this becomes the norm.  I follow wholesale electric rates.  In my area, we have no TOU, with electric rates of 34¢ - I get a net metering credit of that less the 3.77¢ state assessment, so 30¢.  Wholesale rates, during the day when my solar panels are producing, the rate is about 2¢.  It makes zero sense for the electric company to give me 30¢ when they could buy it from somewhere else for 2¢.  And since our peak is now going to be overnight, it no longer has the justification of decentralizing production and less need for larger transmission lines, since we will still need them for nighttime energy.",

Your quote is so insanely high, I don't know how sunrun can live with itself.   The panels you mentioned, or at least similar ones, can be bought for .3/watt easily, .25/watt if you shop around. Just saw some 405w panels advertised for $99 each.  No way 3.5kw offsets 100%, but that's what you are stuck with to keep NEM 2.0.  You don't have to keep sunrun, as the interconnection application is for your house and meter.  If you are trying to save, you can DIY it and have an electrician do the electric, or at least hire an installer separately (see craigslist).  I assume no panel upgrade for this small of a system?  Use a growatt 3.8kw or 5kw inverter (under $700) and get optimizers (13% production increase for me this year by using optimizers), $45 each.   I'm thinking $4k for all equipment (or less), then you have to pay to have it installed (maybe $5k).",

"comment": "&gt;the clear implication of which is that discussion is a waste of time and better avoided in favour of other things\n\nIt's your assumption that this is implied. However, COULD you spend the minutes you're arguing here, in more effective activism elsewhere? \n\n&gt;Also noted that you've immediately gone for the ad hom, and an especially dishonourable one, since you know full well that my admonition to 'shut up' is tongue in cheek, and merely an unserious reference to the start of my post.\n\nHow on Earth am I to assume, that your antagonistic  command to \"shut up\" is somehow meant to be jovial and well-meaning?\n\n&gt; 'On the road to vegan' isn't vegan. \n\nDo you own books? Anything made with rubber?\n\nCan I assume you are *not* vegan, because someone, somewhere, can claim to be \"more vegan\" than you?\n\n&gt;'On the road to vegan' isn't vegan. 'Partially vegan' isn't vegan. 'A holiday in the diet of veganism' isn't vegan.\n\nActually, you're demonstrating VO's argument perfectly. You're stomping your foot complaining that Jessica Hullinger isn't \"really vegan\", when to any reader with half a brain can figure that out: she's *trying it out*, seeing what it is like to be a vegan, without outright adopting the lifestyle or philosophy. And in doing so, is doing a hell of a lot better advocacy than most of us, by helping other meat-eaters to see that *it's really not so hard*, by vicariously experiencing it with her.\n\nI work with a very left-wing non-profit social justice organization. Only one staff member of which is vegan. She has tried to get the others — all highly intelligent, educated, and passionate about the environment, oppression, marginalization, and other social justice issues people — to consider the issue of animal rights or even just reducing meat consumption for the sake of the environment, *but they just don't get it*. And these are the type of people who *can* be swayed by rational arguments about ethics, unlike your typical average person. Our culture is *steeped* in the assumption that animals are there to be used for our own purposes, and sometimes as long-term vegans it's easy to forget what it can be like to think that way, how deeply into our egos and worldview that goes. It's not an easy mindset to change, which is why positive exposure and incremental changes are often necessary. People won't change overnight, nor will society. And being hostile and critical, internally or externally, is *not* going to win people over.\n\n&gt;it's a matter of the definition of the term.\n\n\"[T]he word \"veganism\" denotes a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practical — all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.\" - [The Vegan Society](http://www.vegansociety.com/uploadedFiles/About_Us/Articles-of-Association-Nov-09.pdf) \n\nPracticality, not perfection.",

Do you actually think you can get all the vitamins and minerals you need in ONE smoothie? Why are you trying to get all of your (insert nutrient here) from ONE thing? No, its not realistic, or necessary, to get all of your zinc from pumpkin seeds or peas. If you eat plant foods for all of your meals, you will get all of the zinc you need, as well as every other nutrient.\n\nAlso, the government's RDA is not the be-all-end-all of vitamins and minerals. Personally I don't trust the government to tell me how to be healthy. Have you seen what they have deemed healthy for school lunches? \n\nI have researched nutrition for the last 5 years or so, and here is what I've learned: The healthiest diet is a highly varied whole foods plant-based diet, and it definitely provides all of the vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, antioxidants, and micronutrients that we need, with 2 exceptions: B12 (get a supplement or use nutritional yeast) and vitamin D (sunlight or a supplement).\n\nVariety is key. If you eat a wide variety of whole plant foods and eat until you're full, there is no need to count calories or macronutrients or log vitamins and minerals. There is really no need to count anything to be healthy. Dark leafy greens are nutritional powerhouses, but all plant foods are packed with nutrients. You will get everything you need from plants if you eat a wide variety.",

The non-food aspect of veganism is the most important, in my opinion.\n\nHumans are animals too, so I assume your love of animals extends to humans. Then would I be wrong in assuming you think exploiting humans is wrong? If all of this is true, why do you support capitalism a system that exploits the propertyless, forcing them into selling their labour so they don't starve to death (wage-slavery)?",

Add butter and process until a thick batter forms. Press into a 9- or 10-inch tart pan (I just used a pie pan). Bake the crust for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\n* Meanwhile, melt chocolate in a double boiler or microwave.\n\n* In a saucepan, heat milk over medium heat. It should be scalding hot but not boiling. \n\n* While milk is heating up, combine kudzu and water in a bowl or measuring cup until powder completely dissolves, creating your thickener.\n\n* Add melted chocolate to milk, and whisk to thoroughly combine. Whisk in thickener, and stir well. Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The chocolate mixture will slowly thicken. Pour mixture into the baked tart shell and chill for at least 2 hours or for as long as overnight.\n\n* Decorate by cutting out a stencil pattern and placing it over the tart. Dust some powdered sugar lightly over the top. Remove the stencil. Or top with fresh berries.",

I do, however, drink their chocolate soy milk every now and then and I enjoy it.\n\nI can't comment on their integrity, but from what I know about organic certification (my mom owns a spice company and gets her products certified), it's a joke process so I wouldn't rely on it too much. I wouldn't be surprised that the Simple Truth campaign is just a marketing scheme to get more revenue and that Kroger doesn't care too much about being natural/organic/preservative-free. But that's just me being jaded. Enjoy the fact that it's (most likely) preservative-free, at least.\n\nIt's also incredibly easy to make your own almond milk, you should look into it. Much cheaper, too.",

It is true that honeybees are not native to the U.S. - though the same can be said of lots of things, many of which are staples of vegan diets, like bananas and soy. Supporting the honey industry has a positive impact on the ecosystem, regardless of whether honeybees are native or not, they will still pollinate the plants that exist here (many of which are also not indigenous, surprise) - which include plants that produce food. Whereas buying non-local food has a negative impact on the environment, especially when it's GMO monocrops. \n\nNow, I personally do not buy honey because I don't like it. But if you're vegan because you want to improve the circumstances of the planet and life on it, honey isn't in conflict with that at all - whereas a lot of very \"vegan\" things are. It's a complex and multifaceted issue, and knowing where your food comes from is an essential piece of it - not just blindly cutting out all animal products without realizing the effect they have in context.",

It's addictive and so unhealthy- you will get by just fine without it! But you can take it slow and start eating it in smaller and smaller portions... then try to give it up entirely, then sample some vegan cheeses. I haven't tried a lot of vegan cheese, but I recommend Tofutti cream cheese and So Delicious shreds. I had the mozzarella shreds on a bbq jackfruit pizza last night and it was amazing!! I've never really liked Daiya though. But experiment with things over time and you will tooootally lose your taste for cheese and feel happier with what you're putting in your body :)",

Was the ad above in your local mall? Does this ad truly point a vinger at you or just show the reality of what we do to animals while we don't need to? Think about that for a moment, do we need to? Also, most, if not all vegans here where meat eaters before they transitioned, so in some form we where just like you. There is no shame in admitting we have participated in unnecessary negative actions that we can and should change.  The realisation that we have done unethical things might make us feel bad feelings but in the end this wil result in personal growth.\n\n&gt;It's like telling addicts that drugs are bad, lol. They know, they've just got different values of importance on things than you. They don't need your shame, they've got their own. \n\nThe issue here is not that one can't do to themselves what they want, but that they shouldn't do unto others what they don't want to be done to themselves, especially because they don't need to. You recognise that we don't need to eat meat right, let's be real, most vegans here live healthy lives, we ain't dying anytime soon. Also, animals are sentient, they don't want to die. If we don't need to eat them, and they don't want to die, why should we keep on doing a thing that has so many negative effects on them, the planet and ourselfs while we do it?\n\n&gt;You might do a lot better trying to actually meet the needs of those addicts and \"lure\" them to your side. Catching flies with honey rather than vinegar, and all.\n\nListen, we get it, we where in the same position as you where, most of us also didn't want to be confronted with the effects of our actions but as soon as we realised that this is NOT about us, but about the victims in this mess, we didn't have to feel these negative emotions anymore, we could just do something good with that realization.",

A lot of my family grew up on farms, so I know they don't understand not eating animal products, and I'm not trying to change their lifestyles, so I wish they wouldn't make odd comments about mine. I always write vegan before any of the meals I post on Instagram, because the one time I didn't I got the \"oh, you gave up not eating meat\" comment. It's annoying, but I have had a few friends buy vegan food to try because of me posting my meals, so that's a win! Gotta look at the positive.",

What animals cannot do, is consent. Cows do not have the same sexual awareness as humans or higher mammals. Here's the entirety of their sexuality; comes into oestrus, perceives male, copulates. They absolutely don't have the ability to consent and that is an entirely different statement from sentience. You could have just said that you thought artificial insemination was unnatural, but you chose the word 'rape' which is incredibly offensive to rape victims since you are likening a mildly invasive, non-stressful veterinary procedures to a traumatic event. Its disgusting and your views on veganism are biased as shit. I hope you're getting the argument you wanted.",

Nothing happens if you don't drink (actually, your body will thank you but this isn't a health thread).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently went out and sat in a loving company. I drank water the entire evening (not even soda) and nobody even questioned it. Nobody brought it up and we had a nice time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it all depends on if you're vegan out of convenience or heart in this matter. If you don't mind certain exploitation then you can ignore this and simply go for that drink without issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see the top comment here is one who doesn't care for certain animals and that's their own choice. But keep in mind that veganism is \"as far as possible and practicable\" and translates to \"If you don't need it, don't\". Nobody \"needs\" wine or alcohol in reality, it's a want. If that goes above your veganism then you can simply choose to ignore this and go have a good time but the fact that you made a thread indicates that you're either conflicted for real or simply want approval of other vegans to make the you feel better about your choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's just my take on it.",

The analogy is apt because we fight for animal rights to purely exist and be left the hell alone. \n\nWhen I am outside a dairy farm saving Male calves from a hammer in their head, it’s not because of some evil entity putting them there. It’s people consuming dairy like it’s the gods’ nectar that do. So, while vegetarians aren’t a threat to vegans, they are certainly a threat to animals.

"comment": "The source of the statistics is Gallup polls, but the article is from Mercy for Animals:\n\nhttps://mercyforanimals.org/blog/gallup-poll-americans-making-less-than-30k/\n\nI think the reason is that poorer people have a number of difficulties working against them, many like myself were poor because of health problems related to inadequate health care and dental as a child, along with neglect, etc. So as a young adult, even if I occasionally had access to health care, it was not the better health care. So I solved my health problems myself, by reading about health and experimenting with diet. Many people with money have gotten good medical and dental care their whole lives. They have confidence in mainstream medicine. They don't think for themselves as much with regards to diet.\n\nPoor people, if they eat animal products, it isn't the best quality of animal products, it isn't grass-fed steaks and organic milk. So there is more incentive to switch to lentils soups and bean tacos that eat gross hamburgers and chicken. It's easier to pass on fish sticks than lobster and caviar.\n\nPeople who have been nurtured in loving family are more likely to cling to traditional lifestyles and values, not always, but more likely. People who've been abandoned and neglected by absent fathers and substance abusing mothers  often have to struggle more, don't have to worry as much about offending the older generations by holding a vegan Thanksgiving and Christmas. \n\nMy father didn't concern himself much with my raising or well-being. Although he was well off, he was remarried and had a second family and I was always an outsider and an unwelcome stepchild in his home. So I saw him rarely. When I became a vegetarian when I was 21, he tried to talk me out of it, but he never cared about any of the conditions of my life, so I was used to looking out for myself and making my own decisions without his support or encouragement. Whereas someone who had loving parents helping them along towards success in many areas of life probably feels indebted to parents and imitates their lifestyle more.",

Instead of downvoting, if they gave information and resources that would be much more helpful and less discouraging. You aren’t being rude, or carelessly wanting to harm animals, you are obviously seeking out more info\n\ni have heard of feeding carnivorous pets vegan diets but taking your pets diet into your own hands is risky. but i would love to know more so i can actually feel confident in taking a step in that direction, for the animals! plus most kibble is not healthy to begin with for our furry friends",

Especially in our current cultural dietary practices, you're taking an already restrictive diet and making it harder by cutting out the carbs.\n\nIn fact I have a great idea, why don't you do a keto diet with him but do it vegan?\n\nYou guys have been together 8-years, I think it's important you find a way to work it out. People change overtime, it's very normal, ideals we hold to now are not guaranteed to be ones we hold in the future. \n\nWhat if you're no longer vegan a year or two from now?
