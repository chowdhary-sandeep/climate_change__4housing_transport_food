New models coming out every year and getting better.. more power... more range. Tesla is planning on outfitting its roadsters to 400+ mile ranges, Competition is starting to grow... with that will lead to better electric cars. Can you imagine in 5 years when a car can potentially go 300+ miles for 30k? And a Tesla can push 500 miles (or much more if Li-Air is hammered down) Who wants that crappy leaf or Spark ev that can only go 90 miles? Hell no one wants a 2011 leaf anymore (source: I work in the business) Imagine this thought in 5+ years. \n\n- Battery Pack: Last I read the replacement battery pack on a Model S was close to $40,000. Im sure my Spark's is nowhere near as expensive but I can guess at least 5 to 7k, And there is no concrete data on how long these packs last. \n\n- Full maintenance coverage and warranty (for reasons stated above) Obviously this is covered for the first 3 years if you buy new. \n\nIn conclusion while I had the cash in my bank to drop on any one of these EV's, its hard to stomach paying 28k for a Spark... or 32k for a Fiat or a Focus EV. They de-value immediately by 10k due to incentives, and the resale market is shot due to that. I only pay $187 for my Spark and Save over $400 in fuel costs alone. \n\nI fully plan to hand in my keys in 2.5 years when my lease is up (and still covered under warranty) and buy a Model III or Model S (if I can swing the cash)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.24570330487989375,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09360960981272608,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1545890664643699,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23459989551649463,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07673808456900133,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18702671302578114,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.304870272373134,"ev_1":-0.15461895643171025,"ev_2":-0.28973146219800083,"ev_3":-0.1816378652820701,"ev_4":-0.18243093302567104,"ev_5":-0.32788328872991696,"ev_6":-0.11246097551739147},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

(32 MPG or 1.9375 gallons per 100 kilometers)\n* The Most fuel efficient conventional car would be the 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage with 39 MPG (gasoline)\n* One Gallon gasoline produces 8.909 Kilogram CO2 \n* One Gallon diesel produces 10.151 Kilogramm CO2 \n* A 84 mile electric car produces one ton more CO2 at production / disposal than a comparable fossil fuel one.\n* It is assumed that the battery lands on a landfill. Recycling the Battery would decrease the amount of CO2 used to produce a 84 mile electric car.\n\n**Calculations**\n\n*How much CO2 does the Hyundai Ioniq safe per kilometer?*\n\nThe Most efficient non hybrid sedan produces 17.261 Kg CO2 per 100 Kilometer.\n\nThe most efficient convential car (Mitsubishi Mirage) produces  14.48 kg per 100 km.\n\nA 40 MPG car produces 13.920 Kg per 100 kilometers.\n\nThe Hyundai Ioniq produces 13.517 Kg CO2 per 100 km if the electricity comes completely from coal power plants.\n\nThese are 3.7434 Kg CO2 less per 100 kilometer than a Madzda 6 (32 MPG).\n\nThese are 0,963 Kg CO2 less per 100 kilometer than a Mitsubishi Mirage (39 MPG)\n\nThese are 0.403 Kg CO2 less per 100 kilometer than a 40 MPG car.\n\n*How much kilometer do you have to drive the Hyundai ioniq to produce overall the same amount of CO2?*\n\nThe Hyundai Ioniq has 125 miles of range. This means that the Hyundai ioniq produced 1.5 tons more CO2 at production than a comparable fossil fuel car.\n\n1,500 / 3.7434 * 100 = 40,070 kilometers.\n\n1,500 / 0,963 * 100 = 155,763 Kilometer\n\n1,500 / 0.403 * 100 = 372,208 kilometers.\n\n**Conclusions - You only have to read this section!**\n\nIf you drive an electric car, which gets the electricity exclusively from a coal power plant, for 40,070 kilometers (25,043 miles) than the electric car is as efficient as the most efficient non-HEV fossil fuel sedan. Then, the electric car is as efficient as a 32 MPG car.\n\nIf you drive an electric car, which gets the electricity exclusively from a coal power plant, for 155,763 kilometers (97,352 miles) than the electric car is as efficient as the most efficient conventional car (39 MPG)\n\nIf you drive an electric car, which gets the electricity exclusively from a coal power plant, for 372,208 kilometers (232,630 miles) than the electric car is as efficient as a 40 MPG car.\n\n**Notes** \n\n*Note that a 40 MPG car would be an HEV car which also needs additionally an electric motor and a 1-2 kWh Battery.*\n\n*Note that EPA changed their way to measure the MPG of cars. Your 40 MPG car from 2004 might nowadays only be a 35 MPG car due the changes in the test cycle.*\n\n*Note that your 40 MPG diesel Car would be in fact only a 34,28 MPG car since one gallon of diesel produces more CO2.*\n\n*Note that the CO2 cost of the production of gasoline and diesel was not accounted for.*\n\n*Note that there is Gasoline and Diesel available which is mixed with Ethanol which reduces the CO2 a little bit. In my calculation I used Gasoline and Diesel without the Ethanol mix.*\n\n*Note that the 820 CO2e gram/kWh is the Median coal plant. The worst efficiency measured was 910 CO2e/kWh and the best was 740 CO2e/kWh. The Study which came to this conclusion was conducted in 2014. It is reasonable to assume that less efficient coal plants closed down in the meantime and therefore the Median got better.*\n\n**Sources**\n\n* http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf (page 21) (One ton more CO2 - electric car)\n* http://www.fueleconomy.gov/\n* https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=38431 (Hyundai Ioniq efficiency and range)\n* http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=35982 (Mazda 6 efficiency)\nhttp://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=37291 (2017 Mitsubishi Mirage efficiency)\n* https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=307&amp;t=11 (CO2 per gallon)\n* https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&amp;t=3 (grid loss)\n* https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf (Coal plant 820 gram/kWh)\n* https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf  (Coal plant 820 gram/kWh)\n* http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf (Battery disposal. page 41)\n\n**Illustration**\n\nPound - Kilogram: http://www.stmary.ws/HighSchool/Physics/home/notes/dynamics/gravity/poundKg.jpg\n\nPound - Kilogram: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/fa/05/69/fa05696445207e6907f53dfdf55d2b0c.png","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007313345655954132,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09741327907806863,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20476232160489713,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18743865874906382,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2494989111894808,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2602480799310129,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.4806084904121235,"ev_1":-0.16597095783181515,"ev_2":-0.04273711970745353,"ev_3":-0.0945400606685962,"ev_4":-0.02080412679667158,"ev_5":-0.014427038142457604,"ev_6":-0.01335783770021474},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

What kind of argument is that.\n\nIt's an argument regarding scale. More demand = larger scale production. Selling Opel meant they didn't want to increase production. \n\n&gt;If announcing production ramps is complaining then you have a weird idea of complaining. I don't know of anywhere they are complaining about losing money on it.\n\nAt least be literate about the subject, be in the know, have a clue when arguing\n\nhttps://electrek.co/2016/11/30/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-loss-before-zev-credit/\n\n&gt;So in the same paragraph you criticize them for not making it higher performance and more expensive and then criticize them for not making it more compliance car and cheaper? \n\nI'm complaining? I'm pretty much telling it like it is, they did nothing to diversify and create demand for their products. It's like showing up to a fight and expecting to win because you showed up. You didn't train, you didn't prepare a strategy, you just showed up and then get all confused why you lost and start blaming society for your problems. It's somehow our fault the Bolt costs them more to make then the sticker price. Doubly our fault it's not more in demand than it currently is in the local market.\n\n&gt;They couldn't win here.\n\nThey didn't want to. It **is** a compliance car, look at the production numbers, improvements or diversification after launch. \n\n&gt; They put out a car that was cheaper than a Tesla and performed better than literally any other sub-$100k EV on the market and they did it on time and it's being criticized for being not as good as cars it's cheaper than and being more expensive than cars it's better than. \n\nIs the 40 kWh Nissan Leaf more expensive? What about the Kona EV, will it cost as much as the LR Model 3? \n\n&gt;I can't address your criticisms one by one because they're all just \"I don't like GM so I don't like the Bolt so I'm going to find fault with every part of it whether or not that stands up to how anyone else would be judged on this\". You are determined to hate it so much that you bring it into discussions about VW. Nothing I can say will change that.\n\nYou're talking about GM as if it was a helpless kitten instead of a massive car company selling ICE cars by the tens of millions. Bringing VW into the discussion is default given this very comment section is under an article about them. I brought GM into the discussion to prove that announcing and launching what appears to be a decent EV in the future doesn't mean what people think it means, as in people expect the transition to start. What it is actually is more compliance cars, just with the right specifications so we don't accuse them of being bad cars.\n\n&gt;Also I mentioned the Kona and I'll stick with it but I really wanted to say Niro because the Kona back seat is way too tight and there's no space (but I do like the Kona in theory, not complaining about performance/specs) and I'd suggest it to people. But even then, it's not even available and launching in exactly the same way as the Bolt (late 2018 launch in CA only, rollout in 2019). It's not a superior option right now because it literally does not exist to buy, and when it does exist it will be a slight improvement. I'm sure that if they sell 30k in the US in 2019 it will be rightly hailed as a success for Hyundai (noting you seem to have no criticism for the fact that they sold 432 ioniQ electrics in 2017). And if they sell 30k they should be congratulated. That's a number to be proud of for an EV right now. And if it outsells the Bolt then great. Get GM moving on the next vehicles.\n\nThis company is not like the other and I can find faults in the product as well, starting with the cheap interior and the small room in the back seats and again, no AWD standard or as an upgrade. Not least of all, it was announced in the same compliance car production scale of 20000 units per year. Every company has a story, GM and VW are a lot alike and right now there is no believable story that it's the companies that will pave the way to mainstream EVs. They want you to think that way, but what they make and sell says otherwise.\n\n&gt;Look, GM didn't market it well but they sold out their allotments and ramping production. I own one. It's fun as hell to drive, seats five comfortably, and I'm extremely happy with it. GM did a good job on this car as someone who would have never bought a GM car before. \n\nThis is the veil they pulled over the public's face, \"it's a fine EV\", \"it's ramping up\". Yes, in a 10 million ICE car per year company and in a world where EVs in that price range are getting increasingly better.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.049591302406042814,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26480801580548863,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2539902515918584,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13368364050984383,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24800821642080942,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21202407534308734,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.27286551833337097,"ev_1":-0.19940217511455785,"ev_2":-0.39392820458014055,"ev_3":-0.37969182800254014,"ev_4":-0.1862300787133237,"ev_5":-0.12042121464941481,"ev_6":-0.2765010135819544},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Personally I would love to have a little electric sports coupe or sedan as a daily vehicle once my truck is paid off.  But the fact is that we have to face some realities about the so called EV revolution and primary among them is how to provide charging for everyone.  I'm not saying that it can't be done, but we need to make sure we don't put the cart before the horse or in this case the car before the electricity.  There are a lot of places in the U.S. where people who own cars will not be able to just plug those cars into a charger when they get home for a variety of reasons.  This of course means that those people will have to spend time at a public charging location.  Perhaps we need to start considering charging locations that are more like a comfortable lounge and less like a gas station because electric cars do not go from near dead battery to 100% in 5 minutes.  With the current level of battery technology, anyone who does not have a home charger will likely never get their battery charged to 100% because they aren't going favor spending hours and hours at some public charger waiting on their battery to get fully charged.\n\nPeople who have a site built home with a garage will likely have no problem adopting an EV into their lifestyle but people who live in apartment buildings, apartment complexes and other densely populated areas where parking is at a premium will not be able to just plug their EV into their home charger.  I think we should also conduct some studies into just how plugging millions of EV's into the grid is going to affect the grid.  God knows California has enough problem keeping the lights on during fire season as it is.   I personally have no problem with EVs and I'm actually kind of excited to see them become more prolific.  I would prefer a good sedan or coup to the crossovers that the market is currently being given.  I understand that this is because there is more demand for SUV's but personally I have zero use for an SUV so I'm just waiting on a sedan.  And yes I know that Tesla sells sedans.  I have no interest in a Tesla.  They are too expensive, too unreliable and frankly the interiors are just God awful in my opinion.  \n\nFinally I think we have to address the issue of cost.  I have always said that EV's will take over the market when they can offer the buying public two things.\n\n1. Can you recharge your EV as quickly as you can gas up your gas powered car.\n2. Are they affordable to the majority of the public.\n\nUntil these two goals can be met, EV's will never be mainstream no matter how cool they are.  I hope we can get there.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00022116074251243845,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08140739657002476,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19997365363688005,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2522493405195937,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17197295439512214,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18269760786814235,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11748096533119678,"ev_1":-0.18751771109763382,"ev_2":-0.05824903007063161,"ev_3":-0.07921110733877867,"ev_4":-0.1060862373818594,"ev_5":-0.01177043949913544,"ev_6":-0.09100589042160816},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Even though 32miles is more than enough for me I'd be worried about resale value and environmentally it'd better just to get the EV.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.15127340052233693,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22327281281768255,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16682398411155985,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23526066740672122,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24581534518418063,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24154035765696674,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16012134023766242,"ev_1":-0.1519495303448969,"ev_2":-0.14596314302388128,"ev_3":-0.08792493872111663,"ev_4":-0.08442104796752876,"ev_5":-0.09986454578271757,"ev_6":-0.14404616026362244},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Duke Energy does net metering in Ohio, I think on a monthly basis.  The way I understand it is that Duke pays me for excess energy I produce at retail rates up to the amount I purchase from them that month.  Excess energy produced by me beyond that is paid at their generation costs, at a rate of .03 or .04 cents per Kwh.  So it seems it's not economical for me to size my system so large that I produce more than I use, unless I have battery storage.\n\n2013 was an above average year for me, my energy usage last year was 25,500 Kwh.\n\nI usually require at most a 7 year payback on any of the efficiency projects that I've done to the house.  I would like a 7 year payback on a solar system but am willing to stretch that a little.  I have ideas/fantasies about self installation, or at least partial self install to help mitigate the costs.  I'm wondering if this will ruin my chances of getting the federal tax rebate.  I don't think there are any other state or utility incentives left in Ohio.\n\n- If I decide that it's impractical to install myself, Would it be a good idea to purchase equipment myself and hire a firm to install?  I see panels on Wholesale Solar dot com for pretty cheap, less than $1.00 per watt.  Anything to be wary of there?  I'm guessing yes.\n\n- I'll need to hire an architect for my kitchen extension.  The roof of the extension will extend 14' beyond the extension to cover a 2nd story deck.  I'll need them to calculate structural and wind loads for panels on that roof.  Should I have a solar installation company involved in that process?  I'm guessing yes.\n\n- Should I go with microinverters, or centralized.  Gird tied, or grid+charger for future batteries?\n\n- How close can I come to an off-grid solution and can I phase in an off-grid solution?  \n\n- I am very interested in battery storage as a phase 2 plan, what can I do in phase 1 to facilitate that.  \n\n- My next vehicle will most likely be electric, is there anything I can do in phase 1 and phase 2 to prepare for EV charging.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.061292580949763455,"1.1.1_stance":-0.299034283949985,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.40909369815633245,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2781227999776771,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3861319352770604,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.31656186040125844,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06342189901624806,"solar_1":-0.08632191774039649,"solar_2":-0.23908396584106034,"solar_3":-0.20345002592911215,"solar_4":-0.16240538815244038,"solar_5":-0.04460226032089546,"solar_6":-0.04023102785941754,"solar_7":-0.022541334455410993,"solar_8":-0.04364793354654001,"solar_9":-0.17829185056336172,"solar_10":-0.35514825072345935},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

If you produce 1000kW on the meter, you will get paid the figure of 13.88p/kW for the 1000kW and then because the electricity company your FiT is registered with (usually your supplier in most cases) don't monitor how much you export, they say that you are away from the property for 50% of the time so you get the 4.77p/kW for 500kW in addition to the 13.88p/kW. \n\nThis is why it is important to use as much energy as you possibly can when you are generating as you get paid for all of it - whether you use it or not!!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002570325198272864,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1784939916772541,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.06873789706964532,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09497491374176738,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19277701905583158,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1987909812657518,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.007464371311167876,"solar_1":-0.1553788089619733,"solar_2":-0.027502872272937868,"solar_3":-0.0005247194773498146,"solar_4":-0.19025843217428992,"solar_5":-0.00045314759578711045,"solar_6":-0.0006466573443807041,"solar_7":-0.0023038464617760233,"solar_8":-0.0010969240975100547,"solar_9":-0.14029509832511233,"solar_10":-0.22574764490127563},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

I'm not interested in getting sidetracked with discussions about efficiencies at different latitudes, thermal dynamics, etc at this point. I really want to get a handle on the basics of terminology first. Everything else is just technical implementation issues.\n\nI think I realized my first mistake after parsing through your comment a couple of times. I said \"1 kilowatt\" thinking that meant 1kW over the course of an hour. Really \"1 kilowatt\" means 1000 joules per second! So when we're talking about solar, is the parlance to refer to \"watts per hour\"? How do we also notate joules per second per land area?\n\nSo if we actually had a 1kW system, then that would be 1kW * 60 = 6000 joules/minute, and then 36000 joules/hour, and finally we would call it a \"36kWh\" system, or \"36 kilowatt hour\". Is that right?\n\nI hit up wikipedia again and I think I understand where your value of 1kW/m^2 comes from, about 1050 W/m^2 actually hits the ground when the sun is directly overhead.\n\nAfter some quick googling, a company called SunPower supposedly has the commercial panels with highest efficiency at about 24.1%. So for the sake of my understanding, lets call it 24% and about 240W/m^2 can be converted to electricity.\n\nThis would give us a max of about 240W * 3600 seconds = 864000W/h, or 864kWh/m^2. Wait, that seems really wrong. Is it? That seems like a lot of power.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.05297632186072102,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22567277653751358,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.240937351547436,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2724646653571199,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3509862727140137,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2471517150575849,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26589466604371087,"solar_1":-0.11457571212731534,"solar_2":-0.14718300741589832,"solar_3":-0.07491283180378458,"solar_4":-0.027530645405162806,"solar_5":-0.028200901209499665,"solar_6":-0.08796297211384409,"solar_7":-0.022391532640232487,"solar_8":-0.03921740062022981,"solar_9":-0.0073069333636723854,"solar_10":-0.25755017048169276},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

In this case g/W would be effectively lowered because a preexisting material is replaced and the surface area is limited only to the size of the gliders wings.

Typical turn around is at least 2 weeks. Of course it has to go back to the engineer; who has to redesign the strings and wiring; let's say a week; then to AHJ 2 weeks; then it has to get rescheduled for installation could be a few weeks depending on how booked out they are. I'd say 30-60 days is reasonable. \n\nI recommend this all the time. The SolarEdge design tool is very intuitive and free.\nhttp://sitedesigner.solaredge.com/\nYou just have to signup and be sure to UNCHECK one of the boxes. With this you can get estimates for what you'd save. \n\nYou can also get the modeling production from http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/\n\nHonestly if you wait 30-60 days you could get an 10000HD inverter which could be a good gain too. \n\nKeep in mind each array needs 8 panels. The max number of panels per string depends on your inverter but it might be 15 panels or could be 18 if they're specing you 2 HD inverters. Max watts per string is 6000, 5700, or 5250. Actually do they have 2 inverters spec'd 20 front and 18 back makes no sense to me? Unless you have 2 inverters and they are running 4 strings. You could very nicely run 2 SE5000HD inverters. I think the HD inverters are much better then the older version.  \n\nSolarEdge Inverters max per string.\nhttps://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/se-P5-series-add-on-power-optimizer-datasheet-na.pdf\n\nYou can run a strings with panels in different direction but it can impact your production. With an East West roof the best production can be modeled from 8 east and 8 west in a string but typically all are facing the same direction. \n\nIf you have a copy of the plans it is easy to find the info you need. You want the tilt and azimuth of each array.  \n\nYou cost numbers don't seem to make sense? Do you have a State or Local tax credit? Most people talk price of installation; roof work and tree cutting work is outside that. \n\nJust to check you know the Solar Tax Credit is a credit not a rebate.

The boilers of modern power station are 96% efficient and the exhaust heat is captured by the economisers and reheaters that heat the air and water before entering the boilers.\n\nThe very slight amount exiting the stack is moist as in condensation and CO2. There is virtually no fly ash because this is removed by the precipitators or bagging plant that are 99.98% efficient. The 4% lost is heat through boiler wall convection.\n\nCoal-fired Power Stations are highly efficient with very little heat loss and can generate a massive amount of energy for our needs. They can generate power at efficiency of less than 10,000 b.t.u. per kilowatt and cost-wise that is very low.\n\nThe percentage cost of mining and freight is very low. The total cost of fuel is 8% of total generation cost and does NOT constitute a major production cost.\n\nAs for being laughed out of the country, China is building multitudes of coal-fired power stations because they are the most efficient for bulk power generation.\n\nWe have, like, the USA , coal-fired power stations because we HAVE the raw materials and are VERY fortunate to have them. Believe me no one is laughing at Australia – exactly the reverse, they are very envious of our raw materials and independence. The major percentage of power in Europe and U.K. is nuclear because they don't have the coal supply for the future.\n\nYes it would be very nice to have clean, quiet, cheap energy in bulk supply. Everyone agrees that it would be ideal. You don't have to be a genius to work that out. But there is only one problem---It doesn't exist.\n\nYes - there are wind and solar generators being built all over the world but they only add a small amount to the overall power demand.\n\nThe maximum size wind generator is 3 Megawatts, which can rarely be attained on a continuous basis because it requires substantial forces of wind. And for the same reason only generate when there is sufficient wind to drive them. This of course depends where they are located but usually they only run for 45% -65% of the time, mostly well below maximum capacity. They cannot be relied on for a 'base load ‘because they are too variable. And they certainly could not be used for load control.\n\nThe peak load demand for electricity in Australia is approximately 50,000 Megawatts and only small part of this comes from the Snowy Hydro Electric System (the ultimate power Generation) because it is only available when water is there from snow melt or rain. And yes, they can pump it back but it costs to do that (Long Story).\n\nTasmania is very fortunate in that they have mostly hydro-electric generation because of their high amounts of snow and rainfall. They also have wind generators (located in the roaring forties) but that is only a small amount of total power generated.\n\nBased on an average generating output of 1.5 megawatts (of unreliable power) you would require over 33,300 wind generators.\n\nAs for solar power generation much research has been done over the decades and there are two types.\n\nSolar thermal generation and Solar Electric generation but in each case they cannot generate large amounts of electricity.\n\nAny clean, cheap energy is obviously welcomed but they would NEVER have the capability of replacing Thermal Power Generation. So get your heads out of the clouds, do some basic mathematics and look at the facts, - not going off with the fairies (or some would say the extreme Greenies).\n\nWe are all Greenies in one form or another and care very much about our planet. The difference is most of us are realistic. Not in some idyllic Utopia where everything can be made perfect by standing around holding a banner and being a general pain in the backside.\n\nHere are some facts that will show how ridiculous this financial madness is that the government is following. Do the simple maths and see for yourselves.\n\nAccording to the 'believers' the CO2 in air has risen from .034% to .038% in air over the last 50 years.\n\nTo put the percentage of Carbon Dioxide in air in a clearer perspective:\n\nIf you had a room 3.7  x  3.7  x  2.1 metres the area carbon dioxide would occupy in that room would be .25 x .25 x .17m or the size of a large packet of cereal.\n\nAustralia emits 1% of the world's total carbon Dioxide and the government wants to reduce this by 20%t or reduce emissions by 0.2 % of the world's total CO2 emissions.\n\nWhat effect will this have on existing CO2 levels?\n\nBy their own figures they state the CO2 in air has risen from .034% to .038% in 50 years.\n\nAssuming this is correct, the world CO2 has increased in 50 years by...004%.\n\nPer year that is .004 divided by 50 = .00008%.  (Getting confusing - but stay with me).\n\nOf that because we only contribute 1% our emissions would cause CO2 to rise .00008 divided by 100 = .0000008 %.\n\nOf that 1%, we supposedly emit, the governments wants to reduce it by 20% which is 1/5th of .0000008 =...00000016% effect per year they would have on the world CO2 emissions based on their own figures.\n\nThat would equate to an area in the same room, as the size of a small pin.\n\nFor that they have gone crazy with the ridiculous trading schemes, Solar and Roofing Installations, Clean Coal Technology Renewable Energy, etc, etc.\n\nHow ridiculous it that?\n\nThe cost to the general public and industry will be enormous. Cripple and even closing some smaller businesses.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.033002130687236786,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24099435665280927,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.010388109056899944,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.01289060350973159,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3183547187767317,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1640090307172246,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09703762843897024,"solar_1":-0.15065873364866975,"solar_2":-0.15059110621431812,"solar_3":-0.017907013118626008,"solar_4":-0.01893518730867072,"solar_5":-0.012759939410898369,"solar_6":-0.004625217202071023,"solar_7":-0.006322730379906716,"solar_8":-0.006638018373754069,"solar_9":-0.12920545771038516,"solar_10":-0.0973421423259424},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I knew this would happen eventually as the roof was aging, but as a resident I couldn’t force the HOA to replace the roof before I installed my panels; they do it on their own timetable. The issue for me is that my solar installer had since gone out of business (Real Goods Solar) so I had to find another company to remove the panels and then reinstall them after the roof was reshingled. Had a tough time as none of the larger companies wanted to do it unless they had installed the system.  Eventually found a smaller mom and pop solar firm that was willing to do it and gave me a fair price.\n\nStill, even with the cost of removing and reinstalling the panels, I’m further ahead than had I not installed the panels.

A period of clouds over your house may significantly reduce the power available.\n\nSolar power production usually follows a bell curve with greater production during the middle of the day.  The value of the battery is that it can provide a more consistent experience because it duplicates the two functions that the grid provides  - it provides electricity when your consumption exceeds your generation but, often overlooked, it also provides a place of excess generation to go.

When I have seen net metering laws be changed, people were grandfathered in for 20 years.  Could you show me an example where legislators suddenly reversed net metering and didn't grandfather their voter base in?\n\nWith net metering, it is absolutely worth going solar if the numbers work you.  I used to run the calculations all of the time.  You can estimate with pretty good accuracy what electricity the panels will produce and then subtract from the electric cost.  Many of the estimates I did were based on 3% loans which immediately reduced their average month expenses.  A $235 average bill would turn to $185 (with grid connect fee included).  If the electricity cost spiked per kWh, they would still only pay $185 a month instead of $250.  The decreases of panel efficiency were minor at 20 years, but if you look at 20 years of historical costs in electricity, it doubles or triples in the same time.  The bulk of savings comes from not having to worry about rising electric costs.  People really will almost certainly save tens of thousands of dollars over the lifetime of their system.  It isn't just a \"new garage door\".  It's a kid's college fund or a new car.\n\nDoes this mean there is no risk?  Of course not. If you invest in stocks there is a risk.  Any investment you make has risks.  Even a CD carries the risk that you will lose value due to inflation being higher than your rate of return.  Staying with paying increasing electric costs to the electric company runs the risk that you will pay a lot more money for only the benefit of \"keeping things simple\".  Everything has pros and cons.

Which makes the APR usury when you allocate the difference between actual COGS and finance price. \n\nAdditionally, the payment is most likely not the payment. The first 18-36 months depending on the program are a teaser that most likely adjusts north of 60-100 / month if you do not pay forward your tax incentive to the lender.\n\nAlso, a cash price 6kW, even in the Bay Area above $4.00 is pretty high if you’re not getting premium panels, any storage, main panel upgrades, or your home has some unknown historic or logistical challenges.\n\nAll of this is very common knowledge that would have been transparent and given to you if you had been contacted by a smaller, local, vertically integrated solar installer that does not subcontract their sales team to thousands of unlicensed sellers.\n\nGoogle Solar Installer in “city”\nBefore you get another quote ask them for or look up their license number. \n\nLook up their company by name on the CSLB website and see how many sales people they have registered under them. All sales people must be registered to that company to sell their products, even through zoom.\n\nMost of the local businesses are going to have 10-50 sales people registered. \n\nThe ones that use subcontractors are going to have upwards of a thousand. The result is that as a homeowner you may call 3-5 different companies expecting to shop around get various equipment options or a level of comfort to proceed with this home improvement to actually spending time with 3-5 different subcontracted sales organizations that mask their identity as a contractor to simply wind up choosing the sales rep with the best pitch or price only to end up getting the same installation from the original seller. \n\nIt’s a shell game and very hard for homeowners to shop for solar home improvements.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06387970596548105,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3589030910438305,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.13077512443777034,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2225619355837504,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34957831099321385,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.03049503577252229,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01572335822856985,"solar_1":-0.25829373474798983,"solar_2":-0.04840614884172586,"solar_3":-0.10156912872984124,"solar_4":-0.2047437467028385,"solar_5":-0.0038691906859943024,"solar_6":-0.17797214287374108,"solar_7":-0.03397016212935947,"solar_8":-0.053118438832677035,"solar_9":-0.06659350794893015,"solar_10":-0.18746611186324805},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (the author is against specific instances of solar installation practices, but overall supports the concept of solar)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

As you said, implicit condemnation, and feeling morally inferior to others, make us feel very uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, I think that many are worried that if they give the vegan position serious consideration, they will find that it has some merit. If that happens, they will be forced either to give up animal products, or to feel perpetually guilty. Not an attractive proposition. I think this is one of the reasons omnivores are heavily invested in *not* giving veganism fair consideration.\n\nI'm speaking generally here, and I don't think all of this applies to everyone.

When you visit someone's house and see they have a bag of Iams, do you call them an asshole? Is what I am doing categorically different from that just because the food I feed my pets isn't sprayed with chicken by-product meal?\n\nI would also point out that this is comparing meat to cereal based foods, not treats. It does not make the case that there are no non-meat treats that dogs would enjoy as much as meat.\n\n&gt; Your argument that they don't know any better so they enjoy what you give them is a very slippery slope. Some dogs don't know a life beyond being tied to a post their whole life, but it's still wrong for obvious reasons.\n\nLet's give your argument the benefit of the doubt though. Let's say dogs can only enjoy anything that's not meat 50% as much as they would enjoy meat. I feed my dogs twice a day, and they take about 90 seconds to consume their food. That's 3 minutes per day of eating, but let's exaggerate a bit and say they spend 10 minutes eating.\n\nThey spend 0.69% of their life eating. I would say the remaining 99.31% makes a much more significant difference to their quality of life. A comparison to tying a dog up to a post all the time is, to be quite frank, rather ridiculous.\n\n&gt; I realize I might as well be talking to a brick wall here, because no argument will penetrate your thick wall of vegan ideology. \n\nAh yes, the old \"declare victory in the debate because my opponent is too thick to understand\" trick. Doesn't exactly earn respect.\n\n&gt; Don't own dogs if you make them adhere to a weird diet that mimics your own.\n\nYou're calling me out because I don't choose to completely optimize my dogs' happiness for an activity that they spend less than 1% of their time engaged in. I don't let them rip up the garbage (even though they would love it) to save myself the work of having to clean it, but this is fine.

It's so hilarious how each point applies to veganism and most don't work at all for trees but yet that's what he's primarily arguing. You've gotta read this. np.reddit.com/r/accountt1234/comments/4dgubi/civilization_is_like_auschwitz/\n\nSomehow this guy gets positive comments and karma but we're seen as the crazy one's for making even casual comparisons to the atrocities people commit against each other. I'm really trying to figure out how he so casually gets away with these nazi comparisons. I can barely get people to accept a comparison to kicking an animal being comparable to paying other people to mistreat them.\n\n&gt; The first step in any conspiracy is to alienate ourselves from those who are to be its victims. This is needed to psychologically divorce ourselves from them. There are different ways to go about this. Symbols can be used. A yellow star typically works just fine. In the case of trees, we hammer nails into them and assign them a number, so that we cease to see them as unique living organisms.\n\n&gt; I've noticed that it's very hard to get policymakers to actually visit nature reserves whose destruction they plan on approving, so that we can show them what is at risk of being lost. How different is this from those Nazi's, who would throw up upon visiting the concentration camps? To inflict cruelty on a massive scale, we always have to psychologically divorce ourselves from the cruelty we inflict.\n\n&gt; The intuitive discomfort we feel over our actions is removed by appealing to a higher cause. Himmler always carried the Bhagavad Gita with him. Similarly, every tree we remove can be justified through the pursuit of \"economic growth\".\n\n&gt; Any nation where people have genuinely become persuaded of environmental ideas will face de facto genocide. It happened to the Native Americans, who did not want to render their whole environment subject to the laws of the economy.\n\n&gt; If everyone can point to someone else, nobody can ever be held fully responsible for an atrocity.\n\n&gt; Top Nazi's were given paintings from Jewish art dealers. Regular people were given homes of people shipped to concentration camps. Academics saw new positions open up in universities. Companies received cheap slave labor. Similarly, we always ensure that the spoils of exploitation of the natural world are distributed among as many people as possible, though not equally of course. Perhaps every citizen receives fossil fuel dividends. In most cases however, the main spoil is the creation of the fetishized \"job\"","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.31924955693601886,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23587204082741378,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18378218901247437,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22261178669007953,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14840906641291374,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.33818442476164734,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1853796958409172,"diet_1":-0.06833067216757627,"diet_2":-0.2545118816782501,"diet_3":-0.18527055078355273,"diet_4":-0.0770711449731607,"diet_5":-0.030318381483084522,"diet_6":-0.08895912753238615,"diet_8":-0.019267481970018707,"diet_9":-0.03944498093915172,"diet_10":-0.16672618875357634,"diet_11":-0.34113371147638344,"diet_13":-0.1087406665707628,"diet_14":-0.33535809253226034,"diet_17":-0.09130028416550431},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
