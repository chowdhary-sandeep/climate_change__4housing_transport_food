"comment": "Just FYI as someone in the industry: Leasing companies are known to use assessors hired by them to assess the \"true\" value of the system. There is an understanding that energy prices in 20 years will be much higher than at the moment and most customers have a vested interest in the system (and removing the system can cause issues in the home)\n\nPurchase the system, always. Unless you cant use the tax credit it is always better to purchase than to lease. \n\nOne thing that aggravates me about third party ownership is that the financing companies are getting the great majority of the benefit designed to go to the customer. They will say their systems are worth more upfront to get depreciation and tax credits, which are tax dollars from you and me. They will pass these tax savings to their partners, mainly giant banks and super billionaires. \n\nIts a corrupt game, IMO. The production guarantees are there to entice you into the lease, but most systems will be fine without any issues if properly maintained and monitored. Solar is now cheap enough that the lease/PPA model is not attractive anymore like it was 5 years ago selling solar at $6.00/W and the tax credit capped at 2K....\n\nTo expand after checking your spreadsheet:\n\n1. Those are all big companies, most of them will have a high price for \"purchase\" to guide you into the \"much cheaper\" lease option.\n2. Get quotes from smaller companies with good records. They will sell the system turn key at a much better price\n3. SolarEdge is the new product you want to use for inverter/optimizing. Gives you the information from the microinverter at a fraction of the cost. \n4. Cost in our area is around 3.25/W purchase. Worth shopping to local guys and comparing their figures.",

They already have power inverters, electric motors, high voltage wiring, a high-voltage battery, etc.  The just need to take out the gas engine and put in a larger battery.  I just can't understand their resistance to EVs.  Maybe the issue is that they don't have a lot of IP (patents) in the area and don't want to license technology from other companies.",

"comment": "Not sure how well it would transfer to EVs, but there are several inverter options for hybrids. http://shop.priuschat.com/converdant-toyota-prius-plug-out-generator-inverter/ Easiest way is to use a 12v inverter and let the car keep the 12v battery charged, though you're limited to about 1kw depending on the DC-DC converter (would work with an EV).  Not enough to power a house, but you could at least keep a fridge going.  Then there's the inverters that hook directly into the HV battery.  They can provide a lot more power, but they're more expensive and difficult to install.  Probably can't use the same ones in an EV.",

"comment": "The total number of parts is kind of meaningless when comparing an EV to a ICE. Some errors will be do you count the battery as 1 part or do you count each individual cell, connection, and screw?\n\nOther than that, the number is pretty meaningless unless you are the manufacturer of the car. To be honest, I'd think they'd be pretty much the same. Most parts are for things not related to the engine or transmission.\n\nAs far as EVs, people tend to look at moving parts as their distinct advantage. You take out the engine, transmission, and fuel tank and replace that with a motor, 1 speed gearbox, and batteries. Everything else is more or less the same.\n\nThe idea is that the motor, 1 speed gearbox, and batteries are much simpler than the ICE drivetrain. Since it is simpler, it should be cheaper and more reliable. \n\nIn the real world, that hasn't happened. EVs are at best more expensive and just as reliable as their ICE cousins. The leading idea (which I subscribe too) is that ICE cars are so well engineered and manufactured that they rarely break down. EVs will need around (another) 10 years to catch up in engineering and manufacturing to be able to beat an ICE car given the simpler drivetrain.",

"comment": "If you haven't seen this yet, then I recommend reading through here: https://energy.gov/eere/vehicles/workplace-charging-install-and-manage-pev-charging\n\nIt is a pretty comprehensive list of resources about workplace charging. Not directly applicable, but a lot of the same considerations apply.\n\n----\n\nCan you give us more details on what sort of location these spots will be at and what the usecase is? It is hard to give specific advice with no details.\n\nFor general advice (this all assumes USA specific, things are slightly different in other markets):\n\nThere are two separate charger types that you can install for public use, level 2 and level 3. level 2 chargers are basically standardized. They use the J1772 plug which all cars have*, and can charge at a rate of roughly 25 miles/hour, depending on the car. Level 3 chargers are not standardized, and the charging stations are much more expensive and require better electrical wiring as well. Level 3 plugs are (for your purposes) CHAdeMO and CCS. You can buy stations that have both plug types, but it does limit what station options you can choose. Tesla vehicles can charge at CHAdeMO with a ~$500 adapter. Level 3's charge is hard to give a specific number on (as the charge rates can vary quite a bit on the car), but for ~100 miles of range, it takes 30 minutes.\n\n*Tesla is not compatible with J1772 directly, but every Tesla comes with a dongle that converts J1772 to Tesla.\n\nTypically, level 3 chargers would typically be used if you want to attract tourists as they will be what long range drivers will be looking for when planning a trip. Level 2 chargers are more of a locals only type of thing so that people can charge their cars while out running errands etc. as level 2 chargers are too slow to charge for long road trips (imagine having to stop after 1.5-2 hours of driving to then charge for 3-4 hours).",

"comment": "This is sort of too bad, but not surprising for two reasons:\n\n1. The bill was stripped of its funding source at some point in the process (by the lower chamber?) so the cost became unpalatable. \n2. The current rebate still goes almost exclusively to the Bay Area so there is resistance to expanding it without doing something to spread the money better.  The sponsor for the original bill is also a Bay Area assemblyman.  \n\nOpponents called this the \"Tesla rebate\" because it comes Tesla runs out of federal credits and simultaneously wants to ramp up the Model 3.  TBH that's a fair criticism since a 10k rebate from the state seems like it could be excessive for the Leaf or other cheaper EVs if the federal tax credit isn't eliminated completely.",

My only advice is jump in feet first and build something before the tax credits aren't avail, and you'll be happy to be making power.  It does suck price-wise as you go up in panel density.\n\nThat said, I'll say I had one unpleasant surprise...in my first 5kw system...I think I was at like 300W panels...so I built my second array with out looking at the frame/structure plans from the provider (I built the second 5kW frame the same length as the first one)...then at sorta the last minute I opted to order 325W panels (for the same reason as you)...same brand even as my 300's.  So when the 325's came, I had assumed they were more dense and the same length/width...but OOOPS!  I didn't realize the 325's were actually about 7\" longer than the 300's (again, both were the same brand).  I felt dumb, but was able to easily fix it all with a short extension to my framing.\n\nPoint is...some of the higher watt panels are jactually just longer, and not 'denser'...which I should have paid more attention to, as the drawings I was provided by my vendor clearly showed that...so shame on me!\n\nI got lucky in being able to add an extension.\n\nI hope you get to build something soon...I'll say it's been super satisfying walking outside and basically feeling like on a sunny day that money is just falling from the sky!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

"comment": "I feel with you, but I think we’ll be seeing a lot more crossover styled vehicles in the EV world. The batteries in the floor pan easily eat up 20-30 cm of height, and trying to make something that looks like a modern ICE wagon is likely to result in a compromised back seat. The front is okay because you get to stretch the feet, but the rear often ends up with a low bench and/or a low roof compared to the sitting height. \n\nTesla has gotten around this with the model 3 by putting your head under the glass, but I wouldn’t want to be a tall person sitting there in a roll or any other major accident. \n\nThe compromise is often to build something that looks more like an SUV or crossover. In addition it is, alas, by far the most popular segment world wide. The upside is that for once the design doesn’t compromise the handling since the battery pack lowers the center of gravity considerably. \n\nWhen Autogefühl drove the Audi e-tron Quattro the comment was that it felt a lot like driving an Audi A6 Allroad. That doesn’t sound too bad all things considered. If it was lower it might even be comparable to a regular A6, which would make me very happy despite the obvious SUV styling.",

At the time, there were virtually no public charging stations and the only other mass market EV on sale was the Leaf.\n\nPeople definitely paid a hefty early adopter price for the first gen Volts. Anyone who leased was probably way better off. I bought mine used last May with 45k miles for $10k. It's a great daily driver for that price.\n\nIf I had enough disposable income to buy a brand new car, I wouldn't have trouble paying the going price for a 2019 Volt (I believe you can get them for mid to high $20s depending on trim/options and assuming the full rebate which I think ends today). It's still a great car, and is what I would choose again because none of the EVs on sale today charge fast enough for how I tend to roadtrip.",

That the test porsche commissioned also got it wrong?\n\nWhich is more efficient depends on the attributes of the car, and EVs absolutely can be more efficient at highway than city, as many tests of the taycan have found.\n\nA heavier, larger tire, aerodynamic and smaller cross sectional car will do better at highway speeds than city all things being equal.\n\nA lighter, thinner/low rolling resistance, larger and less aerodynamic car will do better at city than highway all things being equal.\n\nhttps://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=41054\n\nIs a good example of the latter, city range is 21.5% higher than highway. Super lightweight, narrow tires, and a big cross sectional area to make rolling drag less significant than aero.\n\nhttps://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=41393\n\nIs a good example of a heavy car that will be impacted by aero less because its rolling resistance is so high (likely twice as high as the i3, but similar aero drag). Virtually 0 difference between city and highway.\n\nOf course in the real world the impacts are even greater, because even the highway epa test cycle has plenty of accelerations and slowing down vs a fixed speed.\n\nThe less stop and go a test is the more the taycan will benefit vs lighter EVs.",

But when you have panels around the entire car misaligned, interior components not attached properly or chintzily attached with cheapish materials, paint issues, glass issues, hatch issues, etc... all on one car, then clearly the assembly line has issues along with a complete lack of QC  at the end of the line.  That of course adds a burden to the customer in having to potentially make multiple trips to the service department that could be an hour or more away.\n\nIt's a question of frequency of quality issues at the price point.  Then on top of that, some people reported taking their cars in to fix misalignments, only to have Tesla claiming the alignment was within spec... even though it clearly wasn't aligned.\n\nIf you go into a dealership and see an issue, you can often have them fix it before taking possession, or even talk them down on price or have them throw in free stuff for the inconvenience.\n\nRange Rover isn't exactly known for their initial quality either though, lol.  That Ford is a bit kooky; surprised they missed that one!",

Like drive to the dealership today if not before the end of August (since budget reconciliation revising and signing could take a while) and get a sales agreement in place.  I'm suddenly dramatically rethinking my timing on buying an EV thanks to this new tax credit plan.  I was really liking the Ioniq 5 / EV6 pair but wasn't totally sure I wanted one before more details about the Blazer / Equinox EVs came out.  Now there's a greatly increased sense of urgency to the decision.",

"comment": "Well first, take a look at this article that shows where the highest percentages of AWD sales are (wow it’s the majority in several states across the Midwest and Northeast…it’s almost like I wasn’t making things up!)\n\nhttps://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15366192/differential-distribution-where-rwd-awd-and-fwd-vehicles-are-sold-in-the-u-s-infographic/\n\nThen take a moment to consider how much used AWD Model 3 costs brand new *today*.  It’s about $56k.  Assume a modest 46% depreciation in 200,000 miles and 5 years to arrive at price of $30k.  Then remember that we compared this to the electric civic with its less than stellar specs that we both agreed it would be slower, &lt;300 miles range, and not AWD.  If this car can be $24k *brand new* in 2027, I would be pretty impressed with that.\n\nSo to answer your question, I’m living in the hypothetical world created by things we both agreed on in 2027 when there are 5-10 million teslas coming out per year, driving 40%+ depreciation for 5 year old models with 200,000 miles on them and Honda somehow has come out with a Civic EV that has specs similar to today’s bolt for $10k off the price.",

Lots of comments have done the math already, but anecdotally; I went from an old Chevy Equinox which was getting maybe 15ish mpg to a Chevy Bolt and noticed a HUGE difference. I have a relatively long commute for work, and was spending anywhere from $30-$60 a week in gas. I charge at home now and have seen my electric bill go up maybe around $40/month max. So personally I've saved a shitload of money on gas in the few years since I've bought it.

It doesn't need to turn on an engine for decent acceleration times like your PHEV would.\n\n>An EREV style PHEV is slow compared to both fully electric cars and parallel style PHEVs,\n\nEREVs have similar electric mode performance to BEVs because (as I've said above) they're essentially BEVs with an onboard generator.\n\n>The advantage of EREVs is efficiency,\n\nEfficiency is a downside of EREVs, the direct connection to the wheels in a PHEV benefits efficiency as you have reduced losses.

I originally told him to buy the panel, but since he doesn't have the capital currently I mentioned considering a lease as an alternative and now I've gotten several rude responses and PMs which I don't feel like I deserve.\n\nIs owning a system better in the long run? Usually yes.\n\nBut it becomes less clear if you are taking out a loan to pay for solar. are you going to stay in the same house for 25+ years to see the benefit? Owning doesn't pay back for like 10 years or so... Do you owe taxes typically or get a refund? Do you want the extra liability of owning the system? Can you sell back to the grid? How many incentives, rebates, and tax credits do you qualify for? What is your cost of electricity? *CAN YOU AFFORD TO BUY THE FUCKING SOLAR PANELS IN THE FIRST PLACE?*\n\nLessing still saves money compared to paying utilities, but owning can save maybe 50% more in the long run. \n\nIt's like leasing a car. It's usually better to buy, but some people still prefer to lease for whatever reason. \n\nY'all are a little too paranoid...",

With Sunpower you'd probably get 20% more power out of a roof your size. That said, it would also cost you a lot more and make your ROI longer. Also, Sunpower is not compatible with Enphase microinverters, so you'd make up some savings by going with a string inverter instead. Sunpower also leases systems and has their own set of installers/subcontractors (in that sense they are like Solar City). But you can purchase a system through an affiliated dealer. I can't say for sure, but in your situation Sunpower may not be worth it. I'd look into getting a quote from a dealer that installs Sunpower though.\n\n$/w = total price / DC system rating",

"comment": "well except that the solar PV system will last longer than 7 years.   \nI am not clear on why you are wrapping the mortgage up with your energy bill.  \nYou currently pay a power bill and a mortgage.   \nIf you go solar (with a loan for solar) you would have a reduced power bill and new solar loan probably less than your existing power bill, in addition to your existing mortgage.   You could put the savings of your power bill/solar loan combination towards your mortgage as well as your 30% federal tax credit for the solar PV system.   \nAt the end of your solar loan, you would still have solar reducing your bill so the now greater savings can go towards your mortgage.",

"comment": "The storedge is not specific to a given battery solution.\n\nAs to your other questions:  \n\n1)  There are other competitors to the Powerwall out there - they just don't have the glitz and glam that Elon Musk brings with his media focus.  (sorry, don't remember the list, but there are 2 I know of and one I've heard of)\n\n2)  Storedge is taking a while because they're running test beds and getting certifications here in the states.  They're further along that process in Europe.\n\n3)  Far from vaporware - tech just really takes time to get to market, especially when it's volatile electronics that can kill children and other stupid people.  There's lots of certs and testing to be done.\n\n4)  it is my humble opinion that SolarEdge doesn't need a whole lot of help selling their product line - they're one of the best, most pliable, most reliable solutions out there.  They have *several* advantages over both specific competitors and broader system types.  They build a solid, robust product, and I can get it on the roof for a reasonable upsell over traditional string inverters, especially now that 3' rules and rapid shutdown requirements are all over.\n\nThere we go.  food for thought.",

I like the yeti battery cause its an enclosed, all in one unit (yes it includes the charge controller and inverter), with all the plugs and DC or AC outlets needed. But im thinking about getting thin film panels with a glue backing so i can attached them low profile to my curved trailer roof. \n\nIf anyone has any information that would be great! i was considering contacting goal zero and asking for the specifications of their charge controller so i can pair it with the solar panels i want. So long as the solar meets those specifications it should work fine.\n\nnot sure but i think we'll need to make our own adapter by soldering together to different connectors. not sure if there are industry standards on this small off grid type of equipment.",

There are still places in the world where solar panels are far too expensive to import in bulk, so adding 30% for the cost of a frame matters a lot. I don't live in a place like that, though.",

First, make sure you have a variable speed energy efficient pump (comes with rebates).  Then figure out whether you can get away with running the pump only at night during off-peak.  After that, look at solar.  But definitely look at solar for offsetting a/c usage on peak.  Lots of people in socal getting $3/w installs.",

More than half the cost of solar is installing awkward solar panels to racking, and the racking to the ground/roof. If solarcity can get some smart modular roofing solutions going it'll be a huge game changer. \n\nIncorporating these awkward hard to install panels into building structures also saves on building materials. Why build a roof, and then put another solar panel roof on top of it?",

For example, in New Jersey overall activity is flat but that plateau still seems pretty high. But competition in 2017 is as stiff or stiffer than ever before. Someone I know in Arizona thinks the newest utility agreements in the last week or so will catalyze C&amp;I for him.

"comment": "&gt; If you curtail output to 90% of available, a solar plant and inverters can provide rapid frequency response\n\nThe testbed for this is Hawaii, which requires solar inverters to back off and ultimately stop as the frequency rises above the nominal setpoint.  It means the grid is less than perfectly stable, but Hawaii's frequency is not terribly stable anyway because of scale and inertia; each island has it's own small grid.  Huge amounts of solar was a threat to grid stability, but with the inverters now preventing severe over-frequency events, it all works much better.\n\nThe problem isn't one of engineering; it's one of money.  A lot of folks fit solar based on they'll make a bucketload of money when the sun shines, and today, basically, the inverter runs as a high an output as it can manage all of the time, so more power generated when its bright and sunny, less when it's cloudy.   In the future, on a bright sunny day, with a lot of solar, lot of wind, everyone's  inverters may need to maintain 70%, or 50% of output to keep the frequency nominal.  Sometimes, this will mean that despite there being a load of sun, and a load of panels on the roof, with sufficient capability to cover the house load, the house is not exporting but importing, and folks will scowl at this.  There are ways around this, but it'll mean a bit more technology and smarts in the house.\n\nThe trick to grid stability, known since Westinghouse and Tesla's day, is to over-provision, but to run at exactly the right output to match the load, with a bit of capability to ramp up and down as necessary.  Or bad stuff happens.",

Then at night when I need to buy it back, they charge me $0.40/kwh.\n\nAs more solar gets installed, this changes.  10 years from now, they will probably only pay $0.05/kwh during the day, and then charge $0.60/kwh at night.  At some point, it will be more cost effective to install batteries, but those aren't cheap either.",

Without upgrading our infrastructure we'll not have anything to shift toward. Without feeling proper economic pain, we'll simply pay a little bit more for our drugs.\n\nThe dividend has been voted against in Washington State. Polls show it is far less popular than reinvesting the tax. The dividend is the Republican attempt to redirect the will of the people toward their own political means.\n\nA carbon tax is to be reinvested in infrastructure for electricity generation, and clean transportation. It must be used to help agriculture evolve. We no longer can passively hope that our economic slights will drive a pace of change fast enough.\n\nPeople are already dying.

If a global audience, or an Asia/India specific audience I would look for those published in that region.\n\nOtherwise, you could Google \"renewable energy news\" or \"....magazine\" or \"solar energy news\", etc. and find the ones that presumably get a lot of traffic because they show first in the search results. \n\nFor example, where I am located Google seems to prefer Renewable Energy World, Greentech Media, Solar Power World, etc. as those are the top most links that show up for solar energy news. Suggests to me those are ones Google knows have higher traffic and also get more clicks from other Google searches. It's the way their algorithm works. Ignore ads at the top.",

Assume $700/kWh of battery storage and see what the solar comes out to. Without knowing the size of the SunRun batteries, I can't be sure, but it looks like the SunRun deal is more back for the buck. Some people will pay a premium for the Tesla branding (Tesla does have a slightly better warranty, too) but really SunRun's LG will work fine.",

"comment": "&gt; Seems that California grandfathered in the people with 1:1 net metering.\n\nNot quite true.  Yes, we are grandfathered in on NEM 1.0.  But that does NOT include rates, so the utility companies will move us all to rate plans with peak rate hours in the evening/night time and off peak rate hours during mid afternoon.  So yes, we will still get 1 kwh credit for every kwh that we sell to the grid.  But since the value of those credits will be different, we'll need to sell 2 kwh to get enough money to buy one back.  \n\nThere are a lot of people with solar in California that will be in for a rude awakening when they are switched over to new rate plan in a few years because they installed systems that only generate about 70-80% of their usage.  Under original NEM 1.0 rates that's enough to end up with $0 bill at the end of the year.  After the rates change i a few years, they will have large electricity bills again and they will have to expand their system by 20-40% if they want to get their bills back down to $0.",

"comment": "I'm in Reno and it's worth it in Nevada as a cash purchase, but IMO not as a loan or lease. At least not a 20 year deal. 5 year financing, maybe. I chose to go solar not to lower or \"lock in\" my power bill, but to zero it out completely. If I still had to pay some monthly fee to a someone for a loan or PPA then I didn't see the point: either I'm paying NVE monthly or I'm paying someone else monthly. On a cash purchase my ROI came out to about 9 years.\n\nPeople bitch about how horrible NVE is, but facts are net metering was fixed by the legislature, NVE's rates keep going down, and our rates are nowhere near as high as CA. I believe you have TOU rates, but up here in the north we don't have TOU except as an option. I'm in the third net metering tier (81% of the retail rate). That's full now, so everyone now comes in at 75% of the retail rate on net metering.\n\nSolar salespeople like to say the cost of power is increasing and use that in their proposal to show how much you'll \"save\" by locking in a price today on financing and showing increasing utility costs over 20 years as the comparison. But that's just made up data. As you saw from your own research NVE's rates have been trending downwards, not up.\n\nEdit: that's not to say NVE rates are guaranteed to keep decreasing, but they have more solar stuff coming online in the coming years so I wouldn't bet on increases.",

"comment": "If the sub array of 4 panels is scrapped, where should the panels be moved to? If there will be conduit run on the exterior of the roof, will it greatly affect the aesthetics of the house? Isn’t it standard practice to have the flashings hidden? Boston Solar does install SunPower panels as well, but we were told it would be more expensive. It seems they install SunPower panels more often for their commercial customers. Does SunPower manufacture their own inverters? And why wouldn’t the LG panels with Enphase inverters warranty be as strong?",

How is the cost of the PV system driving you to try and sell the panels?  I'm willing to concede that the price for the fully installed system may have been $32k, assuming an extremely difficult install, all black AC panels, and a buyer who overpaid.  \n\nI'll also agree that you did post asking for a company who buys used panels, and maybe you just had absolutely no idea about the value of panels.\n\nI like to think that people posting here are trying to get real answers.  Could you explain why you have panels to sell and the current state of the panels (are they still on the roof, were they ever installed, have they been removed) and why?",

"comment": "Farms don't all produce food\n\n[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep22521/tables/1) estimates that 11 million hectares of land in 2013 were cultivated for bioethanol and 4 million ha for biodiesel. Above article asks for 1% of land, which means about 3 million ha. It stands to reason that falling dependence on combustion cars would reduce the need for biofuels, and solar farms net you significantly more energy per ha than fuel crops. Of course it would need to be made sure that solar farms don't overwhelmingly end up on highly productive food-cropland.\n\nAlso, like shown in the article, solar farms can be co-located with grazing lands quite easily - this hardly harms food production.\n\nBLM land and desert land aren't evenly spread across the nation. There's hardly any of it in the East. You'd need to overbuild generation in the West, also overbuild transmission, and then it's suddenly 2045 and you've missed your targets.\n\nSure rooftop solar needs to continue being built, we'll need that plus utility scale solar plus wind. If this move makes sense for farmers financially, that's good.",

You'll want to choose a charge controller that can handle the voltage, so 48Voc * 3 panels in series = 144V input voltage on your charge controller. Your charge controller will also have an amperage rating. So, if you have three 370W panels, that will be 1110W. Pushing that power through a 12V charge controller, you will be at 1110W/12V = 92A. You'll need a 100A charge controller. For that kind of solar power, you'd be better off with a 24V or 48V battery bank and inverter. 48V is becoming standard, and you would only need 1 more battery.  Wire the four 12V batteries in series to get a perfect balance.",

It feels like, without any basis or understanding of the reality of the technological challenges, people sing their praises as though you can just \"make them and plug them in\". \n\nEvery country has different energy requirements, given things like industry, lifestyle, population, transportation.\n\n[Consider that it takes 200 million 300W solar panels to replace one nuclear plant](https://www.quora.com/How-many-solar-panels-would-be-needed-to-replace-a-nuclear-power-station) excluding battery considerations, grid adapters, backup and redundancy, and losses in transmission. That would occupy 13 square miles of area assuming each panel is 2 square meters. \n\nThe USA has 58 nuclear plants which combined supply 10% of the energy requirements of the country. The US would need an additional 522 nuclear plants to meet today's requirements, requirements that don't factor in non electrical energy use or growth.\n\nThat's 104 trillion solar panels. Even if we were able to produce 100 million solar panels a year, it would take over 500 years to meet *today's* demand. \n\nMost people will read that and somehow still think it's reasonable.\n\nYes though, rooftop solar can be economical for home owners after some time, assuming there are government incentives and the grid is able to accept electricity put back into it.\n\n**Tl;dr**\n\nRenewables are great but they aren't ready to save the planet. Nuclear is a sensible technology to tie us over until renewable technologies mature.\n\nMost importantly, listen to the experts. They know what they are talking about.",

Lets say we average 1kW per hour it would last us approx 14 hours. It does work when the power goes out too. The main reason for the storage system is to take advantage of grid prices and to ensure I consume as much of my solar generated power as possible. I'm on a variable tarrif which uses wholesale prices, i import when its cheap, and export some during peak times for profit.",

Since the inventor is a little bit shy, Im trying to help by having y'll feedback regarding her technology.\n\nI was thinking that maybe emailing her about any concerns might be a good way to help her improve. But regarding the technology i think it's more about power generation than power storage maybe that's why lithium wasnt mentioned. \n\nFor CO2 generation, any pre-combustion capture equipment should lower CO2 emission, the main question would be what is the source of power for the plant (natural gas or solar panels). \n\nIf we believe everything the inventor says, do you think this is a good alternative? Because at the end of the day, it's all about what people want!",

"comment": "The recent tragic tornados in Kentucky, Illinois and other states left a substantial death toll of at least 89 people, which is likely to increase. It did not take long for the all-to-predictable climate change chorus to exploit them for their political benefit.\n\nThe Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Deanne Criswell, was brazen and bereft of evidence when she said, “This is going to be our new normal and the effects that we’re seeing from climate change are the crisis of our generation”.\n\nSuch unfounded gibberish continues a rhetorical tradition from so many of the usual suspects following a major weather event. Think Al Gore, Sen. Bernie Sanders and AOC and their fellow travelers.\n\n….\n\nNo amount of facts, history or science is going to sway such dogmatists who, like wind-up dolls, repeat the false mantra of climate-change-causing-bad-storms every time bad weather makes the news and brings tragedy. They are neck-deep into the politics and financial hooks of climate change.\n\nExceptional storm activity did not begin with the baby-boom or successor generations in search of a meaningful cause in their lives. Recent strong tornados are not unique or unusual in the 21st Century nor is planetary warming. They have existed since the dawn of time.\n\nLet’s go back about a century. The Tri-State Tornado in March 1925 devasted communities across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana for a stretch of about 220 miles and killed nearly 700 people. \n\n[The Tri-State Tornado, March 18, 1925: Deadliest Tornado in U.S. History](https://youtu.be/2AguMdnoU2E)\n\nSince 1950, there have been 21 violent storms in the month of December that were rated EF4 or EF5 as measured by meteorologists based on the Enhanced Fujita Scale of intensity. The last EF4 level tornado in the month of December occurred in 2015 and the last EF5 tornado this time of year dates to 1957. The National Weather Service now categorized this latest tornado as an EF4.\n\n….\n\nReminders of previous violent storms become necessary to refute the climate hucksters who are so quick to capitalize on the latest weather tragedy as though it necessitates adopting their climate change political agenda.\n\nThe reality, however, is that more solar panels and wind turbines, and less oil use will not diminish future storms or the average planetary temperature reading. That’s going to occur all on its own – in unpredictable fashion. A modest climate warming trend will be a trend – until climate changes.\n\n➖➖➖\n\nAn analysis by Greg Goodman reconstructed tornado counts back to 1950 using an adjustment for the pre-Doppler era to fill in unobserved storm events. The result shows all categories of tornado numbers rising from 1950 to a peak in 1975, then declining thereafter through the present. The conclusion was:\n\n“The post 1975 period marks the beginning of the late 20th century warming which IPCC has attributed mainly to anthropogenic effects (AGW). If there is a need to hypothesise a link between “global warming” and the frequency or intensity of tornadoes in USA, it would be that there have been less events in all major categories during this warming period. There has been no significant change in the distribution in storm severity as temperatures rise and recent warmer decades have seen notably less activity than the earlier post-WWII cooling period”.\n\nSo maybe there is a connection between warming and tornadoes: More warming might mean fewer of them. If that hypothesis is verified, scientists may eventually tell us. But we have no faith that alarmist politicians will be interested in listening to the science.",

"comment": "I'm assuming you are talking about stanchions\n\nIn my opinion, trust your roofing guy to know what is best for the roof, not the solar guy. The solar guy would know what is best for the solar installation. The stanchions should be flashed. I can't tell you if this would matter with the system you referenced, but water could still penetrate under the plate if it is not laid properly with the shingles.\n\nThe only problem would be getting the stanchions installed while your new roof is being put on (i.e. the roofing and solar installer may not be able to or want to work together). My roofer had a preferred solar guy and they worked together for these things, but I don't know if this works into your plans and/or if your roofer has a preferred solar crew they work with.\n\nIn my case I needed my panels removed and reinstalled after the new roof. The roofer decided if the old stanchions were still in good enough shape. I also had new additional panels installed, but I wasn't around to know the exact order and who did exactly what when it came to the stanchions.\n\nThe roofer's concern is right after a new roof, if the solar guys screw up the stanchions and you get penetration, you will come after the roofing guy to fix it. Leaks don't always happen at the point of penetration and can sometimes be hard to trace without ripping things up. I would communicate with the roofing guy and see how he could help make it work. When shopping around, you should see how willing a prospective roofer and solar installer will be willing to coordinate. My roofer coordinated with my general contractor to drill a hole and flash a boot used to install conduit for a subpanel in addition to my solar installer.",

"comment": "California alone curtails an insane amount of solar power. What if instead of shutting those generation sources off, they charged utility scale or VPP batteries at market rates (supply outstripping demand and driving costs way down) then turn around and sell that power for 30 cents per kWh which is the average residential rate. Plus make the grid far more stable. And save money by reducing rate spikes during hot days in the evening that can send market pricing to $2k per MWh of power. \n\nThis gets to the issue with rate structure. California utilities cannot price power lower then around 18 cents, even if the market value of power is less than a penny per kWh midday thanks to abundant solar because the utilities have to recover their costs on a per kWh basis. From a grid stability and management perspective, it would be great if the utilities made it crazy cheap to charge EV, grid scale, and home batteries during the day and use up all that solar power. Maybe everyone programs their smart thermostats to cool their homes to 60 degrees by 4 pm and then not need AC until after the peak is over in the evening. \n\nWe need to have a flat monthly fee to pay for the grid with CARE/FERA discounts and weighted fee based on how large your electrical service is. A home with a 400 amp service is many times more expensive to provide service to than a 250 amp which is more expensive than a 100 amp home. Then charge dynamic market rates for power with some price controls to prevent Texas style price spikes during extreme weather while also encouraging energy savings during grid strain.",

"comment": "Exactly. Just wait, the utilities will try to recycle these arguments when the Inflation Reduction Act starts paying for billions of energy efficiency upgrades. \n\nThe cost shift argument is stupid because the entire rate structure is full of cost shifts, many of which are much larger than solar. It’s more expensive to service customers in rural areas vs cities, in single family homes vs multi family dwellings, in desert areas vs costal, customers with pools vs those without, and on and on. \n\nThe fundamental issue is that investor owned utilities only make money on transmission projects. So they would rather have cheap centralized utility scale solar and wind that they have to connect to population centers hundreds of miles away. Tons of opportunity for cost overruns which benefits them because they recoup 100% of costs from the ratepayers and also make a fixed percentage in profits off the total cost of the transmission project. They can have cheap power and bloated transmission costs and Californians will have no option but to pay. Distributed solar, especially when paired with batteries reduce the need for long distance transmission. And that makes investors and utility CEOs mad.",

Of that, our Chevy Bolt EV (3.3 miles/kW) used roughly 4,900 kWh of power to go 16,000 miles. We stopped driving our ICE car whenever possible. Maybe put 3,000 miles on it last year.\n\nSuper basic house, 1,400sq feet, AC usage in summer and natural gas usage in winter. Ohio area. Getting a 5.5kW system here soon that's the biggest our roof will support that will generate 6,500 kWh a year. So more than covering all of our yearly transportation needs.  1:1 Net metering.",

Would you be overjoyed if someone gave you a 15 year old computer or car that’s going to cost you $10K to get working with obsolete parts?  Panels today probably are twice as efficient as the ones you were given. The design and installation costs for new or used will be the same so you are might only be saving $5k by installing something so old and you are only getting half the performance.  If you were installing it might be worth it, but hiring a company probably not.  AND remember electricians ARE not roofers.  I would not have a roofer install panels that require penetration of the roof.  Installing racking for solar panels is tricky and if one screws up you will have a leak which can ruins the ceiling, drywall, insulation and flooring. \n\nIf you post model numbers or pictures of the model number we can try to assist.",

"comment": "Everyone is legitimate until they aren’t. Here in CA I happen to work with a SunPower authorized dealer and we’re what’s considered an ND (or non-installing dealer) which means SunPower or their vetted subcontractors do the installing, not my company. There are companies that do the sales and installation (which is referred to as an installing dealer). Most dealers across the industry have a sales team (either inside - like phone calls or outside - like the door to door guys) and then sub out the installs…..you’ll see this especially with HVAC or roofing contractors who’ve started a Solar arm to their business. One of the main reasons I chose to work with SunPower is their longevity in the business (37+ years…which is longer than warranties….oh and I installed SP on my home 3 years ago as it’s the best quality and warranty out there).\n\nA bit of a misnomer is that a company like Tesla or SunRun makes and installs panels. They do not - they install other manufacturer’s panels, racking, inverters, monitoring, etc. In many cases they can’t tell the homeowner what they’re going to be installing because they don’t know until they go to the distribution warehouse and pick up all of the components. \n\nYou can look up Solar Alliance and CALSSA as a couple of orgs helpful to the industry….and the CPUC which would be the antithesis of helpful to the industry.\n\nGlad to be a further resource.\n\nThere are 4 main purchase options: Cash, Loan, Lease, and PPA….each has it’s pros and cons with the current market heavily influenced by interest rates which means cash and leases are the best way to go for most folks.",

"comment": "They generally don’t fail outright, just degrade. And when they do fail, it is often cell balancing problems where one or two cells fail and bring the rest of a pack down with it.\n\nA high mileage 60kWh pack with only 40% capacity left is still very useful for static energy storage, where weight and space is much less of a concern.\n\nAlso, static energy storage is far less demanding on packs, so can tolerate a lot more cell to cell variations than a car can.\n\nIn a vehicle, during driving and DC fast charging, a pack can regularly see charge and discharge rates in excess of 2C (eg, a 60kWh pack could charge / discharge at rates at or above 120kW)\n\nIn a static application, they will rarely  if ever see above 0.4C (eg, a 13.5kWh tesla powerwall has a max charge/discharge rate of ~5kW).",

My point is that the same mindset that killed off forest management is now killing off oil, which is arguably the safest energy source for the environment at this time when you consider the rapid replacement of productive farmland with toxic solar panels, the strip mining of minerals for batteries, and the coming catastrophe of disposal of these batteries when their short useful life is over. Does this make any sense at all when the most dire predictions of global warming are maybe a few degrees over the course of a century? Isn’t it likely that within in that time frame we’ll have incremental technological advancement that does less harm than good?",

"comment": "Yes, Sunrun will have access to the Tesla monitoring, they only give customer's the MySunrun app.  \n\nTypically Sunrun will set up the OEM monitoring (Tesla, Enphase, Solaredge, etc) during commissioning, then they import data via API, which is integrated into their proprietary monitoring system.  They process the OEM data and do their own analysis to detect issues.  And they use it during service repairs.\n\nWhether they can or will detect remotely that there's an additional Powerwall, I don't know.  Unlikely.\n\nModifying the system is a contract violation.  They won't blanket void the warranty - they're more intersted in you continuing to pay - but they may charge you for repairs.  If you run into issues and service is needed, the tech may not even notice, or confused why there's an extra battery.  Hard to say.  So if they realize it's a modification, then you may be on the hook for repair costs.\n\nA bigger possible issue is that technically with an addition you're supposed to redo the permit, inspection, and interconnection.  And the utility may have special requirements if it exceeds a certain capacity.\n\n I know that Sunrun does allow for a full battery syatem to be added by other installers - there's a process - but I don't know if that applies to adding more Powerwalls.  I'd say call and ask, but then there'll be a call log in your account.\n\nAgain, whether anyone notices AND does anything is anyone's guess. The risk seems small, but it's not zero.  Your call.",

But they've already eliminated the majority of their contribution to animal suffering. Rather than being the stereotypical elitist vegan, it's better to just be a good example.\n\n&gt;our message that animal cruelty is never okay gets burried by BS terms like this vegn.\n\nIt doesn't get \"buried\" at all. You're grossly exaggerating the significance of a bit of online shorthand.\n\n&gt;The two terms, vegn and vegan can easily become mixed up and, if it becomes popular/wide spread enough, the actual meaning of vegan will no longer be known.\n\nThis is sky-is-falling alarmism.",

That's because you are not being honest in your analysis.\n\n[I responded to this here](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/e6jyf/being_vegan_is_worse_for_the_environment_exposing/c15uywt)\n\nI really don't get the fetish among vegans to try to win this argument. We have our animal ethics arguments. The more we try to pretend that no meat is better than a small amount of very targeted meat production, the more we will begin to come off as global warming deniers, who say fuck science, we have our own ideas. Even Michael Pollan (a person I am sure other vegans also love), has pointed out (as an expert in the field) that some types of cow production for instance are actually carbon-negative!\n\nNot all meat production has to happen the way we currently do it. Vegans need to stick to the ethics argument or suffer unending criticism and appearances of cultish science-deniers.",

I have tried all sorts of treatments: retin-a, BP, tetracyclenes, etc. and they all work to clear up spots, but aren't long term cures: they don't stop new pustules from developing. The only thing so far that stops the pustules is including animal protein in my diet.\n\nI have even tried soy protein powers and just eating lots of tofu to increase my protein on full vegan diet, but the pustules always return (even while excluding the grains). Also, it doesn't matter which starches I eat (rice, wheat, buckwheat, etc), even fruits, will trigger the pustules.",

Why not encourage them to make their own or eat other things? Many of us have changed our diets considerably since going vegan -- often for the better, too. \n\nBut your other suggests our good.

"comment": "Ok. Let's go through this paragraph by paragraph. I should say before this that I don't believe soy is unhealthy, just that the article is bogus.\n\n&gt; **As a company that creates a line of minimally processed soy-based puddings^1** that are gluten, dairy/lactose, tree nut, peanut, and egg free, you better believe that we’ve done our research to ensure that we’re using not only the best ingredients out there, but also that eating whole soy is healthy. The problem is that after books like Kaayla T. Daniel’s The Whole Soy Story, came out in 2005, the general public has become confused about whether soy is good for you. **While we’ve consistently shown you research that proves it is^2**, we’re happy to report that we aren’t the only ones who believe in making whole soy a part of a healthy diet. **Many people who subsist on plant-based diets agree with us on this point^3**, but they aren’t the only ones — we recently came upon **an article written by Ginny Messina, a vegan dietician and nutritionist^4**, who clears up the foggy information floating around the Internet and public libraries.\n\n1. \"Hi. We have commercial interest in you eating more soy. Let us tell you all about it.\", while this doesn't invalidate the rest of the text it does mean you should take it with a grain of salt.\n\n2. Not in this article.\n\n3. People who eat something agree that it's healthy? In related news: carnists usually believe meat is healthy and ethical.\n\n4. Fair enough, let's hear what she has to say.\n\n&gt; In an article published on OneGreenPlanet.org, Messina says that while the earliest incarnations of soy 2,000 years ago, such as miso and tempeh, were fermented, tofu and other unfermented types of soy have been eaten for at least 1,000 years. If you listen to the soy naysayers, then you probably believe that people of Asian descent have treated soy just as a condiment, not as an actual food source, and that they focus on consuming fermented soy. According to Messina, this is just not true: “[I]f we look to Asian diets for guidance on consuming soy, it’s clear that all traditional products — tofu, soymilk, tempeh, miso and soybeans — can play a role in healthy diets. Average intakes among Japanese are around 1 to 1½ servings, but some people — especially those eating more traditional diets — eat more.” If they’ve been consuming this much soy on a daily basis for this long, then maybe it’s time you added a moderate amount of whole soy to your plate.\n\nThis whole paragraph is an appeal to tradition. People ate lots of shit in the old days, and people also didn't live very long.\n\n&gt; Still need a little more time to shake away your confusion about whether whole soy is good for you or not? **Then perhaps long time vegan and competitive distance runner^1**, Jennifer Valentine might be able to persuade you. She reiterates Messina’s claim that **some of the world’s healthiest diets — I.e. traditional Asian diets^2** — have lived not only without any ill effects from their consumption of soy, **but also have experienced its health-promoting effects^3**, such as reducing the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer, a reduction in “bad” cholesterol, a decreased incidence in menopausal symptoms, and a decreased risk for osteoporosis.\n\n1. Anecdotal evidence isn't worth squat, sorry.\n\n2. Citation needed. Also, soy is a part of traditional asian diets, not the foundation. Other big parts of asian diets is meat, fish and eggs (though very little dairy I think). And rice. Really, you can't just look at one component of a healthy diet and say \"that's it, that's what's keeping them healthy!\". The japanese smoke and drink loads, yet they still have one of the longest (maybe it's the longest?) life span in the world. I'm for one am not picking up drinking or smoking because of it. -- Oh, and it's also an appeal to tradition.\n\n3. This really is the same kind of fallacy as #2. The reasoning is thoroughly flawed. Btw, why are we listening to an athlete for dietary advice? Because she eats? I eat too. Because she's healthy? Lots of people are healthy and can't tell a tomato from a pineapple.\n\n&gt; Valentine goes on to say that even athletes, like her, can gain a lot by eating “minimally processed soy products.” And we agree, the key — whether you're an athlete or not — is choosing minimally processed, whole soy that is organic and non-gmo, like Soyummi Puddings!\n\nAgain, I don't care what an athlete have to say on the subject. It's an appeal to authority even though the person in question should have no authority on the subject to begin with. Oh, and then we end this informative article with an ad.\n\n--------------\n\nDon't take it personally. It's a fun read and all but regardless if soy is healthy for you or not the article is riddled with poor reasoning and essentially is just a promotion for Soyummi's line of products.",

A youtube cooking show I recently watched involved killing shellfish as a step in the preparation; there were comments along the lines of 'OMG THEY WERE ALIVE? U MONSTER!' from people who happily eat meat.\n\nBy existing, vegans remind people of the obvious truths that most sophisticated bacon worshiping gentlesirs and their equivalents in the real world try their hardest to repress: the consumption of animal products means the killing of animals, and consuming animal products is not necessary. These are people who know they are good and kind and love animals; they don't unnecessarily kill things! This is why it's generally accepted that vegans are all so preachy; a vegan doesn't even have to open their mouth to be accused of being judgmental. The non-vegan feels the cognitive dissonance and immediately blames the trigger.",

"comment": "Cool... go all the way with it &amp; stick with it. You know, there are those who argue, pretty reasonably, that dairy is worse than just meat because the dairy cows are impregnated frequently, have their calves taken away each time, which is traumatic, &amp; they're kept in those hellish conditions for the extended period of time while they're being sucked dry &amp; made lame, &amp; *then* they're slaughtered (&amp; ~30% of American dairy cows are lame by the time they're killed.) So, the argument is that they suffer more than cattle used solely for meat. Also, veal is a dairy co-product (where the calves are chained into little  stalls where they can't move.) So, you should definitely leave dairy out. Legumes are great for protein, &amp; healthier than dairy (&amp; feasibly even cheaper too.) I like lentils quite a bit... I'm eating a bowl now... they can be boiled in the microwave until tender but firm (I cook a bowl for 6 minutes, then let it sit in the hot water for 2 minutes), strained, &amp; then served with fat (like marg) &amp; salt. It's simple &amp; delicious. And then there are other legumes... chickpeas, beans... &amp; there is tofu &amp; seitan &amp; faux meats, which are all great for protein too. \n\nI don't know what to say about a duck sanctuary; that's not something I could really advise about. Although, maybe there is a Humane Society in your area that might get involved. Eat well, keep fit, &amp; take care!",

But my best guess is that either a) she's not eating nearly as many calories as she thinks she is; b) she has a hereditary form of fructose malabsorption, or some other sugar malabsorption; or c) she has become so extremely insulin sensitive as a result of keeping her fat intake super low, that her body has a much harder time converting sugars into adipose (*de novo lipogenesis*), a process that is already very difficult for the body to do.\n\nI think she means well, and that said she *has* been effective in encouraging others towards veganism. The \"raw til 4\" premise is not unreasonable, and gets people eating much better than they used to, which is a win.\n\nThe interesting thing about pure raw fruitarians is that they seem to require higher calories than those eating cooked food. No one is really sure why this is, but it's been described in the literature. Dr. Greger did a video on it a while ago: [How Much Fruit is Too Much?](http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/) \n\nIt's puzzling, but I can theorize all day about why this is...perhaps because de novo lipogenesis is very difficult for the body to do, so in the absence of even a moderate amount of dietary fat, the body prefers to burn off sugars as heat or encourage the body to move more, rather than create fatty acids from those sugars.",

But I still like treats and eat a lot of dark chocolate and like kale chips, too. I add berries, nuts and seeds to vegan yogurt sometimes, too. \n\nIBS can be very specific to the person, though. Mine was mostly misdiagnosed lactose intolerance I think (which you'd think multiple digestive disease specialists would have considered...). So, do take time to find if anything is a trigger. \n\nAs far as fatigue...do try to avoid caffeine and too much sugar. Eat lots of high nutrient food. It's not a cure, but setting your diet right will set you up to feel better overall and not get additional diet related problems.",

AGAIN, if animals weren't sentient, there wouldn't be veganism.  You're not following very well....\n\n\\&gt;  You seem to discriminate based on what humans see as sentience.\n\nYeah, because once you lose sentience, you're basically a rock.  That's why vegans use sentience as the line.  It makes sense.\n\nYou should really brush up on what sentience is and what hypotheticals are. You don't see to be following along.\n\nMaybe read the top threads over at /r/DebateAVegan\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I've noticed the commitment carries over past just diet changes, but I'm a bit confused about how far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn regards to animals being kept in captivity, there seems to be an overwhelming opinion of it being bad. But why aren't pets included in this? It's true, I don't know many vegans. But the few I do know have cats, which they ironically keep and feed a meat diet. Are they the outlier, or not true vegan, by doing this?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhenever I point out the fact that they lead a carefully wholesome lifestyle, but keep one of nature's biggest killing machines as a souvenir, I'm told I don't understand.

I hope that the child I raise is full of compassion and answers those questions in an pro-active vegan manner. I'm hoping to raise a smart little one who stands up for what he/she believes in!",

You'll find lots of stories of people who hated vegan cheese, then a year later they love it. And it's not a fake love, it's a true enjoyment of the taste due to chained desires and sensory input. So I'd recommend being patient. Also use a fresh, unfortified nutritional yeast to avoid that weird aftertaste. No bulk bin, no fortifications. I like sari brand as an example",

"comment": "My friend I believe you can be vegan - this is how pretty much all of us started, by making more and more ethical choices as consumers. That's all there is to it :-)\n\nAlso with your body wash situation, as I myself suffered from a skin condition (on my scalp) and funnily enough it went away after going vegan (I suspect it was dairy), but animal proteins are linked to a variety of auto-immune responses (even some serious ones like rheumatoid arthritis), so while the body wash maybe causing the breakout to appear, the damage could actually be an underlying issue with your diet, and often it is a sign that something internal is not working right.\n\nA lot \"natural stores\" have very good body washes, and cheaper sometimes too, without those petroleum based ingredients which might be causing breakouts, even if it isn't the diet.\n\n&gt;I eat something with meat in it. A burger. I will enjoy the taste and everything, but feel really guilty about it.\n\nEat all of the beyond meat / impossible burgers you want. Guilt free, and same delicious taste :-)\n\nTry the vegan challenge for 22 days (it's fun with a friend too btw) at [challenge22.com](https://challenge22.com) (all free) and I think you will be surprised at how easy things really are when you have dedicated a set amount of time into looking at it.",

I'm a vegan bot.  \n\n\n-------------\n\n**Your Fallacy:**\n\n&gt;and in my personal efforts to be as respectful of the environment as possible I always buy milk and meat from exclusively grass-fed cows **(ie: Humane meat)**\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\nIt is normal and healthy for people to empathize with the animals they eat, to be concerned about whether or not they are living happy lives and to hope they are slaughtered humanely. However, if it is unethical to harm these animals, then it is more unethical to kill them.\nKilling animals for food is far worse than making them suffer. Of course, it is admirable that people care so deeply about these animals that they take deliberate steps to reduce their suffering (e.g. by purchasing \"free-range\" eggs or \"suffering free\" meat). However, because they choose not to acknowledge the right of those same animals to live out their natural lives, and because slaughtering them is a much greater violation than mistreatment, people who eat 'humane' meat are laboring under an irreconcilable contradiction.)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]",

There's only a difference morally if you think it's morally wrong to murder for your food. I obviously do think it's wrong to murder for your food. I think it's pretty obvious that's the main reason why most people are vegan is that they think it's not good to murder animals to eat them. Why do I have to tell you this?",

I don’t know what brands are available to you in India, so I can’t be of much help with alternatives, but if you have any eco/health stores available locally or online, they may be a good place to try!\n\n2. Dettol are not cruelty-free. Again, a local eco store may sell organic/vegan/cruelty-free cleaning products. \n\n3. I don’t think all their products are vegan, so it depends on what you’re using - but not cruelty-free. A lot of shampoo bars tend to be vegan and cruelty-free, so maybe look into those? I love the brand Ethique - they’re quite expensive but they also last a LONG time compared to a bottle of shampoo, in my experience. (Also, less plastic!) \n\n4. Some glycerin is animal-derived, so it depends on the brand. It looks like Pears is vegan and cruelty-free. I can’t tell with Vivel.\n\nWith the vast majority of brands, a quick Google should tell you what you need to know.",

You can check that here https://tools.myfooddata.com/protein-calculator/169704/wt1/1\n\nI suppose brown rice/wheat/barly, etc. contains more methionine per gram of protein, but they are low in protein, both relative to volume and to calories, so I don't know why you would care about that. Eating more legumes will result in a higher protein diet, but I don't think that is a bad thing. You won't get a carb deficiency on a vegan diet.",

Living with people who aren't vegan and constantly being around people who normalize it is easy! Trying to make a major lifestyle change when you're already struggling with mental illness and/or disability is easy! Doing all of the research to learn what's *actually* vegan when you don't have any time to yourself due to work/school/family is easy! Going vegan while living in a food desert and/or being poor is easy! \n\nNgl, I'm not vegan. I want to be. I'm making small changes, swapping things out day by day, meal by meal, product by product, but I also have a full time job, 4 pets, depression, and migraines. I struggle to get up and get dressed most days, I literally don't have the time/energy to switch to an entirely vegan lifestyle tomorrow. The majority of the population is like me in some way, something in their life is stopping them, and your response alienates people from the cause",

After a great public uproar and a petition signed by millions of people, it is decided that the dog will not be put down and the guy is innocent.\n\nDuring the next walk, the dog breaks loose, runs after him and through a portal that leads him to the parallel world. Before he gets his dog, the dog, which is thought to have run away, is caught by the authorities and put into a factory farm.\n\nDisappointed, the guy goes to a burger joint, only to be shocked to find out that he is eating dog meat. As the movie. continues, he tries to get his dog out and learns of the horrors of animal husbandry. \n\nAs a last hope to save his dog, he starts a big protest against factory dog farming. There, he meets an anti-vegan guy with a boar as his pet. The two get into an argument, at the end of which the boar bites him to death.\n\nCut - boom - no happy ending",

I’ve always been a good speaker and writer, and this was a damn good presentation. I was so careful to make it palatable. I pored over it.\nThen I got my grade back: a D, my very first. There was no substantial comment on the speech or delivery itself, which was unusual for her; just a big scrawl at the bottom: “Unconvincing.”  I was heartbroken. Furious. Embarrassed.\nAnd I get it. It’s rough to be confronted with facts that suggest you’re falling morally short, especially from a student. We only hope to sow enough seeds for some to fall on good soil.\n\nBut this sub teacher you had sounds like an emotionally dense virtue signaler. There’s a lot of social clout in broadcasting the idea that you’re moral and self-controlled enough to go vegan, but ONLY for a trial period — you’re back in the safe group, but you’re now carrying badges of self control (“I had an extreme diet”), self-effacement (“it was too hard for me haha”), and group absolution (“it’s not worth it”). To be in the presence of someone who used to be on the other side, makes everyone comfortable. It justifies their current position. \nThis teacher is tearing you down because he doesn’t know how to budget. Cage-free eggs? That shit is expensive! \nKeep your chin up. Sit with that anger. Reduce it to elements you can use. We got you ✊",

"comment": "Saying that you believe them kinds kicks the leg out from any argument you try and make in the future though... because they'll circle back to \"but my Uncle Joe does that too, and you said he's being humane\".\n\nUncle dairy farmer almost certainly does what the rest of those \"95% of dairy farms\" do.  He still kills his unproductive animals, he still sells the males off for veal, he still uses milking machines which probably result in chafing and cuts and bleeding some of the time.  \n\nHe very likely does treat his animals better than the worst undercover abuse videos (as I'm sure most farms do, because those videos are the worst of the worst), but the simple economics of dairy farming means he *must* do many things that vegans disagree with and find abusive if he wants to stay in business.",
