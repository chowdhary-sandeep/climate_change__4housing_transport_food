"comment": "Their plan is to eventually have all the superchargers use solar canopies and grid storage. They also quoted each station as costing about $150,000 to build, and about another $150,000 for the canopies, and they plan to have roughly 200 stations built by 2015. This brings the total cost to $60M up front, free electricity from the panels, and minimal maintenance costs.\n\nThis sounds like a lot, but consider that they just raised approx one BILLION from a follow-on offering of stock and bonds. If they reach their target in Q4 of 25% profit margin per vehicle with a global demand of 50,000 Model S per year, they'll be raking in about another *billion in profit per year on Model S alone*. The superchargers are really a drop in the bucket of their business.",

"comment": "I did some research on this a few years ago.  Perhaps some of below is out of date, but here is what can remember from what I learned:\n\n**Low end cars** = Obviously easy to go no leather.\n\n**Medium end cars** = easy to go no leather UNLESS you want it \"fully loaded\", in which case there are annoyances like you must get leather seats if you want heated seats, or Nav systems or whatever.  Depending on the demand for the vehicle, you may be able to special order, but on super-high demand vehicles, they may be building things in pre-specified packagages making special orders slow or impossible.  (I had this experience trying to buy a \"fully loaded no leather Toyota Highlander\", and eventually just gave up (This was several years ago.  If you are looking for nonleather SUV, consider Mercedes, or I actually prefer the cloth interior of the Chevy Equinox which is a surprisingly great car that my parents bought).\n\n**Luxury cars** = easy to get non-leather seats for SOME brands / impossible for others.  Mercedes has a \"MBTex\" option that is in my opinion quite superior to leather.  BMW has something similar.  Other brands (Lexus, for example) seem impossible.  Probably Lexus is trying to keep manufacturing cost down by providing fewer options.  I really liked MBTex interiors.   Tesla can also do fully non-leather, I think.  If not, it's very close (not sure of steering wheel). \n\n**Exotics** = At this point, if you buy new, you can often specify your interior as custom.  Expect to pay a lot more, of course.  I did not research all brands, as this is out of my price range, but Ferrari, McLaren, and Aston Martin were all allowing money to talk.  Forget buying used, as it is extremely rare to find such a thing, though I have seen some of the race car variants with non-leather, as at that level weight is the primary concern.\n\nI would never buy a car with leather.  I might make an exception for the scrap they use around the shifter, and maybe the steering wheel, but when you go leather on the seats, that's an insane amount of cruelty for something that is just not worth it.",

I will buy electricity from the grid, no matter where it's generated.  \n\nOh, and those projections?  They are calculated based on a continuous increase in emissions.  The baseline is a 1%, year over year increase.  It's exponential.  Have you calculated the \"growth curve\" of US CO2 over the last 15 years?  It's flat.  It's not an exponential growth curve.  So, we've already acted, and we continue to act.\n\nMe, personally?  I've changed from driving 70 miles per day to go to work to working at home.  I've recently leased a Nissan Leaf, a zero emissions car. Less than 30% of the electricity that powers that Nissan Leaf comes from coal, and that number is falling every year.  My local grid will be powered in a few years by one of the only new Nuclear (that's non-co2 emitting) plant in the US since the 1970s.  It's supposed to replace several Coal powered plants.\n\nMy personal Carbon Footprint is less than half of the average American's, and at this point, smaller than the average Chinese or European.  Cast your aspersions elsewhere.  In fact, you should attempt to be the change you want to see in the world.  I have not attacked you for your carbon sins, have I?",

I refuse to stop and wait for my car to charge on a trip, as will all mainstream drivers.  When I fill up my PHEV, its because it's time to fill up, not because if I don't fill up I will be stranded.  When EV drivers charge their car during a short trip, it's because if they don't they will be stranded.\n\nManufacturers aren't racing to compete with Tesla because Tesla is bleeding money.  That's why Musk is so amazing, he is literally paving the way on his own dime.  And with gas prices dropping here in the US, he has a tough road ahead.\n\nTwenty five miles is perfect, until the charging infrastructure catches up.   That's why EVERY top manufacturer is making them in that configuration.\n\nFord, Hyundai, Audi, BMW, VW, Kia ... all have +/- 8kwh battery, small four cylinder engine, small electric engine.  The only one that doesn't get it is Toyota with their 4kwh battery.\n\nYour leaf is a cute commuter car, but it's a band aid(admittedly a nice one).",

"comment": "&gt; A fleet of battery electric vehicles ARE (in the aggregate) more expensive to operate, period.\n\nI'm going to disagree.  You are not saying that they are more expensive to purchase, or I'd agree with you.  You are claiming that they are more expensive to operate, and I'm not going to agree.\n\nYes, the purchase price is being offset by federal and state grants, so it would cost more to actually buy an electric car than to buy an equivalently powered and equipped normal car.  But, then again, some cars are ridiculously priced due to their branding or trim package, while not actually being better cars.  A BMW versus a Honda, for example. The Honda is arguably a better car, while the name brand of the BWM, and some non-functioning trim work makes the BMW much more expensive.  \n\nAnyway, back to the \"operation\" costs.  How exactly do you see the cost of the electricity plus the cost of the batteries as being more expensive than the cost of gasoline, oil changes, and such?  Show me where the cost is being \"shifted to others\" as a form of parasitic welfare.",

"comment": "&gt; Is the $35k car crowd just way more demanding than the $100k car crowd?\n\nIt's more that they can't afford a spare car.  People who have a 3 year lease on a car cannot afford the median 9 month delay on delivery... and that's the delay on the *first* one.  Now imagine that you're number 258,706 in the queue.  What do you do?  The projected delivery date for your Model 3, even if it's on time, would be sometime in Q3 or Q4 2018.  Now add to that a 2-3 quarter delay (Q1 to Q3 2019) and the fact that they're apparently still prioritizing the Model S and X, and you're looking at a scenario where the 3 year lease you signed after putting your deposit down on a Model 3 expires before its delivery (Q2-Q4 2019).   What do you do then?  Sign an extension on the lease?\n\nIn other words, it's not that the $100k car crowd is less demanding, it's that the demand of the $35k crowd is inelastic.",

"comment": "Man...TIL yet again how much more expensive gas is here in CA (more like $2.70 here).\n\nYour numbers are a bit wonky (looks like at least partly just typos).  The 2007 Civic we used for longer trips before generally got more like a max of 34mpg on the highway (it actually still does, but all it's still used for is my wife's short commute until it gets replaced with a Model 3). Our gas is more expensive and our electricity at EV rates is less expensive...so my real world experience isn't matching your idealized numbers.\n\nAnd again: this is leaving out supercharging for free and no longer needing to take 2 vehicles to take 7 people on a long trip, so for those trips you'd need to double the ICE numbers.  So far long trips like this amount to something like 1/4 of my mileage, and of course for any non-Tesla vehicle (possibly including the Bolt) it wouldn't be a practical trip at all.\n\nWith everything taken into account, I'm spending 1/5 of my former gasoline spending on increased electricity costs.",

"comment": "&gt; I am not an enemy of any kind of science. I am only a bit critical when people use the word \"science\" to lend credibility to their otherwise sketchy claims of impending disaster, or their schemes to fix everything.\n\nI find claims of impending disaster at the hands of terrorists to be similarly sketchy and without merit.  I also am skeptical of schemes, like Guantanamo Bay, to contain such threats.  Does this make me an enemy of domestic security policy?  If you are able to empathize, you should see that your subjective opinion about the science you support versus that which you are \"only a bit critical\" about does not necessarily make you an ally of science.\n\n&gt; If someone said, for example, that we should band together to reduce overfishing, for example, because of the obvious data showing that the number of fish in the seas is becoming too low, I'm all in!\n\n\"Overfishing\" is a term that requires quantified measurements and common understanding to have any relevant scientific support.  You claim you would be all in, but you stipulate \"obvious data\" where no standard could possibly be derived.  Every watershed, every river basin, every habitat is its own special snowflake when it comes to factors influencing fish populations.  Adding in that government policy and oversight will favor irrational tradition over science and data in almost every instance, it is no surprise that fear and crises are the historical motivation for change which climate science is attempting to overcome.\n\n&gt; If they want me to help reduce the amount of disposable plastic used, I'm a supporter. Plant trees? Done it! I've helped to plant thousands. Grow oysters in Chesapeak Bay? Yep, I'm doing that right now.\n\n&gt; Hell, I'm even an advocate of electric cars, electric bicycles, telecommuting, and other conservation efforts for clean air and water.\n\nI'm not calling into question whether you have acquitted your life with responsibility and meritorious conduct.  I'm pointing out that you do not understand the fear which possesses and motivates people who support science you disagree with.\n\n&gt; Being skeptical isn't the same thing as fighting against the truth. It's fighting to ensure the truth is what is presented.\n\nAnd I do appreciate a good skeptic.  Your skepticism just is not very convincing in the larger context of ongoing environmental crises that are occurring right now.  Climate science can be an ally to every person that wants to leave this planet in better condition than they found it, even if there are disagreements over data or trends.  As you present it, you seem to rest assured that you will expire before the consequences of skeptics who *are* enemies of science and active champions of unregulated pollution will impact you.\n\nThat is your choice to make.  I will point out that the people who believe the dire predictions of climate science are in ascendance, and your skepticism lends emotional support to those enemies of science.  Without true cooperation and isolation of these enemies of science, government will become more authoritarian and individual ability to make positive choices for the environment will be regulated instead of the pollution itself.",

There aren't actually that many upgrades to the new car, it is really just a face lift/restyle of the old car. Anyway, the cable that came with my car has the Type 1 that plugs into the car, and a Mennekes end that plugs into the charger. No box in between since all the smarts are in the charger itself so it is just a dumb cable. Quite likely that Telsa chargers will not work though since I've heard they generally do check the car they're plugged into. I've seen guys in Australia use a box that converts the Tesla Mennekes to CHAdeMO allowing them to charge at the full 48 amps (about 10kW) so faster than the on board inverter can handle but not as quick as CHAdeMO can go at. Will charge the LEAF in about 2-3 hours though which isn't terrible.",

You don't have to know how to do any repairs, drop shipping ebay'd oparts to your local repair shop is easy and commonplace.  I get the impression you're either one of those people who gets fleeced without knowing better or has never had a car repair bill before.  It's not even as if you'd be choosing Tesla repair over your local repair shop; tesla outsources that shop to do the repair any way if you go right to them, so if they're fleecing you it's your fault for agreeing to it.  I'm sure your Nissan forum is chock full of insanity repair bill stories as well, if you're as willing to look in a mirror as you are to demonstrate your confirmation bias.",

CHAdeMO/CCS is much faster, but in most cases, it is an extra cost when buying and if the battery capacity is lower than 60ish miles, it won't even be an option. CHA/CCS chargers are typically around 40-50 kw/h, and J1772 are around 3-7 kw/h. CHA/CCS have specifications that go up to 150, but those will take awhile to go mainstream and the limiting factor in the majority of cases will be the car battery.

"comment": "Chargepoint stations are INSANELY expensive compared to competing non-networked options. I think the CT40XX series which is their common L2 option these days goes for somewhere in the $6000-8000 USD range, and I believe you have to pay annual subscription fees to keep the station working. Also, I think they take a percentage of the payments from people using the station. All of this can and should be verified with them directly, though.\n\nMake sure your town understands that they will be paying a lot for a networked station, it will probably take years to recover the costs (if they ever do) vs. just offering free charging with a reasonable time limit. Some free L2 stations in my area have a 2-4 hour limit. If you get a ClipperCreek charging station (they're suitable for commercial, high-demand use) for well under $1000, you save a lot upfront.\n\nMy town installed some free L2 charging stations about 4 years ago. They are decently well used but they don't have a constant lineup, they paid for units with support for taking payments and planned to offer free charging for up to a year then set a fee, but they dropped that and just left them free since then. Another town nearby did the same and has had a couple of regulars abuse the stations e.g. plugging in almost 24/7 and staying plugged in long after done charging, they were informed that they would either need to make their usage more reasonable or cease using the stations.\n\nI think any decent councillors should be easily able to understand that offering a couple of free L2 EV charging stations is something they should be offering to residents and visitors for free.",

In order for 100% of even new cars to be electric in 8 years, manufacturers would have to have completely abandoned development of the combustion engine and switched all resources to EVs already. They most certainly have not; not even close. Nor do they show any real sign of doing so any time soon. They are indeed investing in EVs, but they're also busily working on the next generation of combustion engines too.",

This is personal opinion obviously but I own an i3 for over a year now and have driven other EVs (Tesla, and Nissan mostly).\n\nThe i3 is insanely fun to drive, it’s fairly quick and the 2018 is quicker and has more range but aside from its fun is it’s comfort. BMW makes this car feel very high quality. The interior finishes are great and feels good to the touch. It has pedal-less driving /parking tech and a pretty sweet phone app to control a lot of what the car does. If you drive less than 45 miles total per day, imo it’s the best intercity EV you can buy right now. \n\nI haven’t driven the model 3 yet but I have driven the model S and X as well as the Nissan Leaf. The leaf is just as good for the purpose of being a reliable commuter. But imo, the interior feels cheap and there was a lot more road noise than the Bmw. The Tesla’s where amazing vehicles and really the only complaint I could think of was that the fit and finish of the car was off. Trim didn’t lineup and stuff like that. But the Tesla driving experience is amazing. I don’t think anyone currently does it better than Tesla does. \n\nFor two years though, I’d say the i3 would keep you happy, comfortable and loving the EV life. I’m also waiting for the Porsche lineup with my i3 haha. You should test drive an i3 and it’s competitors, have some fun with it! \n\nHope that helped.",

"comment": "From discussions on reddit it only get stationary batteries to be useful for hydrogen, automotive use at best for hauling if at all viable and the hydrogen must come from natural gas which makes the whole thing even more half hearted in actually making an environmental change. \n\nHydrogen produced from excess wind power on site to then be used like that big Tesla battery in Australia is, according to how I've been explained on reddit, on par with li-ion batteries in cost and running. The hydrogen solution would have a slight advantage in the max output effect and potentially have lower investment cost. \n\nWith the pace of development in both areas I still have the most faith in batteries. Also for cars, a little \"fun-ish\" thing is that EV utopia Norway also supports hydrogen cars in the same manner. The sales are abysmal and one of the fuling station companies shut down so we now.  \n\nThe \"market\" for fueling stations around the capital was a whopping 4 stations. Then a competitor came with a 5th (25% increas y'all). So the first company shut down.... the owners now have ONE fueling station. (looks like it's two mow!)",

Lack of public charging is a problem only if you don't have home or workplace charging available. Lack of public charging for trips is a real thing, but it is improving weekly. With common practices, batteries should retain 80% of capacity for 200-300K miles, in other words, the life of the car for most of us.\n\nPro: quiet, powerful, efficient, fuel savings. \n\nCons: For trips, DCFC is a must, and longer range is too. Expect to spend 30-60 minutes per stop on trips for charging, long trips in BEV is a \"Smell the roses\" kind of endeavor.",

"comment": "750 kwh per month in an all electric house is *not especially high*. Remember this is heating season now so if you lived in a \"typical\" house you'd have a gas bill which would include the fuel you used for domestic hot water heating, space heating, clothes drying, cooking.  That gas bill in December might be $75-250/month depending on your home's size and your lifestyle.\n\nAs for the existing solar PV system, you do not mention the system's total capacity or date of install or whether there is any winter time shading that might further reduce the system's generation during the time of year when there's the least solar energy available. \n\nLet's say you have (8) 320 watt modules for a total system capacity of 2.56 kw.  You might generate in the neighborhood of 3,500-4,000 kwh per annum if the system is reasonably well oriented and minimally impacted by shading.  The least amount of that annual generation will be *right now*. (Winter, right.)\n\nYour SCE bill doesn't tell you almost anything about how much electricity your solar generated during Dec.  It only tells you what you exported to them via their meter.  You only export electricity through the SCE meter when your solar generation exceeds how much electricity you are using in your house.  You are using your solar generation *behind* the meter. (2 kwh per day (inverter read) on a sunny winter day is low but you need to tell us system size, date of install, shading and orientation, etc.)\n\nA Sunpower dealer (not Sunpower corporate) likely installed your system and likely is still willing to support you.  You should try to find out who that company is/was.  Sunpower customer service in the Philippines will be a source of great frustration for you and you should spare yourself that pain.  The folks there will be endlessly pleasant and entirely unhelpful.",

Be truthful for once, you said you were leaving and I wish you the best in not coming back to sell what nobody here is buying.  We only deal in reality here and have our fill of dishonest industry trolls already.\n\nPlease, read the facts.  It's undeniable.  VW had to fund EA.  They would be banned from selling cars in the US if they refused to comply, it's a punishment.  I'm sure you're trying to PR spin it into something else, but you know better.  VW told you, wiki told you, literally everything told you including the VW employee in your video.\n\n&gt;I don’t care about diesels\n\nyes, you do.  You talk about them for no reason at all on a board for electric cars where they don't make sense - you're obsessed and even use them to misdirect attention away from your embarrassments.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/vws-2-billion-penalty-for-diesel-scam-builds-ev-charging-network-across-us.html\n\nhttps://media.electrifyamerica.com/en-us/releases/38\n\nhttps://www.electrifyamerica.com/our-team/\n\nMore reality you'll hate!\n\nThree strikes, you're out ✌🏻",

"comment": "For me, a Mach-E owner that has been interested in EV’ssince the GM EV1, it’s not Tesla that annoys me, it’s the Tesla version of “trumpsters”. You know, the people that think the sun rises from Elon’s mouth, and sets in the other end of his digestive system. \n\nClearly, EV enthusiasts owe Tesla, and Elon a debt of gratitude because without his vision, and the proven viability of EV’s proven to the world via Tesla, we would still be 20 years from having the vehicles we have now. But if I never see another video clip of some mental deficient climbing out of the drivers seat of their model 3 to prove that the car does drive itself, it’ll still be too many. And yes, as I say this, I recognize that we are mere weeks from seeing idiots in Mach-E’s doing the same stupid bullshit with BlueCruise., so clearly I don’t believe all the stupidity in this world is bound to Tesla. \n\n\nI sincerely hope every EV driver enjoys their car, and takes a few minutes every week to answer the questions we all get from people that are either skeptical or curious about EV’s.",

A car company taking in thousands of high-profit margin dollars a year on cars sold years ago just isn’t what happens today in the auto business.\n\nThe potential for FSD is one reason Tesla is a trillion-dollar company, roughly 3.5 times the value of Toyota Motor (TM).",

They get away with it because they say it’s in beta. I’m not saying it should be named that or not, but it is just a name.",

"comment": "1.  Chinese brands making EVs stopped making ICE vehicles so all their production is going on making EVs.\nThey also have battery plants on site to ensure constant supplies of  batteries.\n\nThe European brands spent fortunes retooling to make hybrids. They made the same bet the Japanese did. That Tesla would keep making rich people's toys and that most consumers would prefer a stopgap tech like hybrid\n\nThen they got caught on the hop and had to pivot quickly to avoid financial penalties.\n\nAlas battery capacity simply hasn't caught up. So the manufacturers have scrambled to get batteries.\n\nWhy are they using older battery designs?\nBecause they can get them in large quantities because the brands that went heavy on EV have moved on to newer designs.\n\n 2. Price parity.\n Euro brands sell their products through a dealer network.\nDealers got scared that if they had to switch to the majority of their stock being EV they'd lose sales if their customers weren't ready to make that jump.\n\nTo protect that they stuffed small hybrid batteries in cars to exploit a tax loophole and avoid scaring their Dealers.\n\nEVs are being marketed to the same people the Mk 1 Prius was sold to. People with enough money to be able to chose to drive an eco friendly vehicle and flaunt their green credentials.\n\nBecause of the price premium the EVs come stuffed with extras to make them look like a good deal for the consumer.\n\nSure they could shave the price down to more budget friendly price but that would remove the cache of buying them.\n\nIf my neighbour can spend half the price I did for a car that looks the same from the outside why pay the premium.\n\n 3.  Why no technical details?\n Same reason there's barely any tech details on ICE vehicles.\nOnly a small niche of people understand what those stats mean and make their buying decisions because of them.\n\nMost of the car trade wants a vehicle that's cheap to run, cheap to tax, can haul the kids on their summer hols , doesn't cost a mortgage payment to insure and ideally has some trade in value when they decide to get rid of it.\n\nAsk a general member of the public to tell you the difference between a mild hybrid, a hybrid, a plug in hybrid and an Ev and they go boggle eyed.\n\nStart discussing battery technologies, wear rates and charge speeds and they're sprinting for the hills.\n\nIf you ask the mechanics properly certified to work on them, they don't have a clue and they don't care. They just need to know what to do to get paid by the manufacturer for warranty work.\n\n\nI'm rambling now but wanted to throw a few coins in the hat.",

"comment": "As a simple sanity test... \n\nAssume the robot could clean the solar panel amazingly well, giving you a 1% performance boost by running the robot each night. Let's assume you had a 5kW residential job site where all the modules were contiguous, such that the robot could crawl from one module to the next. Let's also assume the robot has similar electrical consumption and cost to a $350 Roomba - 18V @ 3 amp hours. \n\n&gt;5 kw solar array x 1400 kwh / year  / kw x 1% = 70 kwh/yr gain.\n&gt;18V x 3 amp hours x 365 days / 1000 w/kw = 20 kwh/r loss. \n\nSo you gain 50 kwh per year... so far so good right? \n\n&gt;50 kwh x 12 cents per kwh = $6 cost savings.\n&gt;$350 / $6/yr =  ~60 year simple payback.\n\nAssume by the time you hit the market with this, installed solar costs $3/W in the exact same market where you want to install the robot (same production amount, same cost of electricity etc).\n\n&gt;$3/w / 1400 kwh/yr / $0.12/kwh x 1000 w/kw = ~20 year simple payback. \n\nConclusion: buying more efficient solar modules would be a more cost-effective use of the owner's budget than buying the robot.",

"comment": "Part 2:\n\n&gt;I think you also continue to ignore the negative externalities associated with battery production.\n\nI haven't done that at all. I've offered all along that EV production (including the battery) has a cost, but that it's easily overcome by the cost savings during the consumption phase. [Here's a well-respected LCA](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media_IOE/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf) that I don't fully agree with, but that does a decent enough job of demonstrating that.\n\nYou on the other hand *have* completely ignored that there are also negative externalities associated with conventional vehicle production. It's quite disingenuous to keep bringing up the cost of battery production without talking about the costs of those things that the battery replaces. Is producing an engine free, or a transmission? What about the steady stream of motor oil that must be wasted during an ICE vehicle's life, but not an EV's? Similar for belts and spark plugs and various fluids and so on. Even brake pads will last much longer for an EV thanks to regenerative braking. And let's not forget catalytic converters and the platinum they require! You think mining *lithium* is bad? I've yet to see a thorough analysis that accounts for all these costs.\n\n&gt;How much does a battery for an EV weigh, and how much of that is lithium?\n\nThe Nissan Leaf battery, for example, weighs 660 lbs, [9 of which are lithium](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/availability_of_lithium). The more important resources for producing lithium batteries are other metals like cobalt and nickel, but there are many different kinds of batteries that can be used if one type runs into resource constraints.\n\n&gt;I encourage you to read the following article and comment if you like:\n\nI read it. The first half is about how electricity production is dirty in China, which isn't relevant to anything we're discussing here. The second half is about how e-waste is bad, including lithium battery waste. Well sure, that's obvious. At some point expired EV batteries will need to be recycled, and they will be. The article is not a comparative analysis, so I'm not sure what conclusion you're drawing from it.\n\n&gt;Where do you suppose the majority of electricity is coming from today?\n\n70% fossil fuels of course, and of that about 40% coal and 30% NG. But as coal and NG are consumed, we'll simply replace them with nuclear and renewables - that's the beauty of electricity; it's the \"common currency\" of energy.\n\n&gt;The paper cited in the article to which I just linked disagrees.\n\nNo, as I said it's not a comparative analysis, so it makes no such conclusion. The author opines that \"the electric car is no more sustainable than the gasoline or diesel car *in my view*\" but then fails to back that up with any rigor except to say that \"e-waste is bad.\"\n\n&gt;I feel the effects of future global warming attributable to man will simply not be catastrophic. That's why I am in this subreddit.\n\nI understand that, and I hope you're right - although [the people of Kiribati](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-21/kiribati-climate-change-destroys-pacific-island-nation), at least, will disagree with you. That's why I've sought to point out that there are plenty of good reasons to support EVs that have nothing at all to do with global warming.\n\nFor that reason I don't understand the place of some junk article claiming that EVs have a low resale value in this sub. Not to apply a political label to you, but I see it as EVs getting caught in the middle of a mindless conservative vs. liberal hatefest, when in fact many of the reasons I've outlined for supporting EVs should really gain traction from the conservative side.\n\n&gt;Of course one would need to consider the NPV of the solar collectors and EV price premium to see if it is worth while\n\nThat's easily done. In my case the 30-year amortized cost of my rooftop solar and remaining electricity bill with 2 EVs together come out to about $50/month, which replaces what was about a $90 electric bill and $200/month in gas (I drove a hybrid and my wife a small minivan previously.) As far as the EV price premium, that's a little more tricky, but comparing lease payments for a proposed EV vs. an ICE car that you might buy instead works pretty well.\n\n&gt;That latter sentence could spawn a whole new thread in itself\n\nYes, and I think it's quite off-topic. Of course everyone driving around in his own car isn't the greatest idea, but as long as that's the world we're stuck with we can at least try to make those cars better. There's no reason that we can't seek to work on the long term goals of fixing public transportation and re-planning communities at the same time.\n\n&gt;the ethanol mandate comes to mind as a good counterexample. Of course you might have meant scrutiny after the fact.\n\nYes, it's unfortunately true that most scrutiny does come after the fact. With that in mind the ethanol mandate is actually a good example of scrutiny effecting change, as it [looks to be going away soon.](http://thehill.com/blogs/regwatch/energy-environment/192978-bipartisan-push-imperils-ethanol-mandate)\n\n&gt;there is non-trivial power loss in both transmission and distribution as well\n\nIt's [about 7%](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3), so yeah it's something, but it's not as much and most EV critics make it out to be, and not nearly enough to change the conclusion that EVs are more efficient overall.\n\n&gt;There are many areas of demand for light batteries that predate a serious efforts for EVs. Development has been slow.\n\nOnly Tesla uses these commodity cells for their EVs, and they're dramatically changing that market all by themselves. Also their cell costs make up only a small portion of their  battery's ultimate price tag - much of the value in their pack comes from how thousands of those cells are assembled and monitored, which is no small task by any stretch. More on this later.\n\n&gt;For $250k, I will build you a fuel cell car with similar range.\n\nHuh? Why do you bring up the joke that is the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle?\n\nMost of your remaining points are the same as this one:\n\n&gt;That isn't what we are observing. The cost of a battery pack for a car is more than half as much as the sticker price for a new gasoline vehicle. There is little evidence of a decrease in that price.\n\nAny talk of battery cost is wholly speculative at this point, as EVs are still new enough that hardly any batteries have been replaced, and actual information about manufacturers' costs is proprietary. [Here's a good piece of speculation](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084682_what-goes-into-a-tesla-model-s-battery--and-what-it-may-cost) you should read, however, that speaks quite to the contrary of whatever it is that you're observing.\n\nThanks for the discussion, by the way!",

Take the cost of your central power one inverter, buy it again at year 12-15 without the 30% ITC... and boom, your micros have a lower LCOE plus better monitoring and system uptime. Plus you don't have to deal with DC AFCI or combiner boxes.\n\nShade is just one reason of many to consider micros on a residential array. However, a good solar installer can usually deliver a lower install price using quality, traditional components for less upfront $ than a micro-system.",

"comment": "A negative temperature coefficient is a physical property of silicon, be it in a transistor, temperature sensor, LED, or a PV panel, and, my bad, in the above example I should not have been applying -0.4%/⁰C to the cell *voltage*, but to the (0.5V\\*8A=) 4W *power* of the cell.     \n\nI only calculated the difference in (panel) power for that single 65 ⁰C cell, combined with the other 59 cells at 45 ⁰C.     \n\nIf the whole panel heats up from 45 ⁰C to 65 ⁰C, the power would drop with (20 ⁰C \\* -0.4%/⁰C=) 8% of 240W to 221W.      \n\n*Officially, to get that 240W at 45 ⁰C, I should have started with ~260Wp nameplate at 25 ⁰C, the temperature during 'Standard Test Conditions', which would give slightly different results*.    \n\nIf that higher (single cell) temperature is acceptable for your company depends on their QA program.     \nEach panel is 'flashed' to measure its performance, but that takes only a second and it measures the whole panel at 25 ⁰C, a very good cell can compensate for a bad cell without that being noticed.        \n  \nThe problem with a single 'hot' cell is more likely to be in the production of the (p-type-doped) silicon ingot (or whatever you use), or at the place where the (n-type) dopants are added to the wafer, resulting in a cell with lower efficiency.       \n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell#Manufacture):    \n&gt;Polycrystalline silicon wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly p-type-doped. A surface diffusion of n-type dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p–n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.       \n\nIt is a fairly complicated calculation (or maybe they can actually measure it), but QA should be able to produce a paper with \"Acceptable temperature *differences* between cells in a single PV panel\", which should make the life of (field-) engineers a bit easier when they interpret the picture [example](http://www.kitawa.de/images/Photovoltaik-Info/Fehler-Substring01-an-PV-Modulen-beim-Solarpark-Check.jpg).",

"comment": "Keep in mind, Sunpower has a 25 year warranty on the modules, which includes power (but not production), and the inverter should have a 10 year warranty as well. So if any of those components go out in the warranty period, you should be covered. \n\nNow, if they did the math wrong, or didn't account for current or future shading, then a power production guarantee comes into consideration. The company I worked for in Louisiana included in all sales a PPG, with a number of conditions, like monitoring had to be plugged in to verify production, and you needed to keep your trees trimmed and not build new structures that would cause shade and what not.\n\nThe deal they are offering sounds really odd. With Sunpower Panels especially, and depending on the derates used, it is plausible that the first couple of years greatly overproduce. It all depends on what sort of math the company is using. It seems it is in their best interest to under-estimate, so a) they don't have to pay out if it's bad year or they miscalculated something and b) they have a greater chance of you paying them. It really seems odd that they are trying to use the PPG as a way to get money from their customers. I don't like it one bit. \n\nWith that said, solar is science. If given all the variables, it is fairly reasonably accurate to estimate yearly production. Underproducing 10% on an annual basis would be rare. I believe our PPG was at 5%. If you want people to check the company's math, I'm sure there are a number of people, including myself, that could work through the estimate to see if they are being overly conservative or anything. Their PPG seems shady and I'd probably avoid it, going on gut alone.",

"comment": "&gt; Do you know of any people who are doing stuff where the PV part of the setup is far removed from the collector part?\n\nSo PV is just an abbreviation for photovoltaic which only refers to semiconductor solar panels.  Solar concentrator towers which use a heat engine aren't PV.  \n\nHowever, you can have concentrated PV.  In such a setup, a lense or mirror array concentrates light onto a solar panel.  Such a panel can generate more electricity than the same panel without the concentrator.  The downside is that semiconductor efficiency drops with increased temperature.  For silicon, if a panel is at 300C the panel is unable to generate any electricity.  There are other semiconductor materials, but they end up using elements which are much more expensive and they fail to generate at around 400C anyway.  So if you concentrate light onto the panel, you either need more expensive panels, or a cooling system.  Both of those are added cost and complexity.  Your concentrator will also take up space.  Those downsides are enough to generally favor just plopping down more panels rather than trying to concentrate the light onto fewer panels.",

But if you are going the lease route, your best option is a Sunpower lease.  Superior panels and no escalator.  You will save around $50-$75 on average a month.

Your estimate on for a 5 Kwh system is in the ballpark of what a few local solar installers told me, well between 720 and 815 kwh.\n\nI never really looked into wind, we do have a nice breeze for most of the day, but I thought it was too turbulent for a turbine. Plus being in the middle of a suburban area, I worry my neighbors are going to have a few words to say about it and might invoke the CC&amp;Rs.",

Not sure if it works in europe, but you could always choose a similar place up north.\n\nYou could get an off the cuff idea by doing a quick calculation:\n\nPanel Wattage (kW) * # of Panels * Sun Hours/Day Average * # of Days in the Year = (roughly) kWh you will produce in a year.\n\nExample: 10, 300 W solar panels, in a place that gets 3 hours of sun a day. 10 * .300 * 3 * 365 = 3285 kWh/year. \n\nSo that means a 3kW system in optimal conditions (no losses) with 3 sun hours/day over the year average, will produce about 1.095x its nameplate rating.\n\nIf you want the real world number you would need to know lat/long, orientation/pitch, shading, and other system parameters and derates to get it down exactly.",

For example, right now, I run my pool pump, major appliances, and air conditioning only early AM and and at night.  I sell as much of my solar to the utility as possible instead of using it myself.  This type of behavior makes the problem worse for utility, but it benefits me financially.

"comment": "Five parallel strings of 3 in series. Use a combiner box with five 15A breakers in it to combine them, like the Midnite Solar PV6. The charge controller is a little small for the system, but will do if you have  48V battery bank. 255W x 15 = 3825W / 48V = 80A. You run the risk of clipping off 10A during peak performance. But since solar panels are rated at perfect conditions, it will be rare for you to get full output. If you are doing less than a 48V battery bank, you cannot use that charge controller. Here's an [example](https://i.imgur.com/UEHBpyV.jpg) of 4 parallel strings of 2 in series with a combiner box. You would just be doing 3 in series instead, and 5 sets of them.",

Who fucking cares if solar city manufactures the panels or not- they still make money with each sale and install.\n\nIt is a big deal because other car companies are not building them and are so far behind on even making 1 decent electric car or 1 battery plant. Tesla this year alone has plans to announce the next 2-4 gigafactories. \n\nI'll say it again \n\ntesla is currently the world leader in production of electric cars, solar roofs, and solar panels, industrial and residential battery packs, battery production, charging stations- It is also growing in all of those categories exponentially.",

"comment": "I work for a solar company.  It's a wonderful idea to have a small, portable solar array.  However, you are probably not going to save any money with this system.  The reason is that the quality of the components and cost are not going to be where they need to be for that system.  It'd be a lot less expensive to simply run a generator.  I don't work in the sales department anymore, but when I did, we'd run honest cost comparisons for people based on their electric bill rates.  For a larger scale, home system, you determine the price based on pre-incentive cost per watt.  So take the size of the system and divide it into the cost.  For example, a 10kW system is 10,000 watts. If it costs $30,000, that is $3 a watt.  Then finance the system over the duration of the warranty period and you can see how it compares to their current electric bill.  If you have a tiny 300 watt system costing around $2,000, that is more than $6 a watt!  And will that come with a 25 year warranty?  Will those parts actually be built heavy duty enough to last for 25 years of continuous use?  I imagine not.\n\nAs for the idea of using your car like a generator, that could work actually, but keep in mind during an emergency situation, you might not want to be running your car out of gas.  You might also not want to be leaving your car running overnight to power your fridge.  I'd just get a generator if you're worried about power loss.   Or if you want to be goofy and have a tiny solar system, I think they sell tiny kits for $100 at harbor freight.  You can power a light and fan with it.",

"comment": "State REC, is a renewable energy credit. It tends to be transferred at the time of completion. It’s an extra bonus. The person installing the solar in the first place would’ve gotten the SREC. \n\nNow you should be in net metering mode.\n\nIt is important to note, with some SRECs, it is essentially pre-paid revenue for the energy that your home is generating. They may claw some of it back if you don’t provide the energy that you thought you would. They may have already kept about 5% in escrow (which covers admin costs) to see if your system actually produces.  If there is a new tree or building blocking the solar panels since the time they were installed or if when the panels go out you’re very very slow to replace them, you might not generate the energy that those issuing the SREC thought you would. \n\nI would think that you have access to online real time monitoring of energy production, through the inverter company, to make sure you generate what you should and respond when levels dip. Panels lose ~0.5-1% efficiency a year depending on the quality of the panels.\n\nI don’t have all the answers but hopefully that clears up SREC vs. net metering.",

If its bad, then that's something to start asking from your political representatives if you are somewhere that is somewhat reflexive to democratic pressures.\n\nGrowing your own food, as well as maintaining a garden to allow insect and bird life to flourish. Its a small impact, but given how much modern agriculture has done to eradicate insects I think its a worthy effort.\n\nYou're already on the vegan track and seem pretty conscious of your consumption. At some point there's only so much you can do as an individual. At that point, you can become more politically active and and try and get involved or organise actions.\n\nEven as an individual, your resistance will be a powerful example. I think its often overlooked in society, especially when environmentally conscious thinking is largely absent from mass media, how impactful one persons resistance can be. The example you set to those in your community will show that caring for the planet is doable, you'll provide an example against the dominant norms when most others arn't apparent. Socially that makes many likely to consider such actions and ideas when they wouldn't have otherwise.\n\nIf you are wealthy you can get solar panels and become self sufficient energy wise.\nGood luck in your endeavours!",

"comment": "maybe you are right. but i don't think so. I'm not in the business of adjusting someone elses biases. I'm just providing info - leading the horse to water, so to speak.\n\nthe second paper i linked is most interesting to me atm. why is it that 3 terrestrial bodies (Earth, Venus, Titan) - each with very different distances to the sun, and hence large differences in solar radiation influx, all with varying atmospheric make-ups, all have exactly the same temperature at 1Atm? (consider Venus has something like 96% co2, and titan has 94% nitrogen &amp; 5.5% methane, and Earth has 0.04% co2) - Why then at the same atmospheric pressure, do they have the same temperature (within a few fractions of a percent)?\n\nYou can't claim \"greenhouse effect\" and expect anyone to believe it, otherwise we'd see Mars have the same temp, as it's atmosphere is 95% co2 like Venus. However Mars does not have an atmosphere above 10Kpa. hmmmm\n\nIf its the greenhouse effect keeping Venus so hot and not adiabatic auto-compression, why not Mars? Is it all the solar radiation?\n\nBut then why is Mars so cold - almost all radiation it receives reaches the surface, yet almost none reaches Venus surface due to cloud cover?. Not to mention Titan which is so far away that the sun would be just appear a bright star, with solar power to match. hmmmm\n\nThen we have discrepancies in the description of reasons - go look at the wiki page for Mars atmosphere\n\nparagraph1, line 1:\" The **atmosphere of Mars** is the layer of gases surrounding [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars). It is primarily composed of [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) (95.32%) \"\n\nparagraph2, line2\" The weaker [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect) in the Martian atmosphere (5 °C, versus 33 °C on Earth) can be explained by the low abundance of other [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas). \"\n\nOther Greenhouse Gasses? Not just CO2? so which is it? - co2 is NOT the be all and end all greenhouse gas? or is it the water and methane etc?\n\nBut wait =- theres more:\n\nlets go to the Venus wiki page: \"It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4 billion years ago was more like that of the Earth with liquid water on the surface. A [runaway greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_greenhouse_effect) may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas).[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#cite_note-Kasting-7)[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#cite_note-8) \"\n\nOk so they say Venus is so hot due to a runaway greenhouse effect, but then we look at the composition of Venus' atmosphere and see that its above 95% co2, but water vapour is just 20ppm (remember that Earth has co2 at 400ppm, and that is 0.04%). So less water in Venus atmosphere than the amount of CO2 in ours.  Methane doesn't even rate a mention.\n\nSo lets summarise:\n\nVenus had a runaway greenhouse effect with Co2 at 95%, and water vapour at 20ppm (so approx .002%)\n\nMars Doesnt have a runaway greenhouse effect with 96% Co2   and water vapour at .03%\n\nTitan Doesnt have a runaway greenhouse effect with an atmosphere of 94% nitrogen, but 5.6% Methane!\n\nAnd your suggesting Earth does have a greenhouse effect with Co2 at .04%, with water vapour (at surface) of \\~3% (and methane at .0002%)\n\n(edit - remove incorrect statement)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplease write up your paper explaining this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW your comment regarding the paper getting the calcs wrong - the fact you didn't know what a PhD is, isn't adding to your credibility for making 'advanced' calculations: heres a tool you can use to check your work\n\n[https://www.chemicool.com/idealgas.html](https://www.chemicool.com/idealgas.html)",

"comment": "That was production.   My February bill came and I only had to use 68 kwh from the grid, so my electric bill was super cheap!     So far in March I produced 696 kWh and only used 573 kWh, so I'm actually up about 3 full days of energy use.  I'd base that off if we got 3 rainy days in a row, but so far I am super happy, but most important, my wife is estactic that we might not have anymore electric bills with the help of net metering.\n\nThe biggest surprise is that our system was only supposed to offset us by 74%, but so far this year it has been about 90%, and the year just started.  This will be my first full year of taking advantage of the early months producing more power, and hopefully offset our electric bill 100%  9/10 out of 12 months of the year.   I unfortunately still have a $16 connect fee to the grid, but I'm okay with that so long as we can offset the majority of the months.\n\nI'm still going to upgrade my 17 year old AC, which will definitely help.  I will also be insulating the attic more, so my goal is 100% off the grid all year long.   I know I'll be spending some money to do that, but the new AC and insulation has already been in the works.",

"comment": "I've got two EVs, a 7.2KW array, and three Tesla Powerwalls.\n\nMy rate plan has three different prices during the day -- Off Peak ($0.16/kWH), Partial Peak ($0.32/kWH), Peak ($0.48/kWH).\n\nThe EVs charge during Off Peak. I'm off the grid, running on batteries during Partial Peak and Peak.\n\nDepending on EV usage and how successful we are at shifting other loads (laundry, ovens) to Off Peak, we use 1/4 -- 1/2 of the battery power every day.\n\nAll of that adds up reducing the bill $3.00 -- $10.00 per day.\n\nI'm OK with all this. We have batteries because our utility cuts our power at random intervals during 'Fire Season' -- a season that's getting longer and longer every year. And we live in a location that has local outages due to high winds and old infrastructure.\n\nSome day PG&amp;E may stop cutting our power but for now, we look at the batteries as a necessity and any savings as a way of reducing the total cost of ownership.",

"comment": "I had Tesla panels installed, without powerwalls, about this time last year. They were dramatically cheaper than the 2 other quotes I received. So far so good, although don’t expect much from their customer service during the buying process. My initial advisor left before the install and I was assigned to someone else. I communicated mostly through email, which had about a 24hr turnaround time. Don’t expect much when it comes to details about your project, they are very vague if you want specifics on your setup. The local installers (DC area) were absolutely fantastic, and did a tidy install. The lead installer was probably the most helpful Tesla employee throughout the process, I was able to ask him any question I had. \n\nBottom line: if you have patience, and don’t mind “you get what you pay for” customer service, Tesla is hard to beat on price.",

It’s certainly unsolicited. \n\nAnd no, “solar powered” EV’s aren’t going to make a dent in the EV-space as a whole. \n\nThe sun puts out about 700W/m^(2).\n\nA very efficient EV can average 110Wh/km. \n\nIf that’s at 60kph you’re looking at a consumption of 6.6kW (ie. in 60 minutes you would consume 6.6kWh. \n\nEven if managed to get 6m^(2) (that’s 3x2 meters) of 100% efficient solar panels on a highly efficient car you’d still only produce about 4.2 kW of continuous energy. \n\nHowever. Solar panels aren’t 100% efficient. The best ones, in the lab, are 47.1% efficient. \n\nSo that’s less than 2.1kW of continuous energy. If you wanted to go anywhere on that you’d need your consumption to be 35Wh/km. That’s about 1/8th of what an Audi e-tron consumes. \n\nFor an EV to be this efficient it would have to be tiny and light. And thus, unable to fit 6m^(2) of solar panels. \n\nAnd we haven’t even touched on issues like realistic solar panel sizes, efficient size (the sun doesn’t shine from all angles), or when the sun doesn’t shine. \n\nYou can put solar panels on a car. You can use them to run the air condition/fan, or otherwise reduce consumption or just recoup energy slowly if parked in the sun. \n\nBut it’s completely unviable for them to efficiently power a car. \n\nBest of luck with your continued spamming effort.",

"comment": "What power company? What do they give you?\n\nIn general, if you have no net metering, you'd size you array for slightly more than your average daytime consumption (and have 50-80% offset), this would effectively prevent you from exporting and would make it cost effective as long as the array isn't crazy small (so if an 8kW array is a 70% offset, it's probably worth it). The exact numbers depend on how sunny it is and what's your electric rates.\n\nIf you want 100%+ offset you'll need batteries, and it will only be cost effective in areas with higher electric rates.",

In practice, your system could produce more then 3.2kw, for a few days a year, and only for a few hours in those days. \n\nUndersized ac side for as much as you have, should not drop by more than 1% in comparison with a 1:1 dc:ac system.\n\nDo some research on overpaneling and dc to ac ratio on solar panels, to make sure you understand what me and others are trying to explain in a short paragraph",

I was a leader in my city and first person to install solar in 2000 but it ran its life and was old tech by todays standards. Since I was renewing my roof, I decided to upgrade to REC which is one of the Top Premium Leaders Internationally in solar panels based out of Singapore. My old panels depleted by almost 1% per year. REC is guaranteed not to deplete more than 1/4% per year. Here is an Expert Review comparing to another Premium company. https://youtu.be/_66O62smOzU",

"comment": "You're criticizing nuclear waste with a lie so I am criticizing waste from solar panels and wind turbines with facts.  An enormous quantity and variety of materials are needed to produce them and they produce wastes well beyond some aluminum and lead compounds.  The processes that refine rare earth materials are simply nasty and produce a lot of toxic byproducts that you wouldn't want to be exposed to.  \n\nThe quantity of spent fuel and reactor components are small enough that it is completely manageable to store them over a kilometer underground in geologically stable bedrock.  The same isn't true for old solar panels and wind turbine blades.  I'm not sure about Europe's numbers but in the US all of the spent fuel would fit on less than 16 hectares when stored in shielded dry storage casks with room for equipment to access them as needed.  A little bit more would be needed for some old reactor components like old pumps, filters, etc. which won't match the quantity of spent fuel.  The rest is trivial like some old gloves or even pieces of paper that were only in offices and never even entered a reactor building.  The regulations that nuclear power faces are truly ridiculous and unreasonable. \n\nAlso, wind turbines do kill birds and bats.  They have a higher death toll per TWh generated than nuclear power including the Chernobyl accident.  Meanwhile nuclear power from pressurized water reactors, boiling water reactors and CANDU reactors have an unmatched safety record.  \n\nAs for Chernobyl, the real death toll from it was about 30 people from the accident and cleanup and about 15 more from later cancers that can be clearly linked to that accident.  The response was also very poorly done which lead to most of the deaths.  The main thing to do to prevent another Chernobyl accident is to not use RBMK reactors and not do stupid experiments with them.  The graphite moderator made it so that fission continued after the water had been boiled off, something that is impossible when water is the moderator. \n\nThere is some garbage about thousands of people dying from it which is based on the garbage linear no threshold hypothesis.  If that were true then people living at high altitudes would be dying from cancer at disastrous rates but people in places like Denver and Switzerland are not.  \n\nThe exclusion zone has also become Europe's greatest wildlife preserve due to the lack of human presence there.  European bears, boars, elk, and more thrive there while struggling in the rest of Europe. \n\nIn the Ukraine war Russia does things like bomb power plants' office buildings to spread fear of nuclear power.  It's because they want to keep their customers burning gas and want to get their European customers back after the war ends.  \n\nNuclear power plants could be built in about 5 years and they used to be built in that time frame. \n\nNuclear power could also be used to remove over a trillion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere and sequester it in aquifers underground.",

Unless you drive a lot each day, you can probably get by with level 1 (120V) charging.  I can hop onto a nearby fast charger if my battery charge low and I need to quickly replete it.  Check out this article if you are skeptical.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/business/autos/electric-car-charging-at-home-level-1-7a658eb9?st=5mykmro5fug69uu&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n\nOn the other hand, a reason for waiting a year is that several 2025 EVs will come equipped with bidirectional charging capability.  This functionality allows you to use your EV battery for vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid charging.  The latter can be cost saving in areas that have virtual power plants or distributed energy resource programs.  An EV battery holds far more charge than a typical home stationary battery.",

"comment": "While economic arguments hold a lot of weight, they’re not necessarily the whole debate.\n\nFor starters, it’s unarguable that modern nuclear plants are the most disaster resistant power sources. Built to withstand missile strikes, plane crashes, hurricanes and more, nuclear plants are designed to shrug off otherwise highly destructive events. Solar panels and wind turbines are just not built to the same standard.\n\nSecond, it’s a tired argument, but firmly relevant, nuclear is a firm source of energy. There’s no worries posed by building enough battery capacity, or significant transmission infrastructure, both of which pose power losses via energy changes.\n\nThird, per energy unit, nuclear takes up very little space. While solar partially solves this problem by posing the hypothetical of covering most rooftops with panels, and agrovoltaics (how do you get large, bulky farming equipment between the panel rows, and is this tech limited to the small pool of crops that prefer shade?) many wind and solar plants cover significant portions of land. The issue is these swaths of land would be habitats, regardless of where they are.\n\nFourth and finally, nuclear plants take much less resources per unit energy to build. In a finite world with a sand shortage on the horizon, and scars from serious mining, the less resources required to build infrastructure, the better.\n\nI posit that these arguments solidify the need to build as much nuclear power as reasonably feasible with solar and wind being rolled out in the meantime. Therefore, as reactors finish construction, the peaker plants used to supplement solar and wind can be discontinued, and much less battery capacity would need to be built",

And if the animals were being treated humanely, had a decent life and even killed painlessly without knowing, it would still be wrong. I'm pretty sure the animal would rather be alive and I don't feel I have any right to decide what can and what wont live.\nRecipies, hmmmm buy/make some honeycomb (theres no honey in it so it's vegan, cinder toffee in America?). Dip it in some molten dark (milk free) chocolate, leave to cool and enjoy your vegan crunchies! \n\nEdit - thats more of a desert/snack than a meal! Umm, I love falafel in pitta bread with some salad of your preference (I go for a little lettuce, red onion, a bit of sweetcorn and crushed cherry tomatoes) a layer of vegan mayo and some homemade guacamole (store bought usually isn't vegan and not half as nice!). For the guacamole squish some ripe avacado then mix in plenty of garlic, squeeze in some lemon then season. This is great in the summer.",

"comment": "[Vegan Lunch Box](http://veganlunchbox.blogspot.com/) has great ideas for kid-friendly food and deals with talking with kids about veganism. I'm pretty sure that dad is an omni so the kid was able to make up his own mind about how he wanted to eat.\n\n[Dreena Burton](http://vivelevegan.blogspot.com/) also has three kids and has written a couple vegan cookbooks. I have Vive Le vegan and it has notes about what is kid friendly and a section at the back about feeling young children.\n\nI'd say that one important aspect is not going too crazy with it at the beginning. Veganism is not always exclusively health food; it can also be faux chicken nuggets, fries, ketchup and oreos for dessert.\n\nFor other speciality foods, I often order from [Vegan Essentials](http://www.veganessentials.com) This is for things I can't find in my local health food stores, like vegan marshmallows.\n\nI don't have kids yet, so I can't give much advice on how to talk to them, but I know there are some animal rights books that make the issues kid-friendly. A basic, 'we love animals and so have decided not to eat them anymore' should be a good start though. \n\nThe only thing I would struggle with is how much to enforce it out of the house. At 6 years old there are probably kids bringing cupcakes and cookies to school for their birthdays and holidays and it would be really hard to tell the kid she isn't allowed to have these treats anymore.\n\nEDIT: my computer autocorrected \"oreos\" to \"ores\"",

Watch that speech by Gary yourofsky that I linked. He goes over a lot of the health benefits. \n\nThe god thing I brought up is supposed to prove to you that you want to be vegan. When you phrase a problem in that way, you can get a good idea of what you actually want. I didn't mean anything more than that. \n\nAs far as the mental health thing, but I'm not saying you are unhealthy, and I'm saying that living every day disappointed in yourself is destructive and unhealthy, and leads to stress and self loathing. It's a simple issue. If I cheat on my girlfriend and spend everyday feeling terrible, it's going to eat away at me and be a negative factor on my health. \n\nI'm not diagnosing, I'm pointing out that you shouldn't live a life style that makes you feel guilty and disappointed.",

"comment": "It's less of an instinct to kill animals but more of a lack of instinct to kill animals when it's not your only option for survival. You live in a world where you won't die if you don't eat meat because vegan diets are much more practical than they ever were.\n\nWe started eating animals in the first place because it was much easier to kill an animal for all of its proteins and well balanced nutrients that kept it alive, than to obtain these things from simple sources like grains and plants. Like most animals, our instinct to survive led us to discover one way to obtain the nourishment our bodies needed. As modern alternative diets like veganism, gluten-free, etc. prove, this was not the only way to eat to survive, but it was the first we figured out, as well as the simplest and most efficient.\n\nWhen you see a cow or a pig, does your stomach growl? Imagine you're a neanderthal dwelling the plains of Africa in prehistoric times. Your family has figured out eating animals keeps you alive. It's unlikely you have figured out you can obtain the same nutrients from other sources that vegans now eat, but even if you did, killing the animal is much easier. If you kill a gazelle, you eat for a week, and if you don't kill anything you die. The fruits and beans your people may have gathered won't sustain your tribe without the meat, and your gatherers don't yet know how to farm efficiently (or at all for that matter).\n\nFast forward to any other point before this century and odds are you have the same mindset as the neanderthal or you live in a society where the meat industry (or killing your own meat) is much simpler, efficient, and well-known of a process than eating a vegan diet.\n\nThe modern human (as compared to our evolutionary ancestors) has a much less explicit instinct to eat a living thing. Though that instinct may still exist, very subtly, we salivate over packaged meats, plates of bacon, ice cream, etc. (replace these examples with vegan options to your heart's content) rather than a living, breathing animal.",

Getting sick and getting other people sick is \"less vegan\" IMO than getting a shot that was tested on animals or contains animal by products.\nI don't plan on having kids but if it happens you bet they will be vaccinated.

Done properly, being vegan is better for your health, more diverse in flavours and textures, kinder on the environment, and, you know, doesn't involve the whole murder and torture thing. I think society have come to view meat as masculine. BBQs, big steaks, a disdain for vegetables are, cultural stereotypes of masculinity. Probably something to do with hunting and cooking with fire. I dunno. But I say screw the stereotypes! Real men care about their health. Real men care about the future. And, as you say, real men have empathy and love. Well, that's my personal take.",

But you raise a good point - a lot of the issues surrounding a planet-wide shift to veganism seem to point to mass culling of meat animals as a solution. Without a financial incentive to retain and care for livestock there's little reason for people to continue rearing them - besides compassion, which isn't exactly prevalent within the meat, egg and dairy industries. Are there any other options besides genocide (for lack of a better term) with regards to the leftover animals?",

People reliant on food banks (1 in 50 households in my country) who have little choice in what they get. People who have to work 2 or 3 jobs who simply do not have time to cook from scratch and are limited in what can be cooked easily.\n\nAll I would ever ask someone is to do the best they can and make the best of the choices that are available to them. Implying it’s simple and easy in all circumstances to “just” not eat animal products is kind of insulting to a lot of people. It’s great that you and I have the privilege of that choice and we have a responsibility to use that privilege to choose the path of least suffering. Someone without that choice should not be shamed by us for having to do what they need to do to survive.\n\nAs someone who has been in a position of being the minority shamed for needing to do something environmentally unfriendly, let me tel you that people declaring how easy and simple it is to “just” give up X prove the point of those who think veganism/environmentalism etc is just elitist and for the privileged only.\n\nSupport people who find it difficult, or accept that your attitude puts people off even trying.",

"comment": "Here’s a tip from someone who is a vegan but was once an orthorexic “plant-based” dieter: don’t track macros. Focus instead on what you need to do for the animals. I was so drained with the health aspect and thinking I needed to track macros and micros and would only eat the “purest” plant based diet, and when you connect with the idea of veganism being a social justice issue and not a diet, it becomes a lot less taxing.\n\nAnother thing: veganism is only as restrictive as you make it. I personally don’t worry about eating Whole Foods only. If I want to eat a beyond burger, and I have the money to do so, I do. If I want a pop every once in a while, I drink one. I’m at a healthy weight and exercise when I can, but I was once severely underweight because I focused on being so healthy. I find a “healthy” vegan diet to be mentally taxing now that I’ve gotten over my orthorexia. \n\nHonestly, I think a lot of healthy vegans are gonna get on me for this, but I’ll let them. I find it too exhausting  to live in fear of disease from my food, and instead healthy to be in the present and enjoy what’s in front of you. \n\nI’m not sure if this is you or not, but I remember I was afraid of bingeing if I stopped counting macros and calories. And maybe I ate more than I normally did once I gave that up, but my body needed to heal from being 20lbs underweight. Your body knows what it needs. Trust it. Eat until you’re full, no more, no less. Don’t worry about when you eat your meals (who cares if you’re eating at 2am, it’s the same food with the same properties), and don’t worry if your food isn’t “breakfast food” at breakfast time or “dinner food” at dinner time. \n\nAnd most importantly: connect with animals. Volunteer at a sanctuary, go to a vigil, follow animal rights organizations on social media, go to a local vegan restaurant (or not so local, I’ve driven a long ass ways and crossed country borders to get to vegan restaurants lmao) and talk to people who are there. Connect with people who care about animals. I found a sense of purpose that way. \n\nAnyways, these are just a few of my suggestions, and obviously take a B12 vitamin too. Don’t be afraid of your food, eat what you want as long as no animals are harmed! 😊",

That often doesn’t look the same for each of us, but we give grace where needed.\n\nIf your significant other can’t see past something you choose to do for a moral belief, they don’t deserve you.

OK - thank you for the links and the clarification!\n\nThat being said, they really do use it in tons of processed foods, so while lumping it in the human consumption category makes sense, it feels kind of dirty to mix it in with things like soy milk, tempeh, and tofu (ie. the things that are most commonly consumed by vegetarians and vegans). But that's just my opinion.\n\nEDIT: If anything, I think it should be in it's own category if it's as high as 13%.",

Might not be effective for everyone, but the horrifying reality of animal exploitation in the form of images and sounds is what made me realize they deserve rights and moral consideration. When you're deeply indoctrinated in carnism, it can be hard to access your compassion and empathy towards non-humans.",

Do you avoid meat and dairy because you get stomach ache when consuming it (like OP) or because you don't want to harm animals? \nAnd do you *want* to  work in this kitchen (as implied by OP) or are you forced by circumstance? \n\n\nVeganism is a distinct philosophy which OP doesn't quite fit into at this stage (although seems too he heading that way which is cool). If you're similarly health driven and actively wish to do this form of kitchen work then you are also plant-based. If you're driven by next t causing harm though animals and would get another job if it were viable then your circumstance isn't comparable and to don't need the feel defensive about the distinction between someone else's motives being plant-based or vegan",

Also if you give dogs and cats a choice between meaty pet food and vegan pet food, they will always choose the meat.  You can buy vegan pet food, but you’re still doing it against your pet’s wishes.\n\nIt’s impossible to be a dogmatic vegan and keep pets.  You have to realize that keeping an animal may be the lesser of two evils, but it’s still a compromise.\n\nReality is we do the best we can to minimize suffering.  And even if the best possible result is 99.9% (you’ll always have the 0.1% of window bugs) we should strive for that.\n\nIt’s the same as Christians. How often do they covet their neighbour’s wives or take the Lord’s name in vain?  The point is to do the best you can, and be aware and repent when you fall short.",

"comment": "\"Humans derive about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to drop to just 5% to feed the extra 2 billion people expected to be alive by 2050\" Of course it would be a stretch to educate people to the fact that most illness is caused by too much protein- and that protein deficiency is almost impossible to attain. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger in his Bodybuilding Encyclopedia states that there should be no more than 10% protein in your diet, even for bodybuilders. Unless you go to a completely vegetarian diet can you get to levels that low.",

No. Does a whole food plant based diet minimize the symptoms or cure a lot of things? Shockingly yes. One of my favorite stats is a study that got 20 year diabetics off insulin in 2 weeks, and I've seen the same effect in my own patients\n\nAlso the forks over knives \"extended interviews\" is on Netflix and great. The new documentary \"eating you alive\" is also great and not online yet. \"Plantpure nations\" has a stupid name I think, but is a good documentary too.",

"comment": "After becoming a vegan, I kept wearing my old leather shoes until their soles wore out. I still wear my leather belt and my wool clothes. Why? Well I bought them before becoming vegan, so why would I get rid of them if they are still in good enough shape to keep using them? If I did, the suffering of the cows that were abused and killed to make these items would be in vain. At least I give them a purpose. Also, I need shoes and clothes anyway, so I would have to buy new one, which would produce more pollution and GHGs for no reason...\n\nYou may not like it, but the cow(s) that died to make your shoes are already dead and already suffered whether or not your wear them. You should, as I do, wear them everyday to remind you why you are vegan. That being said, if you really feel to bad to wear them, you should definitely give them to someone in need. Don't sell them, cause then you would profit from the suffering and death of an animal.",
