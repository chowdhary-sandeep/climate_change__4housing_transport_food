Its history of marketing. The government gives them incentives to produce these kinds of clean cars in the form of tax breaks-- so they do it, just to say they do it.  If they REALLY wanted to revolutionize electric cars they could.  Yes, PEOPLE want electric cars so of course they are going to sell them. But the majority of the market for BMW wont buy a stupid looking car, and they know it.  I am not saying that they are all evil- thats your own bias reading into my statements.  I am saying that history has shown that major car companies have no interest in changing the status quo.  You should watch a documentary called \"Who killed the electric car.\" In it, they interview executives from GM who explain how they were instructed to make the EV1 for example, but, to make it not desirable on purpose.  \n\nI am not sitting with a tin foil hat- I understand how marketing and business work.  They are rolling in profit and they do wish to do anything to change that.  They want the tax breaks and advertising rights to say they have an electric alternative, but they would much rather sell you a 3 series.\n\nWhen I bought my Volt. I had to first go to three dealerships to find one that was charged.

I was like, \"shut up and take my money,\" and they tried multiple times to sell me something else.  Now, why is this? Well, mostly because it requires almost no servicing, and dealerships make more money servicing cars then selling them.  In addition, every car on the lot had 0% financing for 4 years. Except for the Volt- GM offered no specials on that.  They go out of there way to make it harder to sell, because they dont want to.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.08034888158241908,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10133423733116485,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1422040152090066,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07954559129115202,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27566139592909167,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32033087064822513,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09458304638974369,"ev_1":-0.1692782291963585,"ev_2":-0.12189764487501677,"ev_3":-0.12287032592344986,"ev_4":-0.1658105695724062,"ev_5":-0.32893153637026745,"ev_6":-0.22098327757283678},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

Signing up the NEM account isn't really a choice. It's just how these things work. Your installer will manage most of it for you.  Make sure that the name on your SCE account is *exactly* the same as the name on your solar contract and your home's deed. If your name is Jonathon, don't write it as John. If you have a mismatch, get it corrected now.\n\nAgain, your installer will handle most of this for you, but when you get Permission To Operate (PTO) from SCE, then you start getting full retail credit at your current tier (assuming you are on the tiered plan) when your meter spins backwards during the day. Your credit/balance moves forward every month. This is because most people generate more than they need in cooler months and less than they need when the AC is being used. So NEM allows you design your system that reflects your annual usage. With NEM you no longer care about what you produce in a day or in a month. In fact, you stop getting a normal bill every month. You will be billed about $1.80 for some taxes and small fees every month. \n\nAt the end of your 12 month period, you have to reconcile your account. If you have a balance, you will be expected to pay in full. Be careful and watch your account because you could be hit with a large bill. If you have a credit, then they re-calculate the balance (the exact formula is complicated), but it's basically giving you wholesale price back. You will have the option to get a check or to apply the balance for next year.\n\nThis is important. It doesn't really make sense to over-produce. The law is designed to encourage PV systems that offset your usage. It is not designed for everyone to set up little power companies on their roof.\n\nSCE has lots of NEM info on their website: https://www.sce.com/wps/portal/home/residential/generating-your-own-power/net-energy-metering/!ut/p/b0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOINLdwdPTyDDTwtnIxdDTydDPz9HIMcDbxdjPQLsh0VAYO8KfY!/?from=/customergeneration/nem-ab920.htm\n\nAlso, when you get the electric car, we have access to super-low electric car rates.

Most people can’t afford a Tesla, and the model 3 is still barely rolling out.

I don’t want to have to own two cars, or have to rent cars just so I can take a road trip. Nor do I want to be sitting at a charging station for a couple hours just to make it to my destination when I could fill up a plug in hybrid in less than 10 minutes and be on my way.\n\nI would *love* to go 100% EV, but I’ve yet to find an affordable car that wouldn’t give me range anxiety on a long road trip in my state. Until then, a plug in hybrid with 40-50 miles EV range (Chevy Volt/Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid) is perfect for a daily commute and then having the flexibility of using a hybrid drive for longer trips (and not needing a second car too) is much easier to live with than a BEV here.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.24732201558248523,"1.1.1_stance":-0.006276951779519939,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17810902402057416,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2453084883737397,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23223267374081327,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06672847216092277,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2722562959247795,"ev_1":-0.15477952781449153,"ev_2":-0.23856618519587672,"ev_3":-0.18569385476425446,"ev_4":-0.17466918896013794,"ev_5":-0.05643595151680832,"ev_6":-0.11164182727422699},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I and an installer put a 2.6 kW system in on my own house last year for .$7,800, and collected 55% in rebate and tax credit.  Wow!  I put in a similar system on a neighbor's house 5 years ago, and the completed price was $27,500!  So take the advice posted by kludgefactory, and get in while the getting is good.  \n\nIt is very unlikely you will zero out your ANNUAL sum for electric bill.  Of course, for some particular day or month, you may.  \n\nNet metering in Illinois is like it is in most states:  If you do by golly generate more than you use by the end of your billing year, the surplus will apply to the following billing period or year.  But after another year, any surplus from that then previous year disappears.  \n\nYou should also look at signing on for RRTP (residential real time pricing) with ComEd.  I did so 5 years ago, and have saved about 20% on my costs without making much of any adjustment to my energy use.  ComEd would not allow combining both the Net Metering agreement and RRTP for several years, but they do now.  \n\nAlso, the Illinois rebate for PV (25%), though it is open for new applicants at the moment, is fickle.  It may close soon, and will stay closed until more money accrues in time.  Your contractor should be able to coach you on timing, etc., in this regard.  \n\nLastly, there is no selling of your REC available to individual homeowners in Illinois at this time, but keep an eye on the ISEA program for aggregating REC's.  In the past, they were the only authorized agent in Illinois to pay you for your RECs, and they may be able to start doing so again, or direct you on how to do it.  Last time they were able to payout, they paid about $200 per Megawatt-hour.  Your 2.2 mW system is likely to be able to produce between 3 and 4 mWh/per year, which once had value of $600 to $800 free income/year.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.22091840598217516,"1.1.1_stance":-0.31531049806824957,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.06777209881596491,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23970193289325178,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19074026586273202,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2418851886564617,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2089943718006942,"solar_1":-0.2126266954974817,"solar_2":-0.2258428492429867,"solar_3":-0.02583969618475142,"solar_4":-0.14065979323858607,"solar_5":-0.1268932293120694,"solar_6":-0.07372959039639682,"solar_7":-0.1808491949090012,"solar_8":-0.13931904894222194,"solar_9":-0.035398987338801646,"solar_10":-0.16325894189746273},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Most commercial buildings are leased to tenants.  Building owner can't increase rent enough to recover the cost to install solar.  Also difficult for building owner to plan for the future since tenants come and go so the electricity needs change.  Tenant has little incentive to install solar because they don't own the building.  In other words, too many unknowns.\n\nUltimately, the future of solar is with large scale projects on vacant land because utility company can buy the electricity for 3 cents/kwh instead of paying rooftop solar owners full retail rate through net metering.  As more utility scale solar projects get installed, the more the utility companies will dismantle net metering programs.

If you're getting voltage in the 12-15 volt range, then your PV panels are wired for a 12-volt supply - that's kind of supported by the charge controller being rated at 12 volts - but it's good to be certain. By the way, that controller is rated at 12V 30 **AMPS**, not 30 watts. 12V x 30 amps = 360 watts\n\n3 panels would then be rated at up to 120 watts each - any more and the charge controller will just \"lose\" the extra. It won't pass more current than it's rated for.\n\nYou mentioned 11.2 on the controller - that's probably 11.2 amps, which is OK, but you'd need to know whether that was full sun midday, mid-morning or afternoon, rainy, cloudy, whatever. Solar PV produces maximum power when perpendicular to unobstructed sunlight (hence taking your readings at midday on a sunny day). Clouds, rain, heavy overcast will all reduce output. I can get as little as 10% of rated power on a rainy day, even down to zero in heavy overcast or fog.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002547928233980201,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09516576273849608,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1603714164713111,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16794314127022456,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.33275915705071385,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1329173776099406,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08775792688053723,"solar_1":-0.044631391128253504,"solar_2":-0.025123827070274274,"solar_3":-0.010745601030672939,"solar_4":-0.0444104621092265,"solar_5":-0.03538912202895972,"solar_6":-0.021807141033301985,"solar_7":-0.011795237907790579,"solar_8":-0.002939732406048279,"solar_9":-0.2167936888745485,"solar_10":-0.23598112852295328},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Therefore, flexible sources such as renewable energies must be regulated. One more point for shutting down nuclear power.\n\nTo prevent this, we should have started earlier to store the surplus electricity, be it in the form of pumped storage power plants, battery storage or hydrogen production, which is then mixed with natural gas to be converted into heat in houses with gas boilers or stored to be used later in the form of heat and electricity in a combined heat and power plant. But here in Germany we have missed out on that and now we have the problem with Russia.

China has become the largest producer of both silicon feedstock and PV modules and is expected to continue increasing its share of production (Navigant Consulting 2009; RTS Corporation 2009). Chinese electricity is highly dependent on coal, and therefore is GHG intensive (Di et al. 2007). At the same time, Chinese manufacturing companies may also install PV to supply part of the electricity needed for manufacturing, thereby decreasing the facility's GHG emissions. One study estimated that substitution of PV electricity for grid electricity in manufacturing multicrystalline modules could decrease GHG emissions by almost 70% (Pacca et al. 2007).\n\nAs more renewable energy, including solar power, is added to a given region's grid, the carbon intensity of solar PV component manufacturing decreases.\n\nOther processes associated with solar PV component production are still carbon intensive though, like acquiring raw materials. This can be addressed by the electrification of mining and further reductions in grid carbon intensity.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002277386069181375,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11996354441766925,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16076446530604813,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20174667860070863,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19234721713930802,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14069774769824556,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.036412367170366146,"solar_1":-0.09375643561846421,"solar_2":-0.1553613999485431,"solar_3":-0.17595492157104062,"solar_4":-0.1875443854708768,"solar_5":-0.16026100542920635,"solar_6":-0.014547325485182228,"solar_7":-0.003317714758547178,"solar_8":-0.005520071639087594,"solar_9":-0.07696839163236291,"solar_10":-0.1971145177379425},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

That means they are saying the system will generate 2000 kWh annually per 1 kW of system size. 2000 is not possible. I just used it to make my math easy. It depends on where you are in the country. In north Texas, on a perfectly positioned south slope at the perfect angel, with no shade a realistic number is 1500 kWh/kW of system.

Is the battery charging added to, or subtracted from the consumption. Makes sense if it would be subtracted from overall consumption while charging, if not it could be a “double draw” calculation for charging the battery and then using the battery later. \n\nI have a 3400 sqft single story house located in sunny Orlando FL. The house was built in 1965. Solar system is 30kw and consists of 80 LG Neon2 panels w/ Enphase IQ7+ micro inverters. This system is strictly net metering and I don’t have a backup battery to run off of during the night/ no sun times. \n\nFor the month of May 2023 my production was 3,875 kWh (average of 125 kWh per day) and my consumption was 2,521 kWh (average 81 kWh per day). Energy cost is about $0.07/ kWh resulting in a bill credit of 1,354 kWh equal to $96.18. \n\nFor the year 2022 (rough numbers) my production was 36,700 kWh and consumption was 32,100 kWh. Total credits were 4,600 kWh = $322. I did not pay a single penny to the power company all year. \n\nI decided to go the net metering route as I couldn’t fully see the cost/ benefit to adding a battery (or 3 in my case) to my system. When I had the system installed the battery option was a Tesla Power Wall priced at $14,000 each and I would need at least 2 to get through sunset to sunrise!\n\nI have 2 large A/C units, 5 ton 20 SEER & 2.5 ton 13 SEER. Temperature is set at a constant 74 degrees. I have a large server rack that consumes about 20 kWh per day. Constant load draw for the house without A/C running is between 1.5 & 2 kw (server rack and everything else in the house). \n\nI’ve done every imaginable “energy saving” upgrade possible short of new A/Cs.

I became vegetarian because I didn't want to contribute to the slaughter of animals.  Dairy cows are killed after their milk production slows down, and their calves are taken from them and, if male, used for veal.  So I couldn't justify avoiding meat but drinking milk.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back to drinking milk under any circumstances just because when I gave up dairy my persistent acne miraculously disappeared.  Also, I like almond milk better and dairy makes me sick if I eat it now after a couple years of avoiding it. Honestly I see cow milk as something for baby cows, not grown humans.  Every other mammal is weaned as it grows up. So I personally wouldn't want to go back to milk.\n\nHowever, from an ethical standpoint, I would view drinking milk as ethical only if the dairy cows and their calves were allowed to live out their lives in full, and the calves were not separated from the mother.  Which of course isn't going to happen because the whole point is to take the milk that the calves should be drinking.  But if hypothetically they could let the calves nurse and still take some milk, without using growth hormones to make the cow produce more milk, then I'd be okay with it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003033187434292965,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18224822018451317,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22180171215426667,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17830792783449093,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34009504645102523,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14728282339053594,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11055416365464528,"diet_1":-0.028080929981418496,"diet_2":-0.2682135336447556,"diet_3":-0.01926886276184329,"diet_4":-0.2161804437249278,"diet_5":-0.18449545380522991,"diet_6":-0.1565959565782927,"diet_8":-0.003621168745060762,"diet_9":-0.001382927725596043,"diet_10":-0.01521094114529357,"diet_11":-0.0006721778336213902,"diet_13":-0.006574596461481026,"diet_14":-0.10820023267158643,"diet_17":-0.010246298069735834},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options for dairy-free alternatives that meet ethical standards.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. \" 1 Corinthians 8:8\n\n\"And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. \" Genesis 1:30\n\n\"9 The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour[a] to pray. 10 And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance 11 and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth. 12 In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. 13 And there came a voice to him: “Rise, Peter; kill and eat.” 14 But Peter said, “By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.” 15 And the voice came to him again a second time, “What God has made clean, do not call common.” \n\nActs 10:9-15\n\nThose are just some of the verses I was thinking of.  These verses from the Bible clearly show that eating meat is okay with God (the guy even told Peter to kill and eat).  Thus, morality based on the Bible could easily be shown to be for eating meat.  \n\n&gt;In fact, I would say we universally acknowledge that most people who eat meat have simply not put in the time to consider carefully the ethics of their actions. \n\nSure, but there is certainly a common theme that omnis are immoral.  Saying monsters was hyperbole on my part.  There is certainly the idea that those who eat meat are less moral, or just ignorant.  \n\nThe idea that any thinking, rational, good person would be vegan is the idea that I disagree with.  Sorry for the hyperbole.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.01873053548236688,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14928358207925924,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27203161671404924,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2733317206628827,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.44647638270275064,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13904618466765067,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15557337447535247,"diet_1":-0.015130777164207151,"diet_2":-0.02528340268569688,"diet_3":-0.12953490990548744,"diet_4":-0.011220185670026694,"diet_5":-0.00982438641343227,"diet_6":-0.012426653190535339,"diet_8":-0.006468883387242386,"diet_9":-0.001291865984967444,"diet_10":-0.006657340277646047,"diet_11":-0.0030335949534977167,"diet_13":-0.007792096025999247,"diet_14":-0.06327492606457479,"diet_17":-0.018319718724039074},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

For baking you can replace them with apple-sauce or a banana\na scrambled-egg is replaced with tofu but I never personally made one of these... only eaten it when visiting some friends\nI never really had the desire to use eggs for anything even when I was lacto/ovo-vegetarian. \n\nmilk: by far the easiest to replace: soymilk, almond-milk, rice-milk... nowadays there's tons of options available almost everywhere\n\ncream: I only know soy-cream as replacement, only used it when I got it as a gift. Never felt the urge to add it to anything that I cooked and basically just put it in while I had it so I use it up.\n\ncheese: That's probably the hardest part to find a worthy replacement. Unless you have access to stuff like \"Daiya\".\nWhat is used commonly is ... well we call it \"Hefeschmelz\" in Germany. Don't know what it's called in English... \"yeast-melting\" maybe?\nIt's basically a mixture of (vegan)margarine, nutritional yeast, salt and some spices. Once again something I've never made myself but eaten at friends. I personally just don't have anything to replace cheese with and live without it, despite having heavily relied on it while I was lacto-ovo-vegetarian. It was not as hard as I thought.\n\nI have to admit I'm not a great cook so my \"base\" for sauce is a ready-to-use-store-bought Italian sauce called \"Al Arrabiata\". It's very spicy and I found it goes with about anything.\n\nAlternative to proteins? I guess you animal tissue by that as proteins are building-blocks of all life, including plants and thus are in anything you eat anyways.\nI'm not a fan of Tofu to be honest. I usually just eat lentils, peas or beans in mostly unprocessed (other than cooked) form.\nWhat I also like are \"veggieburgers\"... not the expensive fake-meat-ones but just the combination of some sandwiched vegetables and legumes like chickpeas.\nI remember that the friends (those who also made the \"Hefeschmelz\") made burgers from oatmeal and chickpeas. Those were amazing... But once again something I'm simply too lazy to make for myself. ^^;\n\nI once also tried to make something from soy-shreds which I got as a present from my parents. It's supposed to be treated and taste like meat and it did... way too much. I was disgusted and never used it again. :o\n\nI think it's important how long she has been vegetarian. Those friends went from Omni to vegan in one step and thus were still accustomed with the taste of flesh. I've been long-term vegetarian before who never really liked it much in the first place so if the replacement is too close in imitating the taste/texture I'll dislike it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.18430305520659354,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05149018602335218,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23168276873336985,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17390605683128038,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.026814895682036877,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27742586969912286,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12725732727752379,"diet_1":-0.08304070914073236,"diet_2":-0.14371625516408434,"diet_3":-0.2014932052954208,"diet_4":-0.25354117747378935,"diet_5":-0.11016707434707011,"diet_6":-0.06786089454002688,"diet_8":-0.026361522427275002,"diet_9":-0.27308585547475894,"diet_10":-0.21492265665266708,"diet_11":-0.1757385008981487,"diet_13":-0.021351822031040985,"diet_14":-0.16976683758345035,"diet_17":-0.07971652088842045},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

At some point, you do have to wonder, if the only thing we are doing is getting smashed, what is this friendship really based on?  There was almost nothing to talk about when we were both sober, and I was never much enamoured with the bar or craft beer culture, versus the sober support groups were so supportive, so honest about their struggles, and willing to share openly their struggles if it would help one more person move on past it into a better life.  I feel like, it would probably be easier for omnis to make the switch to vegan, if the vegan culture were as open and supportive.  If we had a kind of evangelical zeal toward new vegans - one more soul we have saved from the meat eating culture, one more friend to join us!

I'm a vegan bot.  \n\n\n-------------\n\n**Your Fallacy:**\n\n&gt;you are saying that killing plants it's not good 100% just the lesser of two evils, right?. Honestly, I have the same doubt, just like taking a shower: you kill bacteria. So in order to not affect someone else(physically), you have to commit suicide. **(ie: You cannot be 100 percent vegan)**\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\nVeganism is the philosophical position that exploitation of and cruelty to sentient beings is ethically indefensible and should be avoided whenever it is possible and practicable to do so. Vegans themselves do not claim this position is absolute nor do they strive for perfection. Rather, the accusation that vegans fail to be vegan because they cannot be perfect is an external one imposed by people who do not understand veganism.\nThe term 'vegan' is defined as \"a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practicable — all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.\" The meaning of the word 'vegan' excludes the possibility of perfection, and vegans themselves understand they cannot hold their philosophical position absolutely. However, this understanding in no way prevents them from making significant, positive changes in the world by choosing not to harm other sentient beings when and where they can. Clearly, anyone who makes this same decision is 100% perfect in their veganism.)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2158718043972617,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24662453902926862,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18971771160753784,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3538435822076258,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.5251026810541849,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24983192910925525,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04321971139870584,"diet_1":-0.09321174986277292,"diet_2":-0.21524742996056637,"diet_3":-0.165794477605111,"diet_4":-0.10668904982277354,"diet_5":-0.194470361340791,"diet_6":-0.1763211825164035,"diet_8":-0.059515720941514395,"diet_9":-0.014565228523373719,"diet_10":-0.08750428507725398,"diet_11":-0.05714414928418895,"diet_13":-0.03161444472304235,"diet_14":-0.09591740125324577,"diet_17":-0.04784880696873491},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

And I hope/believe that if they change their habits slowly they will change them for a longer time. \n\nAlles can do is make information accessible, try not to be angry/aggressive towards them but welcoming. \n\nAnd yes I know how horrible things are but we won't help the environment and the animals by shouting at people.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"yes","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.22224327499982094,"1.1.1_stance":-0.010065892037212214,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2907703251127338,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23505758985433298,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.018792554596075206,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.11263574108791848,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.017756675680478413,"diet_1":-0.025748190712571766,"diet_2":-0.1961519999232063,"diet_3":-0.2581294885525543,"diet_4":-0.1541670364770793,"diet_5":-0.2050241431961728,"diet_6":-0.05206370468173797,"diet_8":-0.0014026632064390772,"diet_9":-0.27298985583843205,"diet_10":-0.001975396129031045,"diet_11":-0.0010476867149312359,"diet_13":-0.15010186886202823,"diet_14":-0.030464122003953282,"diet_17":-0.000762132506982501},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The autism campaign was probably the most controversial and an instance where I think they took it too far.\n\nOn the other hand, I've worked for an animals rights organization and know how difficult it is to get news outlets to cover stories that paint the animal industry in a bad light. Got a story about a pet store that neglects and kills its fish, with months of documentation and an ongoing lawsuit? Better hope its a slow news day. Oh, PETA tweeted that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles should explicitly eat vegan cartoon pizza? Stop the presses, this is front page news!\n\nThere's a reason everyone has heard of PETA. They've decided the negative press is a fair trade-off to get people thinking about animals rights.

And to their credit, they're the most successful animal rights organization to ever exist, so they might be onto something.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13819887368471556,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23048405032459413,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1896750443618295,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3169891512979058,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10646712273228331,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1615398195335204,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1092016352340579,"diet_1":-0.2511409642902436,"diet_2":-0.25983050290871795,"diet_3":-0.1829209928165104,"diet_4":-0.014266990024528544,"diet_5":-0.012827022498944038,"diet_6":-0.013478351070565017,"diet_8":-0.0018137620791094378,"diet_9":-0.004398372259553677,"diet_10":-0.011582760055413624,"diet_11":-0.00661286602068382,"diet_13":-0.039597761894886695,"diet_14":-0.07319546504719951,"diet_17":-0.01537404015834909},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

You get it. I'm there with you. They don't. So your requests are not reasonable to most. It's like if they went to your house and you were like, \"I'm making this delicious pumpkin pie\" and all your friends were like \"hooray,\" then one was like \"no, make cherry pie and everyone better eat it\" and everyone was like, \"booooo.\" That's how they see it. So you have to remember your perspective may be in the right, but you still have to get along with others. Bring your own food. Find a compromise that at least does something. \"I'll make all the pies.\" \"I've got the mashed potatoes.\" And then you don't use animal products in that food. That takes the stress off of them of preparing everything, you get some progress, and if you do it right, nobody cares about it being vegan. They just know it's good and they start to associate vegan food and good together. \n\nI think people often think of their households and traditions along the lines of respect for the homemakers. That feeling like if Grandma puts it on your plate you better eat it. Things like that. So it makes sense your mom may feel that way being told what to make. Not saying it's the most right, but it is a lot of families. And I think it's fair for the non-vegan stuff to give you and your gf the ick. But this sounds like this is also going to put you in a bind of choosing between the two sides for the holidays, which I've been in this situation where your gf makes you choose between family and her way of doing the holidays far too many times to count and it's just soul crushing year after year. The most reasonable request is for you and your gf to contribute vegan dishes as your part and compromise. Your mom is offering to give you separate spaces to eat and is at least trying. She's making a non-vegan meal with or without you. If your gf is going in with the belief that this is not going to be fun, then it's not going to be fun. If she can't get along with your family because they're not vegan or won't eat the way she wants around her, she's never going to get along with her because she's not going to give them a chance. They won't change for her stubbornness. People will change for themselves first usually. There are many other things you can get along over without compromising your ideals for yourselves. However, if they go to visit you at any point, you are allowed to set the rules for your household and cook all the dishes the way you want.\n\nNoting the idea that you don't let people eat non-vegan around you. They eat what they want. You don't control them. They choose for themselves. Your vegan perspective is unfortunately generally irrelevant to them living their lives. And if you put that ultimatum of \"eat vegan or don't be my friend,\" you'll find the option being, \"well, I don't want to be with a controlling friend\" and you lose a friend with nothing accomplished toward spreading veganism, just making someone like vegans less as they associate the idea with the negative impact on your friendship. What you have to do in situations like this is adapt. You can't expect everyone to figure out how to accommodate your wants or even do so if they know how what you want and how to achieve that. But you can be the one to pick the restaurant, cook the food, do the planning, bring the snacks, etc. And if you plan ahead appropriately, you can make it work where at least you get your wants taken care of.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.27149540126833926,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16361409977679386,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.30232582259254215,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.15765062835515753,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23631402926869113,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29128718701526024,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1087596279879411,"diet_1":-0.09652789308650729,"diet_2":-0.1481469665268378,"diet_3":-0.1431368847334369,"diet_4":-0.11606812445703933,"diet_5":-0.024862045880581718,"diet_6":-0.020184870588612586,"diet_8":-0.006679855269491479,"diet_9":-0.004553277187369531,"diet_10":-0.12059187472370922,"diet_11":-0.028395165126615513,"diet_13":-0.07918063908194502,"diet_14":-0.30039062122038257,"diet_17":-0.2613703484449969},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I only considered the environmental aspect, not the ethical or health considerations of soy vs meat. Knowing the environmental shitshow the meat industry causes, convinced me to change my eating and I cut my meat intake.\n\nThen one of my closest friends went from close friend to love interest. He and his parents are all vegetarians, so when we started dating I stopped eating meat. Nobody asked me to but it felt like the right thing to do because of my senior project and because of him. A few unfortunate exceptions in the first three months, where my mom didn't get the memo yet, but I stopped getting it for myself and didn't order it at restaurants.\n\nI moved out for college half a year later and stopped getting dairy for myself, so since mid-2020 I'd been slowly going vegan, just having dairy when it was offered. Mid-2022 I stopped dairy overall and just went vegan mostly for health reasons.\n\nSo both of my diet changes were due to background knowledge (about environment and/or health), entirely unrelated to ethical considerations lol.
