What you haven't shown is that they claim there is no climate change and that mankind had no influence on climate, which are the criteria we discussed.\n\n&gt;If you didn't actually take the time to follow the research I provided for you, what makes you think I will respect the links you send? \n\nBecause mine were mostly peer-reviewed papers, not quote-mined media sources.\n\n&gt;Have you researched the Heartland Institute?\n\nYes.  I know around 5-10% of their budget goes toward climate related things, like the upcoming conference.  I know they are funded by conservatives included one or both of the Koch brothers.  I know they have a strong bias, just as you do.\n\n&gt;You never reply to this. \n\nI don't recall seeing that.  Can you provide a link?  I may have overlooked it.  The meat of the comment is that peak oil was predicted a long time ago and it hasn't happened yet, so it will never happen.  Do you see the logical error with that?  By the way, conventional crude peaked in 2005 or 2006, according to the IEA, so predictions of peak oil were really quite close.  (M. King Hubbert said conventional crude would peak in the year 2000, clear back in the 1950s.)\n\n&gt;What about artificially created oil?\n\nWhat about it?  Where do you get the energy do create it?  If you are talking about biofuels, look at the corn ethanol debacle.  The net carbon savings from that are very near zero, once fossil fuel inputs into all the required processes are considered.  What's worse, is the monoculture of corn is wreaking havoc on local ecosystems, not to mention the effects this is all having on global food prices.\n\nA better way to produce liquid fuels is via processes akin to the Fischer-Tropsch process, but that too requires huge energy inputs.  That means you are essentially converting coal and natural gas to liquid fuel, but very inefficiently.  It's much better to just use the natural gas directly.  The best way to synthesize liquid fuels via F-T is to use high-temperature nuclear reactors that are still on the drawing table for the most part.  (Oak Ridge National Labs did run two test reactors of this type for thousands of hours, but the Nixon Administration pulled the plug on them to fund a different reactor type in his home state of California.)\n\n&gt;Really it seems like the crux of your theory is that at some point we will run out of economically viably extractable fossil fuel/coal based resources. \n\nThat's half of the argument.  The other half is that the newest observationally based estimates of ECS are significantly lower than those produced by GCMs.\n\n&gt;Let me ask you, what will happen to societies based on those resources?\n\nThose nations that are net fossil fuel importers will have a really bad time.  Fossil fuel exporters will continue to be rich until their internal consumption grows to the point of making them net importers.\n\n&gt;Will they leave resources in the ground when the prices of those fuels rise or will they try to create technologies, possibly more destructive technologies, to collect them?\n\nYou seem to have a world view that everyone is just sitting around with their thumbs up their butts pretending fossil fuels are infinite resources.  They are not.  Lots of countries are working very hard on alternatives.  Unfortunately, the biggest obstacles to development of advanced nuclear energy, the technology that could do more to displace fossil fuel use than any other alternative energy, are environmental groups themselves.  The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and Greenpeace are all official opposed to nuclear power; this despite the fact that most environmentalists support nuclear as a very low-carbon path into the future, and more are adopting that viewpoint all the time.  If you really want to put your journalistic activism to good use, expose the hypocrisy of those organizations.\n\n&gt;Would you be against actions to try and curb our use of these resources before we reach \"peak?\"\n\nAbsolutely.  I've said so for a long time.  Sadly, it is those who cry \"Global Warming!\" one day and \"No more Nukes!\" the next that are really inhibiting our ability to move beyond fossil fuels.  A few weeks back someone in this subreddit asked how I think we should proceed.  Allow me to copy/paste a portion of that answer hear, in bullet point form:\n\n\n- While solar and wind are great for certain places at certain times, I do not believe they should be *the* general prescription for our energy needs.  Even very concerned climate scientists like Jim Hansen and Kerry Emanuel [agree on this point](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/).  Solar is great for hot, sunny places like Phoenix.  I think everyone there should consider rooftop solar, especially businesses.  I think there are places where wind makes sense too; however, both solar and wind are diffuse and intermittent.  They are simply not suitable replacements for coal- or gas-generated electricity.  \n\n- We would do well to electrify transportation as much as possible, but recognize that this will probably take a couple of decades.  I think this should be high priority since oil will peak much sooner than natural gas or coal.  I used to be critical of electric vehicles (EVs) and still am to some degree, but I will admit that they are approaching affordability.  If battery storage can continue to improve, I think they may become viable replacements for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars without subsidies.\n\n- Related to the previous, I think the densest urban areas really ought to implement [SkyTran](http://www.skytran.net/) or something like it.  Tel Aviv, Israel is building a test section.  Some places in the U.S. have considered it, but haven't yet committed.\n\n- I think current-level nuclear technology should be replacing retiring coal plants.  Natural gas plants are cheap to build and quite efficient when run in a combined cycle configuration, but I think fuel costs for those plants can only go up.  We still have very cheap natural gas because of all the money that was invested in exploration and production over the last decade.  That money has largely dried up, though, so natural gas plants won't have the cost advantage forever.\n\n- I think we really need to devote some resourced to exploring advanced nuclear options.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences has dusted off the work the U.S. did at Oak Ridge National labs 50 years ago and now has 400 scientists working on building two test Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTRs) by 2020.  (LFTRs are a type of Molten Salt Reactor, or MSR, if you run into that term elsewhere.)  They expect to have commercial reactors rolling off the line within a decade after their test reactors come online.  There are some other approaches to advanced nuclear as well, some of them fusion, that might be worth considering.\n\n- Large transportation ships should be allowed to have small nuclear reactors onboard.  Currently only military ships (and one Russian icebreaker that I'm aware of) are nuclear.  With some forethought, I think we could put sufficient safety protocols in place to allow for civilian ships to have nuclear reactors as well.\n\n- A good many environmentalists and peak oilers support many of my suggestions, but think the process should be goosed along by international treaties and carbon taxes.  In my opinion, neither are good ideas, nor likely to be widely adopted.  The former always break down into issues of reparations with developing nations demanding money from developed nations and developed nations not-so-subtly bringing up aid programs.  The latter (a carbon tax) is extremely regressive.  I've heard people say that the tax revenue would be simply be redistributed, but there are lots of problems with that idea, too.\n\n- Finally, I think we have a duty to help developing nations develop.  I have yet to see any evidence that a nation can develop without massively increasing its energy consumption, so I think we need to stop telling poorer countries that their only energy options are wind and solar.  They need the cheapest energy they can get.  I think we can get nuclear cheap enough and safe enough to do the job, but I don't think we should block financing for coal or natural gas plants at the present time.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.015807284275069833,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22423678631524438,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2656904792432518,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11265489992608006,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3831406932465302,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2668345285554034,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.221494194812615,"ev_1":-0.1272820038651375,"ev_2":-0.1629684385623334,"ev_3":-0.12650620052625527,"ev_4":-0.11114793033083288,"ev_5":-0.12756440256591492,"ev_6":-0.09749231195005194},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

They figure that they can fit 24 panels on my southern facing roofs, generating a bit more than 8,000 kWh/year, and that system would cost me $54,000. Then they went over the state and federal tax credits, the SRECs, the 2.99% loan for the system, and after factoring in all of that I *should* be saving money compared to what I'm paying now. I've got two questions:\n\n1. Does anyone have experience with Next Step Living? Is this a reasonable quote for a system like this, installed?\n\n2. Would I be able to just buy the panels myself and install them? I've looked around a bit at panel prices, and I've found that the panels would cost me somewhere around $12,000.

Gas has a much higher energy density compared to lithium ion batteries. 33.7 kwh per gallon of gas. Even if you assume 20% efficient gas engines, you still have roughly 6 kwh of energy per gallon if gas. A gallon of gas weighs roughly 6.5 lbs.\n\nA battery has a specific energy of around 265 watt-hours/kg, or roughly 120 watt-hours per pound. A kilowatt hour is 1000 watt hours. So to get the the same energy in a gallon of gas (6.5 lbs) you would need 50 pounds of battery to have the same energy as 20% of a gallon of gas (which is somewhat fair considering gas is pretty inefficient to convert into energy with an engine). This doesn't get into electric motor efficiency, which is around 88% for a motor similar to the one in the nissan leaf.\n\nYou need 10× the weight of batteries as the weight of gas in your car. So he was right.\n\nMeanwhile, hydrogen is around 200× as energy dense as a lithium battery, but is roughly 25% efficient to convert to energy, so it would take 50× as much weight in batteries as hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nThese might be misleading as this doesn't consider mass required to enclose the energy sources, with hydrogen then batteries then gas containers weighing the most. Still, it illustrates why a company might want to make a hydrogen car, even if I don't agree with them on reasons other than energy density.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00046921305935635854,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09441030862890329,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18839585386836352,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.290965310249735,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21168600035623514,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19729381530884602,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.14574337994842304,"ev_1":-0.2088791259433294,"ev_2":-0.1599114406705373,"ev_3":-0.14375933862272797,"ev_4":-0.11542511945663136,"ev_5":-0.014877942236732148,"ev_6":-0.1685679713185696},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Yes there is a huge move to keeping conventional cars legal under impending pollution laws by making them 48V at least in part but not pure electric vehicles where 48V is typically only seen in very weak duty cycles such as golf cars and postal delivery vehicles.\n\nNo prototype, some confusing talk about keeping the car at 48 volts instead of 800 volts, because reasons?\n\nThe article also says they plan on releasing a car in 2016.

That's partially so, but not enough to cover all the losses in the system.\n\nIt's high-school level knowledge, and just needs a tiny bit of common sense applied.  Hybrid/electric cars are net less planet friendly than fossil-fuel cars.  At least for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe _only_ advantage one might argue is that any emissions are localised far away and there is more scope for dealing with them.

You're doing all the same things, just choosing the item that doesn't have animal products. It doesn't actually require that much of you. Switching away from a car when you have a lifestyle dependent on it is a drastic change. I for example couldn't go grocery shopping, I couldn't visit friends, I couldn't go on trips.

Mainly, the directive is aimed at kicking member states in their rears about getting old and wasteful buildings renovated, because 40% of the EU's CO2 output is produced by buildings. But, along for the ride, the following provisions are preparing to become law:\n\n* Every newly-built or significantly renovated building with at least 10 parking spaces must include in its construction or renovation the necessary piping and/or infrastructure to allow electric vehicle charging stations to be set up with ease.\n* If the building is a *residential* building, it must provide this piping for all parking spaces.\n* if the building is a *non-residential* building, it must provide this piping for at least 20% of all parking spaces. Additionally, it must provide actual, implemented charging infrastructure for a minimum of two cars charging simultaneously.\n\nSo when is this happening, where does it apply, and is it actually a binding law?\n\n* An EU directive is not a law. It directs member states to implement their own laws.\n* It needs one final approval step, but that is only a matter of bureaucracy. With the European Comission approving the directive this past Tuesday, it is already for all intents and purposes passed.\n* After the final approving and publishing step, which will happen no later than July 30th, 2018 (but possibly sooner than that), EU member states will have 20 months worth of time in which they are required to make every single item of the directive a national law. If they do not succeed to make it in time, or refuse to cooperate, the EU will sanction them.\n* The directive applies to all EU member states equally.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.24144593556341815,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26490825954872943,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16412512617545455,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22967292522748786,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16330038046631307,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25223508924346133,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06151145197236474,"ev_1":-0.17029784364188663,"ev_2":-0.1764661098534258,"ev_3":-0.17209080083730516,"ev_4":-0.14268772570854915,"ev_5":-0.14297418714947221,"ev_6":-0.17659711774225192},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I absolutely love my solar system and Powerwalls they installed for me, but they are horrible for customer service. \n\nWhen they installed my system they didn't have a disconnect placard.  The lead guy said he would come back tomorrow to install it.  He did not.  I honestly forgot about it and a 3 weeks go by.  TECO (energy company) says I don't have the placard, so they can't approve the system.\n\nI call Tesla and they say they will have someone come out.   A few days ago by, so I call again.  They say someone will go by in a day or two.  At this point it's a week, so a little more than 4 weeks after install.  I call TECO (my energy company) to ask if they got the info, and they say no.   I call back Tesla and they say someone will go tomorrow. So at this point someone actually does go back out, takes pics and leaves.   Two days goes by and  I call my energy company, and they say they still don't have anything.   WTF, I'm livid!  Not with my energy company though.   At this point the person I'm talking to says I can go outside and take the pics myself if I feel comfortable uploading them via their website.   I ended up doing this, and then called Tesla.  So I'm about almost 5 weeks post-install and bitched that they sent someone out, but they never uploaded the pics a week ago when they came out.   Sure enough, they check, and the person never uploaded the pics.   Oh, in the meantime my sales rep already left Tesla (along with 2 other points of contact that did some paperwork in CA).   I told them I already got another electric bill, and now a solar loan that I haven't even been able to use because of their horrible customer service.   I told them I wanted to be reimbursed my electric bill, or my solar loan of $255.  I told them if it wasn't for me uploading all the info my install still wouldn't be at the final stage awaiting the okay for my electric company.    They said they would get back to me.\n\nAfter another week my electric company signed off and I was finally able to turn on my system, 6 weeks post-install!    I did get good news, and after two months of waiting, I finally got a check for $250 to cover my first solar loan.   They gave me that option or a $300 Wal-Mart gift card, but I took the $250 check.\n\nI will say now my Powerwalls aren't working as of a week ago.   I called, complained, did some trouble shooting with them over the phone, but no luck.  They emailed back the next day saying they have to order parts, but they are out of stock and won't be in till November 26th.   So now I can't check my solar info until then.   They assured me the solar panels are still working as intended, so that isn't an issue.   I confirmed that today because I had forgotten about it and wanted to make sure.   \n\nThe whole process to install my system took a year and half.  They kept delaying my install, and almost pushed me away, but I stayed since I wanted Powerwalls.   Some of his happened after Irma, and them rolling out Model 3, so I kind of understand why it took so long.  Doesn't mean it made okay, but overall I'm still happy I waited.   \n\nI love the way my panels look, perform, and I will say CS was better with my Powerwall situation.  I'm not holding a grudge on them for the two week delay to fix them, because we had something happen and I think mother nature is to blame.   If they fix it, then I'll definitely say the CS has improved somewhat compared to my solar panel install nightmare.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2364673283520157,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16747716163284482,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20978928787359824,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21491102843719734,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2004323497001183,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13589922075973268,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20698076404938628,"ev_1":-0.18192764540076045,"ev_2":-0.22089169989107582,"ev_3":-0.053419189741058894,"ev_4":-0.09223138358599196,"ev_5":-0.07914884652321537,"ev_6":-0.26784317748664754},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

IMO that is an idiotic solution because it adds complexity and will inevitably break down, whereas wireless charging can be built into the ground without moving parts, thus reducing complexity and maintenance costs.\n\nI'm not so sure wireless charging will be very successful for home usage, because wires are simple and cheap and it's not difficult to plug in, although a wireless mat could be just put on the floor without having to bury it. But for mass transit and other vehicles which are constantly on the go, such as light-duty trucks and vans, wireless charging makes it dead simple to integrate charging while on the go without needing a overhead line or a heavy charging cable, which may be undesirable in a urban setting.\n\nBeing forward thinking, whenever level 4 or 5 autonomous driving becomes viable, it would also make it possible to have fully automatic valet parking at service stations as well as any other parking facility: your car drops you off at your destination or rest area and then it drives itself to the charging spot and charges, and when it's adequately charged it parks itself somewhere else, and when you need to leave, you just summon the car and it comes and picks you up.\n\nEDIT: I said \"catenary\" instead of \"overhead line\"; me so sorry for bad engleesh.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2593067502602935,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16466695035389733,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15719951610419444,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21534790753249752,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2962749198687269,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19544778184215753,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.31239319630885076,"ev_1":-0.11474204835964223,"ev_2":-0.01172359010646081,"ev_3":-0.14894372196674036,"ev_4":-0.11730222899707808,"ev_5":-0.05049432733843181,"ev_6":-0.1741383584464666},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

They plan for years and years ahead.\n\nA PHEV becoming hard to support would require the majority of over 100k gas stations in the US to shut down/be converted to charging stations, and all the companies who make ICE components to just stop completely and throw away their stockpiles.\n\nYou also have far more faith in US infrastructure improving to support it, and our true wealth desparity. Do you really think the majority of Americans are going to just toss that 5 year old ICE in perfect running order and be able to afford most of the new EVs coming out over the next 5 years? Or will want to buy the extremely degraded Leafs and such that are at the price of some much nicer late model cars?\n\nYou have over 4.5 million ICE cars being sold in the US last year alone, compared to the whole global EV fleet of only 7 million vehicles, which is cumulative over the past 20 years.

In many jurisdictions, both your electric grid operator and your home owners insurance would like to see a structural engineering stamp, and perhaps an electrical stamp as well. \n\nYou might want a designer who isn't the installer.

It's recommended 100Ah/kW capacity- which would mean a huge battery bank. The absolute minimum however is 100Ah. The problem is heavy battery cycling. IIRC Generator mode kicks on as a function of battery voltage and kicks off when the batteries are filled up. During the day the Sunny Island will use frequency shift to reduce power coming from the array to keep batteries full up. Both of these modes will put wear on your batteries. My main worry is that say you have 2kW of draw on the loads, batteries are full, but 100kW of solar production- is the frequency shift going to be able to match the 2kW (2% of total production)? Or are you going to produce 10kW (10%) until you reach float and then produce 0kW till the battery voltage drops low enough that you can use the excess 8kW to charge the battery bank. That 8kW is 160ADC @48V which would dry a small battery bank out pretty quickly. \n\nCould you instead line-side tap 80kW of the solar array and use 20kW on the Sunny Island?

As far as I am concerned, there is a single, and *as yet unrealized* advantage to OPV, and that is solution processing as a pathway to lower cost. Really, when you talk about solar, beyond a few niche applications, the only thing that matter is cost of produced kwH of electricity. Crystalline silicon is going to hit a brick wall in terms of cost due to the way it is made. You´ve got to melt down (expensive in terms of energy input) and crystallize a crap load of silicon to make it, and then half of that perfect crystal (with all of its embodied energy) gets left as silicon sawdust on the factor floor when you dice it into wafers. OPV offers the promise of just mixing stuff together and applying a thin layer of to an appropriate surface to make a solar cell. Its a much more chemical than electronic manufacturing promise and in theory should eventually much cheaper for covering large areas with solar than c-Si, with its essentially electronic manufacturing process. If you´ve ever heard people talk about a future with \"solar paint\" or \"roll to roll solar panels\" they were talking OPV.\n\nHowever the problems have been 1) its taken longer than expected to get the efficiency up (although looking at OPs links I was surprised to see commercial cells are [up to 13%](http://www.heliatek.com/en/news/news/details/heliatek-sets-new-organic-photovoltaic-world-record-efficiency-of-13-2-228)) and 2) the cost hasn´t come down fast enough, especially in the face of rapidly falling prices for conventional panels (something that has basically hit any \"alternative\" solar tech lately). This is why people that develop OPV, and OP, generally focus on \"additional benefits\" like flexibility, semi-transparency, aesthetics, etc. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind. Inorganic-organic hybrid structures (ie perovskites) have recently been developed that are also amenable to solution processing and have now demonstrated much higher efficiencies (and an incredibly fast rise in demonstrated efficiencies over just a few years) and are now another option for being the first truly cheap and viable \"3rd generation\" technology (although they still have many problems to solve).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20251595275476575,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19929016608073513,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12666353517444673,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16807990668844144,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2897292749595503,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20114270176574273,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15621319595569125,"solar_1":-0.2433143076420876,"solar_2":-0.2038703930850545,"solar_3":-0.1667612079177917,"solar_4":-0.1446109212698718,"solar_5":-0.11607559454084064,"solar_6":-0.014058727573380262,"solar_7":-0.010761882732670832,"solar_8":-0.0760925957984,"solar_9":-0.042792569741344266,"solar_10":-0.14910665020493874},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

Peak solar is generally solar noon, when power demand is fairly low.  Heat hasn't built up for air conditioning needs (which peak late afternoon/early evening, especially as people come home and cool the house off), and there's just not that much going on.\n\nResidential solar is a giant pain in the ass for the power company.  The typical deal is, \"I give the power company a kWh when I find convenient, and the power company gives me a kWh when I find convenient.\"  Plus, they have to have generator capacity for everything anyway, to cover loads when solar is low.  And they have no control over rooftop solar - on a partly cloudy day with clear patches, rooftop solar is whipping output power all over the place with no warning and only limited ramp rate control (the 1741SA inverters are slightly better here, but they'll still be irritating on a partly cloudy day).\n\nIndustrial solar is very useful to a power company, but they can do things like operate curtailed so they have headroom to respond to other generation outages (solar can react nearly instantly and go from 80% output to 100% output), or can say \"You know, it's on and off sun today, I'm bidding at 50% of nameplate today.\"  So, instead of ramping the production up and down as the sun goes over or not, they can provide a stable 50% of nameplate (and if you have a bit of battery, you can even ride production through, say, 40% illumination).  It's far easier to deal with from a grid perspective than what is, for all practical purposes, a set of rogue generators that do what they want, when they want, and you have no control over.\n\nIt's becoming quite a problem in a few areas.  Look at the \"duck curve\" issues in areas with high rooftop solar - as the sun goes down, the utility has to ramp generation at an absolutely insane rate to keep up with the loss of south facing panels.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0062637208417678876,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1818066555133555,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1889765425068251,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2504878727098306,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3182499332462214,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20513115803143975,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18467943634437956,"solar_1":-0.09649536815656272,"solar_2":-0.031612833404021025,"solar_3":-0.19314961161359007,"solar_4":-0.022427638334799365,"solar_5":-0.12369681322161341,"solar_6":-0.006344084698260606,"solar_7":-0.007698842155756817,"solar_8":-0.009584717329441142,"solar_9":-0.06258652516856245,"solar_10":-0.31129393478234607,"1.1.1_stance_lack_recheck":-0.08536072155432824},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neutral/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

That document lays out specifics on how a transfer is performed safely and time / power / frequency requirements.\n\nOperating in Island Mode usually requires batteries in the system to absorb excess energy produced by the chargers / solar panels and to source large amounts of power when starting large electric motors (like AC compressors).\n\nI’m not familiar with Solar ready AC systems but it implies the AC system has a soft start compressor (lower peak starting current) and lower energy draw (my guess).\n\n(Info source:  former solar inverter embedded engineer)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2182547559670187,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20631998593741493,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.08314112596665726,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11232522316277027,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18011798027235196,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26442069023017895,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26163792159544147,"solar_1":-0.17895020666940012,"solar_2":-0.22574304952451182,"solar_3":-0.024306227742878644,"solar_4":-0.08735189833472153,"solar_5":-0.004195938404033465,"solar_6":-0.0012817116321457434,"solar_7":-0.0533439033315517,"solar_8":-0.0031201795348655046,"solar_9":-0.027814862190915335,"solar_10":-0.026173213647174027},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The belief there is that they are reflecting heat away exactly as you say, and that aesthetically, all-black panels matter less in commercial applications. Although I will say that there isn't really a difference in functionality between residential and commercials panels; they are 100% interchangeable. But to your exact questions, reflective materials does help, however airflow beneath the panels helps a lot more.

However, if the load of 2 AC units was more than powerwalls could handle, it would have to tap the grid if they both went an at same time - specifically think about peak when sun is down.  So that’s the key question - whether you need something else to manage the load so powerwall peak amp draw isn’t exceeded. Typically that would be a ‘load controller’ that would prevent both AC units from running at same time.  Some of the local installers push that, but unnecessary in our case. \n\nI’d note that before we had powerwalls, we experimented with doing pre-cooling while solar was at the peak - so AC simply wouldn’t kick on during peak.

They didn't present these as hypotheticals or maybes, they were presented as a benefit derived from the technology they currently possessed. Trevor even went out of his way to bash Tesla's batteries and price point as part of these claims. Since then, the range, battery size and price have all changed to the point that neither are even remotely competitive any more.\n\nTrevor also made claims that clearly indicated they had a working H2 station on site. And that their facility was powered by a massive solar array. And that the prototype on stage was a fully functional vehicle, not a pusher. They listed $3B in pre-orders (1/3 of their total) from a company that barely has $10M in the bank. These examples are not even close to exhaustive, they are just the very tip of the iceberg.\n\nThese claims influence whether and how much investors put in.

You will need around 900 watts per hour using led to light a 1000sq ft building with shop grade lighting.\n\nhttps://www.rapidtables.com/calc/light/lumen-to-watt-calculator.html\n\nSo 900 watts x 4 hours is 3600 watts. Depending on where you are, you will need 4 - 300 watt solar panels. Each one should produce around 1200 watts a day in good weather. That gives you 4800watts per day in good sun as their will be loses in your setup. You then need a charge controller to charge your batteries. Now batteries you would need 2 or 3 days of backup in case of poor weather. Let's say 2 days (more days would need more panels to charge them). So we need to store 7200 watts of power. So we would need 6 200ah 12v batteries (lead acid can only be used 50% without damage). Then finally the inverter. \n\nYou are looking at serveral thousand dollars, shop level lighting for a building of that size is going to be on par with the needs of an off grid cabin.\n\nNow if you are looking at the Amazon kits with 4 lights for around $50.

This statement is provably false.  We can consult John Kerry for that, who said a few weeks ago something about 50% of our emissions cuts will have to come from technology we don't have yet: [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57135506](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57135506)\n\nBut if you feel the way I do about John Kerry, you'd prefer to listen to someone with more credibility, like prof. Kevin Anderson, or just read IPCC to see where our future reductions that bring us to net zero then negative emissions.  IPCC clearly states that pathways in which we successfully stabilize temperatures under 2C rely on unknown technologies, carbon swaps and BECCS, which is a fancy way of saying plant forests, then cut them down, ship them to centralised locations, burn them for energy, sequester the emissions.  This is not an elegant solution.  Academics such as Vaclav Smil have exposed such political schemes as false economies whose scale is prohibitive in both cost and speed of implementation.  \n\nTo u/antigop2020 the OP: Your feelings of hopelessness are justified by the circumstances.  We've had warnings for 30 years about all this, and instead of turning the corner, things are accelerating in the wrong direction.  The world's response to covid has been, well, less than heartening.  China, who you pointed out, is indeed governed by wild-eyed genocidal accelerationists, and your US government is hamstrung on these matters.  \n\nGiving up hope doesn't mean that you don't have to care.  You can still care and act, out of a sense of duty, out of a sense of faith in yourself, if only to set yourself apart from the humanity in which you are loosing faith.  Loss of hope does not actually mean 'if you can't beat'em join'em.'  Hope is a luxury we don't actually need.  We've had 30 years of 'hope' and no action.  There is no reason to associate the two.  You don't tell the truth or do the honorable thing because you have hope it will work out for you in the end.  You do it because you know its right!  Equip yourself with knowledge!  Practice Adaptation and Mitigation!  Speak the truth!  Hold climate vandals in your US plutocratic duopoly accountable!  Encourage your allies, not with false hopes, but with example and action!  The horizon is dark.  We are deep in it now.  Don't go looking for hope outside of you.  Search for the strength within.  Let your feelings of despair for humankind wash over you like a rising tide.  Cry it out.  Scream.  Liberate yourself from your sense of agency, and stop believing that ends justify means so as to reconnect with the idea that doing the right thing is right, because it's the right thing: it is its own end, it is right independent of the consequences.  Every great hero handed down to us through ages of human experience and tradition, abandons both hope and fear and takes up courage and conviction in spite of certain death.

I dont think you understand how wind and solar farms, or any power system for that mater are designed.\n\nMy man, it amazes me that you seem to be unable to accept the definition of nameplate capacity. If it isn't the maximum capacity under ideal circumstances then it isn't the nameplate capacity. It doesn't matter what the GSU capacity is. \n\n>I answered it, depends on the size of the farm. For stand alone installations is basically whatever the utility is ok with combined with long term profitability.\n\nYou didn't. You answered what individuals would do which doesn't really matter. We are talking about the country-wide application of battery storage. If you only have or are capable of one to two hours of storage then it is irrelevant to solving the intermittency of solar/wind. As I said before it is widely accepted that you need at least 8 hours of storage and preferably to actually implement such storage, 10 days of storage. Before you reach these capacities you are talking about something that actually doesn't exist.\n\n>Yes, that's exactly what happens because the fuels source is free and intermittent. If you're burning a fuel source for power and demand decreases, it's easy to just not burn as much. Isn't that one of your points? That nuclear is constant and renewables are intermittent? But I'm the dumb one. Sure.\n\nYour logic has started to confuse me. If you believe by talking riddles are going to get to anywhere then you are quite wrong.\n\nFirst, stop with the whole marketing trick of \"free\" stuff. Although the sunlight is free to get that doesn't mean that the energy produced from a solar farm is free. Whatever you win from the \"free\" fuel you have to pay for raw materials. It is disingenuous to compare solar with nuclear just because sunlight is \"free\". You still have to pay for the solar PV, the cables, and the inverters. Besides it isn't as if uranium is that expensive. It's quite cheap. Not free levels cheap but compared to natural gas or coal it is cheaper. \n\nI need to ask, do you have any clue how a nuclear reactor operates? It isn't some coal power plant where you shovel uranium into a boiler. It is clearly stated in the same link that regardless of how much energy is produced your fuel rods get used up at about the same rate. If you had read the Wikipedia page would have at least the slightest idea of how a nuclear power plant works and wouldn't post these braindead arguments.\n\n>And now you're confusing boilers with turbines and also ignoring this isn't how the fuel is burned. The boiler can ramp up and down fairly easily, the turbines can't.\n\nBy boiler you mean reactor? Besides the link a gave you with the load following clearly shows how fast a **whole** nuclear power plant can power up or down. It is clearly stated in the same link that irregardless how much energy is produced your fuel rods get used up at about the same rate.\n\n>Or there wasn't demand, but yes those would be the biggest three reasons.\n\nMaintenance or things breaking down don't happen as often as make it seem so. If they did, no one would have invested in coal power plants. Nor would they still invest in coal power plants.\n\nI already mentioned how you could deal with a lower demand for energy. You would definitely not completely power off a single turbine.\n\n>Besides the issues with storage of the water materials, they're not a permenant solution. They're literally burning a resource that is rarer and more costly than gold. Do you think it would be a good idea for us to start burning gold if someone found an efficient way to do it? What happens when the gold runs out?\n\nYour ignorance truly amazes me. Are you sure you are an expert in the industry? These are literally 5 min google worth searches to have a minimum of understanding.\n\nI suspect in your first sentence you mean **waste** and specifically spent fuel and high-level waste. I am not going to type out the answer for your illiterate ass. Just go read this link: [https://whatisnuclear.com/waste.html#whattodo](https://whatisnuclear.com/waste.html#whattodo)\n\nFor the second part of your paragraph, I would refer to this link: [https://whatisnuclear.com/nuclear-sustainability.html](https://whatisnuclear.com/nuclear-sustainability.html)\n\nThe tldr; We basically have about 4 billion years worth of fissile material on **Earth**. This can last us for quite a while.\n\n>When coupled with other sources. It's like youre intentionally trying to twist my words.\n\nWhen did I say the other sources are the problem?? The problem is that you use battery storage as a handwavy solution. We don't have viable battery storage technology at the moment. Nor are we sure when we will have it. To wave away the flaws of solar/wind with battery storage when that technology simply doesn't exist is the problem. Look at who is twisting the words of whom.\n\n>Yes, what is your relevant education and experience or are you just going on your feelings?\n\nSince when does science rely on degrees? Besides I am not the one coming up with things without a source. I merely referring to what scientists have already collected data in with rigorous testing. Solar/wind have yet to be the major provider of energy in a country without having to rely on imports.\n\n>My man, you don't even know where the \"nameplate capacity\" for a wind farm comes from. Please tell me the specific piece of equipment that limits the generation capacity for a site. It's literally a single piece of equipment and is independant of everything else on a site.\n\nNameplate capacity already has a definition. I don't have to change it like you. Besides CF is a factor that can be equally compared through all energy sources. The CF relies on nameplate capacity. You can't change the definition of CF from one facility to the other. Nameplate capacity is the theoretical maximum power output of the plant/farm under ideal circumstances.\n\nBesides I just now realized how your whole point is quite dumb on this one. Why would you install so many wind turbines in a wind farm that you can't extract their max energy output? It literally makes zero sense. Why would waste money and raw resources for something you won't be able to use?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000511962204958157,"1.1.1_stance":-0.35207219651109006,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2257723846742888,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2210817162025099,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2049164379472322,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21533805077262946,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16163387374399463,"solar_1":-0.110432205005089,"solar_2":-0.0937581680388328,"solar_3":-0.14370350143681493,"solar_4":-0.13429982287925668,"solar_5":-0.0953972824472259,"solar_6":-0.17181272828990282,"solar_7":-0.23919224272928355,"solar_8":-0.02519263130670879,"solar_9":-0.029418589223247693,"solar_10":-0.1222580795697196},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

If code inspection learns about this, they can force Sun Run to inform prospective patrons of the issue or require non-reflective panels. This is no way your fault. The fact that Sun Run offered to buy you curtains is tantamount to their admission that their installation is causing a nuisance to you, and they know about it. Any damages caused they failed to mitigate do not fall on you or your neighbor.\n\nIt will fall on Sun Run. Perhaps it is time to make a claim against the neighbors homeowners insurance, because believe you me, if your homeowners or the hoa insurance covering the exterior of your home finds out about the directed rays, you could be ass-out of an insurance claim if there is damage over the long term. It is legally the fault of the \"experts\" who installed the solar panels. \n\nSince your neighbor would not \"knowingly\" have allowed this option to be installed given the amount of potential and actual legal liability on the neighbor for long term effects, and the fact that your neighbor is on your side, getting code enforcement and the insurance company involved will put serious pressure on Sun Run. \n\nIf your insurance will void coverage due to the intentional direction of enhanced light on to the exterior of your property, you then have a cognizeable claim against Sun Run. Insurance companies, believe it or not, can be very useful in this situation because if something a business installed voids your homeowners insurance coverage, even before damage, that constitutes a valid claim. \n\nThere is a liability issue there as well, as discussed in this insurance article: \n\n\"Homeowners, Solar Panels Are Green but Improper Insurance Might Make You Blue | Fairfield County Bank Insurance in Connecticut\" https://www.fcbins.com/blog/2021/04/homeowners-solar-panels-are-green-but-improper-insurance-might-make-you-blue\n\nSo, your insurance may refuse to cover the panels due to the improper installation by the contractor. \n\nYou can also make a claim to the CA contractor's licensing board, who can then put in place standards to address this issue. They may even have some guidance on this already, I did not check. \n\nAlthough the HOA can not block the use of solar, they can require that it does not create a nuisance, and the HOA can also go after the contractor for improper installation. If the HOA maintains the home exterior, and the insurance company refuses to cover due to the man made potential damage and liability claim, or yours or your neighbors insurance refuses to cover the panels, then the installation violates the warranty doctrine of merchantability and use. \n\nEverywhere I am reading it essentially places the responsibility on the licensed solar contractor, to whom your neighbor paid for their \"expert\" installation. \n\nGo after Sun Run, and get your HOA, the city, the state, the neighbor, the insurance company, and the news to put pressure on Sun Run. It is their fault. \n\nMoreover, as this article states, the situation you have here is exactly what IS KNOWN to cause GLARE in solar panel installation, and this company in Florida says that they install their panels PROPERLY in order to mitigate any of those issues. \n\n\"Do Solar Panels Cause Glare for Neighbors? l Solar Bear Orlando\" https://solarbear.com/2023/01/26/do-solar-panels-cause-glare-for-neighbors/\n\nIt kind of appears as though the company may have used substandard materials and installation techniques, and this may indicate that the product itself may have been installed improperly. With Sun Run's refusal to mitigate this issue, what happens if they discover that their installation was defective to a much greater degree later on, and because the neighbor didn't take care of the glare issue as improper installation, they no longer have insurance coverage on the whole system?

This is still a continuing process at this point, and likely will be for some time. Those animals are still being exploited for this research.\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nVat meat doesn't involve animal testing, it involves a tissue sample from a live animal. This animal could be totally wild, independent, and free. If she is domesticated, she could live at a sanctuary. She could also be human, but eating human flesh isn't exactly on anyone's to-do list.\n\nThere is no experimentation or suffering or exploitation. There is a moment of discomfort that carries with it the potential to end true exploitation and suffering. Veganism is not something *all* people will ever agree on. In fact, I can't think of a single thing that *all* people have *ever* agreed on.\n\nIn the real world, progress is never made without sacrifice. You may think that taking a tissue sample from an animal is exploitation, but it's insignificant compared to the potential it holds.\n\nEven if we all went vegan, wouldn't you at least want vat meat to feed to rescued cats?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00696826571947895,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2615667826349131,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15872836099903756,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21339767584136693,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3719738313000945,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21215307909730735,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05298108634936701,"diet_1":-0.08581336362536263,"diet_2":-0.263199031376777,"diet_3":-0.09085566163165217,"diet_4":-0.14125171149983848,"diet_5":-0.016028767908816615,"diet_6":-0.01136846710202614,"diet_8":-0.13397276319543985,"diet_9":-0.01096832508725735,"diet_10":-0.050959944289691826,"diet_11":-0.0796443713188637,"diet_13":-0.06284898872642468,"diet_14":-0.09631524591510596,"diet_17":-0.005882475614877573},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

While you're learning how to live a vegan lifestyle, you'll still need to feed yourself. Luckily, there's a low-effort, convenient way to do that. Go to your local grocery store (Walmart, Kroger, Fred Meyer, Whole Foods, etc). In the frozen foods aisle, near the TV dinners, there should be a section of vegan and vegetarian foods. You should be able to find everything from frozen meatballs to frozen burritos to frozen curry. You may even be able to find veggie bacon. Good vegan brands to look for are Gardein and Lightlife. Vegetarian brands with some vegan food to look for are Amy's, Boca, and Morning Star (most of morning star products are only vegetarian, though). You may also be able to find vegan chili and soups, probably made by Amy's, in other parts of the store. There should be a few good milk alternatives that should be easy to find. Soy milk is probably the most common, but you may also see almond milk. The soy milk is a bit thicker than the almond milk, and the almond milk is a bit sweeter.\n\nWhile this isn't a long-term solution (the frozen foods can get expensive over time), it is really convenient when you're starting out and still learning new recipes.

You're also a subjectivist in this case (or maybe Subjectivist, since it's the subjective opinion of God).\n\nIf you're a subjectivist/relativist then why are you wasting time debating about something you believe is nothing more than opinion?  Right and wrong depends only on the individual or society, and there are no correct moral frameworks.\n\nIf you're a moral realist then it depends how you ground morality, but I'd argue that sentience is the key attribute that determines moral worth, and non-human animals are sentient to varying degrees.\n\nEven if you agree that animals have moral worth, you probably have a nice list of qualities that you think justifies eating animals but not humans.  The problem there is that you then likely have to defend eating vegetative people or mentally handicapped people or other such nonsense (otherwise you're arbitrarily excluding humans, and not basing this difference on anything except species, which is not a valid reason).  For example, if intelligence is your go-to, then if it's okay to eat pigs then it must also be okay to eat a human who is only as smart as a pig.\n\n>This is what we evolved to eat and gives us the optimal nutrition.\n\nThe latest science shows that we are more \"gatherer-hunters\" than \"hunter-gatherers\", but this is just a sneaky appeal to nature fallacy in science clothes.  It is *entirely possible* that the optimal human diet is something that is completely synthetic.  \"Natural\" does not mean optimal, correct, or morally acceptable.\n\nOur pre-human ancestors ate meat for millions of years, but the event that most correlates to the increase in brain size that made us human was the invention of cooking, not the invention of meat eating.  Cooking unlocks more plant and animal foods.\n\nEven modern hunter-gatherers equipped with rifles and other advanced technology primarily subsist on starchy plant foods, even though they highly prize meat.\n\nRed meat is a likely carcinogen, and a diet high in animal products increases your risk of diabetes.  High fat intake increases insulin resistance.  Your notion of meat being \"optimal nutrition\" is very flawed.\n\n\n>Not to mention humans kill other humans all the time. War, crime, self defense, etc.. it does not appear we have or will stop being an animal. We are animals, or do you refuse to believe that and think we are somehow a special species that has to obey some sort of higher ethical power?\n\nSo you are still unironically appealing to nature?  You do know this is a fallacy, right?\n\nIf you accept such reasoning then you're saying that murder, genocide, cannibalism, rape, infanticide, and any other \"natural\" animal behavior as morally acceptable.  This is ridiculous, but would be consistent if you're a moral relativist.\n\nNo deity here.  I subscribe to more of a \"moral landscape\" type of objective moral framework based on sentience (the ability to suffer).  I can't justify eating animals when I have the ability to avoid doing so.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001311160206872349,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2852398805393808,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17120782534281412,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04218098955849806,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26555342767858836,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2371574847337562,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.021271130002181355,"diet_1":-0.18299691283997768,"diet_2":-0.24960443596743667,"diet_3":-0.04466529854568459,"diet_4":-0.02640989157468236,"diet_5":-0.0090282564330361,"diet_6":-0.0141983266742803,"diet_8":-0.01880692802357468,"diet_9":-0.006802279203839134,"diet_10":-0.0655300927561863,"diet_11":-0.08260675585188437,"diet_13":-0.04398834621921802,"diet_14":-0.2548777626264685,"diet_17":-0.0409452501044143},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Not feeling like rewriting for 10 min...\n\n\nBut to make it short : being vegan is about being empathetic and sharing strong moral values in principles in order to cause the least harm possible to the world and any species living in it, hence not paying to torture them, to accept any positive expression of one self etc .. \n\n\nSo do good deeds in short. \n\n\nYou can't be vegan and homophobic. Otherwise you're just a shitty person on a plant-based diet. Vegans not eating anything from animals is not the main point, it is just a consequence of their choice to not hurt others. Vegans also aim to help the poor and the oppressed, whatever the species, like for instance by not buying leather or fur, by not buying coffee at Starbucks (pro-israel genocide), Tesla, Apple, McDonald's etc .. or by actively defending and supporting LGBTQ+ rights. \n\n\nSo yeah, being vegan is a way of life. We don't claim to all perfectly doing all of the above, but surely we can all claim to not actively try to hurt or deny anyone, except people who try to hurt other (like hate-spreaders like Trump, or homophobic people). It's a way of life that requires us to constantly be on the watch to not mistakingly endorse these behaviours we judge bad. Hence not endorsing trump. In America it's more complicated to vote for the right candidate, it's more like voting for the lesser evel, but in some countries in Europe, we can politically express ourselves by voting for ecologist/animalist/humanist parties that tend to have more weight and can have enough power to change things. For instance in France you can't be vegan and vote for Macron who actively supports hunting. Even if it will help your wallet and your retirement plan. Morals, morals, morals...
