Oil is a fungible global commodity, and once it reaches a port, can be sold anywhere.  For instance, Canada has threatened to sell their crude to China if Keystone does not go through.  \n\nThe article makes a subtle claim that you have to take into account.  It says: \n\n&gt; Most big, public financial assessments have said that the $7 per barrel differential makes it too costly. To fully develop the Tar Sands region, the various industries need the Keystone pipeline.\n\n**To fully develop**.  The tar sands are huge.  The article even says:\n\n&gt; By some accounts, the Tar Sands reserves are as big as anything in Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. All by itself, financial analysts say, the Tar Sands could supply all of the United States' energy needs for the next 30 years if 170 billion barrels of oil are recovered. It's that big.\n\n\"Fully developing\" the tar sands is not the issue here.  The tar sands do not need to be \"fully developed\" for the oil industry to make money from them.  What the article is saying is that, if the tar sands were to be \"fully developed\", the keystone pipeline would be needed simply because there would be incredibly so much oil flowing out of there that every conceivable conduit would need to be developed.  \n\nFurthermore, the argument that the oil is too costly is assuming that the $7 differential will not decrease.  The fact is that conventional oil reserves are dwindling, and new reserves everywhere are becoming more expensive to develop.  Meanwhile, the global demand for oil is continuing to rise due to growing demand in developing countries.  It is not a matter of if tar sands will be profitable... it is just a matter of when.  \n\nSo if not for climate, then for local environmental impacts?  This could be a valid concern, but one that is really overblown.  There are millions of miles of existing pipelines throughout the US already that receive little to no media attention.  There are many leaks, explosions, and other accidents that occur with these pipelines, yes.  Most of these accidents happen in aging infrastructure that was built before the era of appropriate government regulation.  Realistically, one more (state-of-the-art) pipeline shouldn't pose much additional risk relative to what we already incur.  Plus, with all the politics surrounding Keystone, you can bet that stakeholders will do everything they can to avoid any potential bad publicity.  \n\nI think we should do more to develop solutions to counter the potential dangers of climate change.  But I don't think focusing on the Keystone is the answer.  A more realistic path is through policy and global cooperation in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.  We should be investing more in energy storage and battery technology.  We should be encouraging infrastructure for the deployment of electric vehicles.  We should be providing technical and financial assistance to developing countries to help them develop effective models for carbon-reducing initiatives.\n\nFocusing on the wrong side of the issue is going to cause a lot of controversy and won't really achieve results.  But it will give voters a bad impression of environmentalism and turn people off from supporting the overall goal of mitigating climate change.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.26960138409194767,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28978487156645494,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17859392574752608,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30084152829239164,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20750187535176448,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1785425584508175,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19702256952101985,"ev_1":-0.1294540677523628,"ev_2":-0.1761169031439446,"ev_3":-0.16578597614473742,"ev_4":-0.23519189438957255,"ev_5":-0.07775478784848626,"ev_6":-0.036830731958616525},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Do you have any evidence to support such a silly notion?\n\nI never said the economy would have to shrink. Just that there was a lot of room for efficiency improvements.  \n\n&gt; Consider an article I ran across this morning. It details how the increase in energy prices in Japan since Fukushima are harming Japan's industrial sector.\n\nAgain, if you want to argue on costs, then you need to include the cost of continued use of fossil fuels. This includes the health costs of coal pollution and costs of global warming. Perhaps Japan needs to pay a little more for energy so that [South Florida](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/come-hell-or-high-water-the-disaster-scenario-that-is-south-florida/article25552300/) does not flood?\n\n&gt; Per capita energy use in California is less than half of that in say Texas...\n&gt; This is a great illustration of a statistic that hasn't been subjected to much thought. Have you controlled energy use in those states for climate? For population density along the coast? Have you noted that the price of energy in California is a major factor in businesses leaving California for Texas? To go a bit further, from this article, here are some metrics comparing the two states:\n&gt; Texas has had four times the job growth of California over the last 20 years.\n&gt; Texas unemployment is about 50 percent below California’s.\n&gt; Nearly every business climate index has California in the bottom 10 and Texas in the top five.\n&gt; California has been losing net taxpayers to interstate migration over the last three years.\n&gt; Incomes are growing at a faster pace in Texas than in California.\n\nMy point was that there is lots of room for efficiency improvements, and the comparison to California and Europe was to demonstrate that it is possible to reduce per capita energy use without having to \"reduce aid, research, development or production of pharmaceuticals.\" as you suggest we do. \n\n&gt; They are losing subsidies because governments are starting to understand that renewables have major drawbacks and that they don't have the funds to subsidize forever.\n\nRenewable energy subsidies were intended to encourage the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. This has [largely](http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/solar-grid-parity-world-2017) [been](http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2370937/lazard-us-renewables-reach-cost-parity-tipping-point) [achieved.](http://cleantechnica.com/2014/10/29/solar-grid-parity-us-states-2016-says-deutsche-bank/) And so the subsidies are no longer needed.  \n\n&gt; Did you even read the sources I provided? Your source doesn't even consider the requirement of backup or storage. Please look at my source where those costs are incorporated.\n\nI read your source. And it doesn't include the large external costs that fossil fuels don't have to pay. Using the atmosphere as a dumping ground should not be free.  \n\n&gt; Yep, I just argued that, but again, you didn't read my sources because my sources specifically identified the external prices of those things and even added a price to them. You should really read my comment more closely.\n\nI read them with no mention of the health costs or damage from global warming. Provide a link to those numbers?\n\n&gt; Are you seriously trying to argue that PV produces at the same output on cloudy days? I'm sure you've seen online data for countries with high PV installations, like Germany. You might look at those when the next storm moves over the country.\n\nI never said that it produces the same output, just correcting your statement that solar only produces power on sunny days.\n\n&gt; And it pays the price in reduced output. PV is ~20% efficient. CSP is maybe half that.\n\nEfficiency is not the metric that matters here. $ per KWh is. And in that metric CSP is competing or soon will compete with fossil fuels.\n\n&gt; So you are arguing that solar and wind are only viable as small fractions of the grid and are otherwise pretty useless without fossil fuels doing the bulk of the work?\n\nThat's not what I said. I said wind and solar can provide large amounts of power and there are entire nations, Germany and Denmark that agree.\n\n&gt; Add electric cars in large volumes, weather forecasts, smart grids, demand response and thermal storage and the grid can tolerate even more intermittent electricity.\n&gt; In other words, even if you spend a lot of money, renewables still can't do the job. It seems very much like you are supporting my thesis.\n\nThese technologies save money.\n\n&gt; The concrete base. Concrete production requires tremendous thermal inputs. Wind --&gt; electricity --&gt; heat is so inefficient that it makes baby Jesus cry. What's more, you can't just add heat when the wind is blowing. You need a steady, controllable source. Finally, concrete production chemically releases CO2 in addition to the energy it consumes.\n\nI suggested biogas or power to gas to supply the heat to make concrete. Not electricity. \n\n&gt; The steel tower. Same thing as concrete: high, steady thermal requirements. Yes, electric arc furnaces are a way to produce steel, but in smaller batches, and from old Chevys, not from ore. Wind couldn't even power electric arc because of intermittency.\n\nWind can power electric arc when it is blowing. \n\n&gt; Uh, no. Again, it's high, steady heat you need. Using electricity for heat is very inefficient, and you still have the intermittency problem.\n\nUsing electricity for heat is far from inefficient. Resistive heating is nearly 100% efficient and heat pumps can have an effective efficiency of 350% or more.  \n\n&gt; Or, we could just not use wind at all. Consider the energy production that could come from the same amount of concrete and steel if they were used to build nuclear plants.\n\nFinally something we agree on. I am 100% in favour of nuclear power. \n\n\n&gt; ...or power to gas technology...\n&gt; Hugely inefficient.\n\nWikipedia says [64%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_to_gas#Efficiency) efficient for substitute natural gas. That's actually pretty reasonable considering the electricity from a particularly windy day would otherwise have to be curtailed.\n\n&gt; But let's set that aside. Let's assume global warming will be every bit as costly as you think. Why are you trying to defend renewables as the only path forward? Let's really examine this. Suppose we converted 100% of our electricity production to nuclear power, converted all of our passenger vehicles to EVs, charged those EVs at night, then used any excess power production to either a) desalinate seawater, or b) produce dimethyl ether as a diesel alternative (or other hydrocarbons as a jet fuel alternative). Why is that option worse than the proposed Rube Goldberg renewables-only complex?\n\nI am only defending renewables as much as they are six [wedges](http://cmi.princeton.edu/wedges/) of the climate [solution](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/01/10/207320/the-full-global-warming-solution-how-the-world-can-stabilize-at-350-to-450-ppm/). Nuclear power, electric cars, energy conservation and biofuels all account for other wedges. No one technology is enough but your so called \"Rube Goldberg\" renewables are a very large part of the solution.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.4313921862206512,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23234529327291678,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2930478882055296,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33391182745496434,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38311925191760565,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2762749380547348,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2830050337800052,"ev_1":-0.14207990094660417,"ev_2":-0.1877462183609688,"ev_3":-0.12333865366217651,"ev_4":-0.14578871593172948,"ev_5":-0.06726361769795082,"ev_6":-0.21669350240562193},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

Cite something that shows that mitigation is undisputably cheaper than adaptation.\n\nI already have, as you acknowledge further down.\n\n&gt; How can you make an unequivocal statement that mitigation is absolutely, positively cheaper than adaptation.\n\nI referred to the report where this was shown also for low levels of warming. Where is your reference for your unequivocal statement from eariler that it *won't* be cheaper?\n\n&gt;  Estimates of both have decreased since that review was written, both in AR5 and subsequent literature. You know it's true, so don't bother disputing it.\n\nThat's a lie. The \"most likely\" ECS in AR5 hasn't moved at all, it's still 3 degrees. The extremal limits of recent aggregate studies have narrowed in both direction, so a very high ECS is now less likely, but also a very low ECS is now less likely. Finally, the \"likely\" aggregate range has not moved much either, it's low end has merely moved back to what it was in earlier IPCC estimates—1.5 degrees. If you had bothered to look at the Stern review, you'd know that the range of assumptions it relies on include values as little as 2.2 degrees warming for CO2 stabilisation levels of 1000 (!!) ppm, i.e. an ECS of below those 1.5 degrees!\n\n&gt; It's widely acknowledged as a regressive tax.\n\nAny general purpose tax is likely to be regressive on its own, you always have to compensate for low incomes. Take the GST for example: highly regressive but made less so through exemptions on basic goods and additional taxes on luxury goods.\n\nAnd that's exactly what I'm claiming for the carbon tax as well. There is absolutely no problem in implementing it properly, just as it was in Australia, where low-income households were not only compensated but in fact *over* compensated for the expense. I know what your economists are writing about the carbon tax and they recommend what I already said earlier: that it is offset by lower payroll taxes.  \n\n&gt;  were $24.34 per megawatt hour\n\nI won't play along with this inane stupidity. You know full well that you cannot do a \"per megawatt\" hour comparison between technology such as coal that has been subsidized fof more than century, or nuclear, introduced more than 60 years ago after the enormously expensive Mahattan program, and a technology we're rolling out completely from scratch.\n\nWhat's the subsidy per MWh for experimental geothermal? Let me guess, it is **INFINITE** $$, right? How awful, that proves that it should never have been done! What's the expected subsidy per MW for fusion at rollout? Also infinite! Does that show you how silly this argument is?\n\nSpare yourself the trouble and instead have a look at the LCOE that the DOE estimates for [power sources in their 2014 report](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf). It has onshore wind at 80 $/MWh, and advanced nuclear at 96, that's 20% more expensive! That report also tells us that the government tax credit for nuclear power is just as high as that for new wind and solar: $18/MWh.\n\nSo much for \"cost without subsidy\". And that number of 98 does, to my knowledge, *not* include any hedging of the enormous financial risk of spills that are now shouldered by the public (see e.g. Fukushima cleanup, a staggering $105 billion!!), nor does it in the US currently include the question of waste disposal, which for civil use has just seen a big change.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0013950951397418976,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27034028088130113,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.10447799147225333,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3551551780840852,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32755273747353897,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2922885644516578,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13734383602665426,"ev_1":-0.15421884697157637,"ev_2":-0.2445621791684971,"ev_3":-0.10639380676384462,"ev_4":-0.15468313966024047,"ev_5":-0.08920943655539304,"ev_6":-0.08474737124064},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

SolarCity guy sets up an appointment to come over even before I ever said OK to any appointment. Kept calling and emailing with a specific time and date and that he'd meet me at my house before I even checked my calendar or agreed to meet him. No, you aren't showing up at my house at 730 tonight I'm busy. They make u call thru their call center to get a hold of the sales guy. All call go thru there.  I give u my personal mobile number but I can't have yours?! Pushy sales.  They just bug the shit out of me while I'm standing in line at HD. \n\nSunRun - actually was a nice guy and did a decent job explaining things to me.  But he emailed me asking if he could get me set up otherwise he may lose his job. A pity sale, really??? C'mon. \n\nSungevity - called my SO by the wrong name multiple times. Did everyrhing over the phone. When I asked for what panels they use  and spec/data sheets he couldn't provide it. I asked him how they go about calculating the systems total annual output power and he couldn't tell me the factors/variables used in the calculation other than \"that's just what the tool tells us\". Thats not a good enough answer my friend. Not when I'm about to buy something that is $20-30k.  He kept making appointments he couldn't keep. Twice he had to leave early on the call last minute after I rushed home to get on the call with him. Also did not stop emailing me or calling me to take another call with him so he could try to sell me on it.  I literally had to tell him to stop emailing/call me and that I would call him after I reviewed the data.  [He needs some sales practice for sure]\n\nI am going with SunPower because the sales guy was on point. Explained everything clearly to me and answered all my question and provided me with data. Was not pushy even when I didn't call him back for three months. Secondly I like them because they are the actual panel manufacturer. Also better warranty and more output per panel. I went with the x21 all blacks 335w.  Pricing was slightly higher but not significantly  for buying outright after rebates and credits. He also didn't ever try to push me to lease. Leasing is NOT an option for me. Just doesn't make sense when I'll make my money back in about 8-9 years. And why the heck would I let someone take MY tax credits. \n\nAlso my friends did SunRun lease (I think) and then decided to sell their house and they set it was a PITA to sell bc they had to find someone willing to take over the lease. Wouldn't have been a problem had they owned it. Probably couldve gotten some additional value from it but one would never really know for sure. \n\nI had a few friends get solar as well as many coworkers and so I made sure I spent some time asking around and understanding what I was buying before jumping in. This is why I didn't like the pushy sales guys trying to get me to sign up immediately. Like I said I initially talked to Sunpower back in Sept or Oct and I only just called him back at the end of Jan. The guy was totally cool.\n\nCalled a few other but they didn't call back. Probably just weren't really in my area. \n\nJust my experience.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2106150181614845,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2991617532294482,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2763187387767463,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13443618081510067,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2037493574008901,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26508805976794475,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3033821371306355,"ev_1":-0.11260911288263742,"ev_2":-0.2700503953864725,"ev_3":-0.0029136946880801893,"ev_4":-0.025913227883089956,"ev_5":-0.010052801992666597,"ev_6":-0.18694450975137458},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

It was \"enough\", but lifespan is a serious concern, to say nothing about anxiety. That's basically \"toy\" level.\n\n~100 is sub-optimal. It's enough for \"about a week's worth\" of driving for most people, but it also boxes you in. Yes, you can rent a car to go out further, but should you really *have* to? It's like having kids. You can still have a social life and upward mobility in the workplace, but your emotional capability to take major risks to either end diminishes dramatically in most cases.\n\n~200+ is awesome. Personally, I won't settle for anything less, and I'll still want more than that, but 200, especially with a good enough cross-country fast-charging network, gives you a 3 hour drive between breaks. That's a healthy amount of breathing room. Combine it with decent pricing and you're gonna see a big shift in the overall market, provided that enough decently priced 200+ mile cars *exist*.\n\n~400 is game-changing. That's how much most petrol cars have, and you can get far enough into even a road trip that, even if you need a major (hour or so) recharge time, you'll probably have been driving for about six hours and need one *anyway*. When mass-market EVs hit 400, and even *as they approach* that number, petrol's days will be seriously numbered.\n\n~600+ is the end. You get a car than can stand up to roughly an honest day's worth of driving, *straight*, without a need for a re-charge, and you're **done**. Flat out. Owning a car that needs fuel basically looks like a *retarded* decision at that point.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19600238951912588,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19792242154731302,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24629337523140904,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2879971355265864,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3504960145318752,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.12871738583392775,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04157216955597202,"ev_1":-0.13231287372081013,"ev_2":-0.32481059073006124,"ev_3":-0.1997242469698735,"ev_4":-0.16144217200828098,"ev_5":-0.16659345706316722,"ev_6":-0.12512250839913688},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The EU has to do something about that at some point. And Germany for example starts to build 1.000 new charging parks, some with 100+ charging points. One of the requirements is that you don't need a special charging card, but can use one from any provider. Even when in Germany that's not really an issue, because you can charge at basically every HPC with just two different cards.\n\nTeslabjörn did a Roadtrip vom Oslo to the North Cape in a MG ZS EV (42 kWh battery).

Tesla has just been better at making it seem cheaper - like not including the destination charge when they show the price.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0035455459389292323,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13507782871415658,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15427965116039488,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2622457341311428,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10854567790618282,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20700312005147373,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2642063901294023,"ev_1":-0.09549223534098604,"ev_2":-0.1649822456181141,"ev_3":-0.10771028847168054,"ev_4":-0.029901150992373005,"ev_5":-0.003708382175924877,"ev_6":-0.16801546017116142},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Every mainstream carmaker has issues and most of them handled them poorly. This is an industry wide thing. Tesla has shitty paint quality, Ford and GM both have motors that fail, Honda had exploding airbags not too long ago, Toyota has wheels falling off. The important thing is how the company reacts to the issue. Hyundai really messed up the Theta II issue but it seems that they are doing better now. This ICCU issue is still pretty terrible since it leaves you stranded. I just hope they roll out whatever fix to Kias ASAP as well since I have one and it's a risk I'd rather not deal with.\n\nJust an anecdote: a friend of mine had a C-Class not too long ago that was constantly in the shop for various reason. The car was a lemon and we don't have lemon laws in Canada. It took over a year and escalation to MB Canada to get them to buy the car back. Even premium brands can have shitty customer service.

It's whether there are different EROI requirements for societal standards of living, depending on the energy source used. i.e. perhaps the 15:1 ratio isn't consistent among technologies.\n\ni.e. everyone can imagine that if we spend 10% of our time and energy resources to extract 100% of our energy, that we only have 90% of our resources available for everything else. Say if we all worked as farmers 10% of the time, and used 10% of our energy to produce some biofuel, to power the rest of the economy, that'd be severely limiting. So for every barrel of fuel we put into this, we produce 10 barrels of fuel.\n\nBut now imagine a robotic, fully automated solar panel factory that runs on barrels of fuel, too (hypothetically) spends 90% of our energy. So for every 9 barrels we put in, we get 10 barrels of fuel (equivalence) in return, barely more than break-even, or rounded down, for every 1 barrel we put in we only get 1.1 in return. \n\nYou'd think at first glance that the first is workable (a 10:1 ratio), the second (a 1:1.1 ratio) completely sucks and is deemed unworkable according to the 15:1 minimum.\n\nBut now imagine that solar panel factory was easy to build, and could easily produce 10 million barrels of fuel, despite expending 9m barrels to do so, and produce a net of 1 million barrels per day, and as they're automated factories, nobody is working there, and so we're free to use nearly 100% of our time to put those 1 million barrels of fuel to use daily.\n\nMeanwhile, with 10% of the entire world working at these farms producing biofuel, despite a 10:1 ratio, we're limited by arable land and manpower, and thus we only produce 110 thousand barrels per day, expending 10 thousand, and we only have 90% of the world population left to put a petty 0.1 million barrels to use.\n\nObviously the factory would work much better, despite having a far, far worse EROI. Now this is an extremely silly, exaggerated example of course. But it shows that on paper, EROI requirements to sustain XYZ standard of living can differ between energy technologies, such that one technology on a 10:1 EROI ratio might be just as good or better to sustaining society than another technology that has an ostensibly 'better' 15:1 ratio. \n\nI say this because it appears to me that at some point IF solar becomes dirt cheap (say post 2080 or 2100, we're talking about future societies which are majority or almost fully renewably-driven after all), producing gigantic amounts of solar panels in a factory can be automated to such an extent, and building large solar farms in desert areas becomes so cheap, that it wouldn't matter if the ratio was very low if you can simply build cheap extra capacity to exploit an energy resource that'll burn for more than a billion years. (the sun), and has very different EROI requirements compared to a scarce energy resources.\n\nIt's just a thought, let me know if you know if anyone ever explored it.\n\nParticularly because solar has fewer scarcity issues (land, capital etc is still scarce, but the sun isn't), and thus solar breeder stations are perhaps feasible. (something akin to the silly example of the solar panel factory above, a factory that produces its own energy with panels and uses it to produce energy producing panels, is mainly limited by scarcity of capital expenditure on solar which is dropping fast, as opposed to fossil which has much bigger non-capital limits to scale indefinitely).\n\n&gt; Some argue that society cannot get that much more efficient because of basic physics -\n\nI was just referring to energy intensity[0], some countries produce $2 of GDP per unit of energy, other countries produce $10 with the same unit of energy. There's a lot of disparity there which has nothing to do with laws of physics, and the $10 per unit can still go up a lot before it hits physical limits. (e.g. simply digitising mail to email, or say building a new city with a focus on public transport rather than car lanes, or passing new policy requirements for energy efficient electronics or insulated housing). We've seen energy intensity improve a lot in many countries, a lot of it is policy.\n\nMy point here is that if you double energy intensity (i.e. produce more wealth / standard of living per unit of energy, due to improved efficiency, a lot of it coming from simple policy-driven changes), you'd be able to cut the EROI in half. If you say need to produce 10 units of energy for every 1 unit you put in (a 1:10 EROI ratio), and those 10 units of energy create X units of GDP. Then doubling the efficiency of turning energy into GDP, so only 5 units of energy could generate the same X units of GDP, would mean you could run the same society on just a 1:5 EROI ratio. \n\nAgain, exaggerated example... Was also wondering if you knew if anyone ever explored those scenarios. \n\nIn short, on paper different technologies could influence EROI requirements of society, and a more energy intensive (note, different from 'more energy *use* intensive') society could drive the 15:1 ratio down. Exploring that (the different requirements of EROI) would be just as important as merely calculating the EROI. And none of that is philosophical, I'm not sure why you brought that up. It seems like this stuff really could be measured in approximations, and should.\n\nAnyway, beyond that the report you linked to is pretty conclusive that EROI for solar is already just fine. (and that it's on a ridiculous trendline. The energy pay back times basically dropped by an order of magnitude (10x) every two decades. If it drops again by even a small fraction of its historical rate (need to look at the science but intuitively I doubt we've exhausted the trend fully), you'd get to really high levels of EROI that should be more than sufficient. Is this a one-sided report, biased, in-comprehensive? Because if not, it looks like this is a total non-issue, a 1980s argument that stuck around in the energy debate and is way overdue to die out. What would the nuke heads say in /r/energy?\n\nThanks again for your thoughts\n\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_intensity","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.013085041039933762,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23616409683157416,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15413246105539324,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19789674977929553,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4214028826647286,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.237843779832205,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23290881506116606,"solar_1":-0.09439272022858734,"solar_2":-0.12536059769800267,"solar_3":-0.24676805341958594,"solar_4":-0.04847580001110012,"solar_5":-0.07879335082962181,"solar_6":-0.1991007869030422,"solar_7":-0.04940450363312484,"solar_8":-0.03981706144087034,"solar_9":-0.02281188406809065,"solar_10":-0.20354494262843184},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Like say an inverter you'll need for 1 panel or 20 panels, and an inverter can cost you like $2k. So it's not really practical to drop $2k to get started, and then start adding a $100 panel every month you know? You might as well try to drop a little bit more money on it right away.\n\nAs for local stores, I don't think it's worth the hassle for them to let you rent their roof, and then let you use their grid connection to sell your energy. You could install solar for them and their sake, but you'd be competing with solar companies whose business it is to do this, no way you can unless you know what you're doing, which means get a job at those companies and decide later if you want to start your own business like it once you have experience.\n\nBuilding small solar farms is also possible, but it's tricky and it still does include things like 1) doing a fair bit of your own engineering 2) politics: promise a local government you create xyz many jobs, create xyz renewable production to let them hit some federal quota etc, and ask them for tax breaks or feed in tariff deals, or go somewhere else and 3) some good financing partnerships. Even then it's really hard. For example in my country the cost of electricity retail is 25c, the cost of producing it is like 8c. The reason is because like 10c is energy taxes, and the rest is VAT. So if you produce it and sell it, you pay those taxes and you're left with only 8c per kwh. So you need your production of solar to be below 8c, which isn't easy everywhere. Whereas if you just run solar for your own home (i.e. not to sell it), then what you're doing is for every 1 kwh you generate, you don't have to pay 25c for it retail, so your kwh is worth 25c, and thus it's easy to build a solar project for your own use that is financially viable, as your solar project can cost 20c per kwh and you'd still save money. But once you start selling it, your cost price has to be like 1/3rd of that, which is really hard, which is where tax breaks and tariffs and cheap capital etc come from. It depends per country and even state what the conditions are, but just generally know that residential solar can be financially worthwhile at cost prices that would be unprofitable to sell.\n\nAnyway I really suggest working at a solar company, taking some courses in some technical fundamentals (on panels, energy, electricity, batteries), and reading some literature on local regulations, energy companies etc.\n\nBest bet imo is call these guys: http://www.helios-power.com/company.html\n\nThey built multiple small scale (i.e. few million dollar budgets) solar farms with small &lt; 5 man teams or so and offer consultancy. You can probably get a free call in for 15 minutes to explore what is realistic and what is not.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004181142139714211,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27838226718524584,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14993572813795006,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21659242174803373,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17749183162979015,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2393456334362627,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16278260552885931,"solar_1":-0.24277605266818852,"solar_2":-0.17706094461314237,"solar_3":-0.11608598514673456,"solar_4":-0.08440094803028962,"solar_5":-0.03858268897117038,"solar_6":-0.18154468595172565,"solar_7":-0.026295895571820438,"solar_8":-0.10736420703930587,"solar_9":-0.021325753397889002,"solar_10":-0.18436570762735055},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

Whereas, the SMA system seems to throttle down the string inverter power output to meet the load rather than disconnect the solar array entirely. Wouldn't that mean the SMA inverter utilizes the batteries less, running more of daytime load off solar and not off the batteries? Wouldn't that mean that the batteries have ~10% longer life? So the LCoE of the SMA system would be lower than the Outback/Schneider system, despite the upfront cost and added complexity?\n\n2) When the battery voltage is low, the outback/schneider/magnum inverters can switch to a generator. But isn't the generator separately derived? And so the surplus power from generator cannot fill up the depleted batteries? If the goal of the off-grid system is to use as little gas as possible, wouldn't you want parallel operation of the battery bank / generator? It seems the complex controls of the SMA system would be an advantage to reduce onsite gas consumption. Additionally, provided you have a control system governing the system to ensure you aren't backfeeding the individual components, wouldn't parallel operation of the battery bank / generator / solar array allow for maximum amperage?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.05098719894886017,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2484937971939644,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1740105785925288,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.341487781150989,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20234367882703364,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23971030268137514,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.4653467090683989,"solar_1":-0.09613193958090797,"solar_2":-0.07658116768516265,"solar_3":-0.13183913681440562,"solar_4":-0.017906590526411956,"solar_5":-0.044761189121318455,"solar_6":-0.030119483167205228,"solar_7":-0.01029093677995263,"solar_8":-0.01101735590295575,"solar_9":-0.05313375831893552,"solar_10":-0.10193797508832682},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Way over state average consumption at 75kWh per day.    I know a lot about solar both on grid and off.  and can say without any qualms at it is cheaper to save a kWh than to generate that kWh off grid.\n\n&gt; 1) Renewable generator systems connected to the grid without batteries are not a standby power source during an FPL outage. The system must shut down when FPL's grid shuts down in order to prevent dangerous back feed on FPL's grid. This is required to protect FPL employees who may be working on the grid.\n\nI suggest you read up on Bimodal solar systems.   They are similar to off grid system with batteries but on grid.  I design and sell them as well as have one my self.  It definitely backs up things in my house when the grid is down.   \n\n&gt; 2) Customer generation is limited to 90 percent of the FPL service capacity.\nBeing off-grid means you can have any size system you want.\n\nWell not really.  You can generate 100% or 110% of your consumption when on grid in most locations.   \nHowever when off grid your generation HAS to be much larger, to handle winter (lowest production days), battery conversion inefficiencies, as well as cloudy rainy days.  \n\nYes there is a application fee for net metering but the grid 100% efficiency and reduced solar size easily compensate for this fee.   \nAs well as the ability to net meter extra production from month to month to even out annual consumption to generation at nearly 100% efficiency.  \n\n&gt; 4) Upload documentation showing proof of insurance in the amount of no less than $1 million per section 11 of the interconnection agreement\n\nHave you checked your homeowners insurance?   you may already have the $1million liability coverage.

I think adding the \"hour\" means it was the unit of energy actually used over a given period of time? And to calculate my usage I take the watts x hours used = my watt-hours... Am I following right? If so I think I have to calculate the solor panels the same way? If one panel is a 100-watt panel, I can times it by the number of panels I have (let's say 6) that means I obtain 600-watts per hour (of optimal sunlight). So 600-watts x 4 sunlight hours = 600-watt hours were obtained. And if I have 1000-watt hours calculate that I spend, I have just cut my power bill in half?\nI didn't think about low/high power consumption for the computer or washer, thank you! That helps a lot. I think I can find a program to get a \"guess\" of what my computers high wattage use really is.\n\nAnd for the solar panels, I do need a professional to install them, haha, at least until I learn a lot more. But I was wondering about the best set-up for my needs, I'll have to figure that out. Does the different volts (12v or 24v) on the solar panel kits matter for a grid tied person? And some people are telling me I need batteries and others are telling me it's pointless if I'm on the grid. I do know I want to use as much solar as possible, and if it was legal for me to be off the grid I would. I was hoping to have a system I could use as if I was off the grid, meaning, I want to make at least the amount of energy than I actually use. How do I determin how many batteries I need? And some people tell me I can't run my A/C, refrigerator, water heater, etc. Because they run on a higher voltage (probably ~210v) than standard (110v) so they say that power will be coming from the power company...? I'm not sure how to understand or fix this. Thanks for all the help.

Find out from the operations people the actual install time vs what the sales management tells you. It takes time for local construction permitting and then utility approval. Most will say, oh, 4-6 weeks, then it's really months, not weeks. Who will the client bug constantly? The salesperson.\n\n2. Learn about the ITC.  Almost no solar sales people know how this works. They will tell you when calculating the ROI that the client gets the 30% back next year when they file taxes. WRONG! If you owe the IRS $2000, and have a tax credit of $6000 from purchasing a solar system, you can use $2000 of the $6000 so you dont owe that year; the IRS will NOT cut you a check for the $4000 balance. Instead, you can roll the remaining $4000 tax credit balance forward over 5 years, using some each year. But loan companies routinely say, your monthly payment will be, say, $150, if you send us your $6000 ITC towards the principle balance of your solar loan. Otherwise it will rise to, say, $350. So what it really means is that the client would have to take the $6000 from some other place (ie, savings account), and send the loan company that money. (The way I explain it is to let your CPA know you hold an ITC of so many dollars, then have them adjust your withholding so you pay less to the IRS every pay period, and intentionally create a deficit that matches what you will owe)\n\n3. Net metering. In a lease, in much the same way as the ITC, if you have net balance at the end of the month in your favor (ie, you sent more electricity to the grid than you used), the utility will NOT cut you a check. They will roll the negative balance forward until the next bill - you will either add your balance (that they owe you)...or if your usage is higher than what you provided to them, you start using up your \"credits\". Know the rate of what the utility pays the solar customer per ow when they feed the grid. Its usually less than what they charge the customer.\n\n4. Go in and determine which is best for the client: lease or own, and if own, will they use cash, or take a loan?\n\n5. Know the history of your states' SREC price over time. Assumptions ate made on that.\n\n6. Know how these systems affect the price of their home. Look it up on zillow or trulia, lots of good info there.\n\nQualifications: electrical engineer, realtor, mortgage loan officer, solar sales.\n\nGood luck!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006283309194259346,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08053136016501412,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17180559045557475,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21178021629001154,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38639314320581253,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27561315372863454,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013543990751107534,"solar_1":-0.19271887012001665,"solar_2":-0.02186494778652559,"solar_3":-0.082968324302783,"solar_4":-0.21123490860336247,"solar_5":-0.0037869149649244114,"solar_6":-0.18876462543919087,"solar_7":-0.19473955273861066,"solar_8":-0.05582022442253307,"solar_9":-0.24301087266987673,"solar_10":-0.18086886219380413},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

The only limiting factor is cost, but if this allows smaller batteries to be viable then it could effectively pay for itself\n\nIt wouldn't do shit for a car being used for 100 miles a day, but it could make a lot of sense for a car doing 10 miles/day.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0028622144212325415,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20443378759767022,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17738779093404272,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2141983493541678,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1975398542330037,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25407024006866585,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08635072099665801,"solar_1":-0.10580739798738299,"solar_2":-0.15328409591125133,"solar_3":-0.09837889086118139,"solar_4":-0.26036232459301856,"solar_5":-0.16534170276251953,"solar_6":-0.0010513122688280419,"solar_7":-0.01834647801903581,"solar_8":-0.018905172750237398,"solar_9":-0.2034727653299995,"solar_10":-0.19481289166630075},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

So probably be sure the dealer you go with has good reviews.\n\nOverall, my opinion on the issue is this. You can never fully rely on a warranty, but what is the worst case scenario? The worst case would be the entire system being down and waiting months to fix it. And when you finally do get them to fix it, they stick you with a large bill.\n\nMicroinverters means that there is little room for single point failure, even if I have to wait, 1-2 panels failing isn't the end of the world. And the warranty does cover labor, which in my opinion is the most expensive thing. Particularly in NYC and with time the labor cost will only go up. Thus, as long as they eventually fix the few panels that may fail, there shouldn't be a problem and I won't get stuck with the bill.\n\nThe only 3 gotchas I've identified is:\n\n1) Warranty says this: \"For any valid claim, SunPower will, in its sole discretion, either: (a) repair; (b) replace; or (c) refund a prorated value of the module based on  \nthe original purchase price subject to the conditions set out herein\"\n\nWhich means, they can choose not to replace the panel but pay you the prorated amount. This can be a bit annoying since as you can guess, the equipment is maybe 1/3rd the value. And not sure how they count deprecation. The bright side though is that NYC has really good tax incentives, so I'd figure at worst I'd break even. But I somehow doubt if a panel breaks in 20 years, they'll choose to replace it. They'd most likely just give me a few bucks at best.\n\nBut it is still much better than others where even if a panel is degrading beyond warranty or etc, I won't have to worry about paying for labor (cause what is the point of a warranty if the labor makes it useless)\n\n2) Monitoring only has 10 year warranty, so after 10 years if it breaks I'm on my own. The bright side though is I'd break even in 4-5 years so...\n\n3) Monitoring is our responsibility(unless dealer does it for you), so we have to identify the issues ourselves.

When they are new this difference is less pronounced, but as they age they can differ quite a bit, especially if they have seen different amounts of sunlight over their life, such as second hand panels coming from different houses.\n\nSo if you test each of your two panels individually, you'll probably want to test them together as well (in series and in parallel if practical) as you'll likely get a different result each way.\n\nLong term testing (weeks) can also be tricky because of weather and seasonal changes making it difficult to repeat the same test at a later point in time, as the environmental conditions will be different.  Having panels side by side can help (by running multiple tests at the same time to ensure identical conditions) but it means duplicate equipment and the need to ensure the panels behave identically to begin with (which is unlikely to be the case if the panels are second hand, as they'll have deteriorated at different rates, and your comparison won't be valid).\n\nYou don't say what type of information you are hoping to obtain from the testing so it's difficult to advise further.  It's unclear whether you are wanting to measure how much the panels have deteriorated, whether one panel performs better than another, whether the panels are suitable for running in series/parallel, whether you want to know how long the panels will take to charge a battery at your location, how much power you can expect to generate on an average day, etc, etc.  There are a huge number of different things that can be tested, each of which requires a slightly different set up, so it's hard to advise what options are available.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00011065291982959025,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11209248389309323,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.06499151316711504,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17689783771363943,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22788304987177743,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18547626831635,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04023497427503268,"solar_1":-0.033441090107468575,"solar_2":-0.10726995230046062,"solar_3":-0.2928896659580487,"solar_4":-0.06649372592648378,"solar_5":-0.301152718893718,"solar_6":-0.050563990501056345,"solar_7":-0.02865460633620387,"solar_8":-0.009623568407429653,"solar_9":-0.19408807588060958,"solar_10":-0.17039506995099601},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

I provide my utility free solar power and bank net metering credits. They still get to bill someone for the power I send to them in exchange for the credit I get rather than pay for hydroelectricity. Whatever profit margin they have when they provide hydroelectricity is increased when they get my free power. \n\nI like the idea of virtual power plants and some utilities seem to like them, too. They pull from batteries of customers instead of starting up auxiliary power plants.

It’s gonna take solar power and wind power and nuclear and electric cars as well as hydrogen fuelled cars. Or no cars. Alternative transportation. It’s gonna take us to simplify our lifestyles. Its gonna take the rich supporting the poor. Its gonna take daring politicians who realise it will never happen if you gonna tax people to death. Its gonna take replanting the whole rain forest. Its gonna take adaptation to a changing world. \n\nI believe the human race is resourceful and resilient enough to get through this and solve it but it’s not gonna happen if we keep bickering and put money over the planet and people. For every person who has too much there will be hundreds who have too little. Its gonna take us to share more equally. Its gonna take governments that have courage to achieve what needs to be achieved.

Beautiful? These aren't deer you know. Unlike the herbivores whose existence is mostly non-imposing the lions cause sentience to scream in agony every day for years and years. Centuries and centuries. Intestines being ripped to the floor by the pride. Herds watching their families getting chased to their deaths day in and day out. Cut the speciest crap. At the end of the day the existence of the species whose survival is dependent on imposing constant net suffering on sentience would be considered negative, speaking objectively of course. Also, you think the wildebeest who watched it's child get ripped apart by that lion cares about your faulty definition of \"beauty\"? You think the wildebeest believes in that romantic \"circle of life\" elitist speciest rhetoric? \n\nAnd to the people saying that the non-existence of a lion is ecologically threatening, how so? A claim stating that the non-existence of a species is ecologically threatening can only be based off of subjective reasoning created by a speciest bias for many species come and go and the inanimate \"world\" isn't threatened. Even if we were to say that it threatened human existence you would still have to come up with an argument as to how our existence is OBJECTIVELY positive, or any other carnivore for that matter.  You vegans I swear, it's like your objective thinking can only go so far, why do so few take it all the way...Enough with the morally righteous finger pointing activism, start looking at ethics with a non judgmental and deterministic view that focuses on the reduction of negatives and not your own irrelevant and emotionally charged blame game. \n\nSo what, some culturally brainwashed hunter killed a brutal rapist carnivore... At this moment there are millions of chickens being stuffed into shit covered cages so humans can have a cornucopia of baked goods at their convenience for a momentary miniscule luxury.

If you follow deontological ethics or negative/prior-existence utilitarianism which place priority on alleviating suffering rather than creating new beings, it doesn't work. Another problem is that, if you replace animals with humans, it seems very dystopian.\n\nThe argument goes something like: (1) It is better to exist and be happy than to not exist at all. (2) It is possible to raise animals that experience more happiness than suffering, so that their lives are worth living on the whole. (3) If the animals are slaughtered, at least they got to live a short happy life, which is still better than never having existed. Death doesn't make their entire life bad. (4) Therefore, animal farming (or eating animal products) is not inherently bad and could in fact be good.\n\nAntinatalists and negative utilitarians will object to (1), which is why they also think human reproduction is always wrong. Animal rights deontologists will object to (3) as well.\n\n[This short summary](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/logic-of-the-larder/) includes some of the standard objections and counter-objections:\n\n&gt; A number of responses have been given to this objection. First, many of the animals raised in factory farms have net negative welfare. Causing fewer of these animals to exist, therefore, reduces overall animal suffering. Second, rearing domesticated animals reduces the number of wild animals that exist by an even greater number, so the assumption that veganism causes fewer animals to exist may be false. Finally, even if increasing demand for animal products was positive on the whole, there are other, more cost-effective ways to help animals, and to improve the world (Matheny &amp; Chan 2005).\n\n&gt; However, Carl Schulman (2013) has pointed out the tension involved in promoting dietary change as a way to reduce farm animal suffering and expressing concern for wild animal suffering. If wild animals tend not to lead net-positive lives, and a vegan diet increases the number of animals in the world, a vegan diet will increase, rather than decrease, the number of beings living net-negative lives. Partly for these reasons, some animal advocates in the effective altruism community favor methods of reducing animal suffering that do not involve dietary change, such as humane slaughter methods (Tomasik 2016).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.4406762801495617,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05996223065253616,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2430990821572807,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20730481112829047,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30072131636144805,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3016238341599488,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24221401448887783,"diet_1":-0.07147444831417715,"diet_2":-0.16705850350148563,"diet_3":-0.10624606126501135,"diet_4":-0.018062601463194976,"diet_5":-0.039441965457323626,"diet_6":-0.025057094750081887,"diet_8":-0.022051180388795426,"diet_9":-0.004514665431391525,"diet_10":-0.071489318995494,"diet_11":-0.029678694045287557,"diet_13":-0.026130776192682486,"diet_14":-0.2555660997677478,"diet_17":-0.034184385848978614},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Patrik Daboumian is a beast.  The amount of protein needed to be consumed to maintain mass like that (vegan or not) is staggering. I personally would never be a vegan for moral reasons provided animals are treated well while they are alive. Yet I always try and cut down meat consumption for environmental reasons. But when so much plant based food is just as bad for the environment as meat the waters get rather muddied as to the benefits of plant based proteins over meat/dairy. I live in Japan as its hard to find ethically sourced ANYTHING, which an issue. Not to mention so much of the vegetables are covered in excessive packaging. Also if I want asparagus it all comes from Peru or Isreal which I kinda aint down with.  \n\nMy main point is even if I dont eat meat for environmental reasons here, eating a plant based diet is not much better.

They are *far* better than store-bought, but ultimately the best, most ethical option is to just not eat them at all.\n\n[Here is a great entry in our wiki that covers the most pertinent issues when it comes to eggs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/eggs)\n\nTo summarize the bits relevant to your question about \"backyard chickens\" - the chicken still has to come from somewhere. If they're purchased from a hatchery, then you're contributing to the same unethical practices (and culling of the male chicks) that occurs when you buy store-bought eggs. This point is obviously not relevant if the chicken is a rescue.\n\nAdditionally, laying an egg is extremely taxing on a chicken's body. It takes a lot of resources and energy for them to lay, and on top of that, the modern chicken is bred in such a way that they lay an *immense* amount of eggs (compared to what they would in the wild, prior to selective breeding). In many farm sanctuaries and rescues, the chickens are given what is effectively birth control in order to soothe their overactive reproductive systems.\n\nOn top of that, taking the eggs from the chickens can often cause them to lay more frequently by instinct. The eggs that are left (and unfertilized) are often eaten by the chicken themselves in order to recoup the significant nutrient expenditure from laying.\n\nIn conclusion, it's way, *way* better to get eggs from your own chickens in your backyard than it is to buy them at the store, but it's still not the best thing you can do for the animal. The best thing you can do is help them manage their overactive reproductive system and ensure their comfort. We don't need to eat eggs anyway, and if you do have a craving or a specific recipe you want to try, there are a ton of different egg substitutes and alternatives. I hope that helps!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1913500624466192,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21943294650989786,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2563368400275662,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2055676413298931,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.45015645986126174,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13296275068952923,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23336941914421372,"diet_1":-0.21885872878677523,"diet_2":-0.20082403988264422,"diet_3":-0.15356833889577315,"diet_4":-0.09740584089801511,"diet_5":-0.018450410362371866,"diet_6":-0.16000573821353706,"diet_8":-0.008843217012023766,"diet_9":-0.008778910281156035,"diet_10":-0.20574812679357515,"diet_11":-0.04344980823710406,"diet_13":-0.030083593204229448,"diet_14":-0.12430478949877966,"diet_17":-0.012780062798507666},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I don't think the fish are suffering there and they are not killed before their time... that's why I think it's an edge case.\n\nYou provide a good opportunity to think about what “exploit” means in the case of non-human animals. Some people seem to think it involves using animals without getting their informed, unforced consent first, which in the case of other animals isn’t really possible — so using animals is “exploitative,” or if not exploitative, then at least something we shouldn’t do, call it what you will. \n\nI think veganism is a movement to abolish the commodification and resourcification of sentient non-human animals. Confining and using fish in the way shown in the video is a form of coercively treating animals as a resource for us. \n\nSo far I haven’t said anything about ethics, just the descriptive goal of veganism. I think it best not to try to dictate to individual vegans what their underlying ethical views should be, for a number of reasons. \n\nIf your particular ethical motivation involves harm reduction or something like that, an option is to appeal to the reasonably expected harmful effects of society continuing to treat and even see animals as our resources, as being here for us, to be used as we like. The harmful history of that kind of human behavior is self-evident. So, this aquaponics way of treating these animals effectively promotes and is in-line with that general kind of practice and way of seeing, when opposition to that kind of thing may be called for instead, particularly if you’re a vegan who shares vegan goals. If you want, you can frame this matter in terms of a risk of harmful side-effects the promotion of this sort of practice may cause. A simple policy of “leave animals alone” certainly seems safer in terms of harmful risk, especially given our history. Anyway, that’s one strategy you can use.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00035927042093438405,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1503043657536182,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16192221294850995,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07842502370476723,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3710011943230408,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2847196198333911,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08726268510023753,"diet_1":-0.06723265009350143,"diet_2":-0.16752728805272454,"diet_3":-0.0768891875219424,"diet_4":-0.024965820177991798,"diet_5":-0.010575375176207066,"diet_6":-0.02384073776374862,"diet_8":-0.013670865412677813,"diet_9":-0.001697630617854884,"diet_10":-0.014732031286257552,"diet_11":-0.0071020254933197675,"diet_13":-0.006311891134828329,"diet_14":-0.1377968388236089,"diet_17":-0.008751497907117786},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
