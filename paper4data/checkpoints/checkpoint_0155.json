Its like saying, \"My grandma smoked for 40 years and didn't get lung cancer, so this proves that smoking doesn't cause cancer.\"  Yes, they are selling because people want electric cars. They will chose to buy them regardless of how silly they look, but, only in small numbers.  If they want to sell a LARGE AMOUNT that would actually change the game-- this is what I am talking about.  \n\nThey sold:\n1,025 so far- its been available since May.\n\nLast year, they sold 500,000 3 series cars and 300,000 5 series.\n\nIts a very small % of their product. So yes, they are selling. I am not saying NOONE wants them.  I am saying that a car like this will never main stream. They wont sell 300,000 of them in a year.  HOWEVER, if it looked like 325i, they would probably sell alot more.",

Would adding $26B in federal support speed up their development?\n\nRemoving C02. I have no faith that mankind will react in time to reduce CO2 levels. Can we develop technologies that can do this and make it as ubiquitous as trees? \n\nFederal research is increasing only incrementally. It may not be beating inflation at this point, and is declining in some areas, so I wouldn't hold out on a Manhattan Project anytime soon. Of course, Europe and China may see it differently and discover ways to improve energy storage. That will be good for mankind, but bad for U.S. industries.",

In any modern fuel injected vehicle, when the vehicle's transaxle is \"overspinning\" the engine, the engine does not go into idle; it actually shuts down the fuel injectors.  This is why if you drive down a theoretical five mile long hill, you will use less fuel in D than you would in Neutral, because the former does not need any fuel to keep the engine idling.",

It's quite obvious that if you calculate residual value against the list price that nobody pays instead of the actual price, as this analysis did, you'll get a ridiculously low result.*\n\nThis tax credit would not be reflective in the price or depreciation of the car because it would be accounted on your income tax, and because it also appears that this \"credit?\" varies \n\nhttp://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml",

There are 150kW SAE+Combo chargers under development, and I expect that Tesla will also unveil 150kW chargers as soon as they have a 100+kWh battery which can take full advantage.\n\nIn theory you could just run 2 150kW chargers in parallel to get 300kW DC. So the power side isn't the problem. Tesla's battery pack gets hot while supercharging(melting any ice/snow on the bottom of the car). I don't think that it could take much more power unless outdoor temperatures were low enough to allow it to shed heat quickly. You need a significantly better battery chemistry that heats less, tolerates heat better or a more efficient thermal management system. Probably all three to get to 300kW.\n\nI think it is possible but I think that it will be at least 10 years before this becomes a reality(technology developed, cars produced, charging network in place). Tesla has plenty of time to improve their tech.",

This comes from a statistic that (I can't attest to the validity) claims that for every Wh in a Model S battery pack, 472 Wh were expended to create it.\n\nConsidering that the pack can to some extent be recycled, and that 99.9% of Model S battery packs will be fully cycled at least 1000 times (if not far more, and then some), I'm not sure what the claim is here? The pack pays off its (purported) energy cost with plenty of surplus.",

What range?\n\nAs for Nissan, the point is that they never got over the compliance point, they never pushed over the limit, they stayed far under it to the point that they won't make even a footnote in the history of electric cars. Tesla will sell more than 200k in a year after they begin full production of the Model 3, in fact they received pre orders for more than that already. All the combined storage capacity of all the Nissan EVs is less than all the combined batteries of Tesla cars. That should say a lot considering how much fewer Tesla made.\n\nBut let's ignore all that because, somehow those that fail at advancing the technology beyond what has already been achieved must be lauded because reasons.",

But if a utility loses 5% of its revenue, unexpectedly without warning, over a period of a few years, *combined with entrenched resistance to change due to a variety of reasons*, that sets up the potential for some rather significant long-term rate hikes (whereas electric price increases usually are **below** inflation). \n\nIt might be the most significant disruption to the electric power industry in grid history, actually. We're talking state legislatures passing laws to \"tax\" battery-owners for using less power, similar to electric vehicle taxes. Followed by massive rate hikes which accelerate the grid-disconnection market. Time to chop down some trees.",

I'm assuming the the AC title means there is a built-in inverter or somesuch. The Tesla Powerwalls have no inverter built in to them. only a DC to DC converter. An inverter must be added after the fact, if the setup requires AC current. As it stands, it appears the Enphase product will only be in Australia and New Zealand for the time being. depending on where you are located, this may or may not be a problem.",

"comment": "&gt; That's not really range extending, that's full on plug-in hybrid territory. The range extender was always intended to be used alongside the battery.\n\nMmm, not convinced by that reasoning.\n\nYour average PHEV - Passat GTE, A3 E-Tron, Outlander PHEV, etc, split their power between the electric and petrol motors, and use both simultaneously under normal conditions.\n\nGM's approach to \"range extender\" was to make the petrol engine big enough to feed the electric motor, so it always drives \"like an electric\" - and you're meant to use all the battery then switch to using all the petrol. In practice they didn't quite achieve that goal, but it's WAY more complex than \"the volt is just another PHEV\"\n\nBMW's approach I'm less convinced by, pretty much for the reasons outlined in this class action - if you try to drive it entirely as a BEV but get caught short, you're suddenly short half your power (which has way more in common with the average PHEV than the Volt)",

And if you charge it with multiple superchargers in parallel charging will be reasonably fast as well (it'll require specialized charging stalls, of course, with one supercharger per 100KWh module) .\n\nBut you can also go shorter: There is definitely a very large business case for semis going 400-500 miles per charge. \n\nTesla does not have to address the long-haul coast-to-coast semis in 2019.

"comment": "I'm out at the moment but I'll read a bit.  As far as warranty, read the fine print.  Labor is covered for 5-10 years with ownership, if they're doing a 20 year bumper to bumper warranty then it's hard times at Sunpower and expect them to be out of business in 5.  No one promises a 20 year commitment on $13k.  \n\nAs far as the value, that is true but in 5 years it's a gamble whether you'll get the tax credit at all.  The best time to do solar in the northeast was about 10 years ago when you had a 3-4 year payback because of the incentives from the states.  \n\n5 years from now you'll also have made 20mwh of solar which is about $4-5k in value and the bottom line is your house has solar that you can include as part of an asking price if you sell it.  But just understand it'll take about 12-15 years to pay for itself in generation alone (but again the value of having solar will reflect in the value of your home so it's less than that if you're willing to buy into that concept).",

"comment": "&gt; From what you've described it sounds like a ground error\n\nEven though it may not change what you do, I think it's worth a quick check with one of [those cheapo outlet testers](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Gear-Receptacle-Indications-50542/dp/B002LZTKIA) (link to an example I got to via a quick Google search, no specific endorsement of that one). One of the things they test for is whether there's an open ground.\n\nNote, these outlet testers are not perfect. There are faults and combinations of faults they can't diagnose or can't completely diagnose. In this particular case, if I pull something out of my ass I can imagine the EVSE doing a more rigorous test of the *quality* of ground, so just because the outlet tester indicates that there's no open ground doesn't mean it's a good enough ground.\n\nI have vague memories of people saying that some EVSEs won't provide power if they don't have a good ground, so this could be it.",

"comment": "A 2.42 kW system is tiny. Typically anything under 3 kW is going to be overpriced. Our average installation in LA is 4.8 kW and goes for around ~$3.50/watt before rebates (closer to $3.70 for Panasonic/LG panels). \n\nBut if we did a 2.42 kW system then it would be around the $4.50/watt range, maybe even a touch higher. So as far as market prices go, the price is alright. Would I recommend installing that solar system on the house in the first place? Probably not. But with an outright purchase, you should still break even in 10-12 years after the 30% tax credit",

From a selfish perspective, that's exactly the corridor I care about, and so I'm super glad to see that the turnpike and EA are collaborating here.\n\nThe particular service plazas are only 50 miles apart, so I'd rather see one further east, but it's very encouraging that they're coming to an arrangement. All the superchargers along that route are a noticeable detour off of the highway, and having them right in the service plazas is a significant boon. I've got worries about congestion -- there will only be four chargers per -- but continuing to expand that network will go along way towards making the long distance trips I most care about eventually truly no compromise over an ICEV.",

"comment": "&gt; I'm leaning towards Microinverters. I don't like the idea of the hassle involved in replacing a centralized inverter in 10-12 years. I've heard arguments about one company not being as big or stable as the other (SolarEdge vs. Enphase), but it seems like both companies have been around a long time and will be around long enough to honor their warranties. Is there anything else to consider here? \n\nBoth are fine options for you so go with best price / most reputable installer.\n\n&gt; Tesla's website claims 1 powerwall can run the AC, WiFi, the lights, fridge, and charge your phone for a day in an outage. Is this realistic? Especially on a hot night in the summer, when we'll likely see an outage? \n\n1 PW is not likely to power your AC. On their site it says you need 2 as well. They updated their 'calculator' recently because this was not always the case. I know because I've had to make my own load calc as I take what they say with a grain of salt. Whatever size battery bank you decide on you will be able to reserve capacity for outages. Day to day your battery will discharge to offset your peak TOU consumption.\n\nLights, WiFi, TV, small appliances are fine but with these larger draw appliances you will need multiple batteries. This goes for PW and LG. I'd only consider PW, LG or PIKA. Sonnen is pricey for what you get and I can't speak to Enphase storage.",

Personally I think Toyota can step in any time in the next 3-5 years and still come out well. People here have a far too rosy idea about how quickly the change will happen, if Tesla hits its numbers over the next five years it's still not going to make a dent in the global car market, it's the 50% growth rate after 2025 where it would really start to bite.",

"comment": "IMO: Used EVs are OK for as long as they are still covered by the original warranty for the battery. When you buy an older EV you are frequently buying a car that has a battery that is no longer manufactured by anyone. If it is outside of the warranty period provided by the manufacturer it is quite an Achilles heel. If a cell or two in one module of the battery get flaky and \"brick\" the car, it will not run. While you might prefer just those cells or just that particular module be replaced, you'll likely face a binary choice of replacing the entire battery with a \\*refurbished\\* one at an high price (maybe $10-25k).",

Sure they can bring out the low range low trim Model 3 and Y and maybe cut 10k off the price, but that still pits them against basically all the other EVs coming to market. \n\nThe Ioniq/EV/GV model lineup is expanding, GM's Lyriq/Blazer/Equinox cars are launching, when that massive NeoPark comes online NIO will sure to be launching a lower cost mainstream model to increase their volume, higher priced BYDs like Seal and Sea Lion are launching in the next 12 months (the Seal undercuts the Model 3 by nearly 10k and easily got 20k preorders hours after launch), VW will continue to expand their ID production, luxury brands like Merc/BMW/Audi/Volvo will start launching lower priced EVs, and it goes on and on. It's gonna be an absolute meat grinder in that 40k-60k market segment, and I just don't see how Tesla picks up a million customers a year for the next 2 years against all that competition.",

Great write up on your trip. \n\nWe love taking road trips in our cars and did a a similar trip from Austin to Sioux City IA, it was during late spring so we didn't have to deal with the winter weather. \n\nYou bring up cost savings of EV vs ICE and definitely agree that people shouldn't expect much, if any, savings from public charging. There is a good way bring down charging costs on long trips. I see you used AirBnBs, we used to do the same but have changed back to using normal hotels for the simple reason that so many have Level 2 chargers available now that are free for guests. As you said \"nothing is free\" but it is included with cost of a room and you can get a (usually) full charge for the next day. Being able to get that first 200-250 miles of the day on a \"free\" charge that will knock $20-30 per day off the public charging cost.",

Even inside cities at places like McDonald's or Aldi I usually find 150 kW slim units.   \n\nThe early ID3 Pros used to take 35 minutes or even more for 10-80%, and the Pure version as well as the ID4 Pure and Enyaq 50 versions apparently didn't do more than 50 kW. The current ID3 Pure and Elroq 50 do 145 kW. I can't imagine the people who got the same model and trim just 3 years ago on the same technological platform are happy, and nor do I think new ID3 customers will know that the Pure is now an actually reasonable vehicle and not shite because nobody reviews every small change in Volkswagens (again comes down to them not being able to build even a small happy community that can look forward to updates and changes lol).  \n\nMaybe they can still turn it around. Maybe they can't. Who knows.",

The main challenges are:\n\n1) Heat. You need an effective way to dissipate the heat, as it not only causes safety issues and accelerates module degradation, it also makes the cells less efficient as they heat up. So, you need to add heatsinks or something.\n\n2) Tracking. You need to have the mirrors track the sun, or they'll be focusing the sunlight on the wrong spot. Sun trackers are notoriously expensive.\n\nSo, the technology is definitely viable. But converting it from utility-scale use down to residential-scale requires some problem solving, especially, as you note, on the safety issues.",

"comment": "If you want to flip houses, then installing small arrays may be a viable strategy. Real estate data indicated a \"green cachet\" value which is above the installation price of small arrays, but which quickly depreciates down to the electric value over ~4-5 years.\n\nIf you want to rent the house, then you really need learn a bit more about your utility solar policy to extract any value from renters. You're adding a 3rd party to a cash flow that's already difficult to justify. \n\nI only see two plays for renters: \n\n1) you're in a zone with a favorable time-of-day metering rate, and a solar roof which is ideal to take advantage of such a rate structure. At which point, you'd likely need to install other energy upgrades, such as service panel monitors, energy efficient appliances, and smart thermostats. I'm not certain you're willing to make that kind of investment.\n\n2) Your property is vacant, but you feel a solar array would differentiate it enough to increase your rental capacity. Of course this is a dice roll. If your property continues to sit vacant, then you could lose money. \n\n3) You have a vacant property that you think will stay vacant for a couple years. Installing a small array and battery bank means you could completely disconnect it from the grid, but still run the air-conditioner and other critical maintenance loads without paying grid-access fees. But of course, your goal is to rent out the property.\n\n4) Solar thermal might be a better fit. I'd love to rent a property with a cheap-to-operate hot tub!",

"comment": "I went to 5 different companies for quotes, and ended up with a local guy that mainly did commercial installs.  The Sunpower panels I got were leftovers from a large solar farm he'd worked on.  There was no kool aid to drink, his was best price per watt that I could find for a near 5 kw system.  I didn't want to go with microinverters because Enphase gen-1's were failing like crazy at the time and there hadn't been enough time in the field to know if the gen-2's would be more reliable.  \n\nI went with the Sunnyboy 5000TL inverter (thought it was neat to be able to have an outlet to harness my panels if we ever had blackouts), and because of my limited roof space, that helped me go for the higher density panels. \n\nIn 2013, what was the average price/watt for installs in CA?  Mine worked out to $2.69/watt (that is net tax credit and DC watts), which was only slightly more expensive than the cheapest quote I got at the time.  I have my spreadsheets and I just checked, the cheapest quote I had was $2.60/watt (net tax and DC watts) for a system with 17 LG panels (290 watts) and Enphase m215's.\n\nIf you're in the solar industry in CA, take a look at that price and tell me I overpaid.  Keep in mind I'm basing the watts off the DC rating of the panels, and the dollars are based off my cost net of the 30% tax credit.  I kept the spreadsheet with all my quotes and so I know my numbers are right.",

It doesn't get too warm too often in the area we live in, our appliances are gas, there are only 2 of us so I don't anticipate us actually being able to take advantage in savings. Oh and we don't get the tax benefits. I'm not ruling solar out in the future, but if I did get solar panels I would own them outright rather than be stuck in a 20 year lease. If I ever decide to sell the property, I won't have to worry about transferring or paying the lease off.",

"comment": "You can't just look at current electricity usage. Every year solar gets cheaper and fossil fuel energy gets more expensive. Over time, energy currently derived from fossil fuels will be replaced by electricity generated from solar.\n\nOf course there are electric automobiles that get a lot of press, but heating water and buildings is another huge growth area for electricity generated from solar panels to replace fossil fuels in the future.  Water heaters could be programmed to heat water during the day from cheap solar electricity and then shut off the heating element at night when rates are higher.  That kind of thing.\n\nThere is also time-shifting of electricity usage that will drive more solar installation.  Right now at night time, we use energy from fossil fuels.  In the future, we will have real time electricity pricing which will result in much cheaper electricity during the day than at night.  Once this happens, a lot of night time usage will be shifted to solar hours to take advantage of lower electricity rates and more solar will need to be installed to meet that demand. People will run their pool pumps, clothes washers, etc. during the day instead of at night, businesses will shift operations around, that kind of thing. \n\nI live in CA and have a 8 KW solar array on my house currently. Right now, that size makes sense for me.  In the future, I'm probably going to want to expand that to 20 or 30 KW so I can power my water heater, house heater, and electric cars, all of which currently use fossil fuels.  This is basically a huge future market for solar that you are not accounting for in your analysis.",

It also has additional pass-through fees that current solar owners on 1.0 don't have to pay.\n\nI could be wrong, but I think under 1.0, we only pay pass through fees (fees to maintain lines, nuclear decommissioning fee, etc. on the net amount of electricity we use.  Under 2.0, you pay pass through fees on gross amount of electricity used.  So lets say solar owner uses 1,000 kwh from grid and also sells 900 kwh back to the grid.  Under 1.0, solar owner pays pass through fees for 100 kwh.  Under 2.0, solar owner pays pass through fees on 1,000 kwh.  Again, I'm not 100% certain about this, but hHopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong.",

"comment": "&gt;  I might be misunderstanding the bid, but it was my understanding that the 400 watt Solar Edge inverter / optimizer is the inverter we will be using for the 330 watt Panasonic panel solution.\n\nYou are miss understanding the bid.  SolarEdge does not make a 400 watt inverter/optimizer.  They make the P400 which is an optimizer that works with any of their Inverters.  The inverters in the US are the SE3000, SE3800, SE5000, SE6000, SE7600, SE10000, and SE11400\n\n&gt; The idea to use this hybrid inverter being that we may want to add an onsite battery pack at some point and these will afford us the option to add a battery pack to them at some point in the future.\n\nSolarEdge does make a hybrid inverter which is the StorEdge and works with the powerwall or LGChem RESU10H but there is no indication that that is what you are getting.\n\n&gt; The size of the Mitsubishi and Panasonic panels was bid at 27 panels for each solution.\n\nwhy the same number of PV modules?   you are comparing :  \n27 X 280w Mitsubishi for 7.56kw  \n27 X 330w Panasonic for 8.91kw  \n27 X 285w Suniva     for 7.695kw\n\nIs 27 all that will fit?\n\n&gt; The Mitsubishi bid covered 71% of our current usage\n\nwell that is what the installer modeled out and it depends on the quality of their model and how well they took into account the shadows etc.",

Electric rates will go up. \n\nWhat you need is a solar array that will generate at $0.13/kWh+ to make economic sense, or to consider other values of solar as a backup power source, aesthetic upgrade for real estate value. \n\nYou can look at time of day metering, load shifting, etc.\n\nUltimately, nobody is going to get Net-metering. You might get it now, but what happens to the new home buyer 5 years from now? When approaching solar design, the designer might need a more holistic approach to energy distribution management in general. This is a small market today, but will be a huge market tomorrow.\n\nObstructing consumer-friendly solar policy harms the environment and we need to hold those responsible for this instruction legally responsible for this cost. In the past, this cost has been borne by the general public, because it has been cheap to do so. But no matter how you legislate a leaky dam, it's eventually going to burst.

"comment": "Compelled transaction?  In some states they'll pull your certificate of occupancy for not having electrical service connected.  In some states they'll get CPS involved under the guise of child endangerment.  They will literally send cops with guns to kick you out of your own home and steal your children.  How's that for a compelled transaction?  Can I assume you're not ok with that?\n\nIn most states you cannot choose your energy provider, the government has already picked winners and losers.  That's not the free market.\n\nAdmittedly, net metering isn't perfect.  There's an inherent disjoint between the cost to provide energy versus the price to consume it which without competition cannot be addressed.  There are a lot of subsidies that the power companies are already getting on the back of tax payers.  If they had to actually pay property tax for every pole they placed, pay rent for every easement they crossed, actually pay the medical costs for all their pollution, they're get crushed in a heartbeat.\n\nAs it is with net metering the power exported by residential solar during the day is more valuable than the power imported at night.  Net metering would expose that.  Distributed generation exports power by where it's consumed reducing the stress on the grid.  Net metering makes that free to the utility.  The current laws already say residential consumers have to be net consumers or else they get penalized by having the government fix the selling price lower than what the utility would pay to produce it or buy it from a neighboring utility.\n\nThis law is just further governmental price fixing below the costs to produce.  It's a giant transfer of wealth into corporations and it helps to eliminate competition.  How the fuck is that a free market?",

Well, these new panels are the long awaited \"Sunpower NGT panels\" (Next Generation Technology). Sunpower announced they were working on them last year and the goal was very high efficiency like the X series, but at a vastly reduced cost. So yes this is big, big news for those of us interested in these types of ultra high efficiency panels!\n\n&gt; The panels are likely to offer conversion efficiencies of around 23% (roughly in line with SunPower’s top-of-the-line X-Series panels), although **costs are likely to be between 30% to 40% lower.** The company is achieving these cost reductions by deploying larger wafers, which increase the number of watts of power delivered by each cell, while also limiting capital expenditures.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/07/sunpower-q4-preview-ngt-panel-rollout-in-focus/#50d2a70b4863",

If you're not an authorized Tesla installer,  explore Pika (now Generac) or Sonnen ($$). Another option would be getting Enphase to rebate you for a subsidized upgrade to IQs, which will then be compatible with Ensemble. Note the upgrade approach will not be fast if timing is a factor.\n\nFor my home, I'd like to evaluate the new Panasonic and LGChem standalone boxes, similar to the Sky Box, but I can be patient.",

It would be very stupid not to be.\n\nI'm not aware of any company that would cover golf ball damage while living on a golf course. \n\nOn the technical side, I think your best bet would be sunpower maxeon solar panels with microinverters. They're significantly tougher and a damaged cell will only decrease performance slightly. A damaged module with microinverters won't affect the rest of the array. With a normal module you'd lose at least 30% of a module's output after one of those impacts and with string inverters you'd lose around 15-30% of total system performance after a single impact.",

The point isn’t that it is practical right now to put a solar panel on a car, but it isn’t so far off from being useful in certain situations. I mean, they did already have the concept cars that went across Australia using solar only. \n\nCamping vehicles might be among the first for which solar panels do make sense....NOT daily commuters or long haul trucks.",

"comment": "Solar Panels and windmills take up valuable space that could be used for something else. They're also intermittent and unreliable and don't always produce energy and methods to fix this are just overly complicated and the reason  why nuclear power is so backlogged is because we don't use a standardized reactor model. Take France, they use standardized reactor models and most of their energy comes from nuclear and they never had a incident with their power. \n\nAlso, nuclear has the highest capacity factor.

"comment": "I'm not entirely sure why you might want to do that, but reading between the lines I'm guessing you're thinking it might be a way to standardize solar panels in \"plug and play\" sort of way. For purposes of building power systems, solar panels and systems are already somewhat standardized, but it's a set of standards that is incompatible with consumer electronics standards like USB, and for good reason -- generating and moving large quantities of electricity is a much different than charging a phone or powering an external hard drive.\n\nAnyway, let's assume you're still not convinced and take a look at the technical side. USB is designed to operate only at low power levels. The ports are always at 5V and the standard with the highest current is USB-C, at 3A, for a maximum of 15W. That's about three solar cells -- versus 60 or 72 cells per standard panel. Those three cells would only produce about 1.5V when connected in series, so you would need to add a DC-DC converter to each panel to increase the voltage before you could connect it via USB. By the time you're done, I expect you'd have a tiny, surprisingly bulky, expensive, and rather inefficient solar panel. Plus, you would have to install 20-24 of them for every \"normal\" solar panel you need to install now, which means a lot more wiring, which means higher installation costs. Finally, you would also have to adapt the USB cables themselves if your wire runs go beyond a certain length.",

Trying to determine how different some of these providers/installers are on price yet also how reliable they are but most important what is the average REAL savings per month on overall bill. I don't want to agree then find my electric bill doesn't really change that much. I understand variables but looking for general real numbers. Thx",

But you do so at the expense of external 1- or 2-axey trackers. This has proven not to be economically viable.\nEdit: you can do so with mirrors or lenses.",

"comment": "\"Edge-of-Cloud-Event\", or \"Cloud Lensing\". It’s been talked about a number of times on here, but here’s a cool visual of the phenomenon. This occurs when solar irradiance is actually HIGHER right as a cloud passes over a solar array, than it would be even on a totally sunny day WITHOUT any clouds. This occurs for a couple reasons: 1. water + ice molecules inside the cloud reflect and refract the sunlight to \"add on\" extra irradiance (more than a direct sunbeam would measure), as the sunlight \"lenses\" around the cloud  2. when the solar panels are shaded, they are cooler (and as we know, the cooler the solar panel, the more efficiently it can operate). So when the sun blasts out from behind a cloud, it has a brief period of higher conversion efficiency before it warms back up. Here's an example from the system on my roof: you can see that on a cloudy day, I actually max out my inverters at 5,900W (20 panels with 295W Enphase microinverters = 20*295=5900) as clouds pass over the system, and that doesn't even happen on a sunny, cloudless day (which typically maxes out around 5,600 W)!  It's a fascinating phenomenon, and how cool that it is measurable even with standard rooftop solar arrays.",

"comment": "I don't understand why the string inverter is quoted with the 330 W modules. Why not using the 360 W modules there also? That would bring the power of the solar array much closer to the rated power of the suggested inverter.\n\nSize-wise the 330 W modules are about 10 cm/4 inches shorter than the 360 W modules. Maybe this makes the difference that fits 14 slightly shorter modules in the same space as 13 slightly longer. However, assuming 2 rows of panels this makes no sense to me.",

"comment": "Yes, the solar tax credit is a tax credit.  [26 USC section 25D](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/25D) is entitled \"Residential clean energy **credit**.\"  Subsection (a) states \"In the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a **credit** against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the sum of the applicable percentages of—\" I don't think anyone who has read the law would think it isn't a tax credit. \n\nAs for the carryover being a one time event, that is probably wrong.  First, there is a lot of confusion with that subsection and I can see how it looks like the carryforward would apply for only one year.  26 USC Section 25D(c) states:\n\n&gt;(c)  Carryforward of unused credit  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If the credit allowable under subsection (a) exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a) for such taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under this subpart (other than this section), such excess **shall be carried to the succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable under subsection (a) for such succeeding taxable year.**\n\nHowever, the credits do carryforward to multiple years. In 2013, after subsection (c) was amended to its current form by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P. L. 112-240), the IRS issued [Notice 2013-70](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-70.pdf#page=2).  In Q-3 and A-3, the IRS wrote:\n\n&gt;Q-3: May a taxpayer carry forward unused credits to another tax year?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;A-3: . . .  a taxpayer may carry the § 25D credit forward to **future tax years** pursuant to § 25D(c). \r\n\nNotice use of the word \"years.\" So basically, the tax credit is carried forward to the next year, one year at a time, so it isn't limited to being carried forward for just one year. Here's an article about carryforward of tax losses that can be carried forward indefinitely until used up.

So, of course the solar providers oversize the system to ensure you are paying for more electricity than you need. Even with net metering, it's usually a losing proposition. So, yeah the RATE might be cheap... but you are paying that rate for 150% of the electricity you actually need.",

"comment": "I ordered through a company called SunHub out of Cincinnati area, worked with a guy named Mitch. We had some disagreement because I insisted on removing the 3’ fire lane (my area doesn’t need it) and maximizing my coverage. They were patient with me and quoted different panels before I settled on these. I got drawings from them too. We had some issues on sizing per NEC but they got resolved. I’d just advise you to double check everything meets your plans before approving the final set- hard to have somebody paint your house if you don’t spec the colors, you know.\n\nI went with UniRac, as what they spec’d me but having learned and talked to local installers (more below) I would pass on their recommendation of the Unirac flashless mounts but the Snap n Rack rail- apparently they like it because it can serve as a bit of cable chase between modules whereas the Unirac SM rail I used to just had the t slot. I used it to slide a Q Cable PV wire in, but it wasn’t convenient. So go flashless mounts and save yourself the agony of prying shingles, and research the racks before you settle on one.\n\nI did DIY it. I did all of it bar one- I did anchors and flashing, racking, j boxes and penetrations, conduit, all wiring, software, scheduled inspection and interconnect… all but module setting*. 9/12 roof, so when the roofers were doing the re-roof ahead of my project I had them install fall arrest anchors all over and I used those to tie off while I worked. I recommend that, and I recommend buying real roof boots with the shingle treads- next to no damage to your new soft roof and excellent traction. \n\n*I did not do the re-roof, that’s a skill beyond me, and I was not satisfied with my work installing the actual modules and worried I would hurt myself doing it or do a bad job, so I contacted some local IBEW Union solar installers and three guys came out and did a cash install for me of the modules themselves. They pulled up the 20 or so I’d done and reset them and got all the rest down IN A SINGLE DAY. Those guys are pure f*ing animals. I had rented a scissor lift to make it easier on myself, so I fed them panels and they threw them down. Hiring pros for that part was a smart decision- my work there was not as good and was beyond my physical ability.\n\nPM me if I can help ya! It’s certainly a journey and it’s worth taking. 12.2 MW made so far.",

"comment": "Summarized article via AI:\n\n*My favorite trick is to just paste the link in even if paywalled*\n\nThe link you provided is a column by Sammy Roth³, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who covers climate change, energy and the environment. The column is titled \"California strikes another blow against rooftop solar\" and it was published on November 16, 2023. Here is a summary of the column:\n\n- The column criticizes a recent decision by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to reduce the compensation that rooftop solar owners receive for selling their excess electricity to the grid. The decision also imposes new fees on solar customers to cover the costs of maintaining the grid and supporting low-income and wildfire programs.\n- The column argues that the CPUC's decision is unfair and shortsighted, as it will discourage more Californians from installing rooftop solar panels and batteries, which are essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to power outages. The column also claims that the decision is based on flawed assumptions and outdated data that overestimate the costs and undervalue the benefits of rooftop solar.\n- The column cites several studies and experts that challenge the CPUC's rationale and support the case for rooftop solar. For example, the column mentions a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that found that rooftop solar reduces the need for expensive transmission and distribution upgrades, and a report by the California Energy Commission that estimated that rooftop solar could provide up to 40% of the state's electricity by 2050.\n- The column concludes by urging the CPUC to reconsider its decision and adopt a more balanced and forward-looking approach that recognizes the value of rooftop solar and encourages its growth. The column also calls on the state legislature and the governor to intervene and protect the rights of solar customers and the climate.\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 11/17/2023\n(1) Sammy Roth - Los Angeles Times. https://www.latimes.com/people/sammy-roth.\n(2) Climate & Environment - Los Angeles Times. https://www.latimes.com/environment.\n(3) Central Coast residents work to halt offshore wind farms - CalMatters. https://calmatters.org/environment/2023/10/california-offshore-wind-central-coast/.\n(4) California - Los Angeles Times. https://www.latimes.com/california.",

Renewables are great on a sunny, windy day like today when wind and solar farms between them are generating 21 gigawatts of power. It is rather less good on calm winter evenings when they can struggle to generate 1 gigawatt. What makes it possible to incorporate so much wind and solar power in our energy mix is gas power plants, which can be turned up or down at short notice to balance variable and unpredictable renewable power.",

There's not really any huge health benefit to completely excluding animal products as opposed to eating moderate quantities together with plenty of veg, but neither does it do any harm, and thus many consider it more ethical as it does not involve cruelty to animals. \n\nBasically, assuming your diet is otherwise healthy and balanced going vegan will likely be neutral to your health. However, vitamin B12 can be difficult to get enough of since only fortified vegan foods contain it in quantity. Luckily B12 supplements are very cheap, safe , proven effective and readily available. \n\nI suggest you check out the vegan society's advice on nutrition if you consider going vegan.",

If you're getting fancy add tomatoes, lettuce and vegan cheese to sandwich and then bake in the oven real quick (\"buttered\" bread optional) to melt the cheese/crisp the bread. Delicious!

Add to this situation that culturally-specific foods are **important** and not always easily replicateable. These can all be huge obstacles in the way of going to a vegan diet.\n\nAnd \"spare time\" is fucking precious. Between working ten to eighteen hours a day and taking care of kids, there are very few people who want to take time out of their relaxation to cook out of reverence to an ideology. People deserve their rests, especially when society already asks more of them than it already should.\n\nAnd as to the sexism/other isms bit... I'd wager that you haven't looked far enough. I've seen quite a lot of it in this very board. Remember a few weeks ago, for example, when Lady Gaga showed up in another passe meat dress? Tons of comments on the threads here excoriated her not for her actions, but for her *looks*. They portrayed her as a horrible, unwantable, corrupted object because she'd gained some amount of weight. As if her suddenly being less attractive in the light of patriarchal standards made her a horrible person in and of itself.\n\nThe main, most visible strand of veganism out there needs to have a serious talk as to what *fat-shaming* and *misogyny* mean.",

"comment": "That is valid. \n\nThey probably never took an interest in your health because they thought you were an omnivore. Obviously, since they're not as educated about being a vegan as vegans are, they're going to express amazement at how you get your protein because you don't even have dairy. Some people are so undereducated in nutrition that they don't know that beans have protein. \n\nI have a friend who actively avoids googling in some instances because it's far more interesting and entertaining hearing the answers from an expert. I felt that way, too. Do I want to read a wikipedia article at my desk or do I want to engage in an interesting conversation with a vegan about nutrition? Really? \n\nI've been a vegetarian for a number of years and I have never gotten tired of helping people learn. Its when they start telling me that I'm wrong and animals are the only source of protein that I get tired of the comments and questions. If it's just somebody being inquisitive and wanting to learn, why would I be snobby and impatient?",

Take it easy.\n\nI mean, even if you drink non-vegan beer you're still making a huge difference.\n\nA good strategy to eventually veganise your drinking I think would be to look up some common beers and make a mental note of which are vegan - then go with those and gradually expand your repertoire. I'm guessing you have a few standard places you go to so just note down what beers they have and see which ones work (taste-wise and ethics-wise).\n\nSame thing can be applied to tobacco and rizzlas really. If you have to buy the rizzlas online why not just buy them in bulk? Keep a stash.",

"comment": "Deer hunter checking in. Thanks for taking the time to talk with and listen to some hunters, our group too often gets stereotyped, misrepresented, and misunderstood. I think most vegans know what that's like!\n\nI've been dating a vegan for a while, so obviously we discuss these kinds of things a lot. I've noticed that we feel the same way about a lot of core issues in veganism- environmental damage, sustainable land use, healthy food, and animal welfare/cruelty. I don't like the industrialization of our farms, I don't like the deplorable ways they treat livestock, and I don't like the general disconnect people have with where their food comes from.\n\nThe big difference is how we each ultimately deal with these issues. I'm a very outdoorsy, self-sufficient person so I see hunting and fishing as a way to get local, sustainable high-quality food. I only take animals with a healthy population that can sustain hunting in the long term (I know overabundance can be a contentious issue, but deer populations  in my area are stable at the very least), and I do so in the most humane way possible.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't believe that hunting wild populations is the answer to our food problems: it can't be scaled up without wiping out populations (see market hunting in the 1800s). This is one reason I have so much respect for vegans in general, it really is the only wide scale solution.\n\nHonestly, I think what hunters and vegans share is that we're both actively thinking about where our food comes from. Taking a life is a sobering experience (or at least it should be) and if anything it has made me more empathetic to animal welfare, whereas the average person buys a cut of meat with no more consideration than buying a box of crackers.\n\nAlso, I want to mention that I did not grow up hunting. I started on my own in my early 20s, and I pretty much stopped buying meat around the same time. I'd also be happy to answer any questions people have about hunting as best I can.",

"comment": "&gt; What would you gain in the long run? Do other animals not gain that same thing?\n\nWhen I think of the long run, I think of what happens to the species beyond the individual's lifetime. So in the long run, because humans are civilized, we continue to create and add to our human civilization. We progress in the long run in some way, technologically, socially, etc\n\nOther animals don't do this much at all. They don't create in the way we do and leave much if anything for future generations to build upon and leave for further future generations.\n\n&gt; Ceasing to eat animals doesn't require that we drive them out of existence, and that's not going to happen within our lifetimes. That said, if the choice for an animal is between a life of almost nothing but pain and no life at all, I think the second is better. I think the idea of a species benefiting just from existing is rather odd; species is an abstract concept, not something that actually exists in the world.\n\nWell many animals would go out of existence in the long run(beyond our lifetime) and depending on the vegan, that is what they want, all 'bastardized' versions of animals we created to no longer exist as they are not 'natural' animals.\n\nI would possibly agree with you if that is the choice, non existence vs a life of pain. That is not however the situation. Industrial farming has many problems with it, cruelty being one of them, but it is not the only method of farming. I have several friends that raise chickens for example, they are chickens in peace, at least when they're not being dicks to each other(lol).\n\nI'm also not convinced that a life of pain is worse than not existing. Pain is part of being alive. Most people older than 60 have some sort of chronic pain, yet they don't kill themselves and choose to keep living. Generally, I feel existence is better than non-existence.\n\nWhy do any species exist outside of for the sake of existing? You have creatures like some [cicadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas) that will live underground practically dormant, barely moving, eating mostly dirt, for about 17 years, then they leave the ground, swarm, breed, die, and their young start all over. What do they have other than existing really? Spending most of their life doing almost nothing in dirt, less than an earthworm, then breeding and dying for their young to do the same?\n\n&gt; The desire to avoid suffering is pretty much universal among those who can feel it, so I think it's a good thing to reduce it. Do you think that reducing human suffering matters? If not, why not? If so, why does reducing animal suffering not also matter? (Again, honest questions.)\n\nThe desire to avoid suffering is instinctual. We also remember moments of suffering very well, much better than joyous moments, so we have even more incentive to avoid it. The fact that suffering feels bad however does not necessarily make it bad. Why is it rationally bad?\n\nThe goal of reducing suffering, I can't see what it really achieves other than appeasment of feelings for both those that suffer and those that are concerned about those suffering. It doesn't produce new ideas or new technology that humanity can use to progress further.\n\nSuffering can be bad, it can be good, it depends on the circumstances. Life requires suffering, can you have childbirth without suffering?\n\nThe question then becomes about 'necessary' suffering. But why is life itself necessary? Childbirth is not necessary, should it be avoided to reduce suffering?",

What happened in this thread was the largest brigade this subreddit has seen (at least in my two years here). \n\nI am not afraid of downvotes (people like to downvote vegans).  I just prefer to have conversations that are based on good faith and open exchange of ideas,  neither of which are really possible in the environment created by you and your peers.  This could have easily been avoided if you had challenged your peers who were abusing the downvote feature,  engaging in abusive language,  and refrained being abusive yourself. \n\nMe hoping you enjoy your visit here isn't BS.  Despite the circumstances that brought you here,  I think it would be awesome if some of you looked around and learned something about veganism.",

"comment": "I see the existence of labels like these as a defense mechanism by the animal exploitation industry. Consumers have ethical concerns, the industry feels threatened, consumers might stop buying, so it responds by putting a happy face on their product. \"Don't worry, our chickens are not tortured. That badly. It's fine. Don't feel guilty about buying these eggs.\"\n\nThe sad thing is that so many so-called \"animal rights organizations\" and \"animal advocates\" *promote* or *praise* \"cage free\", \"free range\" etc. as if these corporate defense mechanisms were in fact ends worthy of pursuit in themselves. For example, some have publicly hailed as a \"victory\" or \"success\" the fact that some fast food chain or other has \"pledged\" to go \"cage free\" by the year 2025. But promoting or praising these kinds of labels is not a step in the right direction. It is a step *backwards*. Because when *even* the \"animal rights people\" are hailing \"cage free\" etc. as a \"victory\", then it simply *reinforces* the desired effect of the animal exploitation industry, to make people feel better about continuing to buy and consume eggs. It *reinforces* the general effort of industry to *sanitize* exploitation. To make it more outwardly palatable.\n\nBut the animals' most basic rights are still being violated.\n\n*Actually* advocating for animal rights -- as opposed to animal welfare -- would look very different to what the large \"animal organizations\" are doing. It would *start* from the recognition that animals have the minimum, most basic right not to be used as property, as products, as mere things. It would recognize that, as a direct consequence of this, we have a moral obligation to be vegan -- i.e. to personally refrain from using animals as property, products, things. And it would proceed from there to advocate unequivocally for veganism as a moral obligation. Advocating directly for ethical veganism isn't *nearly* as hard as people make out, if it's done intelligently and in a respectful, nonviolent way. The vast majority of nonvegans *already believe* the basic principle that it's wrong to inflict unnecessary suffering on animals. We need to communicate clearly to people that veganism is the only way of living that is consistent with that basic belief; that it's not an \"extreme\" proposition at all. If only \"animal rights organizations\" promoted veganism unequivocally in those terms, instead of promoting \"cage free\" etc..\n\n(Edit: minor wording.)",

"comment": "I can't stand when other vegans are apologetic or \"compromise\" out of social embarrassment/peer pressure. And I say this as someone who used to have that instinct and say \"sorry for being a pain in the arse\" if it affected a group's plans. There is always some kind of expectation that you ought to feel like an annoyance or have no expectation of finding something to eat but I think we're better advocates for the animals when we remain polite but don't cave or excessively apologise.\n\nI spent this past weekend in a small Dutch country town and ate at a few restaurants there with omnis. In one the staff all crowded round my phone with the Vegan Passport app open and spent five minutes checking through their allergen/ingredients list looking for something and it turned out there was nothing. They looked at me like I was some kind of exotic alien species. My friend was also standing there kind of making jokes etc. like it was a big deal. Previously I would have been deeply embarrassed by this and maybe just caved and had something with butter in it or whatever but I was like \"thank you for the effort but we'll go somewhere else\". \n\nThere's no need to be meek or act like *we're* the problem. If they insist on putting animal products in everything *they're* the problem.",

Especially considering they dont have easy access to supplements.  \n\nAnyways this conversation has degraded a lot and now it's turned into am argument about the merits of veganism as opposed to how can we better help the most vulnerable and under privileged people of the world find even daily meals , facilities to bathe , sleep or even use the bathroom.\n\nI guess they can just hang out around jadens gated house and maybe he will get his chef to whip em up some tasties",

I need my car to get to work / live my life in the burbs.  But changing what I eat was doable and more impactful.\n\nNow that I'm here it amazes me how the ethics of consumption have come into focus for me.  I thought very little about animal well being while I was eating them.  But now looking at my own personal notions of \"sentience\" and \"agency\" I can't help but understand how monstrous the whole endeavor is.  Knowing now how little I am hurt or even inconvienienced by this lifestyle I wouldnt dream of going back.",

It's fine to come in asking for help, and i've always seen these posts received very positively!  \n\n\nBut someone coming in to argue isn't here to get their opinion changed. They're here because they want to soothe their ego and convince themselves they are right. They can go to debate a vegan sub if they want that. And people who want to reduce but not eliminate their animal consumption can go to the plant based dieter sub lol.  We're not being rude by telling debatebros to fuck off to the debate sub or criticizing their excuses.  \n\n\nIf a terf comes into a LGBT sub, it's good actually that they are treated with exclusion and kicked out. Similarly, Carnism is literally a violent ideology, and hugboxing is not an effective method of countering violent beliefs. De-radicalization is, and that starts with opening their eyes to how radical and violent their beliefs really are and not giving them a pass on them anymore.",
