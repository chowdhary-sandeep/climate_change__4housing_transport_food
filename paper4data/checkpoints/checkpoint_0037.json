That article is relying on a piece written by Vivian Vetrano, who is [not even a medical doctor](http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2013/01/398-vivian-vetrano.html). \n\nHer piece is just a bunch of her opinions written on her retreat's website and based on no actual evidence. It isn't even a study, much less peer-reviewed. The previous link also includes a lawsuit involving a man who died under her care after her \"natural\" therapy. Here is [Jack Norris' response](http://jacknorrisrd.com/response-to-vegan-vitamin-b12-deficiency-is-a-myth/) to the piece.\n\nHonestly, my intuition tells me to follow empirical evidence, which shows that it is really not worth avoiding B-12 tablets.

The reason I say this is because you get into a big space contention scenario after you finally convince your employer to install a couple of expensive level 2 charging stations and by that time the number of EV drivers has quadrupled. Then you end up having to coordinate who is charging when and why dude doesn't move his car after it's finished charging so you can have a go. It gets messy and crazy. For the same money you could've installed dozens of 110 outlets. These are fine for work because of the amount of time you spend there. 8-9 hours is plenty of time to get a charge. \nEdit: or at the very least go ahead and install one or two level 2 charging stations and a vast number of outdoor 110 outlets.

But after, I got convinced that a regular 4-wheeler was quite as feasible. So, I started off with an old Toyota Starlet (4 cylinder , rear-wheel driven car) [here] (http://imgur.com/YEfhvck), weighs about 600kg with its old engine, but has a good, sturdy body. Acquiring a &gt;10KW DC motor in Ethiopia has not been easy, so I went with the AC motor&amp;controller option. I preferred this ecause the city I live in is full of hills (like rolling country), so I think I can get considerable mileage with the regenerative breaking the AC setup brings. I am still considering various controller vendors (I liked the OpenRevolt controller most, however, I won't be building my own controller any time soon). Following people's advice, I wont remove the existing gearbox, as it may come in handy for steep slopes and what not.\nRight now, I am at the steps of setting up the motor-gearbox coupler. Next I will buy a controller. A buddy of mine also wants his car (Toyota Hilux Pickup) converted, yay!\nWhere I work, team in my department is trying to research and show the role and viability of electricity in the transportation sector. More importantly, in land-locked, non-oil producing countries like ours, this is very important!

Prices. Yes it is true low-sunlight areas have less sun, and dust may increase the cost of maintenance. But you have to always compare that to cost, and alternative cost. At $0.9 / kwh, solar was on par with Gas in UAE, and the dust thing might have tipped the scale, if that adds a cost of say $0.005 / kwh. But at less than $0.3/kwh as the latest won bid was, the dusting cost is miniscule compared to the big cost advantage. As solar prices keeps falling, it is gradually becoming price-competitive in more and more markets, with varying levels of sun and varying levels of alternative power costs.\n\n2. Batteries. There's batteries abound. Yes, you got the lithium batteries coming up, with Tesla and the ever-growing fleet of electric cars. But in a big economy there are thousands of indirect batteries. Example: In Norway we have 99% Hydro. Hydro is basically a big battery, because you can empty the reservoir whenever you want, to sell when the price is the highest. Effectively working as a huge battery for Europe. There's also lots of demand-side batteries, like factories that have high-energy production, and similarly can start and stop production according to prices. \nThese are just three examples. As long as you have a grid, and variable pricing, you can offset a lot of energy fluctuations using costless energy storing mechanisms, as well as complementary energy mechanisms (like wind, gas, hydro)\n3. Growth. The whole world economy is growing at about 3-4% a year. \n\nSo to sum it up. Solar could pass 50 %, just at current trajectories and technology and energy storage mechanisms. And with even better batteries, it can reach 100 %. But even then, the growth of 3-% yearly, given that this was solar, would always need to be made, and this is the solar panel industry's long-term option (together with, as you said, replacements).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.12380944440762202,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1415184321972333,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21409984593686857,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30840816752834144,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32242086457276853,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2099155554705327,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19599404617717178,"ev_1":-0.1574803557739759,"ev_2":-0.11460617849541391,"ev_3":-0.1670435566018527,"ev_4":-0.08146128169409106,"ev_5":-0.07337266882732073,"ev_6":-0.08250198852456185},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

They're just a tall car. If I'm buying a performance car then why would I want to make it have *worse* handling by raising its center of gravity?\n\nI understand why they did it ($), but I don't like that they gave it the Mustang name. Just call it the Mach-e. Or better yet, something else entirely, saving the \"mach\" name for an actual mustang.\n\nI feel like it's a car that doesn't really know what it wants to be. It has the ride height of a regular car (it sits lower than a Subaru WRX), but is tall like a CUV. Then they try to hide that height with a weird black section on the back of the roof line.\n\nIMO the mustang styling cues just don't work. About the only thing that does is the tail lights, but even those don't help the weird looking rear end that seems to be just a bunch of unstyled sheet metal. This goes back to it being a CUV (I don't like the way 99% of them look), but there are a select few that can look good: the Model Y and I-Pace come to mind.\n\nI hate that if you get the GT you have to get it with that fake grille. They actually did the non-grille-front-end-but-have-a-nod-to-one-anyway-because-people-can't-seem-to-let-them-go grille pretty well, IMO. And in the non-GT models apparently the acceleration tapers off really fast after 30 mph. My Volt does that and its drivetrain is well over a decade old at this point.\n\nAnd then there's the price. It's priced to basically be a direct competitor to the Model Y, but it doesn't do anything better than the Model Y. At each price point it has slightly less range than the model y, it's heavier, it doesn't look as nice, and it charges a lot slower. I'd rather just save the 10 grand and buy the Model 3.\n\nBottom line: I prefer cars that are actually cars. And if I'm going to be buying a truck or SUV it's not going to be for performance, it's going to be because I want it to be either capable like a Rivian, or an ultra comfortable car, like the I-Pace or E-Tron.

The reason there are laws like this in Texas, is to protect people's jobs from company's like tesla that are reducing OH costs by going direct to consumer model. While Texas is pretty libertarian, they will still listen to lobbyists protecting large groups of workers. And while some people seem crabby that there are price hikes,the direct to consumer model has had literally the same price increases and on the other side of the same coin, for the last 30 years you could walk into a dealership and get most cars for under MSRP any day of the week.

Nuclear power may not be necessary. A combination of grid interconnections, demand response in the form of smart grid and others, and storage technology should be sufficient. Perhaps we need some peaker (peak electricity) natural gas plants with carbon capture and storage for the interim.  \nGrid interconnections, integrating the grid across North America and Europe if not the world with common standards and high voltage lines is very important to export and import power when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing in a particular area.. to avoid the problem of over generation and under generation. We need a  mix of renewables that are geographically dispersed.  Similarly a smart grid where electric vehicles and other devices can communicate with the grid  and adjust their charging window and charging rate based on the grid load will help with demand response. Storage technology is still quite far behind because we can currently only store seconds worth of power in most cases except where there's dams. Pumped Hydro is the most common form of storage. . Perhaps in the future hydrogen could play a role in storage, converting excess renewables to hydrogen via electrolysis.  \nNuclear plants are typically used for base load but are not good as a peaker.. because of its ramp up times. Come to think of it, the concept of Base load is actually a limitation. It signifies inflexibility. Base loads only currently exist because of how electricity wholesale markets work where the cheapest is dispatched first.  I do not rule out nuclear power plants a priori. Nuclear is actually safer and less radiation despite popular conception. Coal ash is more radioactive than nuclear ash. However storage and proliferation remain a concern. Perhaps Gen III and Gen IV nuclear reactors can help address this. Rather my position is Nuclear may not be required and most pathways to Net zero shows including Nuclear in the mix  in the pathway to Net Zero actually increases total cost.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.024318578963478405,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25517983646249986,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2821504026359369,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27987071571310906,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27859735678181385,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20767638920429976,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.30242952494882047,"ev_1":-0.14105357102616695,"ev_2":-0.2214079090820936,"ev_3":-0.13082477240580678,"ev_4":-0.21499648581956687,"ev_5":-0.05291021496426159,"ev_6":-0.0851069089560764},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

In this case, if you pick lower efficiency panels, you get a better IRR/ROI but you are left buying more power from the power company at prices you have no control over. If you pick higher efficiency panels, the IRR/ROI is typically worse (these panels are more expensive), but you reduce the amount of power you will ultimately buy from the utility. At the highest level, if consumption exceeds roof space, your long-term savings from the solar panels will be considerable smaller with a lower efficiency system vs. a high efficiency system. A good analogy (assuming consumption exceeds roof space and there are no caps on the incentives) would be a pair of mutual funds - one (the lower efficiency) has a better percentage yield, but you can only make a small investment. The higher efficiency mutual fund has a lower percentage yield, but you can make a bigger investment and get a larger gross return on your investment (and get a larger amount of cost avoidance and lower susceptibility to future utility rate increases). Again, this is not relevant if available space for solar exceeds consumption - in this case, high-quality, lower efficiency panels are the better deal - why pay more to stop your meter?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00286104865760232,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16823481308399083,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2302821971647434,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3419689135969206,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07624125569896023,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13537252774678857,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.029944429368091125,"solar_1":-0.12030994035520447,"solar_2":-0.23619125815080672,"solar_3":-0.16160196038496602,"solar_4":-0.19361202900853317,"solar_5":-0.08120423510990804,"solar_6":-0.055858184372482356,"solar_7":-0.003244153136620298,"solar_8":-0.012459820602089167,"solar_9":-0.26879483960076267,"solar_10":-0.17782616866396792},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

You can do it yourself but since everything has to be per their rules it is probably better to go with a solar installer who can do everything for you.  Essentially the system is completely separate from your own use.  So all the electricity you produce is being dumped directly to the grid.    The bill you get now will continue and you will get a separate statement every two months that will show the amount of electricity produced and you will get payment for that amount.    \n\nThe MicroFIT program is revised on an ongoing basis.   When it was first implemented the amount you got paid was very cost because the cost of the solar systems were high.   The amount has been slowly decreased at teh cost of the systems have fallen.  Currently for a 10kW system you would get paid 29.4 cents per kWh.  The contract you would sign is for 20 years at that rate. \n\nI would contact a some good solar installers and have them come out and do site survey.   They should be able to tell you what size system you can install, how much your production will be and give you a quote on the cost of the system.  They give you a time to pay back.  \n\nIn my case I had my system installed in 2013.   I got in right at the end of the one cycle where they still paying 54.9 cents per kWh but prices of the systems have fallen fairly low.   I have a 9kW system and paid 33,400 for it all in - system, permits, labour, etc.    I am not sure what the current cost would be for a similar system.  I assume prices would have had to dropped.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0016640584993486602,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2666724101948647,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2932087622252584,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2002234805583701,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27658402536592347,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29560716164533396,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24834557770130536,"solar_1":-0.26949124372914224,"solar_2":-0.13012424297264763,"solar_3":-0.017078969152256224,"solar_4":-0.18187514173347855,"solar_5":-0.009533797919478578,"solar_6":-0.22013043602036322,"solar_7":-0.03086836899941166,"solar_8":-0.1030884208615177,"solar_9":-0.18779903123193548,"solar_10":-0.052463121712207794},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

Do we just have too many dinosaurs in the board rooms?\n\nSo here's my thought:\n\nIn Northern Illinois, I know you can buy power from any generator you want. The utility (ComEd) delivers it and still charges for transmission. You don't want ComEd's nuclear generated power? No worries, you can buy 100% renewables. Want to cheap out? There are generators that will sell you coal and natural gas as cheap as they can make it.\n\nBut here's the thing: if anyone can be a generator, this means you can be a virtual generator. You can go to Wall Street and say, \"Hey! I want to borrow a couple hundred million dollars. With that, I'm going to put solar on roofs and PowerWall's in homes. This debt and equipment will be secured with the revenue stream from people who will pay for power who elect to sign up for this, and we'll also make money by absorbing cheap power and releasing it when demand is high. We'll also generate revenue when excess power from all of that solar is sold back to the grid, but we'll share a bit of it with those rooftop owners as part of the deal (through lower electricity rates than the utility).\"\n\nBoom. You've become a distributed generator utility. Tesla is doing this in Australia: https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/04/tesla-creates-virtual-power-plant-with-50000-australian-homes/, but there is no reason this can't be done in the US.\n\nIf the utility won't disrupt, you disrupt the utility.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13472595577373928,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2269951697689326,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21279114703701218,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20479197383230258,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1411312618112278,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2227701455971153,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2243030811660973,"solar_1":-0.2322243817384764,"solar_2":-0.22378409806217311,"solar_3":-0.2570981703752739,"solar_4":-0.04411486055377748,"solar_5":-0.27113030294761603,"solar_6":-0.008117319167164775,"solar_7":-0.1337754323236974,"solar_8":-0.01996899195261339,"solar_9":-0.005607093232185889,"solar_10":-0.1676449072577305},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

In net metering between neighbours pay producer the energy cost, charge consumer energy\\+distribution as profit.\n\nThe future of net metering  should be more granular pricing, including per hour pricing factoring weather.  Leading to lower prices in luke warm sunny spring/fall and higher in hot summer and cold winter.  Higher early morning late evening and overnight.\n\nThe future, I think has lower prices in prime midday than evening with residential solar deployed.  That's great for business consumption, which is great for economic competitiveness.  \n\nBasically, as long as residential users are charged the same producer/consumer its fair, and we can lose promised rate contracts.  A battery system, and computer trading software can decide when to charge batteries and when to sell to the grid.  Its also important to eliminate array size restrictions.  Take a \"fix your fucking grid\" attitude to permit objections.\n\nI think sizing your system for cloudy winter day with enough battery to get you to next morning is the right approach compared to higher capacity batteries.  Sell summer surpluses.  With the right net metering scheme, there'd be rewards for morning and late after noon generation that happens to also be part of the winter target design.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.010559920182762047,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1734363803931436,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20977387623575253,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2953525153083609,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24597498779251675,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19345248404143192,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20356422596206433,"solar_1":-0.08816824309455307,"solar_2":-0.1589981717390098,"solar_3":-0.14000761631690953,"solar_4":-0.04151678011813854,"solar_5":-0.11171411153633763,"solar_6":-0.02087883338390384,"solar_7":-0.019315670419018716,"solar_8":-0.09838533377357332,"solar_9":-0.014589181035638887,"solar_10":-0.1285393238121186},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (mentions wanting more granular pricing and eliminating array size restrictions)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

They're not too expensive and is better then guessing.\n\nI'd also recommend getting slightly more solar panels then you'll need. There's a few reasons for this. It will help generate enough on cloudy days (I'm not sure how many of those you actually have), if you're usage goes up in the future you still have enough power and panels do decrease the amount they can produce over time. They usually are rated to still produce about 80% of their capacity after 20 years. Also if the panels are dirty their production will be decreased a little bit. So having a couple extra panels is going to help the system work better.

When I say install labor, I don't just mean the crew of 6 guys working at your house all day to get the panels and electrical work done. That alone is close to $2k. There's also a full crew of engineers at the office drawing up designs (structural and electrical), the surveyor who comes out to measure your roof, the structural support in your attic, capacity of your electrical panel, the admins who work with you, the city, the utility company, the inspection coordinator who has to come back out to your house on 1-3 separate inspection days depending on your local AHJ (for a grand total of a *minimum* 4 visits and 5 different vehicles coming to your house, which all costs money for the vehicle, mileage, paying the crew on the clock driving each way to each job) and the guys stocking the warehouse all working 4-6 weeks before everything is ready to go on each job. This all adds up.\n\nNobody in the industry actually itemizes their costs for customers because whenever a customer sees that solar panels actually only cost about $3,000 for a pallet of 25 panels when you *don't* order in bulk, they get pissed that we're asking them to pay $30,000 for something they view as costing 10% of that.\n\nFeel free to Google the specific panel you had installed and hit the Shopping tab--this shit ain't a secret. The racking and inverter cost more than the panels, but customers view those items as somehow unnecessary. I guess they hope the panels just stick to the roof by pigeon shit. They probably told you it was $3k for labor and $27k for equipment. That's marketing nonsense to try to convince you you're getting the product almost \"at cost.\" The reality is your system was about $10k equipment, $10k labor, and $10k other (marketing, sales commissions, finance charges, and a little bit of profit at the end of the day)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.031302776808540024,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22092929012087553,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17002122177622844,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20268524872759977,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.010383853796156473,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.050468754644195236,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13978201569989324,"solar_1":-0.13668901855461366,"solar_2":-0.044353682358632796,"solar_3":-0.16425761682941833,"solar_4":-0.084039341587236,"solar_5":-0.03605414755778232,"solar_6":-0.2300600869454999,"solar_7":-0.05878042538824957,"solar_8":-0.1938392130250577,"solar_9":-0.06411630751058794,"solar_10":-0.2939745574371266},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

That’s not intended to bad-mouth builders, there are some that really get it right, but it’s not simple and a good local solar company should be glad to work with you and your builder to plan a well integrated project. \n\nThat said, here’s a basic list of things I’d look for: \n\nThe roof:\nFacing south or southish (in the Northern Hemisphere)\nIdeally, a big rectangle with no dormers, skylights, or other weird obstructions - try to locate plumbing vents and such on the north or at least not in the center of the south roof. \nMake sure you pick a roofing surface that will work well for solar mounting. \nMake sure roof framing (trusses/rafters) is engineered above code minimum and can hold the additional weight of solar. \n\nElectrical:\nYes, run conduit between the roof/attic and the utility space. Might want 2 runs of conduit while things are open  - this would allow you to expand capacity with a second project at some point. \nSet up your electrical service to integrate solar. If it’s a 200 amp service, asking for a breaker panel with a 200 amp main breaker and 225 amp max capacity rating gives you the most flexibility in terms of adding a solar interconnection breaker down the line. \n\nAnyhow, that’s a quick list but seriously, there’s always more to think through in terms of the specifics of your design scenario.

The first is technical. Your panels produce varying amounts of energy depending on how much sunlight they are exposed to. All of that energy goes somewhere. The panels do not \"throttle back\" to match the load. If the panels produce 10 kWh, and your house only uses 8 kWh, then the other 2 gets exported to the grid. If the panels produce 8 and the house needs 10, you import 2.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it's meaningless to ask whether the panels power the house directly, or are you only drawing from the grid. The house gets as much as it can from the panels and makes up any shortfall from the grid. The panels supply as much as they can to the house and feed any surplus to the grid.\n\nThe second part is regulatory. I don't know how it works where you live. Where I live, we have net metering. That means if I export 2 kWh today, then import 2 kWh tonight, they cancel out and I pay nothing. In California, you pay by time of day. If you import 2 kWh in the evening you might have to pay 45¢ each. Then if you export 2 kWh during the day, you might only get paid 30¢ each.\n\nBut I'm worried your system might be too big. If you're getting paid less for exports than you pay for imports, it doesn't make a lot of sense to install more capacity than you can use.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003217179619241506,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07801533998247123,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21006515077096025,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22772858738590046,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28152420042203324,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32251806289522217,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013788758282316849,"solar_1":-0.18768633256730743,"solar_2":-0.2018543419172662,"solar_3":-0.23528082805569284,"solar_4":-0.2994465220084142,"solar_5":-0.022426364157581702,"solar_6":-0.0008872075389566211,"solar_7":-0.0019905783653181666,"solar_8":-0.003825085176382951,"solar_9":-0.17817878642381402,"solar_10":-0.03205344298233589},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I am thinking of going with a plan that offers a lower cost per KWH and throw away my excess. I still need to crunch the numbers and obviously your situation will be different.\n\nmicro inverters.

If you assume that all vehicles will last the life of a solar panel and are always parked in the sun and that the angle of the solar panels is near ideal and all the rest of that, sure. Then after the solar panels take some rocks at 80 miles an hour, are you going to bother to replace them if they don't work anymore? Probably not. \n\nIn most cases that are not some sort of boondock camping, it's more cost-effective and more efficient put the solar panels on some stationary structure near where the car will spend some time. Then use those solar panels to their full capacity for 25+ years, either charging a car or powering some other load or feeding the grid.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004371879214886576,"1.1.1_stance":-0.094693957819959,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21453920087075337,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12901203955213228,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2866835631135788,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2837551951798618,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24783593128571133,"solar_1":-0.12994848105772058,"solar_2":-0.08846121852548094,"solar_3":-0.09018318877697222,"solar_4":-0.07186296204662437,"solar_5":-0.04211185292660957,"solar_6":-0.011687939916252313,"solar_7":-0.017418776635167887,"solar_8":-0.050239309643297224,"solar_9":-0.033120870828796,"solar_10":-0.1625165413104494},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I think the downvotes are from people who are (1) annoyed by any argument against veganism and (2) just plain think your argument is silly.\n\nVeganism asserts that you should not support cruelty with your dollars.  Then the argument that you can still enjoy all the foods you love *without* pain and suffering involved is a powerful argument in *support* of veganism.  Our argument with meat is not aesthetic, it's real.  You are paying for cruelty, and you are paying for death.  At the same time, sausage is disconnected from that - people don't think about the awfulness we inflict on animals when they eat, so there is no reason to throw out the flavors we love along with the products that inflict pain.  Sausage is just a food people enjoy, nothing about it screams \"murder\" except for the fact it's made of flesh.  We are not really pretending to eat animals, we just sometimes crave concentrated protein.  There is no reason not to eat concentrated soy protein, and coming up with new terms for things that are recognizable as familiar foods is silly and unhelpful.\n\nWhat's more - most of these products existed in some form long ago - seitan was an ancient Japanese food and tofu was a Chinese food eaten by people who also ate meat.  Calling it \"fake chicken\" just lets people know how it can be used.     \n\nI'm wondering out of curiosity if our disagreement extends to the \"rape play\" example where I and my vegan friend disagreed.  I think it's ok to do things that bring you pleasure, even if they simulate things that are evil and wrong - so long as they don't inflict harm.  He does not agree, what do you think?\n\nI think it's just silly to downvote someone who has a different opinion than you, but is having a respectful conversation.\n\nEdit: awful grammar.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00030440379729649675,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24260606481548166,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21302781559787942,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.4777539742003899,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1848387546674129,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19699535606542812,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.029867109452122047,"diet_1":-0.07198600287284762,"diet_2":-0.29019440498523186,"diet_3":-0.10272947347942818,"diet_4":-0.0304475400607771,"diet_5":-0.008253071277673977,"diet_6":-0.01654894263932268,"diet_8":-0.0044669957696896745,"diet_9":-0.016837790089387756,"diet_10":-0.01007358930898287,"diet_11":-0.014941247085516807,"diet_13":-0.0035136552396579646,"diet_14":-0.02046706616965821,"diet_17":-0.011247705483886724},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

For example, beans are far cheaper to buy and faster to cook than fresh meat is.\n\nIf you've got (preferably rescued) hens in your back garden (or your neighbour does), it's neither bad for the environment nor for the hens to eat their eggs, but otherwise tofu is much better on both counts, and not any more a processed food than cheese (it is made in nearly exactly the same way).\n\nI adore fake meat and I'm fairly fond of fake cheese, but they are not at all necessary, for health or otherwise. I'm also quite sure that (some brands of) vegan salami or cheese is a lot better for you than the real stuff, even without looking at the reduced damage to animals and the environment. :) But I only eat them because there are so many meals I want to eat that I couldn't make without them. Otherwise, there's tofu, (darker) nuts, beans and mushrooms for anything that needs to be vaguely like \"meat\", and tofu and (whiter) nuts for \"dairy\".\n\n(I've been into real food for longer than I've been into veganism.

I got mine for Christmas from my husband and it is so nice to get to have fun flavors that either aren't available in a vegan flavor or are more expensive than I'm willing to spend.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"yes","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.17116247825830117,"1.1.1_stance":-0.008189828262922154,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17501144647465375,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1533590542498965,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07074173688863397,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20268635480399028,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19662288873223588,"diet_1":-0.01970477959063288,"diet_2":-0.0009663825621804752,"diet_3":-0.015153875921271265,"diet_4":-0.05498041553558627,"diet_5":-0.0018639514006887719,"diet_6":-0.1603015414331741,"diet_8":-0.00038130353641463444,"diet_9":-0.0075313659229626255,"diet_10":-0.1613928350745194,"diet_11":-0.1174105340004985,"diet_13":-0.011530140793183818,"diet_14":-0.14196220679109217,"diet_17":-0.0005344774084126888},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Or have more concentrated calories in them. Indian and southeast Asian dishes are great, because you can add lots of vegetable or coconut oil, tomatoes, white rice, and such, and really pack in the calories. Brown rice is great for fibre and B-complex vitamins, but white rice is great for calories.\n\nIn some ways, you need to do the opposite of what most vegan cookbooks tell you to do: use refined oils, polished grains, flour, sugar ... but it can definitely be done.\n\nYou can figure out some snacks, too—smoothies, hummus and flatbread, guacamole or bean dip and corn chips, granola or granola bars, nut butter with crackers or vegetables, or just roasted nuts—all things that are high calorie and either quick to make or easy to make in bulk and store for later. Three meals plus a couple snacks along those lines throughout the day will help you keep or gain weight, for sure. Bean dips are especially good, because they're tasty, calorific, and proteiny, as well—may be helpful if you're combining your weight gain goals with an exercise plan. I improvise way more than I follow recipes, but something a bit like [this](http://www.fitsugar.com/Healthy-Black-Bean-Dip-Recipe-15507931) with a couple tablespoons of olive oil would be perfect for that.\n\nAnd at risk of reiterating if you can eat peanuts eat peanut butter. On crackers, on celery, on lettuce, with rice, with noodles, with salt, with a spoon, with your hands, whatever. It's cheap and you can carry a jar of it in your backpack while you rush between classes, and it'll give you calories and energy that you need. If you can't eat peanuts, eat sunflower seed butter instead. It's just slightly less cheap and does the same things.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1683538239367408,"1.1.1_stance":-0.34258607502251504,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2777497883571933,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2358230691882518,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3142510814923515,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2963249067832245,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02384536402920882,"diet_1":-0.17232269189263982,"diet_2":-0.0047703475793217836,"diet_3":-0.0996625322162193,"diet_4":-0.18453315729857422,"diet_5":-0.02337013168895889,"diet_6":-0.06189045288556372,"diet_8":-0.004807370426230288,"diet_9":-0.21683171521898004,"diet_10":-0.19972148920772737,"diet_11":-0.28054399881511927,"diet_13":-0.028308543071034364,"diet_14":-0.2325763069141734,"diet_17":-0.007285216396364073},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (mentions specific foods that are high in calories and easy to consume in large quantities, but does not express a preference for vegan or vegetarian diet as a whole)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present (the text describes the author's own behavior and suggestions for calorie-dense foods)","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.

I support many *plant* farms. Farming animals is unnecessary cruelty towards sentient beings. \n\n&gt;Now, I know for certain that vegans believe that a cow can have a good life living on a farm in the care of humans, or otherwise you wouldn't be OK with animal sanctuaries, or keeping dogs and cats as pets.\n\nVeganism is against all animal exploitation, and that includes for human companionship. I'm only o.k. with adopting shelter pets because otherwise they would be euthanized. They shouldn't end up there in the first place because people shouldn't be breeding them to begin with. That's why vegans are against stuff like pet stores. Same deal with animal sanctuaries -- they are there because someone else bred them to exploit and now we vegans are trying to support giving them a decent place to live out their lives. \n\n&gt;I know that you're aware that death can be both instant and painless, otherwise I hope that you wouldn't be OK with organisations like PETA euthanising rescue animals.\n\nNot a PETA fan at all.

And exploitation certainly isn't just about death and there are more drawbacks to death than just the pain. \n\n&gt;As for weeping as we cut the animal's throat, you're being ridiculous.\n\nI'm talking of actual things I've heard said by farmers, believe it or not. I grew up in a farming area, I live around a lot of small farms, and you can even find plenty of videos online of these sorts. I guess some are more sensitive than you are. But it is creepy as hell to hear a farmer say how they \"treat animals like family\" knowing how they kill them. Would you be o.k. killing your family for money (and not their own benefit) if you knew you could do it painlessly and instantly? I hope not.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.04058074586403867,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2539535383693874,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2347365745667066,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2504461431059016,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10983102323662225,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26022188273609836,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2041682012048668,"diet_1":-0.07115517345368971,"diet_2":-0.27560378267725943,"diet_3":-0.08227689886499927,"diet_4":-0.037561575358267874,"diet_5":-0.04206491247168742,"diet_6":-0.04119691479354515,"diet_8":-0.02239213869446151,"diet_9":-0.023497995401460987,"diet_10":-0.0939980183999675,"diet_11":-0.0635424153394221,"diet_13":-0.04909402879032617,"diet_14":-0.2111412720211471,"diet_17":-0.0716858872716936,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.2236354014366627},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against (opposes farming animals for food)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

And do you oppose people storming factory farms? \n\nI've been disappointed with society since I was about 12 and started thinking for myself and researching a little bit more about the world than I was told. I already knew people were dumb and hypocritical just from my elementary school years. The teachers failed me miserably. My classmates annoyed me to no end. I felt like the rest of the big world waiting out there would be different. Turned out it really isn't, it's just amplified on a bigger scale. And I didn't get into veganism until I was in my 20s. So that certainly hasn't elevated my opinion of people and human civilization. But it didn't have much room to fall any lower either. \n\nPeople like to ''double down'' on their actions and behaviors I guess. Because they're too feebleminded and weak-willed to give it some thought and maybe admit they might be wrong and try to change. But deep down they probably know they're wrong and so they feel the need to reassure themselves. And as long as the rest of the herd stands behind them there's no real reason to step outside that comfort zone and try to grow as a person. \n\nThe truth is most people are simply primitive apes running around fulfilling their primal desires without a single care about the consequences of their actions.
