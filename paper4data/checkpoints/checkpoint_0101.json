"comment": "The greenhouse gas emissions from a gasoline car and a car running on a 100% coal-fired grid are comparable, but in most of the United States that's not the case, and there are significant GHG benefits to driving an electric car. In Washington State, for example, I used the GREET model to find that EVs charged on their electric grid provide about a 70% reduction in GHG emissions relative to gasoline.\n\nThe other thing about EVs is that you can clean up their emissions by cleaning up the grid. When a coal plant goes offline and is replaced by natural gas, all the cars charging from that grid see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per mile. That's different from a gasoline vehicle, where if it's 25 mpg the day you bought it, it's 25 mpg or worse every day after that. Every EV has the potential to get cleaner as grid emissions are reduced, and gasoline vehicles don't.",

I'm about to rent a car to go into the mountains next weekend- my LEAF's range won't cover the trip without a recharge, and there are no charging stations in the tiny mountain towns.\n\nBut with what I save by not paying for gas, I can choose exactly the vehicle I want for the trip (something big this time to haul bikes) and still save quite a but of cash.\n\nIf you're backpacking every weekend of the year it's probably better to own something that will make the trip.  But if you're looking at 10-12 trips per year or less you'll probably save by renting.",

There is a page that estimates the time to full for 120v, 3.3KW, and 6.6KW level 2 charging, but I think that goes away once you plug in. There is no ETA info on how quick it would fill up on level 3 charging, primarily because there's not a standard for level 3 rates. Different charging stations push different amps. You can't give an across the board estimate for all DC Quick Chargers. Here in TX, I think the evGo chargers use a lower wattage than the Blink chargers I was using up in Seattle, but the Blink chargers were CONSTANTLY going down, where I've yet to see a single evGo charger out of commission.",

Tesla cites 8% improvement in cost every year, and historically that number is very related to improvement in [power|energy]/[mass|volume] density because of materials.\n\nWhich is interesting because the 30% improvement in cost Tesla say they'll get with the gigafactory is equal to the normal expected improvement by the time the factory is running anyway!  Tesla (and the entire greentech economy) just needs a lot of batteries.  :)",

So there is less to break down and virtually no routine services like oil changes, transmission flush, etc. Interior electronics issues are more likely (like the touch screen, climate controls, etc.) \n\nAs others have mentioned, eventually some shops will get certified to work on EVs.  Later, Tesla could have service centers or on-call technicians that travel to perform certain repairs.  \n\nFor major issues like a problem with the battery, the easiest solution is going to be a swap, then they can figure out what is wrong with the original pack, fix it and put it back into their supply system.\n\nAs for your Volt, I don't see Chevy abandoning the dealership model anytime soon.  If they ever do, it will be long after local shops learn how to work on EVs and hybrids.",

"comment": "Using the Model X as a benchmark is probably not useful. The Model X timing was given before Tesla made a single production Model S or any vehicle out of their Fremont factory that used to be NUMMI. Circumstances changed a lot and instead of the Model X pushing Tesla past 20,000 vehicles a year, the Model S did it all by itself. So the Model X is here to push Tesla past 45-50k a year, going to 80-100k a year. Therefore the big impetus to get the Model X out closer to 2013 wasn't there and it was actually better for them to wait while making the Model X better and better.\n\nFor the Model 3, the Gigafactory phase 1 is coming online with 5-6 GWh of cell production, doubling Tesla's battery capacity. Tesla has to ship the Model 3 within a relatively narrow window after the Gigafactory phase 1 comes online in order to make the cash flow work out right. Tesla could push it a bit and divert cells to stationary storage, but the investments in the Fremont factory and the Gigafactory will overall force Tesla to hit a more precise timetable.",

"comment": "So here's what I don't get:\n\nWhen the gov introduced the tax on EVs they wanted a higher tax for teslas than other EVs, but the EU said no as that would be unfair competition. Since a tesla is a higher cost car that means that at the same percentage of \"tax rebate\" they get funded with more cash than a cheaper car.\n\nNow with a flat rebate across all cars wouldn't that then also be unfair competition as relative to vehicle cost the 40K is a higher percentage for low cost cars?\n\nExamples (made up numbers):\n\nA tesla at 1M taxed at 30% compared to ICE 150% is getting a 120% tax rebate meaning 4*300K=1.2M.\n\nA tesla at 1M taxed at 60% compared to ICE 150% is getting a 90% tax rebate meaning 3*300K=900K.\n\nA leaf at 300K taxed at 30% compared to ICE 150% is getting a 120% tax rebate meaning 4*90K=280K.\n\nSo, a tesla is getting a huge discount compared to a cheap EV and really to get the same absolute discount would need to pay 120% tax compared to the 30% of a leaf. \n\nThe EU said that would be unfair so for this 40K rebate to be equally fair tesla should get a 160K rebate to reach same percentage. \n\nSo since all this sounds pretty stupid what am I missing?",

He's the same guy that was recently trying to get FCA to [merge with GM](http://www.autonews.com/article/20150830/INDUSTRY_ON_TRIAL/308319981/marchionne-puts-the-squeeze-on-gm;-gms-response:-why-bail-out-fca?) and was going around saying that publically and had a slideshow of how it was part of their business plan only to be shot down by the GM CEO.  \n\nSure someone will probably replicate the Tesla model, but like the author said, it doesn't seem like it'll be FCA, since that would require a strong committment to electrics, building out infrastructure to support them (by themselves or with others) and working on battery tech etc. Of course FCA has people skilled with ICE cars (they own Ferrari after all, and Dodge too who make things like the SRT Hellcat) but I haven't seen much out in the way of electrification. While searching for something involving Chrysler and electrification I [found this](https://transportevolved.com/2015/07/28/fiat-chrysler-cto-allies-himself-with-fuel-cell-technology-dismisses-electric-cars/). He doesn't seem interested in making or investing in electrics.\n\nAnd don't forget - he's the one who literally told people [not to buy the Fiat 500e](http://www.reuters.com/article/chrsyelr-ceo-evs-idUSL1N0O71MS20140521). As /u/bjarneh said, it seems FCA is in the ICE car business and they want to stick with what they know.",

I am citing what happen 20 years ago as proof that the technology was there-- the other person said the technology wasn't available. \n\nGM might have invested money into the Bolt.  And, no, I am not \"upset\" about that.  My entire point is they are all talk, no action.  If history is any indicator, GM will figure out a way to fuck up the Bolt.  They won't offer 0% incentives, the dealerships will not be educated and they will not be spiffed to sell them.  The sales people will try to redirect people's interest to other cars that make them, and the dealership, more money.  Its just that simple.  Look, I hope I'm wrong, I hope they sell so many they cant keep up with demand...But, corporations like GM simply can not change- they are too old, bloated, and weighed down to think differently and change their model.  The network of dealerships have too much invested to change as well.  Perhaps the only thing that might help is if NEW dealerships rise up that only sell EVs, maybe they can think of a way to become profitable, but its doubtful.",

"comment": "Here are the issues and questions I've encountered between switching from an SUV to a Prius and currently driving a Volt.  It is a bit north east US focused.\n\nThe tipping point isn't one or two things, but several.\n\n* Range/Chargers - People don't just buy cars for commuting.  Until EVs either reach ICE Range Parity (~160-200 seems to be near the minimum based on conversations I've had), we need far more chargers than what we have.\n\nThe issue with just increasing the number of chargers I'm finding people think it takes days to fully recharge a car.  So range increases will go further towards pushing towards the EV tipping point than charger location increases.  However both are needed.  \n\nI've talked to Leaf drivers who have said they had vacations they wanted to take, but can't until they get new cars.  There just weren't enough chargers to daisy chain to where they wanted to go.\n\n* EV Variety - There is a vehicle type bias in my area.  Large trucks and SUVs.  There simply aren't any vanilla EVs that are trucks, and depending on why you like SUVs there might be alternatives.\n\nRegarding more the car sized side of things, if you like the hatchback ability to transport stuff a normal trunk doesn't allow, and can't afford a Model X, the current EV market is like playing a game of \"Range, Hatchback, or advanced cruise control, pick two\".  \n\nThough according to the news reports and PR it sounds like this will start getting better around 2020 to 2022.\n\n* General knowledge - This will get better as EV owners slowly become more plentiful.  I wish I had a dollar for each time I had to explain it is cheaper to drive electric ($0.02/mile with my lead foot and local elec prices) vs my Volt on gas ($0.15/mile when I last updated the price in the spreadsheet).  The impression most seem to have initially that it must cost as much to drive my 35 miles Electric as my ~170 miles on gas.  \n\nSimilar for how long it takes to charge the vehicle.  Also there are sometimes questions regarding how long the batteries last.\n\n* Cost - Once general public deemed adequate EVs hit the market then there is the used car market.  Once these EVs start getting under $10k in the used market (after several years) they'll begin being picked up.  \n\n\nSome are harder than others.  At the moment I think the lower end of the tipping point is around 2025.  We'll see the variety explosion around then in the new market.  Early Model 3s, even earlier Model S, Bolts, and 2018 Ioniqs and Leafs if rumors hold, will be ripe for picking in the used market.  That's another 8 years to spread the chargers around.",

But don't count your money yet: If you try to sell a Bolt that is just 3 months old, the next buyer of the car can't take the credit since the vehicle isn't new. So your virtually new car is competing with actual brand new cars that have the tax credit attached, and thus a virtual $7.5k discount. Effectively, to sell your car, you'll need to reduce the price by an additional $7.5k. So you get the tax credit, but lose it when you unload the car.\n\nOf course, if you keep both cars, then you get to keep the credit, and you'll have two nice electric vehicles to drive around in.",

The more a potential vehicle could add to AE's market the less likely that vehicle ends up tied to AE's market. So now you need enormous numbers of vehicles. As a kicker the demand is likely to be highly clustered temporally, around holidays, driving a higher need for capacity that will be far emptier most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote, this meant to be picking on AE.\n\n1. I'm happy this money is being put in to give it a go, maybe it works out.\n2. AE is just shorthand here for \"EV charging priced at 25mpg gasoline fueling\".\n\nI'm just pessimistic that it's going to play out that well, for them and for EVs in general, in the end along the direction they've chosen. I don't know how much of that $2B mandated by the diesel-gate settlement is going to be in reserve to ongoing maintenance but I hope it's several years runway, as I don't see AE having a chance of going cash flow positive for a very long time unless they've managed to swing some very sweetheart lease deals that generate them income. Even then peak electricity surcharges are a beast, so best case then is they don't get customers. ;) Until such time as their host sites start to realize it's kinda a bust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

That will be replaced by a coal / gas mix, so expect emissions to rise again this year. \n\nhttp://www.theenergycollective.com/robertwilson190/218636/germany-s-nuclear-phaseout-timetable\n\n2019 is the next one, but in 2021 - 2022 they take 8 GW out. As you take more dispatchable out, it basically has to be replaced with dispatchable.  So adding wind and solar will have almost no effect on carbon emissions going forward. German emissions will rise sharply - there will also be more and more electric cars coming, along with neighbour countries not being able to stabilize like they did over the past few years, as they are also installing useless wind + solar.",

At the time we decided to buy the 530e, the model 3 was still not in mass production and also we thought it probably wouldn’t have arrived in time since we didn’t put down a deposit.\n\nWe upgraded from a Hyundai Elantra so it was a huge upgrade and decision.\n\nMy commute is just within range of its battery and I can charge at work.  Due to this usage pattern, I can go for 1.5-2k miles before having to fill up my tank.  I also try to go out of my way to find cheaper or free ChargePoint chargers (there’s one in Newark that is only 12c/kWh) when I’m running errands.  It annoys my SO that we have to walk more sometimes just to get 8 mi of range in charge but they humor me.\n\nThe 530e is a gateway drug that convinced me all of my future cars will be BEV.  The interior is also much better than Tesla’s.  My main gripes are just that I wish the battery was larger and I didn’t have to sacrifice trunk space for it - I would definitely buy a BEV version if it were equivalently priced and appointed.\n\nBefore and after the purchase I subbed to this subreddit and have learned a lot to look out for in my next purchase - active battery cooling, charging rates, etc!",

They also have to terminate any relationships with companies that do sue Tesla for patent infringement.  Tesla also maintains it's trade dress and trademarks, while companies using Tesla's parents have to agree not to protect their own.\n\n\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#patent-pledge\n\nEdit:. I will say, Tesla's connector is great, they had good foresight to use large conductors from the start so that extra conductors didn't have to come along for the ride like CCS. But the Patent Pledge is hardly worth the paper (...electrons?) It's printed on.\n\nEdit: One last thing, \"irrevocably\" means nothing here.  This isn't a legally binding agreement between two parties.  Tesla can charge this policy at any time.",

Sometimes you'll be on a trip and have to use a more expensive public charger.  You'll use more energy when it's cold.  I went from about 4k/ year in gas to around 1200/ year in electricity.  Pre purchase I was estimating my electricity to be about 800 a year.  It's still a huge savings and I'm very happy with an EV commuter.  I drive about 100 miles/ day as well.  Also we drive the EV more than the gas car it replaced because it's convenient and efficient.  So I'm using more electricity than I planned but driving our other gas vehicle less than previous years.",

Each head should last several years.\n\nIn other news, one of my solar installers said he did this the first winter or two, but between the much lower sun-exposure and the fact that once a portion of the snow exposes the panels, it melts pretty quickly in good sunlight, he stopped bothering with it.  It's like driving a couple miles out of your way to save 10 cents on gas.  Takes too long and really isn't worth it in the end.\n\nTo each his own.",

Angie's List is the best I can think but I've noticed that you'll get enough crazy or ignorant reviews to make it hard to separate the chaff from the wheat so to speak.\n\nAnd then as /u/miketomjohn suggested, which is to do some research, can anyone suggest where to start? This forum is great but the learning curve is a little steep to just jump into. (For instance I never even thought about direction of panels based on what type of metering I might have!) The more I lurk here the more hesitant I am to take the next step if only because I'm realizing what I don't know.\n\n\n\nBtw, you guys are awesome. I bow to your collective wisdom.",

"comment": "&gt;My primary arguments against it are cost and lead times to build new nuclear power plants.\n\nMight I suggest you are viewing the issue (mostly) through a US/UK lens?\n\nYes, Hinkley Point C has been a monumental clusterfuck. What about all the Chinese reactors that are coming online? What about all the reactors South Korean firms are building outside their own national boundaries? We are talking Saudi Arabia, the UAE, even Vietnam.\n\nConsider the following paper: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516300106\n\nNote Figure 2. The U.S. used to be really good at building nuclear reactors, right up until the 1970s. What happened then? TMI, of course. We became so paranoid that we added far more regulation than was required. Thus, the US became completely uncompetitive. (See also this [article](https://clearpath.org/jays-take/nuclear-innovation-isnt-welcome/) which describes the ridiculous cost of nuclear innovation in this country.)\n\nNow look at Figure 14. Notice how France and South Korea demonstrate clear positive experience curves, while the US and Japan show negative learning curves. So it clearly isn't anything inherent in nuclear power that is expensive. It's about excessive regulation.\n\n&gt;We are building offshore wind parks today with lower prices per MWh than nuclear plants can provide.\n\nYes, if you don't think intermittency is an issue. If you account for the additional systems required to deal with intermittency, it's nowhere close to the price of what China, South Korea, Russia, etc. are paying for new nuclear plants.\n\n&gt; (You can argue about subsidies, but every power source has subsidies)\n\nOf course, so let's look at those:\n\nhttp://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/\n\nLook at the subsidy data for 2013 (most recent data year) in table ES4 and the production data in table ES5. If you divide the former by the latter, you get the following by energy type:\n\nSource|Subsidy (cents / kWh)\n:-------------------------------|:---------------\nCoal|0.1\nNatural Gas and Petroleum Liquids|0.1\nNuclear|0.2\nBiomass|0.2\nGeothermal|1.4\nHydropower|0.1\nSolar|23.1\nWind|3.5\n\nSo you can't tell me that wind is cheaper than nuclear when it is receiving 17.5 times the subsidies. And that *still* doesn't address intermittency.\n\n&gt;The only arguments for nuclear power are...\n\nNot at all. Less land use, fewer impacts on ecosystems, far less toxic waste than is required to build solar panels (you should look at Chinese practices sometime), more siting options, can be build closer to population centers, not intermittent, etc., etc. \n\n&gt;But natural gas seems to be the current leader there, for the time being.\n\nOf course, but if you are a numerate environmentalist, then you know that natural gas is the leader because of fracking (which environmentalists generally oppose), still emits CO2 when burned (which I assume you oppose), and has that nasty issue with methane leaks (which offsets is GHG forcing impact vis-a-vis coal).",

Was on vacation between projects when someone I know referred me for an advisory role to coordinate information among various parties. Ended up being mostly a problem solving job.\n\nOn a large scale, this type of solar electrical generation produces more power per area than PV. The initial investment is much more than PV, partly because it's new tech. That cost will be paid back faster than PV because of the higher energy output.\n\nThis particular location is within protected habitat for desert tortoises.  A solar PV farm would not have been allowed because it would damage the habitat through erosion (rain runoff) and increased heat at ground level. Interestingly, there was a team of turtle herders who rounded up all of the tortoises before and during construction. Turtle proof fences were constructed around perimeters. I could go on and on, but just trust me, the tortoises were well cared for restored to the habitat.",

"comment": "Disclosure, am employed by Solar City. Not in marketing though, so this is my personal take. \nMany people get cleaner energy at better rates from SolarCity thank what they pay their utility, and enjoy long term control and predictability for their energy budget, often without any initial cost. \nThough they look at initial purchase lower prices from DIY, or other companies, they choose to work with us as they take into account the relative value of the project to the equity in their home, which can easily run to high six or seven figures in the SF Bay area. The value of the home improvement aspects of going solar with SolarCity includes risk assessment. Roof penetrations, moisture sealing, and insurance merit a long look. Quality of service and accountability considerations often give weight to our vertically integrated team. Given the relatively short life expectancy (&lt;10 years) of expensive inverters, customers appreciate term warranty coverage, production guarantees, and monitoring systems. Many place value on the partnerships and long term prospects for SolarCity, the brand value and customer service transferability, as they bank on resale value. Our 34% share of the residential solar market, compared with about 25% for the next 10 competitors combined, provides some peace of mind about our ability to show up in for service call over the coming decades. \nAlso, many have been referred by others who enjoyed doing business with SolarCity.\nRegardless, it is a win for the planet and the customer when anyone switches from the gird to solar. \nWe enjoy being part of the movement, and are a major participant in advocating for favorable net metering, interconnection, and tax policies.",

It's about cost of residential solar going up.  If you take away net metering and tax credit and add battery storage, cost of residential solar more than doubles.  Now instead of 5-10 year payback period, we're looking 10-20 year payback period, or more.  Not worth it.  Over time, that will eventually come back down, but could be decades.",

Here's looking to the future of solar energy!\nIt is infuriating how many greenies believe that solar will be the future of all energy if we just invest and think positively.",

Spec sheet here: http://www.solartrader.ca/UserFiles/Image/Enphase_D380_Datasheet.pdf\n\nThis means that at 39 panels you are likely capped out on your current (ha!) electrical connection, there is either a combiner box or 2 breakers landed in your panel - 1 for each string.  Adding more panels is certainly an option, but you should be producing plenty of power for a standard 2-3000ft2 house and you will get more mileage out of energy efficiency upgrades than just throwing more solar at the problem.",

They operate better in higher temperatures, which is something that doesn't get a lot of press compared to their aesthetics, but can make a big deal if you are out in the desert or in hot desert areas in my neck of the woods.\n\nTheir prices are coming down slowly, but their biggest problem right now is supply.  It's hard to get a good flow of 150's, sometimes you can only get 145's, then they fix their production after you adjust and are back to 150's again after you've signed contracts on the models that are scarce.\n\nI primarily use them as our 'Sunpower alternative', I haven't seen any issues with their quality but their warranties seem to be industry standard?",

The stated goal of the plan is to make nat gas and coal plants artificially less efficient(aka more costly) to force less efficient solar and wind turbines to be economically \"viable\".  That isn't going to change shit... its just going to regressivly lower peoples incomes because renewables are currently vastly less efficient.  \n\nIn theory its a bad idea... in practice its even worse. You end up with a system that taxes the poor to subsidize solar panels on Malibu McMansions and a 700hp Telsa P85D hyper car in the driveway... both of which actually increase emissions and are contributing to one of the most egregious misallocation of resources the world has ever seen. Look no further the Telsa's market cap... where they are on par with Ford despite selling less cars per year then Ford does in 1 day.",

However if you're  persistent, assembling cells into a short lifespan panel is totally possible.  You can even cut the cells to customize the current and voltage too.  It's just a bunch of soldering and one lamination step.  I don't know where you can buy small quanties of Eva or backsheet but eBay probably has everything.",

Though these cost savings are also revenue losses.  The more interesting figure that needs more development (as to average rather than maximum)\n\n&gt; In addition, rooftop solar occasionally reduced hourly median wholesale electricity prices by as much as $3.10 per megawatt-hour (MWh).\n\n0.31c/kwh is pure profit from the centralized expensive energy enslavers that could instead have a portion passed on to consumers.\n\nStill the amount can be classified as an external social benefit, in a way that the headline number cannot.

SolarCoins larger supply and its ability to be broadly distributed more easily make it a much better candidate as a currency.\n\nThat is why longer term it will have value, because it will be able to be used for fast, cheap, global transactions.  At this point there is no need to sell SolarCoins, they have their own intrinsic value.  The more people claim, the faster it will happen.",

"comment": "No worries at all, thanks for the update, interesting to hear what Tesla have to say.\n\nI guess it comes down to whether your priority is selling power back to the grid while the times are good or having power after a (let's face it, unlikely) natural disaster.  If you are limited to 110% offset then having the extra panels would be wasted, but if you want the best chance of continuous electricity after a disaster to keep your fridge and freezer running, then the more panels the better!\n\nDon't forget that unless you use microinverters or DC optimisers on each panel, a single cloud casting a shadow across a corner of one panel can cut the total power produced by the system in half!  So if California has clear blue skies most days of the year then you'll be fine (sorry never been to the US so no idea what the climate is like!), otherwise it could be worth getting at least a few more panels than you need, or getting a microinverter for each panel.\n\nOne good thing about a Powerwall is that microinverters will charge its battery, so you can start with as little as one panel with its microinverter and keep adding more as you need them.  With any other option you're sort of tied to installing the whole solar system in one go and then leaving it unchanged after that.  The catch is that microinverters do add quite a bit of cost to the system, at least at today's prices.",

"comment": "I blinked into the comments of that videos and some dude just dropped two horrifying comments:\n\n**He really seemed pessimistic about what´s going on over the world,especially mentioned that 2017 was (by him)** **the year where the hope for renewable future burned (his favourite scientist is Stefan Rahmstorf).**\n\n**first** \" The IEA says energy demand will increase 100% by 2060.  This is because there will be 2 billion more people, and 75% of the infrastructure they need doesn't exist yet, and construction causes 50% of emissions.  Stefan Rahmstorf says human emission must be 0% by 2060 to stay below 2° C.  Kevin Anderson says we have a 5% chance of success for staying below 2° C.  James Hansen says 2° C = Disaster.  Therefore, we have a 95% chance of not avoiding a disaster.  And that's the optimistic scenario.  Vaclav Smil says 100% energy transitions take about 70 years to complete.  We will run out of food and water before we get 100% renewable energy.  The largest energy demand will be from batteries.  Wind turbines and solar panels only provide 2% of total world energy demand.  Wind turbines only produce 90% of their rated output 25% of the time, which is the same as saying they produce 40% of their average power 100% of the time. This is because the word, average means nothing.  If you put your palm on a solar panel, the output drops 80%. It takes 1 ton of coal to make 12 solar panels.  Wind/solar products only last 30 years. Recycling them is a fraud and uses more energy than making them.  Every solar panel and wind turbine you see now will have to be replaced in 30 years.  We don't have enough minerals to do that. This is not rocket science.  40,000 black slave children in the Congo mine 60% of all the world's cobalt.  Graphite is a fine silver dust mined only in China.  They shut the graphite mines for 2008 Olympics to clear the air so dust wouldn't cover the green painted grass.  Green energy is equitably unsustainable.   The poor will not be drunk sexting in self-driving electric cars.  Between now and 2050, humanity has to grow more food than in all the last 10,000 years.  To grow that much food we need 12 million acres of new soil per year for 30 years.  But we are losing 24 million acres of soil per year.  Humanity only has 50 years of human agriculture at current soil degradation/depletion rates.  Right now 1 billion people walk a mile each day for water. In 20 years, it will be 2 billion people.

"comment": "But it does sound like net metering is an option here, no?\n\nAnd I'm not sure I really understand your argument. The customer should do what is in their best interest. Utilities are not inherently evil nor are they any worse for the environment than any other large corporation we interact with on a day to day basis. They aren't something that needs to avoided, and they do provide a valuable service most of us take for granted. Sure, they may not always treat home solar fairly, but that doesn't mean you can get a better deal elsewhere. Only in some very limited circumstances can you beat the service they provide.\n\nBatteries are expensive. Overbuilding your array is expensive. Both are necessary if you want to get off the grid. Throw in the fact that people like air conditioning and many don't have good options for gas so they have electric heat and hot water too, and you are talking about a lot of energy that needs to be stored. Oh, and how about electric cars and plug in hybrids? Those will save you tons of money and reduce your environmental impact, but they don't go great with an off grid solution. Like, I put 18kwh into my car five days a week. That is a pretty huge demand, and unfortunately it's not happening at the sunniest time of day. Even if my commute was 1/4 what it is and I was putting 5kwh into the car, you would basically be looking at a few thousand in batteries just to charge the car, plus you would have to size the array to generate an extra 1000+kwh. Or you could pay the $8 per month to have a grid connection and charge at night when electric is dirt cheap. $8 is my connection fee, and I'm paying just $0.07/kwh at night (many places offer better deals for electric cars than that too). So $0.35 per day, let's say 20 days a month plus the $8 grid fee and I'm paying $180 per year to be grid tied to charge my car. To achieve the same off grid I would at least a 5kwh battery, which even in the most DIY of systems is going to run at least $1000, plus maybe 1kw DC to charge that battery, installed that is probably $2500 or so. What is the payback on that? Almost 20 years? And that is assuming the system is free to maintain and that this cheap batteries last that long. Obviously your numbers will differ, but that was just one major user.\n\nMy point is, utilities are there to provide us with unlimited electricity on demand. Solar can not do that, and even when you try to imitate that capability with batteries and huge arrays and efficient living, it's going to come up either completely inadequate or outrageously expensive and overbuilt.",

There is a 10 year warranty on parts and labor and 25 years on the panels plus 15 years on the roof. Since you are renting the panels I would assume they are not obligated to replace them. I think many of the negative reviews on sunrun are from the leasing purchases because they pushed that really hard.\n\nMost of the quotes I have are telling me a much higher production than what sunrun rep told me. I remember speaking to Sunrun 3 years ago but I determined leasing was a bad idea.",

"comment": "This only works in an environment where you are using 100% renewables as your energy source.  At the moment, when a consumer switches from a combustion to electric motor, all it does is move the source of greenhouse gases, not eliminate it. \n\nIn our current electrical grid, solar and wind have fixed capacity.  They can collect X amount of wind and solar energy, and cannot collect any more without building more solar panels / wind turbines.  This is due to no large-scale energy storage systems being constructed yet (be it battery, gravity wells, or otherwise).  So when a consumer switches from gas to electric, that extra electricity has to come from *somewhere* - so the coal and natural gas plants begin burning more fuel to provide extra electricity.  \n\nAre there some efficiencies gained?  Absolutely.  But it's a specious argument to claim in our current energy production schema that simply switching to EV solves the greenhouse gas problem.",

We calculate the average lifespan of a string inverter to be 15 years, which means that you'll (probably) need to replace it once during the lifespan of your installation. \n\nI'd say that perhaps 1 in 20 inverters have some issue within the first year and another 1 in 20 in the next 5 years. Which would all be covered by warranties and be replaced.",

The system does seem really large for what you've described. The most PWs I've ever designed was 6 in California for a mansion and it covered the whole home for almost a day if they turned EVERYTHING on.

"comment": "With the “worst case scenario” if we can eliminate that then there seems to be no reason not to switch.\n\nKnowledge had been gained, technology has advanced. The three most relevant meltdowns in history were in reactors utilizing basically the same type of reactor designs (high pressure, light water reactors) and the same fuel (ceramic uranium pellets). These reactor types and fuels have had problems, but we continue to use them because they are the most readily available. \n\nBy switching to new fuels and/or new reactors we can both make nuclear more safe than it already is and improve its efficiency at the same time. One of my favorites of these new concepts is the Liquid Fluoride  Thorium Reactor, which uses liquid thorium salts as a fuel. It would operate at atmospheric pressure and theres no chance of something like a meltdown because the fuel is already a liquid. If there is a problem, the reactor shuts off and the fuel is redirected to a drain tank where it cools and solidifies. Thorium is also much more common than uranium making it cheaper to run and creates far less waste.\n\nNo solution is perfect. Eventually solar panels will have to be replaced, leaving the old ones in dumps. Wind turbines will also need fixing and replacing as well. Wind and solar are also only available around 50% of the time. Nuclear power does create harmful radioactive waste. I don’t know about you, but for me, taking a bunch of dangerous stuff and sticking it deep in some hole in the ground sound a lot better than pumping lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff into the atmosphere like we’re doing now. I’m not saying that nuclear power is the only thing we will ever need, but it can provide a reliable source of energy and enable rapid decarbonation worldwide, and denying that is just foolish. \n“You don’t get a second chance on a first impression” and that clearly rings true on the current climate surrounding nuclear technology.",

I can tell you are talking to a dealer based on the email on page 1. If you want to work with Sunrun call them directly and you’ll get better service and better product than a dealer can offer. \n\nAs for a lease vs. a loan, most solar companies will be negative about a lease, but it’s not comparable to going with a loan. They are solving different problems. \n\nIf you plan to be in the house long term, have a big tax liability, okay with debt and are comfortable managing service and repairs calls then a loan is a great option to look at, and might be better. \n\nIf you just want a lower cost of power and not want to worry about anything solar related then a lease does just that. \n\nTo see if the lease is worth it, calculate your current cost per kWh from your utility then compare it to the cost from the lease. Go with the lower number. \n\n\nOh and if the contract says 59% don’t expect it to produce 65% or 70%. Check the math yourself. Total up your kWh from your electric bills. Compare that to the ~10,000 they say they will produce.",

Maybe you can ask the Q-cell installer what their price would be for a Solaredge 7.6 or enphase IQ 7A microinverter system.  \n\nI wouldn't really worry about the layouts that much though, both companies have run their layout through their simulation software and will guarantee a certain amount of production and you can always ask 1 company to kind of copy the other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;so I don't know the model also does that mean my 8.6kW system installed actually only gets 7.6kW after losses?\n\nit's industry standard to size the DC (solar panels) higher than the AC (inverters) because there is only a small benefit to make it match 1:1.  Normally it's ok to do 1.25-1.35:1 DC:AC ratio and you will only have about 1-2% of clipping losses. this kind of helps the grid out too because you aren't feeding back as much power to the grid (say you and 5 neighbors are on a 25 KVA transformer, if 3 of you put 7.6 KWac inverters, there's no more space and utility will need to upsize the transformer (at a neighbors cost?).  If 3 of you had 6 KWac inverters, that 4th neighbor could put in their own 6 KWac and no upgrade needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I look at the image in the quote, and they've skewed the panels to not run completely orthogonal to the roof (tweaked maybe 5-10 degrees) to match up with the sun better.\n\nI think that's just them being lazy on the rendering.  it would be impractical to install it that way.",

"comment": "You’re correct that the overall dimensions have changed by a few inches since the initial conception and the power output and battery capacity specs have also improved.\n\nI’d argue that the shape has *barely* changed. Aptera 3 has a theoretical 0.02 reduction in drag coefficient over the Aptera 2e.\n\nThere was always an electric version of the Aptera with solar panels since the initial announcement, though the 3 now includes optional power to the rear wheel.\n\nI’m glad they’ve made incremental improvements over the last 10 years. I’m still pretty skeptical of some of their claims, however, I’d love to be proven wrong and I hope they make good on their promises. This is a really cool vehicle, and will be excellent for a very specific type of customer.",

"comment": "Generally utility prices are driven by two things (A) inflation because of the cost of paying their workers and buying equipment and (B) price of buying/producing a kWh. Florida's electricity prices have increased by over 20% in the last two years because of (A) inflation and (B) natural gas prices have increased raising the cost of a kWh. Rate increases are already planned for 2023 (see war in Ukraine and disruption of natural gas markets and inflation). \n\nI'm going to guess that if you apply that tax credit to your loan, you are going to be paying just about the same for your kWh on your solar panels as you are from your utility for a kWh. But the solar panel payment will be fixed for 20/30 years and then you own them and any remaining production they can make is free to you. \n\nI'm going to guess you've got a decent sized house and have plenty of good roof space for more panels. And yeah, when the crew was out there they should have put another 1 or 2 kW of panels up there. That would have been cheap and taken another 20 minutes of work with the crew already there. Absolute jokers for only putting 6.4kW up there. Give it a couple of years to see how the system works and then think about adding to the system. Solar is all pretty modular and you've got top quality equipment. \n\nBut it all comes down to how much the system produces. If that estimate is pretty good, you should do fine financially. Heck, you might drop your $10k tax refund into the stock market and make a bundle that pays for the entire loan.",

Really.\n\nHere are two good reasons these renewable sources would be worthless in 150 mph winds:\n\n1) solar arrays and wind turbines get blown away and destroyed in hurricane-force winds;\n\n2) it would take months to years to replace solar panels, windmills, and infrastructure rather than days or a couple of weeks to get power plants back in operation.\n\n###[Why Do Eco-Activists Think Polluting The Planet Will Somehow Save It?](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/xx1e1y/why_do_ecoactivists_think_polluting_the_planet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

My installers salesman  is pusing SolarEdge over Enphase, no doubt due to lower prices. i also read somewhere that SolarEdge is more efficient, if you are using a battery. The battery is DC only and holds a charge before the inverter, which is the traditional way of doing things. Enphase and Tesla uses AC from the roof down to the battery.  The fewer times you have to do the transformer or inverters the more efficient. AC is more efficent for longer runs. There are a few youtube videos out there that go into detail. heres the link to the ones I saw:\n\n  \nSolarEdge vs. Enphase Inverters: Which solar inverter is better? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/lfyz21R1Rn8 via @YouTube \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kdlu-rIPOM\n\ni",

If you scale it up to big batteries to take advantage of this year's pricing the higher startup cost may not pay off over time.  Better, in that case, to store cheaper-grid or free solar power and use it instead of grid power for yourself during the expensive hours.",

First off, other renewables should be built, don’t get me wrong, and I want us building wind farms wherever they fit, and slapping solar panels on everything like we’re Ukrainians with ERA, but nuclear has to be in the mix for sustainability. It’s safe, reliable, efficient, and excellent for high demand, densely populated areas, as well as for areas likely to be affected by extreme weather events. My second argument is literally everything about nuclear power is sexy. The plants are cool and sexy. How they work is cool and sexy. Nuclear as a word is cool and sexy and it makes me feel certain ways a woman shouldn’t for a power plant and so I demand MORE NUCLEAR! A REACTOR IN EVERY YARD!",

To answer your question, I am 100% happy with my decision but I would urge you to do your homework and to not necessarily go with door to door salesmen.

That way, sales closers can sell on the premise of a “bill swap”. \n\nId like to think that with an open electricity market, it gives incentive to build over 100% offset. If youre installing much larger systems, it makes it easier to cover your overhead costs for the project and then they can sell the panels at a fairer rate. At a company I worked at,  their 5KW system kwh rates was just below $4 per W whereas 20KW systems sold at just a bit above $2 per W.",

"comment": "I am going to suggest a couple of things to possible bring down some of your battery needs.  I am currently trying to tweak our energy usage and have been scouring the internet to see how I can make my battery system last overnight as well.  Since I am married to a CPA and numbers speak loudly, and I have a law degree, I determined by looking at the tax code that there are several things that could make a huge difference in our energy usage that should help us become more energy efficient and gain some tax credits for as well.  I may also buy one more battery for our system to get us through the night. But wanted see what I could do long term as well.  What is cool about our system is if I charge the batteries while I have really good production I get increased usable production because of my DC batteries.  I am going to adjust the TOU to charge the batteries later in the midday and then start using them a bit later too.  We have net 1 to 1 metering.\n\n1.  I am planning to put window film on my windows to keep the heat out in the summer and heat inside in winter.  I did some GILA application myself but I have some many windows that i want to get the lifetime professional application.  These window films have been shown to save 20 to 30 percent of your home energy usage.  I already ran through the house and disconnected a lot of vampire electronics.  We had insulation put in when we installed solar and that has helped a lot.  Our system was projected to cover 86 percent of our usage but I think it will be close to 95 percent with some of the changes I have made.  The nice thing about insulation and the window film is that we can receive a tax credit for that too.  I may only do part of the house in one year and the other part the next to maximize the tax credit.  There is also a tax credit for energy audits which I also plan to use.  I think it is $150.  \n\n2. Tonight I discovered that my gas supplier has an up to $500 rebate on duct sealing. Duct sealing has been proven to also improve energy use by 15 to 30 percent in heating and a/c.  \n\n3. We have a large nearly 19 year old home not builder grade so I am also looking into a higher eff. a/c system.  My HVAC guys are coming this week I want to see what the cost is to upgrade both zones would be.  But first I want to maximize the energy eff. of the house then see how that impacts my usage before spending money on a new HVAC when the one we have still works very well.  Of course there are also tax credits for certain models with increased efficiency.  There are also some rebates with the electric supplier for some models of a/c and heat pumps.    \n\n\nI am telling you all of this because some of these things which you may have already done, are cheaper than batteries and can save you considerable money if properly utilized.  I hope this is helpful to you.  It does not answer your question, but it should help you possibly reduce the size of the battery you may need to suit your needs.  Thus saving you money in the long run.  The 30 percent credit will be there until 2033 I think so I personally would rather save some money by reducing consumption first before spending money on batteries that will only last 10-15 years where as some of these solutions will last possibly for as long as you own your home or even longer than the batteries.\n\nBlessings to you. I hope someone can directly answer your question.  Hopefully someone finds this information useful.",

"comment": "I think 300kWh is way too little especially you have an EV. I have two PHEV, both my wife and I go into the office twice a week and WFH for the other three days, our average monthly consumption on charging both of our cars is about 300-320kWh, so with AC in summer and pool pump (we also have a pool and the pump runs about 6-8 hours everyday), our average monthly usage is between 900-1100kWh. My system is designed to offset 120% of my projected usage (11.96kW), so that I have some room to grow, such as switching to a full EV in the next 5 years.\n\nPersonally, my recommendation is to live there for a year and start recording and analyzing your monthly usage and hourly usage pattern. That would give you the most accurate estimation. However, since we're not sure what's going to happen to the solar tax credit after Trump takes over the office, I think you should at least gather 4-6 months of data (at least get a sample from winter month and summer month) then try to project your annual usage. \n\nOne thing to keep mind is that the bigger your system, more batteries you'll need, unless majority of your heavy usage tends to be in the day time. At this very moment, I still think the cost the battery is still pretty high, so I think it won't hurt to wait a little bit so you can collect some data and hopefully, the price of battery will go down a bit.",

"comment": "I'd say I am an omnivore :D. Plant based foods actually represent 85% of my diet. I guess I decided to \"quit\" being a vegan for the following reasons:\n\n**Health:**\n\nLike many people, I perceived veganism as a superior diet from a health standpoint. I mean there is no doubt that vegans and vegetarians have lower incidences of heart disease (#1 killer in the United States). But, after practicing veganism for close to three years I was confronted with issues like vitamin B12 deficiency, increased risk of bone fractures, deficiency in EPA and DHA omega-3s that have been attributed to a vegan diet by evidence based research. Clearly, these issues could have been corrected by just taking supplements (and I urge vegans to do so) but to me it meant that veganism is not the perfect healthy/sustainable diet that I perceived it was. Furthermore, I have gripes with all those vegan websites that tend to \"market\" veganism as a healthy diet by emphasizing on the cardiovascular benefits. I wish they would talk about these deficiencies so that people going vegan would understand the consequences of their choice better.\n\n**Ideology:**\n\nI've always thought that veganism as a philosophy is very noble but, to me, the debate of whether or not animals have complex emotions is more of an anthropomorphic problem. I mean if we think animals have complex emotions than perhaps we must hold them accountable for their actions. But that idea almost sounds bizarre. I mean would we really consider prosecuting a chicken for eating worms, or fishes for eating other fishes? \n\nOn the flip side, I think vegans/vegetarians/animal rights are right on target with the issues concerning the treatment of \"farm\" animals. I believe it is definitely immoral to give them a life of hell and pain and I wish as a human race we would treat them more ethically. \n\nNonetheless, I think I still practice my own version of veganism (yea right :D). I still refuse to buy leather products. I will pay extra money to ensure that the animal products are organic, free-range etc. (Yes, unfortunately, I have no way of proving that my extra dollars are really going towards improving the treatment of animals but that's all I can really do as a consumer living in a hardcore urban environment). And, as I said earlier, only a small percentage of my diet is really animal-based (basically milk, egg whites and fish).",

But remember: at least they're on the right track. Start up a conversation with one anyway (the site isn't always just for dating) and you might find a friend in there somewhere or maybe even someone who has WANTED to be more restrictive but hasn't had the support needed to go further (and no, I'm not saying you should go out of your way to aggressively convert them). \n\nAlso, big fist bump to be a brave male vegan. Trust me, you won't always be \"forever alone\"- from my experience, male vegans are so hard to find that women jump on the single ones that live close to them. If anything visit some of the national hotspots that have more veg people. I'm sure you'll find someone quick if you have a good attitude :-)",

I've done my best to relieve my non-religious associates of their ignorance about ethical consumption (which seems to lead to them putting it down, mostly, without knowing the first thing about it) and make known my stance that veganism and a commitment to animal rights are another rational response to reality. My take: The same way that veganism represents a baseline for ethical behavior (beyond which actual good can be done) in terms of consumption, atheism represents a baseline for clearly considering ethical behavior, below which that consideration begins to be degraded by dogma.",

Seriously, that's the *one* thing vegans tend to lack, despite it being right there in the grocery store; the fortified plant milks are good for that. I prefer almond milk, but not all brands taste the same. That goes for faux meats too... not all brands are the same, so some trial &amp; error is sometimes required for finding your favorites. Don't be afraid to cook something well; sometimes, simply following the recipe on the back of the box can be a great idea. You're doing the best thing! edit: Oh, &amp; lentils... they're a cheap, easy, delicious source of protein.",

I've still got that same amount of energy as day 10 of being vegan (when it kicked in for me).\n\n\n\nI have no clue what causes it (at least for those of us who get the energy spike) but I will say I love it! Not only do I physically feel better, I feel mentally better as well. :)\n\n\n\nP.S. I eat a mostly whole foods diet. Not very much junk food, mostly whole grains and whole beans (although sometimes refried) with vegetables dispersed into said grains/beans or served alongside it. Occasionally I'll have a pound of tofu but I'd say it's about 2x per month. Practically never eat meat or cheese analogues.",

So you go with the next best option and include some cooked foods, all plant base of course. I went raw for almost a year or so, altho it was nice and I even cleared my acne skin from it, it was hard to constantly find sweet and riped foods to make sure you have something to eat for the day or following week. It's so much easier to just go to your local grocery store and cook up a vegan meal. I feel just as good eating cooked foods but still do my best to at least get as much raw fruits and vegetables into my diet as I can. Normally through salads and lots of smoothies, as I find them to be the easiest and fastest way to get them into your body.",

"comment": "Yeah sure. In terms of vegan specific places, you're much more likely to find them in cities (obviously, they have more of everything consumer related!). However, you don't need to delineate far from the stock items you will already have in order to create vegan options. The majority of your produce is already vegan; fruits, grains, vegetables, legumes etc, are all staples in the kitchen. Rather than making them accompaniments to a meat product, find ways to make them shine on their own.  \n\nJust like the meat you're more used to cooking with, excellent vegetables picked in season need very little attention to make them awesome! In the UK right now, Beetroot, Butternut Squash, and Kale are in season, so this evening I made two purees (one beet and one squash), roasted some Beets and Squash, sautéed some kale, deep-fried some kale to make it crispy like seaweed, and toasted off the nuts from the Squash in some cumin, and tossed all of that together with a simple lemon &amp; tahini dressing. Insanely delicious, seasonal, and pretty easy.",

You basically asked for the difference between eating something that is purposely made by killing animals -- and eating something that might come into CONTACT with materials that other animal-based products may have also contacted.  You made it sound like there was no difference between those two things. I explained why I think there definitely IS a difference.\n\nIf you want to argue that no one should eat at KFC because they kill chickens, then that's fine -- go for it.  But that is a different argument/discussion than what we were talking about.",

What about all the starving children in the world? Homeless people? People in poverty etc and i said to her “but we can stop ourselves from actively contributing to it the best we can, right? What if people treated our dog like this, wouldn’t you feel immense sadness?”\n\nI guess it clicked with her on some level, i told her to try oat milk and soy milk with cereal instead and she did, and she thought it was fine! \n\nThe article i linked her too was a survey of something like 500 dairies in india, and i talked to her about how cows are artificially inseminated, separated from their calves etc and if it was worth it to have a glass of milk if all this pain was behind it, when there are heaps of other subsittutes",

My nephew thinks I’m crazy. For family events, I usually get a baked potato and vegetables. Unless I bring my own food.\n\nOf course, at work, just like you any food that is brought in is most likely not vegan. And, as you pointed out, if we ask about it, they get in our faces as though we are the bad people. \n\nTo tell you the truth, I completely distrust anything coming from normal stores or normal places. Unless I know it specifically is made for vegans, or made from Whole Foods, I don’t trust sports in side it. \n\nIsn’t it awesome that is vegans get to rant in this reddit sub-forum! It feels good to talk about it with other people that share the same problems.",

We are currently in the 6th mass extinction event, a problem comparable to climate change, the thing is, the main cause of extinctions is habitat loss and the main cause of habitat loss is the clearing of land to raise livestock and their feedcrops. A vegan diet saves land so is far more sustainable for that reason alone. \n\nThen there is the amount of nitrogen pollution, which causes ocean dead zones. The main cause of this is also animal agriculture.\n\nI think the largest use of freshwater is animal agriculture as well. During the droughts in California a few years ago, people were quick to blame the almond industry but the dairy industry consumed far more.",

Besides I think people spend a lot of time worrying about offending people rather than about effective activism. Now being a dick isn’t helping anyone’s cause but neither will tip toeing around people’s fragile feelings. Being real is the best way. Since vegans comes from all walks of life and politics, some may believe stupid things as blue lives matter, but I’d rather that than have a partisan movement that becomes an echo chamber. But the premise that vegans online are bigots is just not the case. Finding a few doesn’t represent the whole, especially since overall vegans tend to be less bigoted. You are veering I into the vegans are racist crap that I would stay away from. It’s the internet, not veganism",

"comment": "That's a common argument, but when you look at it, the hunt is organized in such a way as to *maximize* deer populations. First, the reason *why* there are no predators is because hunters shoot all predators. And then, why do we hunt the grown males and not the females or the young ones? Wouldn't that be much more effective population control. I tell you why: Hunting is lucrative, and wildlife agencies want a lot of it, which needs a lot of deer. The males use up all the resources but don't raise young ones. Killing them off means more resources available for the females and young ones, which means a much higher population next year.\n\n[Here's a good vegan take on hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w34zMpRs4jA). If there's a kernel of usefulness or necessity to it, it's been perverted for the fun and profit of animal exploitation.",

I think meat does taste great and still great powerful cravings, I just couldn't parse with the cruelty to animals and the unecessary impact on the environment and knew this mattered more than something tasting better to me. Pescetarian to vegetarian was also hard, i adore shrimp but same deal as last time. The vegetarian to vegan part was only difficult with eggs since I already can't digest dairy. \n\nIt was a few months long process helped by my neurologist and a carefully tracked migraine diary. Which I'm glad I did even if it extended the process. I've found several foods during the process that I identified as triggers, and may have given up and been discouraged had I changed overnight",

The right amount of proteins, carbs and fat must be calculated. The latter should be easy enough, but nonetheless important to think about.\n\nSometimes, vegan parents have their own alternative ideas about what their child needs, leading to malnourishment. These are cases that can reach the media, under headlines like “child in hospital because it was raised vegan”. \n\nThis is sad, for the child and for other parents raising their vegan children responsibly.\n\nPlease, read the advice from health experts, and it should all be fine.\n\nPS: the same goes for pets. A lot of vegan pet food is perfectly balanced, feeding them rice and veg won’t be.",

Unless the way they want to live their lives causes harm to others. \n\nFor example if a racist wants to to own slaves, fuck that guy. \n\nIf a sexist wants to rape, fuck that guy. \n\nIf a speciesist wants to have animals throats slit.... well.... why would I respect that? \n\n\nAnd it's great that you do those other things. But I'm not putting myself on a pedestal and patting myself on the back. A slave owner who feeds the needs is still a fucking slave owner. This is not about you or me and how good we are. This is about the animals. \n\nAlso have you even thought about what you did? You came into a vegan sub, a sub that believes exploiting animals for their products is immoral, and then get passed off when people tell you it's immoral? \n\nAgain this is like a sexist going into a feminist sub where someone is complaining that a family member has become more sexistm and saying \"I became more sexist and you should respect the way I want to live my life.\"",

"comment": "Most stuff is pretty straight forward. Leather, silk, fur and wool are to be avoided and are usually easy to spot on labels. But sometimes you may see wool described by the type of wool, like \"cashmere\" or \"merino\". \"Faux ___ fur\" is sometimes tricky because it may still be fur, just not from the animal it is supposed to replicate. You can often tell the difference with close inspection, though. Down is another animal product, but rare to find outside of big winter jackets. Shearling is also non-vegan unless a synthetic shearling. \n\nI buy most of my clothing from thrift stores and other resale shops, as it saves me money, often helps local charities, and avoids a lot of environmental and labor issues. And even then I try to avoid animal products because I don't want to send the message that animals are ours to use. I've made a few small exceptions like a pair of boots I bought rather last minute for camping for $2 that had some leather and I probably have some jeans with a leather tag on them, though I'm not even sure (I just remember that I forgot to check).  \n\nGenerally, it's actually pretty easy to avoid animal products when shopping for clothes. Winter coats and men's suits are a bit trickier, but even then you'll find a lot of alternatives. You just have to check labels. And when I decided to get rid of my leather shoes, I was pleasantly surprised to find that some of the nicer pairs I had bought were actually pleather! I had no clue! And I had paid enough for them that I would have thought they were leather, but pleather is really taking off these days.",
