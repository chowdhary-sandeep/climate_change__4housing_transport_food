You have to be careful with the bev or it is tow truck time. BMW does free towing but you will be a waiting a hour for a tow truck and then they might tow you somewhere where you have to wait to use a charger. If you go with the bev keep a close watch on how far you are from a charger versus your range. A tripometer is a good tool to use too. If you screw up pull over with some range left so you can run the accessories and still drive up and off the flatbed. Pull over somewhere easy for the tow truck to find too. You will use more miles on the highway too so account for that. Invest in a level two charger so you start more trips with more range rather than less. If you have a bev with eighty miles of range plan on going about thirty miles before turning around, that way you have some range left to spare if you need to take a detour or something. Otherwise get the rex, pay more, deal with a little less electric range by about ten miles, and deal with going a second slower to sixty. Moving a bev is more of a pain than a rex too if the move is far. The rex you can hobble along the highway with gas, the rex you need a flatbed trailer and I do not think uhaul even has those. So figure paying five hundred to a grand to get a bev trucked. Maybe you can drive a bev inside a uhaul and move it that way. The bev is more fun until you go to move or run out of range while driving. I wish the bev had more range, perhaps more like one hundred thirty miles. With the bev if you want to go exploring then plan your trips around chargers. Keep mental track of how far you went versus how much range you used. It is kind of a drag waiting in public three hours for a car to charge too. So plan on bringing snacks and books. The bev works best on familiar routes where you know the ranges. The bev is not for everyone, it is easy to get caught up in some songs on the radio and lose track of your range to the next charger. I wish the rex were as fast as the bev and that it had a bigger gas tank. With the bev you will lose range as the battery ages too. If you can live with a car that goes within a thirty mile radius of your house then maybe the bev is for you. The bev will be more viable once more level three chargers come out. Then you can get a eighty percent charge in thirty minutes. Maybe by 2020 tons of level three chargers will be everywhere. Gas stations should start getting them so they can make a profit off them. Gas stations could already be making money off level two chargers too. People charging cars buy things to eat at the gas station. The rex is a four k option on the i3. For that much you could buy a cheap used car or buy a number of other luxury options for the i3. The accessories do drain range from the bev though. I think the backup camera, premium sound, dc fast charger, larger navigation, satellite radio, and hand touch entrance packages are all worth it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2544010923805273,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05500714083505694,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2578086527171129,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19890288065791883,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24894872899567416,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15967684772249355,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.012695108152305087,"ev_1":-0.13440834994662915,"ev_2":-0.28478195861991934,"ev_3":-0.3378696697932646,"ev_4":-0.2532259026277551,"ev_5":-0.20785719327113839,"ev_6":-0.1943631099123835},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

And as for the cost, to me it seems about right for an extremely limited \"beta-type\" introduction of a new vehicle. Frankly, I'm kinda' surprised that it's not more expensive! Remember when the original [Tesla Roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster) was sold in 2008? It was a tiny two seater with a base price of $109,000 and only had a 200 mile range. How how far they've come along! \n\n\nI think that the point of this car today is to test the ability to operate Hydrogen Fuel Cell batteries in the proverbial \"real world\". It's all about making electricity in a new way. \n\nThe reason that I think this car has such a power autonomy angle is because the distribution of electricity is a major growth impediment for EVs. Globally, there are significant capacity issues with regards to electricity that will restrict what we can achieve with electric cars. While the problem exists both in terms of the transmission of power as well as power generation itself, the problem is far greater on the transmission side. There are only so many amps that can be distributed to and pulled from an average area serviced with 600 volt lines. That describes pretty much every modern city today. Think about what happens every time temperatures start to consistently exceed 100 degrees. We run into transmission over-capacity problems due to an increase in A/C demand. Note, it's almost never a problem on the generation side, it's a distribution/transmission problem. We'd bring down the entire system if a large number of people were to suddenly start driving electric cars within our current infrastructure. \n\nWhere you and I will most likely agree is that, as an overall goal, we need to build a replacement infrastructure to replace fossil fuel distribution for ICEs and replace it with something that energizes EVs. If we only look at electricity in its current form, that's a huge hurdle. There are massive restrictions that prevent us from putting up thousands of additional power lines and thousands more transformer sub-stations. \n\n\nTo illustrate this, as excited as we can get in this subreddit about the success of Tesla, remember that [Tesla will hope to sell 52,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors) cars this year, while the country overall will purchase [18,240,000 ICE vehicles in just this year alone](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/total-vehicle-sales). We don't have the infrastructure to energize anything more than a few percent of the overall quantity and that's just looking at \"new\" vehicles. We have [254,000,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States) ICE vehicles operating today and approximately [373,000 EVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_the_United_States). So, 0.0014% of the current registered vehicles today are EVs.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that I welcome exploring the development of alternative methods of energizing EVs. Toyota is testing a bold idea here. Maybe it will work and maybe it won't? Maybe it will work in Europe, but not here? Regardless, I believe that they are addressing an important and often overlooked problem. we will need to figure out a method of distributing power for EVs if we ever hope to make more significant inroads into the broader passenger vehicle market.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00035872305670636706,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09904884341511888,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.04007213500638803,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21650228773554167,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28673603491839267,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2502295400386578,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.056334943510591984,"ev_1":-0.1848681097447916,"ev_2":-0.017116044741366448,"ev_3":-0.021491510068396263,"ev_4":-0.06788010362530865,"ev_5":-0.00516756365262457,"ev_6":-0.010061552642580315},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

But let's say there were 70 million EVs in the US, and on a busy travel weekend ~10 million of those need at least one public fast charging session. If one charger averages three cars per hour for 16 hours per day over three days, call that 150 charges over a three-day weekend. 10 million ÷ 150 = ~67,000 chargers, assuming they're distributed where people need them and are constantly in use. \n\nRealistically, 100,000 DC chargers would make more sense, and more would be preferable.

Solar jobs require 4.4 billion in annual subsidy, whereas coal rakes in around a half billion in subsidy. In fairness Solar workers out number coal workers 2-1, but that's still a 4 to 1 subsidy per employee. \n\nAlso these retrained coal workers are now installing solar panels and inverters (most often) imported from China, so a sizable amount of this subsidy is sent across the world, whereas with coal, instead of importing, we were exporting our American rocks around the world.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm a huge proponent of solar power - but we can't bury our heads in the sand and ignore the detrimental economic reality of current political fiscal policy.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00037525127845583484,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19530221245951673,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18345449608780884,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21119377265373865,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2669255520190096,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17863836790184506,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09056448400951922,"solar_1":-0.03819247448943012,"solar_2":-0.007034518580136743,"solar_3":-0.16923764052473006,"solar_4":-0.047560095753397036,"solar_5":-0.0008749127494714534,"solar_6":-0.006004471411870327,"solar_7":-0.0005700073428063964,"solar_8":-0.002270701119414298,"solar_9":-0.008378397963194098,"solar_10":-0.024689761087453615},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

You seem to have a bug about $/w.   \nRead my first reply on your comments.  I talk about $/w still being primary for product improvement and $/kwh not being a good indicator, you seem to have missed this point entirely.  Many installers especially Sunpower try to push that sunpower out produces on a similar install.   There is no third party evidence to this greatly exaggerated over production that they constantly push for their over priced products.    Yes it is more efficient and you can sometimes fit a little more watts with a sunpower system but often you are comparing similar watt systems like the OP.   Yes the Sunpower will degrade slightly less but at the increased size of the OPs non-sunpower quote, it will not matter (not even close).  \n\nWith all contractors doing construction going with the lowest bid is not always the best advice thus $/w allows you to compare on an even footing and add in other things that homeowners know like reviews.\n\nIf the size from one proposal is different than the total size of others, that one should be reviewed for WHY they proposed a different size. \n\nHomeowners have different goals, 100% offset (kwh offset), 100% financial offset ($0 bills), best Return on Investment, backup capability, off grid.   \nMeeting these goals is different in different markets.

Right now my project is in the planning phase so I have a little time to think about hardware choices. In talking to my installer I’ve had questions about some shading issues that may arise once the install is complete because I have some trees in the way. The trees will be taken down with in the next 6 months but until then we talked about the potential loss of production. As an alternative my installer offered to replace the Sol-Ark 8kW with a Schneider-Electric Conext SW Pro and power optimizers. I was going with the Sol-Ark because of the flexibility and performance of this inverter. The only down side to it was the Sol-Ark couldn’t use the optimizers so all of the panels would have to installed in strings.\n\nWhich brings us to the Schneider-Electric hybrid inverter. From the research I’ve done this inverter seems to be pretty stable and Schneider has been in business forever so I know I’ll get support when I need it. The one thing that concerns me is I don’t see a lot of comments about any Schneider inverter and that is the reason for this post.

The single most important part of your install is going to be making sure they drill only the minimum amount of holes, and that they are properly flashed and sealed. If the company uses the hammer method to find the studs in your roof they will almost certainly drill extra holes (from missing the studs), greatly increasing your risk of leaks as well as damaging shingles in the process. I would never put solar panels on the roof of anything I owned unless it was a flat roof with a ballasted system. This is because of the leak issues as well as  having to completely dissemble, store, and then rebuild the system every time the roof needs work. If you are going to take this risk, you should insist that they use a proper $2000 ultrasonic stud scanner to find the studs. It's actually criminal that companies are not using this, it could save you tens of thousands down the road....\nEdit: Also you need to make sure whatever type of mounting bracket they are using is anchored into the stud and not just the sheeting. Many brackets, like the RT-mini can optionally be screwed just into the sheeting of the roof using 4 screws instead of 2 in the stud. You should consider this unacceptable, as do most structural engineers.

It would be even better if they calculated it yearly so your summer months could make up for winter usage, but it's still pretty good.

You also shouldn't expect to be able to sell your surplus (after you've reached zero) for anywhere near retail rates.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0015012773607547085,"1.1.1_stance":-0.38554973453959135,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27294200701249877,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.041503097862005234,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30596230969593957,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17967541804767884,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07950177990520994,"solar_1":-0.17070030450771337,"solar_2":-0.06376825656048961,"solar_3":-0.08794701028091367,"solar_4":-0.05934487230758337,"solar_5":-0.005875086137772693,"solar_6":-0.0038956615511172763,"solar_7":-0.049017278070095927,"solar_8":-0.03561639665470769,"solar_9":-0.03525815855601877,"solar_10":-0.2161326922941953},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

And that power is produced and consumed locally, they aren’t directing that power to long distance lines to send to cities across the state. You have 500 solar homes in your city and that power is going to their neighbors and local businesses. \n\nAll this solar distributed power saves them money too. Running gas and diesel peaker plants during the heat of the day causes efficiency loss and people don’t like those build near them so you have to send that power further and with greater transmission loss to meet demand. \n\nAlso in CA when there was a blackout or brownout, it always started mid afternoon because that is when it was the hottest. Now they happen in the evening when the sun is about to go down because of distributed solar.

Truly read what you’re signing. \n2. Don’t go with a company who sends you a contract to a different installer. \n3. Choose a full service company from sales to permits to install. \n4. Ensure you understand what equipment you’re getting. Some companies will try and sell cheap or refurbished panels. I personally recommend anything American made (Sunpower or Silfab) due to the trade supply issues we have already experienced and will continue to experience. American made panels are top notch for that reason alone. Not to mention Silfab has the longest output warranty in the world at 30 years. Out of any panel.\n5. Make sure your representative is willing to talk about any detail and answer any question. Reps like to leave out certain information unless specifically asked about. I believe it’s better to be fully honest and clear about the deal, and I think you need to just keep that in mind. If they’re acting shady and don’t have solid answers, it’s a sign. \n6. Make sure installer warranties the workmanship done. \n7. Understand the fact that some reps or companies will inflate numbers in terms of production on their software to make it look better than the actual final design will be. Some companies software don’t even take the roof obstructions or fire code into account. That means you could potentially end up with a totally different system or having it ripped down since the city won’t approve it. I’ve seen this happen before where a rep wants his commission and they’ll push it to install pre permit. \n8. Ask about timelines. Full service installers usually take 2-4 months to install. Brokers often take longer due to the fact more hands are in the pie. \n9. Understand your utility companies specific net metering policy. If your sales rep knows, even better. But never take their word for it unless the trust has been built and you know they’re a solid rep. \n10. Last but not least.... Enjoy the process and the savings. Yes it might seem like a big investment. But so is paying a never ending inflating loan to the utility company, with no ROI, and a price that will triple as time goes on as the grid itself is already 130 years old and can’t support the weight of EVs. They could choose to double your bill tomorrow and you’d be stuck paying it, unless you had your own power plant on the tip of your home. (Solar) ;) \n\nYou’ll look back in 15 years and think it’s one of the best investments you’ve ever made. Not to mention, most systems carbon footprint offset is equivalent to planting around 5k new trees or eliminating many tons of waste. You’re doing a great thing not only for yourself, but making a bigger impact than most people do. Most people just talk. \n\nGod bless!!\n\nZ","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006598875701987102,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0701907550295194,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16227311379194864,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07501858503868182,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2585777047498022,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06077251848182641,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01483233783316488,"solar_1":-0.18211663287339797,"solar_2":-0.15047479114682236,"solar_3":-0.007536534192998563,"solar_4":-0.0794263680199947,"solar_5":-0.0033394594362713783,"solar_6":-0.19737035031138794,"solar_7":-0.010800227074165983,"solar_8":-0.09953738092250812,"solar_9":-0.14715052631193734,"solar_10":-0.2465917109920917},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

We feel that human beings should not exploit or ultimately kill animals, because death is bad and should be avoided except when working toward the greater good - which feeds directly into a major criticism of the is-ought problem: utilitarianism. \n\nIf you would like to know more about the ethical problems with enslaving animal stock, feel free to study the work of [Peter Singer](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/index.htm), a well known utilitarian and vegetarian who also [directly adresses](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/197301--.htm) the is-ought problem.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.14515502947197534,"1.1.1_stance":-0.34011301305145025,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.13729979080490862,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25105334923253253,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23890324906200616,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21183330864178027,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0034520952225041888,"diet_1":-0.04602349282504292,"diet_2":-0.1627080663182398,"diet_3":-0.2572602430494347,"diet_4":-0.063907617963802,"diet_5":-0.010120456900646483,"diet_6":-0.06074366449562755,"diet_8":-0.010957493106009982,"diet_9":-0.0051895627317814315,"diet_10":-0.039369647675509135,"diet_11":-0.011346856599023644,"diet_13":-0.03579763455975874,"diet_14":-0.252556919886653,"diet_17":-0.01797115301875844},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

A single wild boar can easily destroy $1500 of plant life in one night. Is the vegan position that the boars have as much right to use my land as I do?\n\nI love (in an ironic way) the conditional nature of your beliefs. Killing mosquitoes is ok but not chordates. Well some chordates but only when ....\n\nI am trying hard to not interfere with the lives of other sentient animals. I have yet to see a cat expostulate on the duality of consciousness or the associative principal in mathematics. In fact, I've never seen my cat respond on other than an instinctual level. \"Meow\", I want food. \"Meow\", I want more food. \"Meow\", I want to sit on your lap, move the laptop. \"Meow\", I want still more food. Now that I think about it, I am the one doing all of the thinking here. Yep, cats bred us to take care of them.\n\n&gt;I think that's well established by science that animals feel pain, pleasure, and quite a range of emotions.\n\nExcuse me? You're going to have to be more specific than that. I've spent a lot of time with chickens and cows, for example. I've never seen any emotion from either of them. There's an incredible difference between hard-wired responses and having emotions. There is a difference from withdrawing from a flame as an instinctual response and from cognitively processing the information and avoiding the flame in the future. In both cases, there's withdrawal from a flame. In only one case is there anything like how we respond to pain. \n\nI agree - no one should unnecessarily inflict pain in animals. That's why there are regulations dictating the manner of slaughter. (Yes, I'm aware there's a lack of oversight but nonetheless the rules are there). I can be killed in all sorts of ways that don't inflict pain. Although a different topic, I am amazed we don't provide humane deaths for people suffering from incurable, painful conditions. \n\nI'm sorry but I just don't buy the eggs reason at all. I've raised chickens. They had free run. Loved the eggs. I protected them from getting eaten by dogs or foxes. I took their eggs every day and fed myself and others with them. You really aren't connecting with me that I was exploiting them in the slightest. \n\nHow about fish? Am I exploiting them by keeping them? By feeding them everyday? I have never seen even a glimmer of intelligence in their eyes. Given the limited number of neurons, their ability to feel pain (as opposed to simply being reflexive) is so different than mine that I just don't see the connection.\n\nI don't raise them to kill them though wouldn't have a problem if I did.\n\nThough you may hate what I am saying, let me point out I am trying to connect with you. \n\nI once had a gf who anthropomorphised animals to an incredible degree.

I'm going to say probably not, since people in general are resistant to change when they see it as unnecessary.\n\nSo is it really evil to date a non vegan? or is it more compassionate because you get to be a living example of what you believe to someone you love? Even if your significant other only shares one or two vegan meals per week with you, is that not better than if you hadn't dated and they continued on eating meat with every meal? \n\nObviously this depends a lot on the person, but I think in general the easiest way to convert people is to lead by example and show with your actions that vegans are normal, happy, healthy people. No need for hostility or rudeness... That is just counter productive.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20339055694294572,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24280166121921581,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22502547898004616,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11003976423914234,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20429356768727303,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22678598168782316,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1976629155681735,"diet_1":-0.12190439121312124,"diet_2":-0.09888492998409977,"diet_3":-0.10084181025255627,"diet_4":-0.007122322878785781,"diet_5":-0.002820838213665411,"diet_6":-0.02115697903597417,"diet_8":-0.0019602891713172235,"diet_9":-0.0016969744077262778,"diet_10":-0.022097120545974274,"diet_11":-0.0025921190299413865,"diet_13":-0.018526270912843756,"diet_14":-0.01557854791947951,"diet_17":-0.016971315886621596},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I think that should be the biggest factor. Artificially inflating the demand/supply of vegan ice cream by buying more than you actually *want* would probably do more harm than good (it funds a pretty nasty company and producing vegan ice cream still has an environmental cost/carbon footprint...

Lately, I’ve noticed there are a lot of people in the same boat as me. \n\nI was talking with a few friends and we were discussing how a lot of processed meats such as chicken are slowly being mixed with other soy proteins to make a 50:50 kind of product that’s not entirely made out of chicken. Do you think doing that with other things such as beef patties could help bridge the gap and move more people over to veg/veganism? \n\nSo many are turned off by the 100% veggie patties because they are stubborn and stuck in their old ways, but do you feel that maybe having a burger patty that is half beef, half plant protein, more people would be willing to try it? I see it as an easy start to compromise because taking any meat off the market is a positive step in my opinion.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"yes","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.10133048767253665,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1933509716323424,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14457846345462394,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2820761634177537,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.055195191875100136,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2796693535501209,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.011099480170135697,"diet_1":-0.2570821819353039,"diet_2":-0.2066990237653954,"diet_3":-0.2732783078990053,"diet_4":-0.11067274873239638,"diet_5":-0.17757652856497202,"diet_6":-0.20588534774578307,"diet_8":-0.29763659860641684,"diet_9":-0.21097684969489777,"diet_10":-0.11683396994999384,"diet_11":-0.1640301979277835,"diet_13":-0.16747889199608912,"diet_14":-0.1773014933818189,"diet_17":-0.2243969638316773},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.
