For example, if I'm an installer and I want to build a system for a school that can't take advantage of the tax benefits because they don't have the tax appetite, I can introduce a bank as a tax equity investor. The bank will technically own the system to retain tax benefits, but they can enter a lease or power purchase agreement with the school so that the school can get the other benefits of solar. I don't specifically have literature on this, but this is the model that almost all the solar companies follow to finance residential and commercial scale projects. Look at SolarCity, SunRun, SunPower or SunEdison. \n\nFor the different parts of a family to invest in the system, I would think that it would operate in the fashion similar to what is seen in the community solar projects, where funding is crowd-sourced in order to build a larger project. However, I'm not sure if tax credits or depreciation benefits can be divided amongst different entities; only to the single majority owner of the system. If it is allowable, I would think someone organizes a fund where the individuals are stakeholders and they can find a way to pool their tax liabilities maybe? But the actual methodology of disbursement of tax credits is not something I am familiar with. Maybe take a look at Solar Mosaic, as that's something that's up their alley. \n\nHope that helps!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00026673998703093577,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12528568515470795,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2414637818323961,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22431326716193484,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2984744511846465,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27626585208169274,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10251705364983839,"ev_1":-0.013918278002165607,"ev_2":-0.2647250492209423,"ev_3":-0.004546418657506972,"ev_4":-0.0034127951657865196,"ev_5":-0.0006458831024550212,"ev_6":-0.0028852651181902425},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Refuse trucks circulate through our cities and neighborhoods collecting that trash, typically starting and stopping every few yards. For trucks that can weigh up to 33 tons, all of the slowing down and speeding up uses a lot of fuel and generates a lot of emissions. At this week’s WasteExpo in Las Vegas, Mack Trucks and Wrightspeed are teaming up to demonstrate a plug-in hybrid trash hauler claimed to be able reduce fuel consumption by up to 70%.\n\nThe Wrightspeed Route 1000 powertrain is the brainchild of Ian Wright, one of the co-founders of Tesla Motors. While Wright believes in electrification, he is of the opinion that efficiency efforts would actually have the biggest impact if applied to the biggest consumers of energy such as medium and heavy duty trucks and buses. These vehicles are typically powered by big diesel engines that make a lot of noise and pollution while getting anywhere from 3 to 6 mpg and accumulating as much as 100,000 miles per year.\n\nWhen Wright decided to tackle this problem, he did it from first principles. Whether you’re looking at package delivery, transit buses, or refuse collection, all of these applications share a need for substantial payload capability. Given the mass and bulk of even the most advanced batteries available today, going all electric was not viable because the batteries would use up too much of the payload, making the vehicles useless.\n\nWright’s approach is to size the batteries for about 30 miles of electric driving and then use a range extender to keep the truck going for the rest of the route. Unlike something like the Chevrolet Volt which uses a conventional gasoline four-cylinder engine, Wright found the most efficient type of range-extender available, a small gas turbine. This is paired with a motor/gearbox unit mounted at the drive axles to provide propulsion and regenerative braking from all the stops these vehicles typically do.\n\nWrightspeed has been testing its system for several years now with a variety of companies including FedEx and plans to enter regular production by early autumn of 2016. Earlier this year, Wrightspeed announced a deal to supply powertrains to NZ Bus in New Zealand.\n\n“Until now we’ve focused on re-power kits that would enable customers to do cost-effective updates to existing vehicles without having to purchase all new,” said CEO Ian Wright. “This program with Mack is our first installation with an OEM.”\n\nSeveral years ago, Mack tested a fleet of five diesel-electric hybrid trash trucks in New York City and while they worked well and were fuel efficient, they were also expensive.\n\n“The market dynamics in recent years made other alternatives like CNG and to a lesser degree hydraulic hybrids more cost effective,” said Roy Horton, Mack Trucks director of product strategy. “We’re going to do internal testing first with this truck to evaluate it before potentially doing some customer testing later.”\n\nWhile diesel remains relatively cheap today compared to where it was a few years ago, Mack is still looking out into the future when it will have to deal with tightening emissions and fuel economy standards even on heavy duty trucks. “We see the potential for cost-effectiveness in the Wrightspeed system,” added Horton\n\nIn addition to the fuel savings, heavy duty trucks have a lot of maintenance requirements including the brakes and the diesel particulate filters that must be replaced periodically. Going to a plug-in hybrid that gets most of its braking from energy recovery and much lower emissions from the turbine can lead to maintenance cost savings that combine with fuel savings to offset a lot of the cost of the conversion. Wright estimates a typical payback of three to four years for his system. Since many of these vehicles run for at least 12 to 15 years, that can add up to a lot of savings.\n\nAccording to Wright, the company currently has a $40 million order backlog. The NZ Bus deal was the first order the company received through a competitive bidding process and the first bus is currently going through the conversion process in Wellington, New Zealand. Mack has no firm plans to offer the Wrightspeed Route 1000 powertrain as a production option, but if testing goes well, it could become available.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006028279351691405,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13388394947057,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21094071267011819,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21767933987686128,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30867810364099213,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32885941349453773,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0031354688896196117,"ev_1":-0.20634264528035415,"ev_2":-0.19061502756168616,"ev_3":-0.26134556256329233,"ev_4":-0.17628809524903347,"ev_5":-0.2370618952809838,"ev_6":-0.20837116566386543},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options stance toward EVs in heavy duty trucks.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear\n\n(Note: The text mentions the use of a plug-in hybrid powertrain and potential fuel savings, but it does not explicitly describe any specific behaviors or prevalence of their adoption.)","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

Not only are you away from the car anyway while you visit those places, but your battery will always be fairly full, because you don't drive enough distance to make it run empty, and it gets filled back up to full everytime you stop. Therefore, charging speed will become increasingly irrelevant for everyday use, as will be battery capacity, and also the availability of high-power centralized charging infrastructure.\n\nNow, the reason BEVs are still considered impractical is because people don't drive only \"average\" distances - sometimes they have to go long distance. And that's a problem for current vehicles due to a combination of battery sizing and charging speed. However, those two factors are synergistic. An increase in one multiplies an increase in the other above its nominal value of usefulness. On a long-distance drive, it matters to the driver both 1.) how often they have to stop, and 2.) how long they have to stop. A bigger battery decreases the number of stops, and a faster charging rate decreases the time spent at each stop.\n\nThis is where high-powered, centralized DC fast-charging infrastructure is absolutely required: on long-distance routes. Thankfully, motorway service stations already exist, and they are already more tightly meshed than what necessity would dictate based on the typical range of an internal combustion vehicle. We can use these existing locations to deploy the necessary charging infrastructure - and in fact, this is already starting to happen. In the last half year, multiple operators of motorway service stations across Europe have announced partnerships with manufacturers. And then there's the Queen's speech, which requested a new law that *requires* every gas station in the UK to install charging infrastructure. All motorway service stations include gas stations, and will therefore automatically receive charging infrastructure. This will support long-distance driving.\n\nIn regards to the practicality of it all with future tech: the past month has seen not one, but two separate networks announce a path forward towards deploying 350 kW chargers before 2020. A third (Tesla) has not announced such a move yet, but has been internally working on it. Such a system would be capable of adding ~200 miles of range to a typical EV over the span of just ten minutes. This is a kind of speed that basically removes concerns about charging time entirely. Stopping every 200 miles is not too much to ask; it is in fact recommended for health and safety reasons. And if you only have to stay for 10 minutes, that is basically just enough time to use the restroom and have a swig from the water bottle you should be bringing on such long trips. Things you would have done anyway, even without charging.\n\nBecause of this, you do not need batteries capable of exceeding internal combustion cars in range. Even 200 miles of range will enable smooth long-distance travel, if/when the battery can charge at this speed and the infrastructure offers this speed. If the batteries later exceed these capabilities - great, that'll make things even better! But it can work with these near-future values. It will not happen at massive scale within one or two years, but it is a process which has already started implementation. Considering the typical time span to replace a country's entire vehicle fleet is around 20 years, and EVs are a long ways off 100% market share, we are probably not going to see 100% EV adoption until at least 30 years into the future. That is plenty of time to develop new batteries, which have for the past 20 years improved by a steady 5%-6% per year in capability and at a greater rate than that in cost; as well as rapid charging solutions, which have grown in capability at far greater rates. In my opinion, the limiting factor will not be technology development, but rather the physical rollout.\n\nNow I wanted to bring up other trends, but I think I'm approaching the character limit. If you're interested, I can post more :)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23632977973708572,"1.1.1_stance":-0.36019662636524963,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.35554866793476236,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3401968773752136,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3885639469517628,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2527860907501384,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05383002711459994,"ev_1":-0.1984952548229761,"ev_2":-0.17282025737588924,"ev_3":-0.2389866219165578,"ev_4":-0.1576298233953655,"ev_5":-0.18668742159996227,"ev_6":-0.10876052737548958},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

[http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SunChartProgram.html](http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SunChartProgram.html)\n\nNext you can use this website from NREL to calculate what your system will produce [https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php)\n\nYou would need to enter each array separately and make a spreadsheet to record what each one will produce. You could also compare the exact same size array at different azimuths to work out what the losses are.\n\nUsing Redding as an example and assuming you have no shading and a 20\\* roof angle, you would get a 4% loss (form direct south) on the SW facing array, and a 26% loss on the NE facing array. In reality your losses may be a bit greater and of course I do not know the details of the solar availability like if you have any shading obstructions, but this gives you a general idea. \n\nSW is great, NE you will have losses, but considering Tesla is already 20 - 40% cheaper than other installers it may be no big deal. They are certainly trying to sell you the largest system possible. I have been doing solar for a very long time and it was not long ago that you would NEVER consider putting a system on a north orientated azimuth. With how low cost solar is now, I dont see a good reason not to as long as you understand that the NE facing array will put out around three quarters of what the SW array does each year.\n\nPersonally I dont think grid tied solar has to be all about offsetting as much use as possible. You could just be a smaller system in most effective areas of your roof. With that said, I have solar on weird angles on my house because I can do it for nearly free and I dont care what it produces.

Solar does require water. \n\nThere are environmental impacts. They may not be as dramatic as the opponents claim, but impacts exist nonetheless. Are the impacts zero? Do impacts need to be zero? Is solar a dramatic improvement over fossil fuels and their externalities? Is there a way to reduce the environmental impacts of solar? And so on. \n\nWe should still pursue all options, improve existing options, and have a clear idea of all the costs and benefits. \n\nhttp://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49468.pdf\n\n\"In all cases [of concentrated solar power plants], the transition to dry cooling will reduce water consumption by over 90%. The remaining water consumption is split between steam-cycle maintenance and mirror washing.\"\n\nhttp://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/water-use-by-solar-projects-intensifies/?_r=0\n\n\"developers [of concentrated solar power plants] prefer to use so-called wet cooling in which water must be constantly be replenished to make up for evaporation. Regulators, meanwhile, are pushing developers to use dry cooling, which takes about 90 percent less water but is more expensive and reduces the efficiency –- and profitability – of a power plant.\"\n\nhttp://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/sep/18/dirty-detail-solar-panels-need-water/\n\n\"Dust on solar panels can decrease their efficiency by about 3 percent, solar photovoltaic experts said. The larger the solar array, the more electricity lost. [...]\n\nMost photovoltaic arrays are cleaned with tap water sprayed with a hose or from a water truck. So solar array managers have to add in the cost of labor, truck rental and gasoline.

In fact, GMP has one of the best and most user friendly sites of all the utilities. I highly recommend you use that instead. For example, it has been a while since I dug into the details in VT, but I'm pretty sure the credit expiration term is set on a rolling basis. In other words, credits earned each month must be claimed within the next 12 months. So, naturally you would be applying the oldest credits to each subsequent month. I guess you would call it a FIFO system, and that is different that a simple true-up at the end of the billing year.\n\nAs others have suggested, you are much better off comparing 3 local quotes to hold each of the others honest than asking people all over the country to assess a bid in VT.

Especially if it has some garden. If a catastrophe comes, it will hit those living in stuffed urban environments the most. \n\nIf it becomes a survival struggle, being as independent as possible is important. Here are some things that will help you, so consider them:\n\n* Stay in the house you have, and install solar panels. Make sure to also install batteries so energy doesn't go to waste. This way not only you will be sure that the power you're using is environment friendly, but also that in case power price rates go up because of the climate change, they won't affect you.\n\n* If you have a garden, plant some trees and bushes that produce food, not flowers. Apple trees, olive trees, and such. Climate change might result in foot shortages, and this will result in chaos in urban environments. People will rush to buy and stock as much food as they can, and when you go to the super market or convenience store, you might find that there is nothing left. Perhaps the products of your garden might dwindle, or they might not be enough for a balanced diet, but hey, something is better than nothing. The less populated the area you're living is, the less are the chances one of your neighbors will flip and start using violence such as guns to get his food, at a situation where money can't buy you food.\n\n* It would be better to live in a place where you are protected as much as possible from phenomena that can be related with extreme weather. For example living on a large plain is more dangerous than living on top of a cliff, when it comes to excessive rainfall, as the plains will flood, but the water will follow the hill downwards and won't accumulate on its top. Also it's good to make sure you are at least 30 meters away from forest trees. If the forest catches a wildfire, you want to be at a safe distance so that the flames won't reach your house. But it would be a good idea if a forest is in a convenient walking distance, especially if there are edible fruits, mushrooms, greenery, or even roots that can be find in it, so you can look out for food if the need arises. Also it will be good if you know of a nearby fresh water spring, so you can have drinkable water even if the water infrastructure of the state fails. But make sure to stay at a distance from rivers, especially if they are on higher ground. Because rivers might overflow, and flood your house. And of course it would be a good idea if your house is far from the ocean, because cyclones and such form on the ocean, and get weaker once they are over land. Also it would be a good idea to live at an altitude higher than sea level. At least 90 meters higher than sea level. Because if the ices of the poles melt, sea level will rise. Finally, if sea level rises, be prepared for the mass migration waves of people that will be leaving cities that are at low altitudes. Hundreds of millions of people around the world live in cities that would sink under water if pole ices melted, like Atlantis.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.023026742041110992,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2327512489093212,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1976704861603633,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08034210773102468,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2179246845939231,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.28325666463365595,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08892701909644529,"solar_1":-0.13105595247173366,"solar_2":-0.22481082011445752,"solar_3":-0.1392965147392115,"solar_4":-0.25152440648848895,"solar_5":-0.11536995603679957,"solar_6":-0.057901677483340006,"solar_7":-0.0513045465004088,"solar_8":-0.05811523020156992,"solar_9":-0.0315359676163709,"solar_10":-0.11854918216265652},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro: The author advocates for installing solar panels and planting food-producing trees, demonstrating a positive stance towards solar energy and self-sufficiency.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Battery technology is definitely important, with companies like Tesla developing high capacity, inexpensive batteries that doesn't really worry me as long as there is research being done, ie, as long as there is incentive. \n\n As for your neighbor, it could be that their house is not fully off the grid, that that they don't have a means of storing the energy, or that the panels are auxiliary and server to drastically reduce power bills.\n\n As for houses in the snow, heaters, salt, dark material, or even hydrophobic surfaces. Well maintained solar fields, wind farms, geothermal, nuclear, are all other options for snowy or otherwise sunlight deprived areas.  And that's only what I, someone who isn't in the field, can think of off the top of his head.\n\n As for converting old homes, we will do exactly what we did when people converted from wood furnace to electric.  \n\n The 1st part of the bell curve is the  More wealthy are able to purchase the new technology as more of a status symbol than a environmental effect.\n\nThen as technology starts to get better more and more less a fluent people can afford to do it and word of the benefits spreads.\n\nAfter that more and more and more people convert over to the new technology as it is better developed, problems are solved and it becomes even cheaper. \n\n Then we have the slow in installation as we hit the other side of the bell curve where most homes are now running on the new technology yet we still have a lot of layovers due to resistance to change, cost, other accessibility. \n\n And then as time progress is less and less and less people have the old technology and the vast majority have the new. \n\nAn example of this would be cars.

I *could* afford a BEV, but that would mean a noticeable compromise in other financial goals.\n\nBut the other problem is this ignores other options you could put your money toward that could have a bigger impact.\n\nFor example, I estimate that the amount of natural gas I use to heat my home produces CO2 emissions about in line with the gasoline consumption of driving about 9,000 miles. If I could make energy improvements that would get me a 10% reduction in heating needs for a similar cost of a BEV. Considering that I drive *less* than 9,000/mi year, that would have a greater benefit right from the start. With a more typical driving profile, the house would be a lesser improvement -- but would be a *lasting* one. Probably around 20 years it would start pulling ahead, and most houses are well over 20 years old.\n\nOr perhaps you could put it toward a solar array. A good calculation here would be more work than I want to put in, but as a quick smoke test the emissions from my last years' electric use is the equivalent of almost 20K of miles driven at 30 mpg. (I don't live on a particularly green grid.) Considering there are a bunch of fudge factors (like a system that could provide all my electric needs would well outprice an EV premium), this may or may not wind up more beneficial than getting a BEV. I would guess no (especially because I'm skeptical of the efficacy of solar for my specific location), but it's definitely not a *clear* no.\n\nBut it's possible to do better. Like... much better. Much much much better. Let's pull from the Effective Altruism community.\n\nGiving What We Can [analyzed the charity \"Cool Earth\"](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/report/cool-earth/) a while back and estimated that it is able to reduce carbon emissions for about $1.34 per tonne of CO2. I think the same folks later said these figures are too optimistic, and I'll come back to that later, but let's work with them for now. $5,000 by that estimate would reduce emissions by ~3,700 tonnes CO2, which [at 0.008887 tonnes CO2/gallon gas](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references) is 416,338 gallons of gas. At 30 mpg, enough to go... 12.5 million miles. Are you going to drive your BEV 12.5 million miles? That would probably offset the lifetime gas consumption of every person in this thread.\n\nThere are error bars on that original estimate, but it doesn't really make a difference. Their range spans $0.65-$1.87 per tonne of CO2, and even at $1.87, $5K gets you 9 million miles worth of driving. That estimate could be off by *100x* and it would still match more than six years of average driving.\n\nLike I said above, [later analysis said they overestimated the effectiveness](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RnmZ62kuuC8XzeTBq/why-we-have-over-rated-cool-earth#4_Impactfulness_varies_by_country). That's unfortunate. However, they *also* [evaluated a different charity](https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-climate-change) as even *more* effective. \"We roughly estimate that via their future work, CfRN will avert a tonne of CO2e for $0.12, with a plausible range of $0.02 - $0.72.\"\n\nAnyway, don't be so judgemental on this point. They might just be looking at the problem space differently.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13703221812223396,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13232011142369943,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17726465435312305,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24761393183638958,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.283739347286103,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.326176316949441,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.262027429894627,"solar_1":-0.24270000217665497,"solar_2":-0.13168337130509827,"solar_3":-0.19337220566172342,"solar_4":-0.040277701354155815,"solar_5":-0.05496731518057697,"solar_6":-0.04288251115036454,"solar_7":-0.028284201218657934,"solar_8":-0.026549864525242623,"solar_9":-0.00998763719783824,"solar_10":-0.16866895070314827},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Can the trees be removed? That's going to make a big difference, you have a lot of roof space that's heavily shaded, you can get a lot of extra energy if those trees were gone.\n2. Do you know what the access requirements for your roof are? You may be able to fit more panels if you reduce the access to the legal minimum (my town does NOT require both sides, just 1 36\" path).\n3. What's your reason for a heat pump? Cost or environmental? What's your current electric rate?\n\nSpecifically, I think if you remove the trees I think that's likely to make a big enough difference that you won't need more panels (your kWh/kW is really low...lower than me, and I have mostly north facing panels in NY).\n\nSecond, depending on local rates, the heat pump is likely cheaper anyways, and it's most certainly more environmentally friendly. If your reasons are environmental, just get the heat pump (and I might consider get community solar to meet the offsets you need). If your motivations are cost, run the numbers, it's probably still worth it.

I don't know where you live, but where I live it's really hard to be a 100% perfect vegan 100% of the time.

Am I a hypocrite to even partake any with my belief system? Yes. But a sad fact of the culture that I live in is that we all have to accept the level of hypocrisy that we are comfortable with.

Unless your argument is 'The world needs it's almonds, and we Californians are their only hope!'\n\nWhat I want to see statistics on is volume of products produced, export and revenue statistics, efficiency of water used, and wastewater recycling percentages. \n\nDairy/beef may already be at a slight advantage with this simply because around 20-30% of the water used to produce the products is conserved in the products themselves; assuming these products are largely sold locally, this means that most of the water stays in California, and hopefully finds its way one way or the other back to the water treatment system. If exported this advantage is lost.\n\nAlmonds, however, I don't know much about growing almonds; but considering the remarkably low water content of the final product, and given the amount of water to obtain said product, there would need to be considerable infrastructure in place to reclaim said water at the farm, which I'm not sure is in place.\n\nFor the record, I don't care about vegan practices, meat or dairy produced in California, or whatever other political agenda might play in here. I just would rather have people basing opinions off more meaningful statistics than 'look at this big number compared to that small number! My thing is much more important/better/more worthwhile than the other thing.'\n\nEdit: Please excuse my remarks on water used/conserved for beef and dairy, I was operating off of bad information. Turns out in beef and dairy a completely negligible amount of water used makes it into the final product, but my point about feeling that there has to be better points of data to use than what was put forward in the OP to base an argument on.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00012578674432006665,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17613414649563486,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18629410435236085,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3627876381279091,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38743919419675876,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19063597934858978,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09821958990505664,"diet_1":-0.034293000125520244,"diet_2":-0.011898587053413697,"diet_3":-0.17556231390106475,"diet_4":-0.014585504883749914,"diet_5":-0.007064726774842711,"diet_6":-0.03295915817458687,"diet_8":-0.004118554865878347,"diet_9":-0.002701380111830076,"diet_10":-0.012302137655448556,"diet_11":-0.03148444937323802,"diet_13":-0.004361321679122436,"diet_14":-0.11531338897701618,"diet_17":-0.00678855233794214},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Thanks for the polite and well written question. I believe that you do truly love your pets and can do so without any level of cognitive dissonance occurring. I'm of the opinion that this post isn't so much directed at pet owners, but more so the kind of people to claim that they love animals as a whole and take an increased interest in caring for and observing them. I think this post and meme is targeting the kinds of people who claim to be fascinated and inspired by the miracle of life and it's many forms because the assumption is that they ought to respect the life that they say they love. This is also assuming these biology majors, veterinarians etc. are not vegans. Which would be backed up by statistics. There just aren't that many vegans yet. The meme is criticizing the logic of such people. I have to agree with you though. It's kind of a weak meme in that sense since it relies on a straw man to work. That said, if I had to wager, I'd say that many hundreds of thousands of people exist who really believe they love and respect animals while also consuming animal products.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005734228664853921,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14563654555440736,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27253309704682477,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13679832965135574,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1420957092612354,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24808486337918323,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013181688574453196,"diet_1":-0.02273624018319727,"diet_2":-0.07350256919744425,"diet_3":-0.2561142437698436,"diet_4":-0.009300170894372664,"diet_5":-0.005315384970648059,"diet_6":-0.010925897529280823,"diet_8":-0.001744244543563885,"diet_9":-0.002116295986828239,"diet_10":-0.006904629097941021,"diet_11":-0.005466564803403647,"diet_13":-0.02265735884429887,"diet_14":-0.06273240703012561,"diet_17":-0.019779512188203324},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Synthetic taurine is added to the kibble to make it acceptable as cat food. (synthetic taurine btw is not unhealthy, as it is molecularly identical to raw taurine) \nCats can also suffer liver and kidney damage from commercial cat foods due to the preservatives used, and the meat content being derived from the most garbage portions of meat by-products. (This goes for dog food as well) - just look at the history of recalled pet food, especially big names like Purina and Iams.\n\nCats need taurine, and they have very strict dietary needs, and this can come from a well made nutritionally dense food with them in mind.  Never ever assume though you can home cook a vegan meal plan or kibble for cats on your own, since cats do not have the enzymes omnivorous animals do to break down and digest plant cells in home cooking, while Vegan kibble is made to be easily digestible for them.\n\nA vegan brand of cat and dog food that my family uses, and has been using for 10 years is Vecado.\nI don’t know what brands are available in your area, so I don’t know if this one is an option, but there certainly are options.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2180013964396272,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2593198391718768,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2831697027849479,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18841901120271334,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1073271727655083,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06432835588202579,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16912599940163395,"diet_1":-0.12070987614182134,"diet_2":-0.35372196417301893,"diet_3":-0.07654867518795072,"diet_4":-0.018552057561464608,"diet_5":-0.00833718805127622,"diet_6":-0.008083775464911014,"diet_8":-0.0003007510173726284,"diet_9":-0.012511441372528983,"diet_10":-0.04785488697234541,"diet_11":-0.015462076155624041,"diet_13":-0.01178291734928886,"diet_14":-0.17039244218681676,"diet_17":-0.0011393484273867216},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
