"comment": "That depends on who you're talking about.  There are folks in Southern California who commute 60 miles each way.  Yes, I think they're crazy, too, but they do it.  A long time to top up their vehicle literally doubles their commute time.\n\nAnd I'll take it you've never had to go on any sort of road trip where you're trying to get somewhere.  It's been three times that I made the trip between Seattle and San Diego.  That's 20 hours of driving time, plus about 45 minutes refueling time.  Hydrogen promises comparable time.  Even with a Tesla, using their superchargers, that top up time becomes about 3 hours.\n\nSo, for the average person, on the average trip, no, top-up time doesn't matter a lick.  When it *does* matter, though, it's *killer*",

The model 3 is speculated to use far less aluminum, so the poor smaller batteries have to haul around more weight per cell than their brothers in the S. Somewhere in that space, where cost is the third dimension, I think there exists another stable point that I think Tesla is trying to achieve.",

"comment": "For ICE vehicles, automakers outsourced production of nearly everything except the engine and drivetrain.  They felt this important IP, and would determine the industry winners.\n\nThey didn't care who made the windows, steering wheels, etc.  Many OEMs bought from the same undifferentiated suppliers.  They just wanted it cheap.  Remember when Tata had airbag problems? There were recalls from a half dozen OEMs because so many used Tata.\n\nThe problem with the Bolt is that GM is now not making any \"important\" parts.  Their only job is assembly and branding.  They don't build any of the engine/motor/battery/drivetrain. The company is getting hollowed out when looking toward the future.\n\nThis is a recipe for disaster, as they don't have any expertise in the critical parts of the EV.  If/when the market swings toward EVs, they'll have no competitive advantage.  I predict they'll really struggle.  What good is ICE expertise in an EV world?  \n\nIt'll be like Kodak all over again.",

"comment": "&gt; Not what I was saying.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you were saying it or not; the reality is that selling the cars for anything less than twice the price of what a top-spec loaded Corvette went for at the time, GM would lose a fuckton of money on each car. \n\nTesla is building the world's largest battery factory (and full credit to them for that), and that factory is expected to lower prices by 30% after five years, and that's by the most optimistic estimates.  So suppose GM had put in an equivalent investment back in the 90s.  Oh good, now their $100,000 two seater can sell for $70,000, still an order of magnitude above what any consumer would come close to paying. And that's after eating five years worth of losses.\n\nPeople need to come to grips with the fact that there was no conspiracy, and maybe, just maybe, the technology wasn't CLOSE to being viable in the 90s, and that no push from any single company would have changed that.",

As far as specific costs, it can vary greatly based on the charging station(s) selected and the electrical infrastructure currently existing at/near the charging area. If your company/business owner/landlord is interested, we'd be happy to set up a call where we could go over various options. \n\nIllinois funding:\nOn top of the federal 30% credit, Illinois provides \"Rebates to cover 50% of the cost of equipment and installation (including materials and labor).\" So your company's cost would come down to 20% of the project cost. Pretty sweet deal. \nhttp://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/10532\nHope this helps.",

Even in Ontario (which is considered to have some of the highest electricity prices in Canada) our off peak rate (7pm to 7am, weekends and holidays) is only 11 cents per kWh.   So it makes EVs look really attractive here because they are so much cheaper to operate then gas powered car.   The payback period is much quicker then it is in the US because of the wider gap between gas and electricity prices.",

"comment": "You need to look at the pack as a whole, typical batteries 1C is acceptable, my Volt lets the batteries peak at 8.5C, so higher is certainly possible. I have 50C capable RC car batteries.\n\nAnyways, this means that a vehicle with a 60mi range at 60mph would thus discharge it's battery at 1C, from that it's abundantly clear that a vehicle with a 120mi range is going to have a battery that is usually operating under 0.5C. If you look at other vehicles out there it's very clear that anything with a 100\\+mi range has zero problems getting power out of those batteries, in fact if you look at real world EVs in that class, they all blow the socks off every other car in their class in terms of power to the wheels. This is because the batteries for 100\\+mi range produce about as much power as the vehicle can ever dream of using in normal traffic.\n\nAnd the 2020 Roadster is no exception, build an EV for 600mi\\+ range, and you find out you have so much available power you're calling up tire manufacturers for help because you'll melt any normal tire.\n\nThe BYD buses are having problems because they went cheap everywhere, it's a \"almost 100mi\" bus, not 100mi\\+, and they are trying to operate them on routes that at near their limits. They could have easily paid for a 200mi bus, cell size is irrelevant, just install two of whatever packs they have and double up the motors. It's purely a cost issue, and BYD is a company that knows to to build cheap stuff.",

"comment": "With the sudden increase in Tesla vehicles on the road (is very noticeable around here in Northern Virginia), I reckon that 2019 will be the year for companies like Kia and Hyundai to start making a small dent in the share. With the reduced tax incentive for the big names, the smaller ones will get some of the more budget-strapped EV consumers when they see how nice these new entrants to the market are. I just bought a 2019 Kia Niro Plug-in Hybrid and it's a really nice vehicle (I unfortunately don't have an option for level 2 charging at home, so a PHEV works better on my case, where level 1 trickle charging is really my only option). When the EV arrives in April, I will certainly be envious of those getting one. Likewise, the Hyundai Kona will also probably be a success.",

I believe their plate change for the 20 year reg changed in March, there could be a chance that the model 3 is one of the most common new cars on their roads today. This is a big deal for spreading awareness of Tesla, EVs, electrification, and will reduces the number of dirty cars on the roads.",

Because most people don’t start charging on the road at 1%.\n\n&gt;The best metric they shared is “a 10 percent to 80 percent charge in approximately 45 minutes” while charging on a DC fast charging station.

BEV fares better, but the cut in emissions is nowhere near as drastic as between ICEV and HEV.\n\nSo those that say HEV are the way forward at least for now is completely right. Transitioning all cars to HEV drastically changes emissions, the biggest impact for the least amount of effort. It's the logical first step we should make based on facts and reason.\n\nhttps://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.html",

"comment": "I'll add my anecdote about mobile service. \n\nWe picked up our MYP with a large visible scratch on the spoiler ($800 carbon fiber spoiler...). We mentioned it to the delivery guy, and he immediately went ahead and scheduled mobile service to simply replace it - free since it's a delivery defect. It honestly wasn't that big of a deal, but hey if it's free and it's mobile service, why not. \n\nWell, let's just say it took over a month and numerous reschedules before the guy finally showed up at our house. He was originally supposed to show up at my work place where I intentionally parked the car outside that day. But after even more delays and fumbling that day, he ended up just showing up at our house since it was after business hours and he wasn't sure when he'd make it - therefore, I just went home. \n\nAnyway, guy was nice enough and we had a nice chat about our other car (Ioniq 5 - guy used to be a Hyundai tech). He moves on to finally replace the spoiler. \n\nWe now have a scratch free spoiler. That's just straight up loose. The looseness was not an issue on the old spoiler. I honestly would have preferred to keep a non-loose spoiler with a scratch than this one. I don't even feel like going through the process to schedule mobile service again, and just deal with the loose spoiler. From looking around online, this is a common problem with the spoiler. When it eventually just falls off, I'm going to live without this ridiculous spoiler.",

"comment": "&gt;The OIG \"identified several clear benefits of adopting electric vehicles into the postal delivery fleet, including improved sustainability and environmental impacts,\" the document continues. \"Electric vehicles are generally more mechanically reliable than gas-powered vehicles and would require less maintenance. Energy costs will be lower for electric vehicles, as using electricity to power an electric vehicle is cheaper than using gasoline.\"\n\nBEVs aren't all sunshine and rainbows for this use case... although these are the types of vehicles we want to electrify because they'd use the lion's share of their capacity daily to reduce emissions.  Some issues:\n\n* First... to a large degree these days, the post office is essentially paying people to dig holes.  They employ their own mechanics, so reliability isn't exactly a good thing if the goal is to keep people employed.\n* Gas savings will be offset by battery expense to a degree.\n* 200,000k+ vehicles at 30-40 kWh per vehicle on average is 6-8 GWh of cells, and it's 'mostly' a one time purchase.  Not very likely these are getting a volume discount.\n* Batteries could be cycled daily.  A pack with 2000 cycles being cycled daily 6 days per week may only last 6.5 years.\n* Winter.  A 30 kWh battery in a mail truck that's in use 8 hours per day with the heater running the entire time could use 2+ kW per hour.  That's 16 kWh per day.  A 40 kWh battery would have 24 kWh remaining for driving, while a 30 kWh battery would have 14 kWh remaining.\n* Battery degradation could reduce range over time.\n* Charging.  Do you install DCFCs and rotate the cars nightly, or do you install plugs in the lots?  Those lots are rarely ever organized.  How much electrical work does each lot need to provide this boost in energy?  It may not be as simple as running new electrical lines to the parking spots, but installing new and expensive service at the post office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The document also emphasizes that despite the higher upfront cost of buying new EVs and installing charging infrastructure, \"the adoption of electric delivery vehicles could save the Postal Service money in the long term,\" particularly for longer routes that are up to 70 miles, because the USPS would save on rapidly rising gas costs.\n\nAre gas prices rapidly rising?  They've certainly spiked, but spikes are often temporary; as can be seen in literally every instance of it happening in the past.  They may last a year or two before receding.  Now a proper emissions tax would be a different story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The outlet also noted that \"postal management said it could fully electrify its fleet with an injection of $6.9 billion: $3 billion for the higher vehicle cost and $3.9 billion for the chargers. If such funding were provided, the IG said the lifetime cost of EVs would be 11% lower than gas vehicles. It added that USPS may be eligible for local incentives as well.\"\n\nAh yes, they're always possible...IF...they're subsidized.  Subsidies aren't free.  We taxpayers pay for them, and an additional $6.9 billion is a lot of money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n==========================================\n\nIf we are to electrify mail trucks, we should concentrate on electrifying them in regions with the most clean energy first, and the states should be responsible for the subsidies.  Why should someone in Michigan subsidize a mail truck in California; the wealthiest state in the nation, while California reaps the rewards of the lower mail truck fuel prices?",

They’ll need to communicate to your home, the grid, and know when you’ll need to use your car among other basics. Then to get the most range and performance you’ll need to know temperatures, traffic conditions and hopefully the availability of charging along the way. This all requires massive amounts of software communication to pull off seamlessly. A modern ICE is a contained ecosystem shy of infotainment. You don’t need to tell the gas station you’re coming or let them siphon gas from your tank during demand times if you’re not driving. It’s an entirely new frontier of transportation and energy management.",

I don’t have any paint issues and my seats also still look great. I’m now on my third set of tires which I think is a good average at over 40k miles each set. My battery degradation is below feet average but not bad at 10.3%. \n\nNo other repairs. Did get a few cabin filters and a 12v battery.",

"comment": "Good. It should be getting better and I'm glad it is. For most people.\n\nBut it’s not improving for everyone. In particular, the Tesla experience is getting worse (but maybe not for the reason you think). 120 miles with 75 mph speed limits between V2 Superchargers was not great in 2021 because everyone has to stop and charge up to 75%. But there are only more Teslas on the road now so we increasingly have to wait to pull a mere 75 kW. And Tesla seems to have no plans to install new chargers in between, leaving Tesla owners to deal just with it.",

Having dealt with a fair amount of trades people when building our house, there's something to be said about reputation of a large company that's not going anywhere vs local that may get eaten up in the life of the solar array.\n\nI've had trades people show up hours late, no show or reschedule repeatedly to fix their errors.  I'd like to think with Costco's dedication to their customers that they would feel a certain responsibility to stand behind their product and services.  On top of that they pay their employees wonderfully and I would expect they would do the same in this situation too!  \n\nManditory breaks, great staffing levels and pays a liveable wage with benefits all while offering low prices and great quality?  Yup, I'll shop there.",

"comment": "When I do freelance project work, I primarily target small and mid-sized commercial solar installations. \n\nIf you can't sell the client an array within an acceptable payback period, or you can't give them a solid financing option, then you're chasing windmills - regardless of the existence of the tax credit. The tax credit determines how large a system the client can accommodate in a profitable manner. \n\nSolar power is less than 1% of the USA electric grid. Rather than try to solve the problem of \"my business wants solar but leases the building\", I prefer to target the lower hanging fruit. Businesses who own their own building &gt;&gt; 1% of USA electric use, so why bother even asking that question at this point in time?",

"comment": "~~For SolarCity, isn't there a monthly payment for leasing the panels in addition to the cost per kWh? It's very important you take that into account.~~ Also, you use a LOT of electricity. How big is your house? Mine is 1200 sqft, build in 1920 and I have never used more than 600kWh in one month. My average is around 350kWhm. I can't imagine spending $400 in one month for electricity.\n\nAlso, if you were to buy a 2.6kW system at the same price as what I got my system for, it would cost about $5000 after all the tax credits. Given the data above, it seems like you pay $2800/year on electricity. At 15% offset, that's a savings of $420/year on your bill. You also get around $200/MWh generated through SRECs, so your total savings is close to $620/year, giving you an expected payoff period of 8 years.\n\nI think given your incredible electricity usage, it's best to get a [free energy audit](http://www.masssave.com/) and see how you can reduce it.\n\nEdit: There's a PPA option and a leasing option for SolarCity, I got them confused. Either way, I don't think you're getting a good deal.",

"comment": "I recently bought a home in CT with solar panels already installed. I had no choice in taking the system over because the homeowner leased the panels. Facing this during buying the house I contacted the original installer and discovered some serious hidden costs. I thought this is worth mentioning because I've never seen this mention here. One, is the cost of replacing your inverter every 7 years or so at approx $1500. I was told by the installer that they last about 7 years before they fail or become inefficient enough to replace.  Two, is the cost associated with any roof repair. Anything not covered under your homeowners insurance will cost you. My roof will reach end of life only about 10-12 years into the Solar system term. So the panels will have to be removed and replaced at an approx cost of $4000 on top of the roof expense. Third is any service/maintenance/cleaning you can't do yourself will also cost you approx $350 each time the installer makes a house call. These are all quoted prices directly from the original installer of the system. None of these costs were listed anywhere in their literature, brochures or original proposals to the homeowner.  This is just a heads up that there are potential hidden costs not associated with the general TCO discussion of solar panels. Fyi, I negotiated the price of the home down because of these costs. So not sure were everyone gets the idea that solar panels increase a homes value?",

"comment": "Some credit unions are setting up signature loans as solar loans, others are using home equity loans.  \nIt is difficult to use the solar array as collateral for a loan since it becomes part of the home when installed.  \n\nI meant no offense.  I was commenting on the fact that you used the term \"solar loan\" which is by nature an unsecured loan\nThe solar loans are not something I would get but they are not exploitative.  It is a legal means of paying points up front, like any other loan.   HELOCs often the best choice but not always available to homeowners.    HELOCs are secured and can take longer to set up.",

"comment": "I'm pretty annoyed with how you present sources. Just dumping a bunch of links into the description makes it a pain in the ass to actually look up anything. An onscreen attribution along with corresponding titles in the description would be nice.\n\nAs for your claim that 'As much as 32% of EV owners power their cars with solar', I assume you're referring to the PDF in the first link which says\n\n&gt;A 2013 survey of new EV owners in California, which represents\nmore than 40 percent of the market for EVs, found that\n32 percent of respondents had solar photovoltaic (PV) systems\nin their homes.\n\nThe 'as much as' weasel words are what got me to actually look at your sources, and they don't really say what you claim. Assuming the survey was done properly, there still isn't any info about the size of the systems, whether the EV owners charge while their systems are producing energy, whether they have battery systems to capture energy for usage later, etc.\n\nYou might say that net metering evens things out, but [this page](http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/solar_basics/net_metering.php) on ca.gov seems to claim that that's only available for 1kW systems and below, which is paltry for EV charging needs.\n\nOverall, I liked the video, but please be more careful with your claims in the future. It always pisses me off when people can find inaccuracies with a single claim in a video like this, then use it as an excuse to claim that everything else in the video is BS/a conspiracy/whatever else nincompoopery you find online. It's dumb, but that has never stopped people in the past.",

Hence the comments about *the future*. \n\n&gt; Most AC coupled systems ARE interconnected...DC bimodals are more likely not interconnected.\n\nYou're proving my point. In 5-10 years, most residential battery systems will be interconnected. I believe they will be continue to be AC-coupled, as it is a more efficient solution for grid-tied systems, when backfeeding the grid or pursuing a grid-assist design philosophy. \n\n&gt; \"Therefore, the solar array is never interconnected\" - This has nothing to do with AC vs DC coupling.\n\nWhen approaching a grid-assist design, you need fewer BOS components with AC-coupling vs. DC coupling. It's already obvious to utilities that AC-coupling is the most cost-effective solution for grid-connected arrays. However, it seems to me that utility policies (especially under Trump) are going to become alot more anti-solar, which will force customers to seek out the grid-assist design philosophy. Obviously in solar friendly territories, grid-interconnection will still be the preferred option. But it doesn't matter because AC-coupling is still the most efficient solution for grid-interconnected design.\n\nDC-coupling is only more efficient than AC-coupling when you are primarily running off of your battery bank, such as an 100% off-grid home.",

"comment": "Thanks for the great info!  Unfortunately, my freedom solar in Fort Worth has consistently quoted me $3.24-$3.30 for those same 327 panels.  I also get the $1000 rebate from my work.  They seem very stuck up and really refuse to come down on price.  On the other hand, I was able to negotiate with another company on some lg 335 panels for $2.85 per watt and a 25 year performance guarantee.  Meaning, they guarantee your minimum annual production and, if you don't produce that amount, they pay you double your deficiency.  Meaning, if you were supposed to have a 100% offset but you ended up having to pay $200 that year for electric, they will pay you back $400.  That is  guaranteed, every year for 25 years.  I haven't signed a contract yet but, that's the direction I'm leaning.  If all things were equal, I would chose sunpower....But in my case, they aren't even close to being equal.  You got a great deal on your system...im just trying to find the best deal for me.",

"comment": "I purchased and had installed a solar system that was estimated to offset my 6,325 kWh yearly usage by 125%. The system consisted of 15 panels(TSM-280DD05A.08(II)) with Enphase M250 Micro Inverters. My monitoring app gave me a warning that my system was not producing as expected. I contacted the solar company and there was response was: \"Our data shows your annual kWh usage is 6,325 kWh per year and your solar panel production estimate is 6,397 kWh. All 15 of you solar panels are producing electricity and you are producing at 98% of the estimate so far as shown in the production graph below. \" So basically they are saying that my system is working as expected and should produce ~101% of my needed power over the year. My concern is... I bought a system that should produce 125% and they installed a system that should produce only 101%. Am I missing something...? or Did I get Screwed?

While 61-64% of respondents in all regions expressed some level of support, those living in the West showed had the highest portion expressing strong support, at 35%, with those in the Northeast more tepid about the idea, with only 27% stating that they “strongly” support such a measure.\n\nSo... people who live in sunnier areas think this is a better idea than people who live in cloudier areas with brutal winters.  This is surprising how?\n\nI like solar, but would rather see the investment (and panels) go into large utility scale installations.  Rooftop solar, with net metering, isn't particularly power grid friendly, and most installs, focused on peak kWh generation, generate a lot of power when it's not needed and very little power when demand is high.",

With your number of 35kWh for average charge it can do 85 average supercharges. It's capacity is 3MWh.\n\nIt's the \"it can charge 100 Teslas\" part that sounded wrong which it kinda is imo since it's not a real measurement. If they said 100(apparently actually 85) average supercharge sessions then fair enough but I was going by it can actually fully charge 100 cars and I was wondering how did they just forward with battery storage tech so quick. Was about to say that would have been an amazing step forward for grid storage and even maybe cargo ship power considering space is one of the main reasons long range cargo ships cant use batteries.",

"comment": "Sure. I am a solar service technician out here in Hawaii. I have to jump start or rma the resu units at least once a week. We have installed hundreds of these units. Most of the time the cells don’t hold a charge after a couple hundred of cycles, even with the backup reserves set to 15% on the solaredge inverters. Proper firmware, proper install, proper inverter settings. Lately, we’ve been experiencing the batteries we have to expand so much that it pushes the top brackets holding the battery up and pops the lid. Expanding batteries are an instant rma and a huge hazard to the homeowner house and family. I guess the reason why I get downvoted is because I didn’t explain myself. IMO if you keep that battery in a cool basement like that you should be fine. Most of the installs just leave them in direct sunlight on the sides of the house. If I had to chose I would go Tesla powerwall all the way.",

"comment": "Here's a transcript:\n\n&gt; (voiceover by interviewer with imagery of natural disasters and melting ice) Over the last 10 years, sea levels have risen at an alarming rate, biodiversity is reportedly declining faster than that of any time in human history, and millions--millions-- of people have been affected by extreme weather, like hurricanes and floods. As 2019 ends, this year is likely to be one of the hottest on record, so what can we expect over the next decade? CBS News meteorologist and climate climate specialist Jeff Veradeli(?) is here to explain\n\n&gt; interviewer: How are you this morning?\n\n&gt; Jeff: I'm doing great!\n\n&gt; Interviewer: I know when we hear climate change, we do think doom and gloom, the world's coming to an end relatively quickly, but what are some of the technological advancements and innovations we should be looking at to help improve the issue of climate change? \n\n&gt; Jeff: So this is the best part--sometimes you go to the doctor and the doctor says \"I'm sorry, there's not much I can do for you.\" We *know* the answer, and the answer is the move away from fossil fuels and to start leaning on sustainable energy--and here's the best part: The more we use sustainable energy--which is this energy that's given to us by the sun and the wind; it is free--the more that the prices go down of that, the more that we have to create vast industries and vast employment and opportunities for ourselves, so the bottom line is that we can create a better life for ourselves! So we don't have to look at this as a death sentence for doom and gloom, we can look at this as a time that we can create a brand new and better future with better jobs (higher paying jobs)--just to give you an idea, for every one job in fossil fuels, to create one unit of energy, you need 2 or 3 of those jobs in solar power, and the fastest growing opportunities in the next decade are wind technitian and solar technitian. Think about that!\n\n&gt; Interviewer: Benefit the economy, benefit the environment in the same way. We've talked before on the saturday show about the arctic and the Amazon to be the two areas with the biggest change that we're seeing ahead.\n\n&gt; Jeff: So these *are tipping points*, we need to watch them closely. The Amazon is being slashed and burned very quickly, climate change is drying it out, and if we're not careful, it could turn into a savannah. So, from a rain forest, with all that life into a savannah. Right now, it's acting as a carbon sink, it's pulling tons of carbon out of the atmosphere, it is *helping* us slow down the consequences of climate change, and pretty soon it may not be able to do that. Same thing with the arctic and permafrost. Permafrost is frozen ground in the arctic tundra, that has now *this year* changed from being a net *abosrber* of carbon dioxide to being a net *emmitter*, which means that it causes climate change to spiral, and go even faster. And, we have to watch for destabilization of ice shelves in the arctic and anarctic, that's something we hope doesn't happen, but if it does, sea level creeps up even faster.",

"comment": "&gt; Enphase and other microinverters will not work as well for a AC coupled system.\n\nThis specific line is 100% factually incorrect. Here's an article refuting you: https://www.civicsolar.com/article/ac-coupling-microinverters\n\nWe install at least 1 or 2 PowerWall systems with microinverters every week. In terms of how electricity works, there is literally zero difference between using modern microinverters, string inverters, or string+optimizers with AC-coupled batteries as long as the inverter supports a technology like frequency shifting to disable the solar once the battery's approaching full charge. The entire industry is shifting away from DC-coupled to AC-coupled systems, with the exception of off-grid setups. If you're on the grid, AC-coupled is almost definitely the way to go.",

"comment": "Couple things:\n\n1. As solar installer, we would recommend an upgrade as well. Panel is old, full and dont really have the space to add breakers. \n\n2. Depending on the size of the inverter and the actual rating of the main/bus on a 125A service the max I would be able to add is 25A without derating the main. I dont believe we would be able to derate the main at 100A with current loads. \n\n3. If youre going to upgrade panels, SCE will do a site visit to review current panel before issuing your disconnect/reconnect. Here is where it gets tricky: depending on your current installation (Overhead OH, Underground UG) there can be some additional costs not included in that 2500: \n\n3a: If UG, you can be direct burial (no conduit) which would require a trench, lay conduit and SCE typically covers the wiring as part of maintenance (since the wire was likely to fail at some point). Big expense to trench 36\" and conduit. If its not direct burial, typically when you upgrade 125/150 to 200 the conduit will not be rated for the new wire size, requiring to trench/upgrade conduit. \n\n3b. You can use a 125Amain 225Abus rated panel that is solar ready. Would allow for more Amps to be backfed and likely avoid having to trench/upgrade conduit. Wouldn't give you a lot of room to expand, but would save a lot of headaches. \n\n4. 2500 is not that expensive, typically we are in the 2000-2500 range. Permits, labor, materials all have gone up in price. \n\nIf you do decide to go the higher A route, let us know what you run into. Good luck!",

"comment": "I mean it's nice that covering 1% of the earth land mass would work but it's not gonna be efficient to transport energy from e.g. Saharan solar farms to England or Germany for example. If I'm looking at the Netherlands for example we'd need 892 km² (2,1%)  of solar panels or 21000 windturbines. The only places where you could drop those are nature areas which you'd have to destroy. \n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't be more progressive in transition because we should be doing a lot more. But nuclear I feel is a good step in reducing carbon emissions and towards a greener energy production",

"comment": "Nuclear power *was* the fastest way we could have displaced fossil fuel use 15 years ago. Now renewable power is mature and much cheaper, and we are worse at building nuclear plants than we were then.\n\nYes, we don't presently have necessary battery storage - but that's because we don't really need it. The reason storage is expensive is not because it's intrinsically expensive, it's because there's just not a huge market for storage. As renewables become a significant share of power generation you will start to see storage costs come down.\n\nOf course, what moved the needle on solar and wind was mostly Chinese subsidies - if the US and Europe heavily subsidized the construction of hydrogen electrolysis, flow batteries, and lithium batteries I am confident nuclear would be proven obsolete within 5 years. It seems plausible it will happen anyway (even with the meager subsidies.)\n\nI think around 2030 if prices haven't come down we might need to give up on that route and start investing seriously in nuclear power again but right now I think we should invest in storage, it is most likely going to be the future. (I don't know which techs, it probably won't be lithium ion but who knows.)",

Green/Left worrywarts such as the Australian Academy of Science are struggling to cope with the Great Barrier Reef enjoying the largest area of coral cover ever recorded. That’s after the Academy’s doom-crying since 2012, which is as far back as I’ve bothered to track its Reef fulminations.* \r  \n\r  \n*And there’s another shock for lovers of windmills and made-in-China solar panels. According to the UAH temperature satellites that have been criss-crossing the continent for 40 years, Australia shows no warming for precisely the past decade. Suppose you’re teaching ten-year-olds, and you don’t care about your career in the education system. You could announce, “Hey, kids, there’s not been a jot of warming here since Mummy brought you home from the maternity wing.”*\r  \n\r  \n*Our local alarmists’ shtick has been that our continental “heating emergency” has spurred bushfires, floods, droughts and cyclones. The CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and Tim Flannery’s Climate Council might as well put out a joint press release: “Sorry, damn, we got that all wrong.”*",

The return is inflation adjusted because YOU don't pay higher future rates.\n3. When you sell your house, you recover the initial investment (actually, probably a bit  more). This is like the maturity date of a bond.\n\nThere are some caveats: If you have 100% net metering, that may, unfortunately, change. The solar install cost recovery will fluctuate with the real estate market, but should still be value added.\n\nI'm making about 7% on my solar investment now, and it sure beats stocks this year!",

"comment": "If you can look into solar do it.  You are literally giving away money to PG&E that could help to pay for solar panels.  I wouldn't say doing that is for everyone with NEM 3.0 but because you are charging  your vehicle it makes sense.  To cut down on the cost of solar installs you can buy your solar panels and inverter(s) up front instead of through a solar installer and this can save you big money. \n\nYou can buy an [REC 365W solar panel for $250.65](https://a1solarstore.com/r/3938899f1ba425a8a81471bd1aaa8edc) and for microinverters, these [Enphase Ensemble IQ8 Plus are $191.58](https://a1solarstore.com/r/310c7f65a6ac11784d6b09c74b57b1e7).  With NEM 3.0 it is a good plan to look at batteries to sell excess power back to PG&E so these [batteries](https://a1solarstore.com/r/f277401010a2c813b67f95fd45f97c14) might be worth looking at.  With an EV or PHEV you will use up a lot of the power the panels make so batteries aren't necessary. Using the power created from the panels is the best way to use excess power as the rates from PG&E aren't good. All the above parts don't take the 30% solar tax credit into account either.  \n\nIf this interests you and you want to start putting a system together, below are a few resources.\n\n[PVWatts calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php)\n\n[Google's Project Sunroof](https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/)\n\n[Homeowner’s Guide to the Solar Tax Credit](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics)",

"comment": "And solar power generation, mass scale battery production and charging infrastructure have some pretty good synergies.\n\nRunning some ballpark numbers, 2024 solar LCOE is estimated at 100 €/MWh. A charger with 0.5 MWh/d utilization and 100 k€ installation cost amortizes to 50€/MWh. If you can get LFP batteries at 100 €/kWh and short cycle them for 5k cycles, that ends up at 10 €/MWh cost. Add in operating costs and taxes, lets say the end result is 250 €/MWh = 0.25 €/kWh of costs. That allows for some pretty healthy margins already today. And the costs are only coming down.\n\nVehicle lifecycle energy usage is 50-100 MWh. A majority of that is going to be home charging, but the total margin on energy sales per vehicle not totally dissimilar to vehicle sales margins.",

I am ok with that. \n\nWe were allowed to over build here because we had existing panels from 20 years ago that work at ~70% (4kw system) so our new system didn’t need to take that into account so we just went and added 11kw. To be honest I probably  didn’t so much but we I figured I probably can’t ever add more so much as well. \n\nIt’s nice not worrying about it. \n\nFor the longest time we didn’t even have that $70 but our EQE is getting a lot more use than our EQB did so that may be why, or also that they raised rates.

The tech is just moving too fast now to care about how the car is gonna work 10 years down the road from today. If Tesla goes defunct because its glorious owner continues to drive customers and employees away, then they won’t get the updates to stay relevant. \n\nUltimately, a $2k used Prius with a dead battery usable charge state is equivalent to the biggest home battery setups. So there are avenues for reuse of the batteries, but we are not doing it, and it’s nothing I can change from my position. \n\nSo, EVs are lease cellphones for me right now.",

"comment": "How do you think you will get democratic consent, in what passes for democratic system, without widespread pressure from people?\n\nThe governments of developed nations are mostly captured by corporate power. That includes big ag - an especially powerful lobby for its size because unfortunately people have staggeringly misguided attitudes towards the agricultural industry.\n\nWe don't have to convince everyone in any case. [Research](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aas8827) on social change demonstrates that you need about 25% of the population to change their behaviour and the bulk of the rest of society will then follow suit. Remember, while there are of course conservatives and reactionaries out there, most people are constantly trying to keep up with a changing society. Humans are constantly tracking the changes going on around them so they stay in concert with the people in their communities. So if there is a strong current of people changing diet for all the various reasons that they do, then most other people will see that as they way things are now and adapt accordingly. \n\nThink of social changes like attitudes to gays. One day gay marriage was illegal and lots of people were fine with that. The next day, it was legal and that was celebrated by a decent chunk of the population. Then many of those people originally skeptical quite quickly found themselves not actually bothered any more and actually in favour of the change.\n\nIt's not a perfect analogy but it makes my point. People will change their attitudes remarkably quickly when they see a process of shifting attitudes around them.\n\nSo that's the point on why it matters at a personal level. We have to lead that change, by our professed attitudes and our example. It does matter and it can make a difference, both at a small scale and at a large scale.\n\nIf you are waiting for the government to tell you what to eat, you'll be waiting an eternity. The government can't even tell people not to use horribly dangerous and polluting vehicles. It can't tell the oil and gas industry that its days exploring for new oil and gas are over. It can't tell people not to install gas boilers. It can't tell builders to build efficient homes with solar panels. You think any plausible government is going to tell people they can't eat beef? It will NEVER happen. But that's OK - it doesn't need to. We can choose not to. Right now.",

"comment": "&gt; From where does the moral evaluation derive if not suffering (which is a result of sentience)?\n\nIt indeed derives from sentience and suffering. That doesn't mean that the resulting moral imperative is to diminish suffering. For example, I don't think killing an animal in a way that causes no suffering would be justifiable.\n\n&gt;If you didn't believe it mattered whether or not you exploited animals on an individual level, why bother acting on your belief?\n\nI read that as equivalent to \"If you don't believe something, why act on that belief?\". Did I get that wrong? Why should one feel compelled to act on a belief they don't hold?\n\n&gt; You're an abolitionist of one, because it's the right thing to do.\n\nI think it is right yes. There's a major difference in stopping (as far as is possible and practical) one's contribution to an undesirable situation and diminishing one's contribution.\n\n&gt; This makes my point.\n\nWhat point was that? The one about \"either you allow that individually reducing suffering through your veganism is ethical and valid, or you are living a lie\"? I have already pointed out that I don't see it as a matter of reducing suffering.",

"comment": "If you have the time for it in your school schedule (and your school offers it) I'd highly recommend taking a nutrition class. The health benefits of a vegan diet are massive, from lowering your risk of several chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes to reducing the amount of preservatives, chemicals, and other icky things that you put in your body. \n\nA vegan diet really isn't that hard to do \"correctly.\" The only thing in flesh that isn't in plants is vitamin B12, and all fortified foods (think rice, flour, bread, etc.) have b12. If you're really worried about it you and take supplements, but I have found that it isn't necessary (as have all my veggie friends). Protein isn't the issue that most people think it is. You need 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh per day (roughly, of course), so 0.8 gram for every 2.2 lbs. Divide your weight by 2.2 and multiply by 0.8. It isn't hard to get that much in a day, you'll find that you easily get more than that. No vegans I know even bother to count their protein in a day, generally if you're getting enough calories you're getting enough protein. \n\nRemember that our bodies are better equipped for a vegan diet. Eating vegan is healthy, not dangerous. Just be smart about it. Potato chips and candy aren't going to be healthy for you to live off of, obviously. Be adventurous with your veggies, learn to love quinoa (and what's not to love?!?!), breathe deep, and relax. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you need any advice or anything. I don't have a book to recommend you, sadly, but I doubt you really need one. Good luck!",

Insects are killed by very large numbers as a routine in farming, yet some vegans keep going on and on about how unethical honey is. I believe that honey production kills way less insects than the production of plant-based sugars. \nOn that you could argue that some bees are fed plant-based sugars as substitutes for honey, I don't know how common this is, but I know that in Germany, organic honey has to be produced without feeding the bees substitute sugars, so it is very much possible.",

Eating or wearing that animal, whether or not it would have been \"thrown away\", only adds to the disrespect. Vegans should not participate in that. \n\nWhen I became a vegan, I did get rid of all my leather and wool clothing. Why would I want to wear the product of animal exploitation? The idea that the animal \"sacrificed\" its skin for me doesn't make sense. The skin was ripped away in the process of killing that animal.\n\nIn any case, I agree that there is no such thing as a \"free vegan\". People can call their lifestyles whatever they wish, but as soon as you eat animal products you are disqualified as a vegan by definition.",

I care about both, and I'm sure most other vegans do, too.\n\nI am a member of a local CSA (community-supported agriculture), which provides me with a share of the fruits and vegetables grown by a local farm each week. [Look around a bit](http://www.localharvest.org/), if you are concerned about this issue. You might not *have* to shop at those places.\n\nAdditionally, the humans who work in slaughterhouses and meat packing facilities [suffer injuries, abuse, and exploitation](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2001/07/dangerous-meatpacking-jobs-eric-schlosser). So, by not eating meat, you don't support the companies that are committing abuses against both humans and animals.",

I get upset when I hear people bash vegans for being uppity and condescending when people ask about their diet. This is where I think our movement falls short. I talk to everyone I meet as if they were my friend, regardless of diet, ethics, etc. because that is the way I believe fellow humans should be treated. So many people, like yourself, have legitimate questions, and I wish more vegans were willing to spread their own knowledge.

"comment": "I tend to cook more Asian flavored foods when eating vegan. We always have sauces at home (shoyu, hoisin, plum, etc). So, I can have brown rice, veggies, and one of the sauces. Of course, read the labels since they can sneak anything in. I really like the cookbook The Kind Diet, but I'm a foodie and had no problem finding or even knowing what the ingredients are, which some defined as obscure. Tonight's meal: Spanish rice, white beans, avocado, lime. Allrecipes.com has many great rice recipes. Most are easy to adapt to vegan (eg, use veggie broth vs chicken).",

If vegan options aren't provided for a kid (and I wouldn't expect any parent to start cooking vegan food for their child), getting a job and doing one's own grocery shopping is an option.\n\nReally, moving out doesn't solve anything- getting a job does. You can't move out without a source of income in the first place. Until the kid can provide for itself (ex. if it's underage and can't get a job off the books, or it just can't get hired), it's the parents' responsibility to take care of it.",

She posted it to proudly share her method of activism and to ask about others' forms of activism. \n\nBut let's say this post wasn't about vegan activism. Let's say it was just a post with an image of her body, no caption. Would it have been okay to tell her that she lives up to your personal sexual preferences then?\n\nIt is one thing to look at a bodybuilder in the context of bodybuilding. It is one thing to make encouraging comments about a bodybuilder's technique or dedication or hard work. It's fine to offer suggestions and advice *when it is requested*. It's fine to offer *objective* critiques *when requested*. \n\nIt is another thing entirely to make comments about your opinion and preferences regarding the \"femininity\" of a bodybuilder. When you say things like that, you're no longer talking about her as a person or a bodybuilder, you're objectifying her as a woman subject to your sexual preferences (which don't matter to her or anyone else). \n\nIn this case, you may think you were giving her a compliment, but most of us just see you ignoring the point of the post, zoning in on the fact that she is a sex object that lives up to your standards, and disparaging women who choose to look muscular. It's just rude, not to mention sexist. Women are free to become as muscular as they like, and in this world, we need fewer of men's never-ending, contradictory, no-win opinions about our bodies.",

People are hungry now, because richer countries are consuming so much meat and we use so much area to grow crops that we feed to chickens and pigs instead of people. You need several times the plant calorie to produce a meat calorie. \n\nPoor people eat plants. Eating meat is a luxury. A luxury that is getting subsidized so it's a lot more accessible and ruining the environment at the same time.",

I had some cheese when I accidentally bought the vegetarian version of some Amy’s pizza rolls and it literally tasted like nothing, and the grease was disgusting. I’m a huge fan of the field roast chao cheese slices. Also, Just Egg, or scrambled tofu are fantastic egg substitutes. Eventually you’re going to have to choose if a fleeting pleasure for your taste buds is worth all the lives it kills, especially when you the textures and flavors can be imitated so well without killing.",

She has always declined and thinks it’s super gross/weird that people consume animal products but I think it’s even more special that she’s chosen veganism for herself at such a young age. Kids are smart and allowing them the agency to make choices based on their own beliefs at a young age is a beautiful thing. Just my two cents though.",

Like, what if some rando came to your house and said “my kid has diabetes. Only sugar-free candy please.” Sorry, I only have this... take it or leave it.\n\nIf I were you, I would let the kids get as much candy as they could and have a great night! Go through it and pick out the no-no candy and keep the vegan ones and have candy for them too just in case there were no vegan trick or treats. Ceremoniously burn or bury the bad candy. Something to make it more of a learning experience instead of a night of disappointment.\n\nJust my opinion.",

It should clear up soon, the two or three week mark is usually when you adjust but I'd get to the one month mark and then reevaluate how you feel.\n\nTiredness may be because you need to round out your diet a little more with protein and fats. Eating pre-made vegan options or at vegan restaurants if possible could help with this as you adjust to what you can and can't eat.",

Finding info in English? That’s where it seems to get difficult, but I’ll get back to finding out a good general source for this. PubMed gives out a good amount of results regarding iodine deficiency itself.\n\nMy educated guess would be that it depends a lot on the amount of iodine in table salt, if iodized salt is used in food production, and how much of the diet is made up of products with salt already added. If salt used in food manufacturing is also iodized or a person barely consumes anything with it added, I’m guessing that adding in salt with a high enough level of iodine would be sufficient. \n\nI’ve personally just stuck to figuring out what my intake of iodine generally is. I’m on the low side, especially since my intake of any seaweeds is low.",

I have a good friend (3 years more experienced) at work and she asked to be taken off from mining companies clients and military clients due to moral reasons and it’s all small jobs no one wants get dumped on her. Her work never get appreciated, the bosses always impressed by people who work with significant clients (aka mining). The end result is she is not promoted as she should have been as she’s not revenue generating. Have been put through performance plan as well as excluded from colleagues. I almost got excluded for being close to her. It’s just I can afford to be more different than the others - I need this job :(",

"comment": "There is this italian restaurant that I have gone to twice (I had forgotten its name) which has a lot of vegan options online, but only 2 on the real menu. Inexplicably, both times I have been there the server has said that they don’t know what vegan means and gotten their manager, who has told me that numerous dishes can be made vegan and put through an order which then comes out with visible cheese. It’s bizarre. I had no difficulty ordering vegan food in Italy despite not speaking Italian but this place is obsessed with cheese and has the dumbest servers I’ve encountered (it’s not a language barrier issue, they’re native English speakers)",

It's our responsibility not to be misleading.  \n\nI think that in order to appeal to a larger group of people that it's good to cover all of the different bases.  And even if people don't end up being fully vegan, or vegan for the right reasons, it's still better than nothing.  And maybe people who are attracted by health benefits or disease prevention could start for those reasons, but stay for ethical reasons as they become more informed and realize that a vegan diet isn't hard to stick to.  \n\nIt's a softer approach for sure.  Some people just completely block you out when you start talking about cruelty and slavery, but they'll listen to stuff about health.  It gets your foot in the door, at least.  A lot of people won't listen to somebody they consider a militant vegan.  \n\nBut yeah, I definitely get what you're saying.  I guess the words hate and real threw me off.  At the end of the day it's for the animals.  But it isn't one dimensional.  I'm a vegan for lots of reasons, and saving animals is the most important one, but not the only one.",

There's even a part of the eightfold path that basically says Buddhists cannot be butchers. This is why many Buddhists eat vegetarian, or vegan, depending on their own knowledge or ability to find the proper food. \n\nThe food served at most Buddhist gatherings is vegetarian. In some temples they eat meat, however, and very similar to omnivores who aren't Buddhist the monks kind of close their eyes and ears to the \"supply and demand\" harm they cause and say they didn't ask for the animals to be butchered for themselves specifically.",

As far as that's concerned though, I feel no need to apologize because I said \"honey isn't vegan and neither is powdered sugar :)\" and she went full on crazy. I mean it looked delicious until I saw that. It wasn't intended to be rude at all but yet I got called an idiot?? I understand that different vegans have stricter rules than others, but to completely deny that honey isn't vegan? I don't eat honey, but I do eat sugar. Sadly, none of those are vegan unless it's bone char free sugar. Oh well, but I don't think someone who goes full on crazy like that should be in a supportive subreddit about being vegan. :p",
