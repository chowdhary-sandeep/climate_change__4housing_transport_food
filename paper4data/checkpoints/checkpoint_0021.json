"comment": "What a worthless article.  They completely ignored two major factors:\n\n1. Electric cars are dropping in price each year.  Which isn't surprising at all for a new technology.  As we go forward this early adopter premium will start to disappear. [Leaf example](http://www.autoblog.com/2013/01/14/nissan-leaf-becomes-least-expensive-5-seat-ev-with-massive-price/)\n[Volt example](http://www.autonews.com/article/20130812/RETAIL/308129955/decoding-the-volts-price-cut) \n\n2. They mention the plug in grant but then discount it out of hand.  Using the [UK Price](http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/30/nissan-leaf-uk-price/) of £23,490 this grant equals 21% of the cost. This amount would be immediately discounted even if a brand new car was transferred.  If you add back this grant you end up with a depreciation rate of 41.5%.  Still lower than petrol but much much closer to the truth.\n\n3. The price savings on fueling your car via electricity vs gas over the three year period is about $1390/year or $4180 for 3 years.  Adding this back into the price ((20.2%*23490) + 5000 + 4180)/23490 gives a more accurate picture of \"depreciation\". Adding back your savings you will get 59% of the value back from your car upon selling.  Better than every other car type on the list.

"comment": "The big prize will go to whoever develops a car with a 400-mile all weather range. Not Tesla's fake 300-mile range that's really 175 miles in the winter, but a genuine 400-mile range while using heating or A/C, the use of which will not hurt the battery. And which is rechargeable in less than a couple hours, and which is cheap., i.e., a couple thousand bucks or less for the battery.\n\nIf and when that happens, EVs will become mainstream virtually overnight. Until then, it's a niche game. I strongly believe we'll reach and then far exceed the goal, but the questions are how long it will take and whether the invention will be incremental or sudden and from a different direction, i.e., a different battery type or chemistry.",

It's an outrageous investment of time per mile driven: at least one-sixth of your journey is consumed by recharging if you're foolish enough to take a long roadtrip in a Tesla sedan.\n\nMy ICE truck has a highway range of 500 miles. Do the arithmetic. I realize that you're nothing but an EVangelist who deeply desires to drink the Kool-Aid at every turn. So be it. But only a complete fool would take a real road trip in a Tesla.",

If you purchase an EVSE (electric vehicle supply equipment) you can plug the EVSE right into the 240 V and the other end plugs right into the car, the EVSE should take care of the CP signal. The EVSE is basically the middle man between the car and the outlet.\n\nCP means control pilot. Its a handshake tool between the car and the EVSE to make sure everything is ok before power starts to flow from the grid to the car.\n\nthese are some examples of EVSEs (http://www.pluginnow.com/charging_stations)",

"comment": "I have. I re-insulated my roof last spring along with some minor renovations. Because of the poor quality of our general contractor, we didn't know that some of our renovations require completely new engineering along with city permits.  It was fine as it was built in '58, but not allowed today, and if you renovate it, it has to match today's code.  $15K and one month and no city permits turned into $80K and 8 months and 21 city permits.  Lead paint, asbestos, inadequately sized gas and water pipes....etc.\n\nWhen we asked about insulating our walls, the back of our house is entirely glass.  That size of glass is no longer allowed under code, if it breaks, we will have to redo our entire back of our house....\n\n\nThe other reason I want more PV is that I plan to replace one of our cars with a Tesla model S. My wife and I are engineers. We have no doubt we can do it, but we'll have to have at least 2 batteries to charge during daylight as PV-&gt;battery storage-&gt;battery storage isn't going to really cut it.  The biggest problem is that my body failed me 2 years ago and I don't have long to go..... so a lot may be wishful thinking.  I just hate corporations that  can't or are unwilling to change their business model, start extorting money instead of competing to provide a better or newer product.",

"comment": "Depending on the state and your sun exposure, a 7-12 year loan is usually cheaper than paying your local utility. I work for an install company that offers primarily ownership (my personal favorite) and the standard 20 year PPA. With the ownership you get equity in your home, I only hook PPA's up with people that can't benefit from the Federal tax credit (it translates into a 30% discount off the system).\n\n\n\nAssuming the ownership option...\n\n1. There's no clear cut answer for total cost, there's so many factors that come into play. Most solar companies offer $0 down. I only accept deposits when it's a cash deal or if the homeowner insists. Total cost ranges between $15,000-$50,000 over our 12 year loan. But to put that in perspective, you're replacing a bill that you're already paying.\n\n2. The panels are usually warrantied for 25 years, but you'll eventually have to replace the inverter (we offer a ten year warranty on an inverter that has a projected lifespan of 15 years). The inverter converts Direct Current to Alternating Current.\n\n3. Again, you're just replacing your electricity bill. The example I like to use is it's like you're replacing a rental with a mortgaged home. The mortgage will eventually go away and you'll have all that equity. Look up some local solar companies and get some quotes designed around your specific home. People always want these cookie cutter answers, but they don't exist.\n\n\n\nAnd of course manufacturing isn't 100% clean, but it's absolutely nothing compared to how electricity is produced by local utilities. Once they're up and providing power there aren't any emissions.\n\n\n\nEdited for formatting",

There is absolutely no reason I would ever pay to charge at one of those again willingly if I am near home. Or traveling on a supercharger route. The only time would be when I'm traveling and staying in a city with one. That's why I got the ChaDeMO adapter. But even then, I wouldn't be able to count on it as there's only a single charger that may or may not be occupied or out of service. Better than nothing I guess; gotta start somewhere. I will say that the cost would totally be acceptable if I was traveling and in need of a fast charge.",

"comment": "Yep, we have chargenet chargers here which are the same. 15c/kWh and 15c/min so once you stop charging the bill continues to pile up. Fortunately, they text you when charging completes. We've had a lot of EV growth in the last year or so (I've had my LEAF for three years now) and we've gone from having lots of friendly EV owners who wave at each other and respect charging to getting a bunch of people switching from petrol cars and behaving like they're owed something for doing so. Especially bad that people don't check into plugshare much if at all these days which makes it tricky to see when chargers are even available. Charging stations need to be more connected and automatically upload their status ideally. This is at least the case with the majority of fast chargers but even the level 2 chargers should do this too eventually. That, or every parking spot should have a charger. Then again as we move to bigger and bigger batteries the need for chargers in carparks should decline. Infrastructure isn't particularly a problem, but behaviour does need to be better to make best uses of the available charging and people blocking spaces while not charging is a big no no.",

He knew they'd destroy his company before it got off the ground because if it wasn't just these shenanigans, it would be them charging insane markups that no one would want to pay. Bad enough there's already gatekeeping with Tesla owners (they want the prices to stay high as possible to keep a high resale/trade-in value, which isnt unlike what dealers would have done)\n\nYou guys will be the ones still in business in 10 years. A lot of sales people and companies have forgotten that you can't force a customer into buying what you want them to buy. If they come in with a solid idea of what they want, you assist them and make it easy for them. They will refer their friends your way. Dealers and stores where the high pressure sales are applied, people are more likely to leave or return with the vehicle before the 30 day mark.\n\nAll the dealers that went under around me, all the motorcycle stores around me that pushed people out the door if they didnt buy what the salesman told them to buy, all are out of business after the 2008 crash. Those who focused on taking care of customers survived, not a coincidence either.",

"comment": "No my truck is not necessary for my job and I could do without it, however, I do use my bed quite often for things like hauling lumber for wood working on a regular basis which would be difficult to impossible with most current EVs.\n\nIt also provides the most comfortable cabin for a family of 4 with two child seats, and still allows for a third adult to sit comfortably in the back seat with ample leg room, something that not even many full sized SUVs can accomplish.\n\nTrucks have a lot more general utility than their payload capability, in fact with the EcoBoost V6 and not a V8 I obviously wasn’t even worried about the towing or hauling capacity, hell its not even a 4x4 because that’s not something I needed.  But it’s the vehicle i have that accommodates my family, lifestyle, and hobbies very well as well as being very nicely equipped. I don’t have the income to buy something more fuel efficient just to drive for work and I would lose a lot of functionality (that I actually do use) and comfort by making a switch to a current EV. \n\nI upgraded from a Honda Accord and I can tell you that, mpg aside, a trip from Houston to Dallas is a lot more comfortable and in the truck than it ever was in the Accord. People that argue that trucks are unnecessary unless you are hauling large heavily loads constantly are as bad as those who complain that EVs are “not there yet” because they require slightly more planning for your vacation.  Most people have the car they feel fits their entire lifestyle needs, not one that is best for this piece of their life or that piece of their life and is untenable for the rest of it.\n\nI am going to go out on a limb and say that if/when Tesla delivers on their pickup the people who buy them will have general usage much more in line with my usage and the guys who are consistently hauling and towing large payloads will stick with the proven commodities they know, regardless of how much the Tesla can tow.",

It slows to a stop when it approaches the light (no matter if red or green). It then asks the driver to push an icon when the light turns green. For now it's a completely GPS based system.\n Read [here](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/308757-tesla-tech-leak-this-autopilot-car-stops-for-red-lights).\n\n\n\nTesla collects training data this way. They need lots of images from traffic lights that show red/green. By using a GPS only approach they know a traffic light must be visible in the images sent back. With the \"it's green now\" button push, they know which images show a green traffic light. You now have training data for traffic lights detection in general and green/red traffic light training data too. They'll have to collect data for a while before they can train an image recognition net and roll out a first vision based beta test that would include all traffic lights, assuming a 100% detection rate (which is highly unlikely).\n\n\nIMHO, while it technical works, it's quite stupid to auto-stop on green lights. That's just asking to get rear-ended, flipped off or causing road rage. They should first do a passive approach. They know the GPS location of the traffic lights. If the driver stops, the light is most likely red. If he drives through or resumes driving the light is green or turned green. They could collect the same data without forced auto-stopping.",

"comment": "Where there's a will there's a way.  They ride bikes year round in one city in Finland and even in places like the Netherlands and Denmark.  It's possible with the right infrastructure, winter gear, and bike setup.  Infrastructure meaning they prioritize cleaning snow from bike paths before car paths, and they clean it in such a way as to avoid bikes losing traction.\n\nThat said, why bother?  We can bike/e-bike all spring, summer, and fall with proper bike infrastructure, then during the winter, drive a car, add more work from home days, and combine it with a 4 day work week.  Voila, a drastic reduction in emissions over the course of the entire year.  \n\nInstead we insist, \"Winters are bad here, so I have to drive a car year round\"...  :/\n\nSweaty?  We live in an e-bike age.  Leave work clothes at work, and wear bike clothes on hot days, and change at work.  Petition for a locker/changing room... maybe even a gym and showers while you're at it. ;)\n\nSoggy during the winter?  Snow pants / pant covers / boots? ;) The biggest deterrent for me is lacking bike infrastructure.  Where I live it's all suburbs and the routes are basically all 45 mph roads without any bike lanes.   The only option is sidewalks, which can be dangerous due to driveways, and with the speeds that e-bikes can reach.  We really need government policy to support safe green forms of transit like more public transit and protected bike lanes.\n\nHell, instead of all this EV funding, the government could spend $250 billion and buy every working age adult in the country a $1000 e-bike if they really wanted to, instantly and massively cutting emissions.  They could push a policy of a 7.5 hour work day for those that ride their bike to work to give them more time.  Live closer to work?  Good for you, you can ride quickly and get 1/2 hour off.\n\nWe can solve loads of problems, but not if we're unwilling to even try and solve the problems.",

The brakes are mushy, the steering is mushy, the suspension is simultaneously soft and crashy) but what it does provide is an insane amount of configurability around how power is delivered.

So they do. At one time people would gladly pay more for better service but now that things are kicking off some demographics are changing. Now more people want less expensive. Less expensive than gas station prices for gasoline.\n\nKeep in mind, charging prices can go back up too. Just like gas prices can.

Commercial chargers must be registered with the department of revenue.\n* Cities cannot force property developers to install EV chargers as a condition of permits or plan approvals. [AA1](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/related/amendments/sb791/aa1_sb791)\n\nBoneheaded shit like this means no public chargers at parks, schools, libraries or rest stops. EVs in the state already pay extra registration fees to offset lost gas tax revenue but I guess that isn't enough for the \"anti-tax\" party.",

"comment": "If multiple environmental drivers (urban air pollution, climate emergency, spilled oil pollution, etc.) of the transition to EVs didn't exist, there is an interesting question of how much longer it would have to take to transition.  Going back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, I used to tell people that in many ways EVs are simply better vehicles.  In some ways, arguably (depending on one's taste) they are not.    \n\n\nI think we're still going to have to have policy drivers because of the climate emergency, and that's still going to provoke folks into anger about the EV technology being forced down their throats, as they are unwilling to admit that the policies mandating the transition are necessitated by a life-and-death emergency.    \n\n\nBut yes, talking up the fact that EVs are simply better in some ways is a useful thing to do, and can change some of the tone of conversation, in some cases.  I have come to see combustion vehicles as being in some important ways Rube Goldberg devices, with the various disadvantages.  It might be useful to compare notes as to what we compare the transition to:  \n\n\nmanual typewriter to electric typewriter?  to word processor and personal computer? other?  \n\n\nlandline to cell phone?  to smart phone?  \n\n\nblack and white TV to color?  \n\n\nfilm photography to digital?\n\nI'm dating myself, and I don't think these are great comparisons, but I'm trying to open the floor to others to ask what comparisons work for them when they are in conversation with someone and trying to help them understand ways in which one's EV is better.  A key point is no longer having to pay the man for gasoline, and maybe there are good comparisons for that sort of transition.  \n\n\nIt doesn't mean EVs are better in all ways, and we do ourselves a disservice if we do pretend we are there, but I do think they seem to be better in most ways I can think of.",

The most efficient solar thermal system won't produce more heat than you need in the summer, and will only heat up your tub on sunny, winter days. That last bit may be inconvenient, or it may not be. Depends on your lifestyle. \n\nIf you're going to get a hot tub, and you're going to be heating it as much as you can, then that's going to take energy. If u/mrCloggy is basing his \"gets too much energy during the summer\" comment on the typical home water heating usage without a hot tub, then he would be wrong if that same home added a hot tub. Again, the cost-effectiveness of the system depends on your lifestyle. \n\nIf you are a good candidate for solar thermal, and hot tub owners typically are, it can be 3x the space-efficiency of PV. But like a hot tub, a solar thermal system requires some maintenance. And it requires a design know-how that most PV guys lack. You might want to hop over to /r/plumbing and ask them about it.\n\nMost of us on here are PV guys. It's easy, has enough $ to interest us, and very worry-free. But solar PV and solar thermal is like comparing a car vs. a truck. They can bost be used as transportation vehicles, but there are specific instances where one can outperform the other.",

"comment": "Wouldn't that be great? To keep your house at 55 without any cost or guilt? Well, if you covered the earth's crust with solar power, you could be 10,000x our current energy consumption, even with a 50% inefficient storage medium. And silicon dioxide is the most abundant mineral in the earth's crust.  So when you think about it, if we begin putting solar power on most all of our eligible roof surfaces, we wouldn't need to many acres of land outside of town before we start hitting our energy needs. \n\nSolar captures and converts 10x as much energy over its lifetime as went into its production. So while solar is less than .1% of our energy supply today... over time, the dividends on that energy payback will begin to accumulate. To scale up to 100%... well we might not see it in our lifetime, but it's not an improbable reality as a 100-200 year vision. \n\nYes, unlimited, free electricity will make us use more electricity, but will our energy use exceed 10,000x what it is today? I doubt it. Furthermore, what will that future look like? Solving our energy problems will solve our fresh water problems (via desalinization) and also our food shortage issues. It might even make currency meaningless. A true \"Star Trek\" society could actually emerge.\n\nIf we produce that much more energy, we'll probably have everthing we need to tap into an even greater energy source - outerspace solar power generation, microwaved back to earth. Or perhaps we just use it to colonize space. \n\nKeep in mind this is renewable, emmission free electricity. We're not killing off the planet to extract the power necessary to accomplish these things. Instead, we're using the power emitted from the sun\n\nSocieties 1000's of years from now might refer to this as the early beginnings of the \"Silicon Age\" like we refer to the Iron Age or Bronze Age or Stone Age. But they might be giving solar power (a silicon technology) equal credit to computer chip in that moniker.\n\nI know it's a bit of a daydream, but I don't see a limiting factor in this.",

I could also point to Germany, who despite scaling back nuclear increased their renewable generation from 6% to near 30% in just 15 years, without being at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n&gt; BASELOAD\n\nI already said that's not an issue at the currently lowish rates of penetration.

For example, where I live:\n\n1) The average wind speed is too low\n\n2)  Maximum build height is 36 feet\n\n3)  For wind turbines to work, they have to be taller than every other building/tree/etc around them, because of turbulence.\n\nIf you don't install a solar array in 2016 and wait until 2017, it could be 30% more expensive because of the expiration of the ITC tax credit.\n\nSo...",

Most jobs where I install 5kW of 20% SunPower can only support 4kW of 15-16% something else. In the case of SunPower - over the life of the system - they will generate more energy due to a lower panel degradation rate (0.4% vs 0.7%).\n\nAnd I don't think it is 'slightly' smaller - it is 20% smaller.",

There net metering laws do differ quite a bit but are being written with the backdrop expectation that renewable energy goals will actually be honored and utilities can't get everything they want as a result.\n\nWhile your thinking about the topic at all is laudable it is very black and white.  Interconnection should cost you something because any possible thing could happen in the future and the security grid connection provides saves lives.  So philosophically it's the equivalent of being a libertarian.  You want the hospitals and the street lights to stay on during emergencies then we need grid integrity so we have to pay.  Interconnection may be something you want to break free from but really you'll only break free in one aspect of your life and you'll still rely on but barely notice how it makes your life better every day.  I hope one day it's s solar/wind/geo/osmotic(!) interconnection and it won't be so gross to feel on grid.",

"comment": "A lot of money. It would be extremely easy to spend $10,000 on this. \n\nAssuming the rig is running 24/7, say 750W @ 120V, that's 18 kWh(kiloWatt-hour) of power that going to need to get to the computer. The path of that will be:\n\n Sun -&gt; Solar Panels -&gt; Charge Controller -&gt; Battery -&gt; Inverter -&gt; Computer. \n\nTaking the 18kWh, Starting at the sun with call it 6 hours of usable sunlight, you will need 3kW (18kwh/6hours) or 3000 Watts of solar panels. That's going to be ten 300W panels, each are about ~20 square feet so you're going to need at miminum 200sqft of space if they're completely flat, more than that if they are tilted to prevent shading. From a retail seller, that will be about $3000 plus shipping. Onto the charge controller, that will take the output from the panels and charge the batteries. A suitable charge controller should be around $500-$1,000. \n\nAssuming that you're never going to need \"backup\" power for multiple days since the sun will always be shining. You'll only need to size the battery for 1 day of power. Rule of thumb is batteries should be sized to never drain below 50% capacity, so (750w*24hr)/(120 volts)/(50%) gives us 300AH (amp-hours) of batteries needed. Two 12V 150AH lead-acid batteries with wiring will be about another $1,000. \n\nFor the inverter you're going to need something with a 12V input that can output at least 1000W. That should run you in the range of $1000-$1,500. \n\nAfter that its stuff like combiner boxes, fusing, breakers, wiring, enclosures, and lightning protection.",

"comment": "Oh, and to answer a couple more questions you had: yes, you could get a Tesla powerwall and supposedly solarcity customers get preferential access. Otherwise, power at night is handled by \"the grid\", and offset via net metering (though net metering is coming increasingly under attack as solar gets more popular). \n\nYou're expected to remove snow - it doesn't seem to stick to the panels as much as it does to your roof, so that's nice.  I don't remember about cleaning - apparently that's not a big deal in most situations depending on roof pitch. Rain will do most of the work.\n\nWe're locked into a rate that was half our normal grid rate, increasing by 3% a year to the max of our 20 year ppa, at that point we can terminate or buy the system.  So, we pay that rate for the solar generated off the panels that we use and make up the rest of it from the grid.\n\nWe're saving money but not a ton, but electricity was never that huge a cost for us compared to heating oil.",

When I was referring to solar resource, I suppose I worded it poorly, because I was simply referring to average annual sunlight, how \"sunny\" or \"shady\" the states were. A common argument I've heard is \"solar panels aren't worth it unless you live in the desert!\"\n\nThat is called insolation.   It is deffinitly worth it in NY, heck it is worth it in MA.  The cost of energy and incentives makes it very worth it in north east states.  There is an SREC market as well which is on top of the value of the energy itself.\n\nThe google solar map is doing local shadows so if a house is shadowed by trees or other buildings then the insolation is going to go down locally for that house.  (it is project sunroof from google).",

"comment": "First off, clever username.\n\nSecondly, if you're really looking to make a great argument to the builder I would contact Sunpower and ask them to put a quote together for your existing house without telling them about your new one.  Bring that over to the builder and they may do something for you.  It'll be about 30% cheaper on an existing home.  Solar on new construction should be cheaper than the quote you get on your house because you're not retro-fitting the roof with flashing (anchor points) and running conduit (tubes the electrical wires go into) through existing structures.\n\nAs far as the actual usage goes.  Since it's new construction it should be more efficient power wise than your older house even if it was the same size, taking 800 sq ft off your AC needs will take a chunk out as well. \n\nIn terms of generation, it's not straightforward.  They should have given you a document with a total annual yield for what they plan to install and a month by month breakdown.  It's hard to give advice without info because for example solar panels placed facing north don't generate as much as panels facing south by orders of magnitude so just saying 3kw of panels are being installed doesn't really tell me anything in terms of production.  If I had to hazard a guess about total generation I'd say you'll do 4-13kwh per day, 120-400kwh/month depending on the month (it rains more some months etc.).  You'll basically be covering the on going electrical load in your house plus a little bit more on your better days which your utility will likely credit you back during night hours.  \n\nI'm a big believer in owning but if they're not willing to lower the price I would be interested in the lease.  10k in mortgage is $50/month or so...so $13ish is $65/month.\n\nIf you're willing to see it as an investment in the resale price of your home I would urge you still to buy it outright but if you plan to stay there for a long time you may as well lease.  \n\nAs far as the warranties go btw.  It probably won't break for a long time.  The deal is though that the warranty is on PARTS not LABOR, at least after the first 5 or (very unlikely) 10 years.  So if it doesn't break right away and it breaks 6 years from now you'll have to pay someone to come...though it's not crazy amounts of money or anything, couple or few hundred most times as the problems are simple.",

"comment": "Interesting. \n\n&gt;Solar production tends to be more of a distributed source (thousands of house roofs) than a fixed one (single 10MW+ fields).\n\nI was trying to find any data I could on what would be possible with distributed rooftop solar, but it is hard to find sources that agree because of all the variation involved.\n\nI found that an average home's use seems to be around [900kwh](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3)  per month. \n\nThen [this source](https://solarpowerrocks.com/buying-solar/how-to-calculate-the-amount-of-kilowatt-hours-kwh-your-solar-panel-system-will-produce/) says that a 5 kw solar system in mostly optimal conditions (Arizona sun levels) would produce about 650 kwh per month. \n\nDoes that sound about right to you? \n\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around it all :)",

"comment": "Builders are greedy as hell and don't like dealing with additional regulations man. If it will save them money on the build, I fully expect all new construction to have large, heavily sloped north facing roofs, eliminating the option of installing solar panels. They'll sell the units for like 5 grand less but will save like 20+ grand dealing with solar installations, engineering plans, and inspections.\n\nIf builders built out with what people wanted, all these high density condos popping up would have adequate parking. But it's cheaper to build dense and forego the parking space because that parking doesn't equate to more money for them. \n\n\nHere's what I think would possibly work: Provide a financial incentive for builders to make *solar ready* construction. Set up some guidelines with, say, minimum 30% of the roof to be south facing contiguous area sufficient for solar panels, the main breaker panel is large enough to support a solar array, and the builder gets like a $5000 rebate for building a solar ready home. The builder can then advertise those homes as solar ready and possibly get like $5000 more for the sale as well.\n\nHell, you can probably even skip the rebate and just set up a small government entity that certifies homes and new construction as solar ready. Give it a fancy logo and a bit of a media promotion and all the builders will be looking to tweak their specs in order to add that little logo on the sale listing.",

"comment": "Because they have the potential to make us self reliant in the future. I don't like being forced to use them or subsidizing them. However OPEC nations intentionally keep increasing production to make renewables unviable. It's kind of hostile. I also like coal and stuff. I'd like a combination of coal power plants to suppliment renewables if OPEC nations decide to undercut renewables. I like this idea since it should appease green people but prevent us from being screwed by being undercut by OPEC. I don't like mandating solar panels on homes because there are some people who do not like electricity and don't even want a house with electricity so forcing solar panels on their house is a waste.",

"comment": "&gt; That would still save the planet from irreversible issues, no ?\n\nNo. We need to cut emissions now, not in 15 years. The ocean/atmosphere system is like a pan of water. We have the heat on high but it hasn't reach equilibrium temperature yet. The longer we leave it on high, the hotter it gets. Unlike a pan of water the effects of hitting higher temperature are generally not reversible because there are feedback mechanisms that add other heat sources as the planet warms. So if we overshoot then we could be in a situation where we could stop CO2 emissions overnight and still get runaway warming.\n\nBottom line - Emissions now matter greatly but can't be mitigated by a nuclear build out that won't start generation until 2035.\n\n&gt; Well, there is no physical limit on the amount of debt the world can make. It would be like a global Green New Deal, or a Marshall Plan for Climate. I'm more concerned about CO2 then about debt.\n\nNo there isn't but the world isn't run by a single authoritarian government so whatever is proposed must work with the economic system we have, or a slightly reformed version of it. If your solution requires an overthrow of capitalism before we can start then, even if you or I wanted that, it won't happen in time to avoid catastrophe.\n\n&gt; Make a hole. CO2 is much more dangerous than supposed radiation accident.\n\nI didn't mean that security risk. I meant putting nuclear technology in countries that can't adequately secure it. Putting nuclear technology in Somalia or the DRC or Afghanistan would likely end badly.\n\n&gt; Solar and wind are not cheaper: \n\nThat analysis is highly partial given its reference time period. So partial in fact that the article you cited made it into the climate change denier playground, WUWT.\n\nYes, Germany spent a fortune developing solar power and electricity was expensive while they did that, but looking FORWARD, prices for solar and wind are the cheapest for any electricity in history. Solar-only contracts are now being done at 2-3US cents per KWh. Even solar backed by storage can be done at [8c per KWh](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/hawaiian-electric-industries-announces-mind-blowing-solar-plus-storage-cont). That is comparable to gas, but with the benefit that the price is fixed, not volatile based on the fuel price.\n\nGiven the bulk of solar is being rolled out at much lower prices and much greater scale than earlier and smaller roll-outs, the effect of solar and wind will be to reduce the price of electricity.",

"comment": "Thank you. I precisely needed this after reading a few things that felt like being punched in the gut.\n\nAlready decided that I will only invest in green/renewable companies/energy sources from now on.\nInterest rates on local savings account currently suck anyway. (&lt;0.2%), you don't need money if the rest of the world is $&amp;@&amp;(;:,  and I've got a basic buffer now. So I'll do my bit and \"buy the change I want to see in the world\".\n\nCurrently generating 3 times my annual electricity usage with solar panels and via investments in solar panels I've already generated another couple of thousand kWh,\n\nFight back where you can, even if what you're doing not perfect. Millions of people making small changes, changes companies, policies, production scaling, market pricing etc.\n\nWe need the good option to be/become the cheapest option. Then parties looking only at thei financials will also shift, simply because it saves them money.",

"comment": "Do I understand correctly that you want to:\n\n\\- Build a plant to produce your own silicon from borosilicate\n\n\\- Process the silicon into solar panels\n\n\\- And create the infrastructure to recycle the solar panels\n\n\\- All for a quantity of 100 kW of solar panels?\n\nIf so, you are talking about an enormous commitment of time and money for a very small quantity of solar modules. I can try to help you with a bit more information, but first I want to make sure I understand exactly what you intend to do.\n\nBe aware that depending on where in the world you are, you can probably build a 100 kW solar farm for USD 100-200k, and building the plants necessary to make them from sand is likely to cost upwards of USD 10 million if you use new, state-of-the-art equipment (either because you'll have to build to a much larger scale than you need or because you'll have to use laboratory-scale equipment). It can be cheaper if you use old, used equipment, but 100 kW is so little that you're unlikely to save money by doing it yourself.\n\nOf course, if the economic part of the equation is not your motivation, none of that matters....",

"comment": "I work with both companies regularly. Both companies are persistent and friendly before the install. After the install both companies can be a bit difficult to get a hold of or work with but, by far, sunrun has been the worse to interact with. That could be quite different depending on your area. In my personal experience I find that Tesla is much more willing to take care of issues. I also find that Tesla's installation quality is much higher than Sunrun. A big reason for this is that the ZEP equipment is so straight forward. If I was forced to choose between Sunrun and Tesla I wouldn't hesitate to choose Tesla over Sunrun.\n\nWith that said, I would highly recommend checking with a local installer as well. There are both good and bad companies out there, but I find the best experience you could have is if you find that right local installer that really takes care of you. If you have the time it wouldn't hurt to interact with a couple to see if you really connect with one before choosing a large corporation.",

"comment": "The rate is 10.5 cents vs 6.5 cents, plus whatever brings it up to 13.5 cents.\n\nI wouldn't spend much more time beyond that because you're already on unstable ground. Net metering could be thrown out in the FERC lawsuit or at the state level and then grandpa would lose another 6-8 cents on the deal. Grandpa might not have the tax liability to begin with. \n\nThe sales agent didn't properly inform the customer on inflow vs outflow issues associated with their net metering plan.\n\nElectric rates do not increase at those rates, and certainly the solar component of the savings will not increase at that rate, and certainly not savings will be had as the rate is already higher than the default rate. Best thing OP's dad can do is hope it is a real PPA and not a loan or fixed payment. The inverter could then be conveniently turned off to avoid payment. I doubt that is the case though.\n\nInstead call it for what it is. The sales rep found an 80-year-old and told him it would save  money and the 80-year-old said oh boy that's great and three days go by and grandpa has a $30k potential lein on his property for something that will increase his cost of living for the rest of his life.  \n\nThere are ways for solar to be cost effective and there are customers who are happy with long-term paybacks but I have a feeling this isn't one of them.\n\nHope Grandpa had a good contractor because their installation quality can be a real heartache (or the only thing that salvages some value at the end of the day).",

It's about half the usable capacity of one powerwall, I have tested it running one fridge, one chest freezer, and one very low power AC, cooling one closed room, set only a few degrees below the outside temperature. I can only get 6 hours at night from this load, so a Powerwall may get you 12 hours.  That might work for one night (if it's summer and the nights are shorter), but if the following day is cloudy you will need a truly *massive* solar array to recharge it, or a second Powerwall for the next night.  See where I'm going with this?  I don't know about you, but sometimes it's cloudy for a whole week, in which case you would need 7 Powerwalls (~$60k, before adding solar) to just keep that minimal load going.\n\nIt's all possible. It's just far more complicated and expensive than everything seems when you first start exploring the concepts.",

"comment": "A few days ago: https://www.designboom.com/technology/oceanbird-wallneius-marine-09-14-2020/\n\n&gt;Swedish company wallenius marine has unveiled the oceanbird — an innovative sailing cargo vessel that claims to reduce transatlantic travel emissions by 90% and is able to carry up to 7,000 cars. measuring 200 meters in length, 40 in width, and 100 meters in height, the boat has five unique wings which are reminiscent of those found on airplanes. a transatlantic crossing would take approximately 12 days, instead of the current 7 days it takes with a conventional freighter.\n\nTo get to drastic reduction in emissions the diesels must go out. to achieve that faster i.e. without requiring a massive infrastructure changes which unavoidably take a lot of time even if they can be financed, the existing technology must be used.\n\nSo, batteries and hybrid forms of sailing and recharging.\n\nA decent amount of recharging can be done in several ways on the boats. They can have hybrid systems of both solar panels and wind turbines.\n\nSuch as this type, for example \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200903-the-wind-turbines-standing-up-to-the-worlds-worst-storms\n\n&gt;A start-up called Challenergy, based in Tokyo, has designed and built a wind turbine specifically engineered to operate in typhoon-prone areas. For Atsushi Shimizu, founder and chief executive of Challenergy, the ideal place for these robust wind turbines is somewhere like Eastern Samar where reliable electricity is scarce.\n\n&gt;It is in such conditions that Shimizu hopes his design will not only withstand high wind speeds but also harness their power. He plans to do so using a radically different design from usual turbines. Most commercial wind turbines, like the ones found in northern Europe, operate along a horizontal axis using propeller-like blades. But Shimizu’s design is on a vertical axis, with cylinders in place of blades, and which make use of a physics phenomenon known as the Magnus effect.\n\nAll of these technologies combined can provide enough continuous propulsion to change the whole shipping and passenger industry. Norwegians already have working EV ferries, for shorter routes - which are the majority of everyday sea transport.  \n\nSo, its already existing tech and with a few already reliable and doable additions it can be extended for long journeys and cargo transportation.\n\n\nedit:\n\nbtw im all for nuclear power only not based on current ancient and behind times reactors.\nUntil we have Traveling Wave reactors and Thorium liquid salt or similar new designs which can be made much smaller and without most of the issues the old reactors create we should use what we have and can do right now. \n\nAnd when these new types of reactors become available then they too can be used as additions to the whole system, instead of Either - Or  idiocy.\n\nedit 2:\n\nAny hybrid diesel systems need to simply fuck off because if we do that we will be stuck with those for the next 50 years, which the article lists as potential running life of boats.\n\nWe can go all green - zero emissions right now.",

"comment": "Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for!  Thank you for understanding what I'm saying.\n\nTo clear up confusion here about why I called it off grid - both the power company and the county electric inspector said what I'm describing is \"off grid\" with regards to the solar installation itself, since I'm not getting a net meter connection and my solar system itself is not connected to the grid, even though the devices I hook up to power will be. They both said it's not grid connected unless my solar panels themselves feed power to the utility grid, which is not what I'm doing. IE - if I isolate my panels from the grid itself, then it's off grid technically speaking. So I guess the requirement here is to make sure the inverter, mini split, or any other device that uses such a scheme also ensures the panels themselves stay isolated from the grid, in order to still qualify as \"off grid\".\n\nAt least that's what they told me when I showed them that mini split that is both connected to utility and my solar system, together.  The device itself is connected to the grid, but the solar system itself is off grid still, and thus not applicable to on grid regulations and requirements still. This inverter does the same thing though, so I will ask them about it and see if they will still consider it to be technically off grid. Because using one inverter that supplements with grid power when needed both allows me to avoid a huge, costly battery bank plus allows me to power multiple devices the same way whereas the minisplit that does this same thing only powers itself (plus costs 2x the normal mini split price), so would defintely prefer something like this Outback inverter if I can do it.\n\n\\*for the non technicians, think about water - I can have a city water connection plus a well. If I combine both the well and city pipes in order to ensure there is enough water during times the well aquifer can't keep up, and if I put a backflow preventer valve on the city and well pipes, then my well is not technically tied into the city water system, but the tub, sink, irrigation system are still getting the benefit of both sources of water combined. The devices themselves are tied to the \"grid water\", but the well water isn't. And since I have \"grid water\" still, I don't need a big tank (aka batteries) for my well anymore. In my case, the well water would be like my solar system.  And my heaters, computers etc are like the tub, irrigation system, etc. Not apples to apples, but this might be a simpler way to envision the system I'm trying to build.\n\nIn other words - my shop/house in on grid. But my solar system is off grid. But both work together still.",

"comment": "That's laughably overpriced. You should immediately stop talking to Sunrun, IMO, because that proposal is an absolute joke.\n\n* Low grade, low power panels\n* String inverter...did they mention DC optimizers on the panels at all? They'd better. Otherwise run away as your system will be hobbled every time even a portion of one panel gets shaded. Also, if your single inverter ever goes bad (and they do), then your whole system goes down all at once until it's replaced, which will not happen immediately.\n* 98% offset means you're still going to be a net importer of electricity. Why? Do you think utility rates are a good deal? You're also likely to increase electricity usage in the future if you go with a heat pump, EV, etc. Why go small? The only reason I see is so Sunrun can give you even less for your money without making the quote so astronomically high that you don't even consider it.\n* $40k for that system is almost 2x what you can get if you look at competing bids. Do not do this. Run, do not walk, away. You should absolutely get more quotes and *then* decide if it's worth your time talking to Sunrun so you can get a Costco cash card.\n\n\nOne thing that may be a factor here is that you didn't mention a \"cash price\" vs. a financed price. It seems like they gave you the price that includes financing. Financing through solar installers is almost always a bad idea because they include HUGE dealer fees. So you may get an ok or even excellent rate on the loan, but the amount of the loan is inflated. Again, this is Sunrun looking out for themselves and not trying to help you.",

"comment": "This was earlier this year. I looked carefully at the deal and how it's structured. It's a tax loophole using a third party company, SunRun as the \"lessor\" that can then claim and resell the incentives and MACRS on $6/W, then leases the system they just bought from the third party company, back to me, warranties it, guarantees it, etc.\n\nIt's esoteric for sure and maybe questionable depending on how you feel about taxes (I've seen crazier stuff in business finance personally) but the bottom line is unbeatable - $0.03/kwh in California on a regular SFR.\n\nI haven't needed service yet but it's just part of SunRun's fleet of systems now and they guarantee me 37000kwh/year\n\nThe work was well done, it's better than most of the installs I've seen anyway (cosmetically anywa) but I did have to be around to ask for attic runs and tweak the panel alignment how I wanted it.\n\nI'm assuming tax laws will catch up but who knows how long that will take, and given the current climate of going green at all costs I have no idea",

Germany is closing down nuclear and still using lignite and lots of  oil . The UK dropped back on nuclear and is now beholden to France and the PRC.\n\nChina is planning at least 150 new nuclear reactors in the next 15 years, more than the rest of the world has built in the past 35.\n\nThe PRC built wind farms with a total capacity of almost 100GW in 2020, a rise of nearly 60% on the previous year, which is more than the rest of world combined.  The US built just 16.5GW.",

As in the linked article, bad news propagates more easily and therefore bad news sells (papers and online visits). Positive changes are harder to publicise and harder to find.\n\nNot everyone can make the same changes but it only makes things worse to criticise those who do make changes as making changes which are specific to their situation and which others cannot change for themselves. For example, not everyone can fit solar panels and a heat pump to their own properties (rental, finance, building restrictions etc.) I've recently completed those, it doesn't mean that I'm expecting you to do the same unless you are currently in a similar situation to where I was when I accepted those quotes. (Yes, I'm now combustion-free & a chunk poorer but my energy bills have been reduced to a quarter of last year - 75% less.) There is no easy way to put a value on the carbon emissions saved by this work but I'm old enough not to care about fake \"return on investment\" arguments. I made the change for two reasons - I am on a fixed income, so I need to cut my bills and the changes to this property will outlive me.",

"comment": "You need to figure out what the net metering agreement is with your utility first.  If you have 1:1 net metering, your concern is a moot point.  That energy will be sent to the grid during the day when you guys are working, but you can pull it back for free (for the most part, depending on utility, typically a few cents pull back per kWh) at night when you guys are home.\n\nFor only using energy for a set number of hours, that is sure a big system.  Do you guys have EVs or a roof that isn't all that great for solar?  Anyway, get more quotes of course, and look at local installers.  They'll give you the best deals and better customer service.  Don't both with Tesla if they are in your area.  Yes they will be cheap, but you get what you pay for with 0 customer service, which you definitely definitely need on a project like this.  Also, ask for the cash price of the system even though it sounds like you need to finance?  That way you can see how much all the loan fees, etc, are.",

Plus, having a large power overhead means that even in winter you can generate enough current to run electric heaters/heat pumps 24/7 too.",

"comment": "Will second this. I think PPA structure can be abused. But there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it. First, you only pay for the electricity that the solar panels produce. So performance and maintenance is on the installer/owner of the project. If an inverter breaks (and they will break at some point), that is the installers problem since they lose money on no kWh sold every day. They deal with the warranty claims with the manufacturers and setting up a repair/replacement. And they will get this done faster than a homeowner. Second, the installer/owner deals with the tax credit. So a very low income person (think retiree who has very little taxable income) doesn't have to deal with spreading tax credits over two or more tax years. Third, a nice low escalator like 1.9% is fixed for 20 years. You get savings immediately and if electricity prices and inflation rises, you don't have to worry about that.",

"comment": "absolutely, but there are challenges to homeowners feeding power into the grid that tend to make it expensive.\n\nForget about the source for now, but when you are backfeeding into the grid you have to match both voltage, frequency and you have to sync that frequency (if the waveform on the grid is at say -120v and you try to give it +120v...bad things happen..)  Power outtages are also a large concern.  You have to isolate your home from the grid because if you feed power out it will energize the lines they are trying to repair and add risk for linesman.\n\nThe grid operator would still need to either give flat hours when they would like the storage, or make a way to signal your equipment to turn on when they want it.\n\n  \nThe fact is, a business can do this much cheaper than a homeowner.  Buying in bulk and building big both bring down the cost substantially compared to a homeowner.  Even if you disregard the battery cost, there's still a bunch of equipment needed.  They can also guarantee uptime and availability in a way a homeowner never could.  Even the cost of charging said batteries would be much cheaper for a business.\n\nOutside of early subsidies and fringe cases there is just no way a homeowner will be able to compete with a business for grid storage.  A distributed system of homeowners selling storage to the grid is never going to compete with the scales of economy a business can take advantage of.  There's only 3 options.\n\nA: the grid pays so little homeowners lose money doing this (on average at least, exceptions always exist)\n\nB: the grid pay's enough for homeowners to profit, but this costs more than paying a business to do it, so they lose money and raise rates.\n\nC: the grid builds the needed storage themselves, or pay's another business to do so.\n\n\n\nIt's the same sort of issue rooftop solar has.  It's just cheaper to buy the land they need and do it large scale rather than do 1000's of little ones on roof's.",

Our 1951 house never had a main service panel, just the main breaker from the meter, so it had a sub panel inside which is where the whole house was wired to. \n\nWhen upgrading everything for solar panels and EV, we had to put in a panel at the box that is essentially not used at all besides being a feed into the actual sub panel inside which was also upgraded. \n\nSo in the future I guess we could add loads to the main panel that would be separate from the sub panel and would not be backed up by our whole home backup since that only backs up what is on the sub panel.",

Only you can judge how likely it is you'd have an outage, based on weather, issues locally, and other reasons.\n\n(b) speaking of weather, some batteries (Tesla Powerwall) have functions where you can trigger holding back a certain part (or all) of the battery capacity, and run off of the grid in case of *expected* storms (trigger provided by manufacturer, the utility, or a sensor that picks up Weather Service advisories for extreme weather in your region). \n\n(c) Check the battery manufacturers use guidelines, and what type of discharge cycles are supported as \"normal use\", and which may void the warranty. Many are build to be *nearly depleted* and cycle to charge (80%? 100%? Read the manual!), with no ill effects.",

An agnostic, for instance, might be that way because they just aren't that interested in the question of god, therefore, it won't be much of an issue at all.\n\nMy husband wasn't vegan when I met him, but after one very low key discussion and a couple youtube videos, he instantly reacted and said, \"I want nothing to do with that,\" and has been vegan since. :)",

I know there are a lot of self-righteous, holier-than-thou vegans in this subreddit who are immediately hostile to anybody who isn't basically a Jain monk, and I feel it necessary to make clear that they don't speak for all of us.  It's unfortunate that there are too many vegans who are too busy being full of themselves to realize that everybody in the world simply isn't going to become vegan overnight, or perhaps at all.  Do I think the world would be a better place if everybody were vegan?  Yes.  But that's not realistic.  What is realistic is the recognition that every steak that isn't bought and every hamburger that isn't eaten is a victory, and I'm glad to have conversation partners in this subreddit who are on board with reducing meat consumption, no matter what their level of personal dedication.",

Many of our friends have tried vegan dishes a great number of times, yet are not willing to forgo meat on the 4th when their families have traditionally been barbecuing meat for generations.\n\nSome of us just don't have enough friends to sit alone at our vegan barbecues on July 4th while being \"better off without\" all of our friends who don't show up annually.  You are in the position where you don't have to compromise.  This is one of those ideal situations for a vegan.  Many of us don't have that luxury.",

"comment": "[This](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2012/04/11-ways-to-cheat-veganism/) is an article I recently read about foods that can supplement the vegan diet. Over my whole life as a vegan (I turned from vegan into a vegetarian about 5 years ago, and was raised as a vegan) I noticed, that whatever you do or don't, other people will still have trouble understanding your preferences. \nA large part of my family are vegans for ~a couple of decades now, and the small part that isn't (grandmother, mostly) is giving us a hard time about it. There's tension upon gathering around table, because she is a great chef and wants to cook 'proper' food, instead of messing around with veggie tortillas and such. However, no bond was lost here, as we managed to convince her it's a nice challenge for her to learn something new and different, and she's makes awesome vegan meals now. So we just play around it. On the other hand, my mother-in-law, who is a pescatarian like yours, will give me hard time for not cooking meat dishes to her son (which he never asks for, as he enjoys my vegetarian cooking a lot). I still manage to have a nice relationship with her, she lets me cook soups and make salads in her kitchen... Life is not about food, relationships with other people should not be based on food preferences too.",

"comment": "I've never understood the position that it's the *consumption* of animal products that's the ethical problem--to me it's the *production*. This is because I'm an ethical consequentialist--to me, the only ethical component to an action is its set of consequences. \n\nIf a packet of mayonnaise (or an entire cheeseburger) falls out of the sky, I can see nothing ethically wrong with eating it, because you did not cause suffering by producing it, and you will not cause suffering by consuming it. The suffering has already happened, and discarding the product cannot undo it.\n\nIn most circumstances it's the act of *purchase* that has the ethical component--not because of what happened in the past to get the product to the store or restaurant, but because it adds to the demand for that product, which encourages future production, which requires future suffering.\n\n(Of course there are other consequences to eating animal products--given that you are an ethical actor in the world, actions that affect your own health, and hence your ability to be that actor, can have an ethical component too. But that's approaching splitting hairs and not really the topic under discussion.)\n\nTL;DR Buying the animal product is the only unethical act under consideration. As to whether that's \"vegan\", I'll leave that for the Arbiters of What Is or Ain't Vegan to rule on.",

You might exclude more things from your diet than an average person but your awareness and willingness to take action makes a difference in the lives of animals. Vegans are the people who successfully get companies to stop using animal products through boycotts and awareness campaigns. The people and services around us may not cater to vegans but we can certainly change that so long as we are adamant about not eating animal products. \n\n\nAlso, about Earth Balance and Palm Oil:\n\nhttp://www.earthbalancenatural.com/responsibility/palm-oil/\n\n\nEarth Balance doesn't get their palm oil from Orangutan habitats (thanks to people speaking out), and I think that they now also make buttery spreads without palm oil altogether.",

It's kind of like how lactaid is seen as special milk for lactose intolerant people and people don't really drink it otherwise. I think lots of people see vegan food in a similar way.",

Honest reasons endure.\n\nPeople who go vegan because their friends do so, because it is trendy, because they want to rebel, they want something to be enraged about, etc backslide eventually.\n\nYou need to know why you started, why you want to continue and what you want.\n\nBy coming to /r/vegan I'm guessing ( if you are not trolling ) you want to stay vegan and you want us to bolster that desire, or you want our permission to quit.\n\nFigure out if the things that motivated you to start still exist in you.   If not,  look at the reasons that are out there like a newb and see if any inspire you.  Be clear with yourself that is why you are staying vegan.   Go visit a farm animal sanctuary.  Get to know the animals by name.  Visit them a few times.\n\nGood luck",

If someone ate 2200 calories a day of mostly animal products compared to someone who ate 2200 calories of fruit. We all know who would be fat and who would be lean. The secret to staying lean effortlessly is definitely not obsessing over calorie intake. If that was the case all them restrictive fad diets would work. The secret is eating a whole plant based diet which is high carb low fat minus the oils. You can eat in abundance because no amount of fresh fruits and vegetables will make anybody fat.",

Keeping that mental separation only serves to keep that linguistically-enforced mental divide around longer, and it's already essentially the core of animal rights issues in general (and racism, and sexism, and any other -ism that elevates any one group above another).\n\nIt's like almost like pandering to the carnivore \"justification\" of being above animals...we need to be doing exactly the opposite of this since those faux justifications don't even deserve to be seriously addressed.\n\nSo, with that in mind...\n\n&gt; ...but we have moral agency and are vastly different in that regard.\n\nThis is a divide to be recognized, but this is one that squarely places the onus on us, since we are the ones with said moral agency.  Treating animals with respect does not require that they act any differently than they do now as their moral agency, or lack thereof, was never the criteria in the first place as to whether or not it was deserved.\n\n&gt; Both should be supported, but don't expect vegan activists to intersect these issues as it takes away from the voiceless - the animals.\n\nNo, it doesn't though...as the humans trapped in morally repugnant places are often also left as \"voiceless\" as any animal.  This is literally the entire point of the #BLM protests right now.",

As a further act of cowardice, he's using his baby as an excuse because he simply cannot admit that he's full of shit even though it's painfully obvious.\n\nWatch some of the old videos where he had outbursts against vegans for being too preachy. You can see on his face that he's having an internal struggle and knows what he's saying it's utter shit but he's got zero resolve. I wouldn't be surprised if he was repeating verbatim some of the insults and shit slinging he got from his in-laws.\n\nI'm sure it's hard for him to deal with obnoxious, intrusive in-laws, especially when it comes to a baby. I wouldn't pretend to know that particular situation firsthand but I've been vegan for almost 15 years and come from a family of hillbillies who love hunting. I've lived in rural Texas for 17 years. I've had to deal with intense anti-vegan sentiment and it wears on you. It really does and honestly, I wouldn't even be that mad at him if he was just honest and came right out and said \"I can't handle the pressure from my family. It has gotten to me and I'm abandoning my principles.\"  As shitty as that is for the true victims in all of this, it as least not gussied up with excuses and lies.\n\nHe's not doing that though. He's profited off of the vegan label (maybe not as much recently considering his channel has been tanking, coincidentally) and has actively harmed the movement with his lies and excuses that contradict everything he and his wife have ever said while commodifying this movement. It gives credence and ammo to all the shit the anti-vegan charlatans constantly spew while undermining the critical role that societal pressure plays in people sticking to vegan values.\n\nHe's a fraud and a coward. Fuck him.",

He wouldn’t even give me his damn fruit cup.\n\nBut, the top person of my entire agency was there, and I happened to run into her right after this happened. I told her I was super upset and thankfully she shared my indignation. She said even though we were not allowed to claim lunch on our travel bc it was “provided” that I could still submit the claim for lunch. She then walked with me to a hotel cafe and scanned the place for vegan options which was really kind of endearing. She said, “that’s so unacceptable. You need to eat too.” Before she received her promotion a few years ago, she actually stepped in when she overheard me talking to the venue about how a place of white rice is not a satisfactory vegan option. She was super pissed and made them make me a nice lunch. So she has always been supportive…. It’s just some of the people in between who aren’t so much.",

"comment": "I don’t believe that we should compare animal abuse and carnism to racism or any other historical atrocity, as they can stand on their own as awful things without being used as measuring sticks against one another. \n\nHowever, I think it’s important to recognize the difference between equating two things and comparing them. Comparing racism and animal abuse is not to say the two are necessarily equal. When a lot of vegans use comparisons like this, it’s often to point out how the logic and arguments  people used (and still use) to justify other atrocities bears a striking resemblance to the logic people use to justify animal agriculture and eating animals. \n\nThat being said, I think it’s important to refrain from using these arguments (especially if you are white) at least for the time being. They often are alienating and turn people off to veganism, because people often think that they are comparing humans to animals. What they don’t really understand is that there is an inherent difference between how most people view animals and how vegans view animals — we don’t see animals as lesser than humans, we see them as equal. But once again, I think if marginalized communities are objecting to these comparisons being made, we should probably refrain from using them. I just wish we were able to point out the similarities without coming off the way we do.",

"comment": "I'm very late to this, but I've had this tab open for a little while meaning to get a response together and wanted to note something:\n\n>And how do we make the same decision on a global level? Isn't the option to go vegan a privilege when so many people struggle to survive another day?\n\nPutting solar panels on your house is a privilege. Buying organic produce is a privilege. Buying plastic-free alternatives to products is a privilege. Owning an electric car is a privilege. Living in a walkable and bikeable area so you don't have to drive at all is a privilege. Not living in  a food desert is a privilege.\n\nPrivilege is a useful framework for understanding social stratification and oppression in our society, but dismissing a person doing something that's better for society, the planet, animals, etc. as a privilege is a deeply unproductive way of viewing things. People who are struggling to make ends meet are often in a position with more limited options, and I don't judge them for doing their best -- I just try to make the world a better place so no one has to struggle in the first place. That's a privilege, but if I chose not to utilize it because not everyone can, would I actually be helping anyone? Or would I be surrendering responsibility to do better even though I can?\n\nI think that when it comes to causes, there's a very real risk of \"perfect is the enemy of good.\" There's a lot of bad going on in the world, too many for any one person to tackle all of them. But if everyone were to pick a few causes and fight for them, then we'd get a lot farther than spending too long trying to figure out the absolute most useful causes before we do anything. When it comes to doing the right thing, it's often better to do something imperfect now than to wait to try to do it perfectly later.\n\nI can make a lot of arguments as to why I believe veganism is a useful place to spend my energy. I can point out that in addition to animal welfare concerns, there are huge environmental concerns surrounding animal agriculture. That it's using huge amounts of water, land, and resources which could go directly to humans instead. I could point out that all the soy that goes into cattle feed could instead feed a lot more people than the slaughtered cows will. I could point out that animal agriculture results in a whole lot of methane emissions, contributing to climate collapse. I could point out that animal agriculture is a major contributor to the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I could point out that animal agriculture is a major source of zoonotic diseases. And then I can point out that it's something I personally do, that I have to get food and feed myself anyway, so it's worth it to me to put in a bit more effort in order to minimize the harm my food does, especially given that I genuinely believe that animals have emotions and it's wrong to harm anyone who can suffer if I can just... not do that. And literally all of that is true! But honestly, if it's in the context of \"So, how do I justify personally focusing my energy on veganism when human societies are in such a state? Even if I do both (help animals and help humans), when I act for veganism am I not choosing animals over humans?\" then I feel like it's not even worth pointing that out, because that involves accepting the idea that it's an either/or proposition. It's not. You can do a lot of stuff.\n\nWhich wraps back around to:\n\n>Absolute Code:  \nI find that vegans I know, in person and second-hand, have a near-absolute code. For example, if one would get pizza delivery but the cheese seems like it might not be vegan, they would rather throw it away rather than eat it themselves.  \nI worry that this absolute code, in the long term, causes several of the negative behaviours I have observed from vegan media: be it self-hate when one fails to uphold their code, a feeling of superiority against people who do not have or have failed to stick to their own code, an attitude of misanthropy (e.g. \"We really are the worst species\"), a general cult-like mindlessness of the \"we are all doing the right thing, you should too\" vibe.  \nI also worry that I will not be able to avoid posing an absolute code to myself as well, possibly falling into the trap of such behaviours.  \nIf you have had these worries, how have you dealt with them? Is my perception possibly flawed as an \"outsider\"?\n\nHere's my personal suggestion: just don't do that if you're worried about it. There's a whole range of vegans, from those who would never knowingly eat an animal product to \"freegans\" who consider it acceptable to eat animal products that would just be disposed of anyway. Most of us fall somewhere in between. I tend to fall more towards not eating anything that an animal has died for even if it will just \"go to waste\" otherwise, but if it turns out that the restaurant put butter in my rice, then I'll see if anyone else wants it, and if not, well, that's life. My number one rule is not to judge anyone who's trying their best. Some people will gatekeep veganism, but that doesn't need to impact whether or not you choose to follow the vegan philosophy at all. Only you get to make your own decisions, and if they're not good enough for some purist who only accepts vegans who exclusively eat pesticide-free crops they've grown themselves in till-free soil with vegan soil amendments, well, then don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Just do your best, and don't fret too much about whether it's good enough by someone else's standards.",

"comment": "Yeah I wish I could grow avocados here in jersey, down florida I tried in unclaimed lots along with a sprouted coconut and some other things, but when I went back they probably dried out and died. Tree-ripened mangos (or any fruit usually) is just amazing, not just kent there's some others that was the best mango I've ever had had a scaly skin like a hass avocado and no stringyness or anything nice and dense. In summer people have so many they put ads up you can come take for free, same w coconuts. I grow figs here in jersey but have to wrap it each winter or the branches will freeze and by the time they grow back the season is late and barely makes any figs but when I wrap it they're as great, the ones from store had no flavor like eating cork, same w blackberries etc I grow are amazing vine ripened, many things have a short shelf life like berries, figs etc so commercially they pick them hard and sour way too early and some things don't even get sweeter as they ripen off the plant so they just end up sour mush quickly. \n\n\n\nI did quite a bit of research on freezing avocados in hopes to just defrost a pre-ripened one whenever I want avocado sushi instead of having the avocado tell me when it's ripe and then drop what I'm doing even if I wasn't really in the mood for sushi especially since a day or two later it can turn brown and bad even in the fridge. I love sushi w nori though and it's got tons of good iodine. By law, most salts are required to have iodine which is mostly in seafood but people non vegans as most people are still weren't getting enough iodine, same with why white flour in the US is required to be fortified, so the gov started adding iodine to salt. I don't really taste the difference and I usually eat iodized salt although other pink Himalayan and sea salts etc usually have more flavor and minerals etc I don't really notice it, pink himalayan just tastes 'saltier than salt' to me almost like MSG so I just stick with iodized sea salt usually, I'm the type if I'm going to salt something usually I like the salt on top after rather than cooking it into it, this way I get the texture of the salt too, kosher salt has a nice flaky texture for something batter fried cauliflower etc. \n\n  \nAnyways, turns out can't really freeze avocados because most plants when frozen the cell wall structure bursts and then ends up mushy but hass avocados luckily which I prefer I read are somewhat do-able if cut in half and frozen, many freeze avocados even Aldi carries them in chunks fine for shakes etc but hopefully it's decent for sushi, I have a bag ripening right now. I've even tried store made guacamole for sushi lol but the garlic etc it just tasted too off. Funny is vegan sushi avocado cucumber still hits the same way for me vs I used to get all tuna and salmon california rolls etc but w the wasabi soy sauce nori etc I'm not missing the fish kind, raw tuna/salmon doesn't even really have flavor either it's more for the texture, plus I don't have to worry about mercury etc or some fish left out to suffocate let alone all the stuff they gets caught in nets etc etc etc.",

"comment": "So, you saw a human running from an animal, hmmm, that changes everything right? So, just not run, and stand still like a tree ? Other animals don't run from other animals, just people right? Ahem... Figured...Also, I'm pretty sure those are the same type like-vegans, activists and pacifists, that are running away in that context of veganism that's been pictured, because it's pictured as if humans were \"cowards\" instead of being the \"big alpha hunter predators, and instead it will run from the predators, since humans are \"herbivorous\" animals right? Well, let's see in vegans eyes, how could they have expected that an animal could have dared to attacked them, since eating an animal is \"cruel\" practice, and being vegans is the \"only\" way to go, while in the mean time, you are being chased by those same animals you are \"trying to protect\", how's that logic works anyway ? It all just shows on how degraded these people can be these days, especially if they are part of some kind of a \"health\" or \"environmental\" cult like PETA or \"JUST STOP OIL\" crap. If you are gonna try to pick on an omnivorous animal (homo-sapiens) who eat other animals as well, you should first try to become those animals once again, before you try to judge them on tv or social media, no one's allowed to judge vegans, but how come they can judge everyone who's not up to their standards, or \"beliefs\" ?",

"comment": "Yeah this is somewhat accurate. Personally I've gotten sick of seeing vegan personalities get shit on by other fellow vegans for being ''too extreme''. If you go on these ''extreme'' youtubers comment section you'll almost always see commenters write that they've been changed by those people and that they've been convinced to go vegan. These ''extreme'' and loud vegans seem to have a higher track record at convincing people to go vegan than the more moderate ''don't wanna hurt your meat eating feelings'' types. In the end if you believe badly enough in the cause you should celebrate results. I don't believe that the end always justifies the means but when the means is just being very loud and brash on the internet then yeah what's the problem if people hear the message and make a change? I guess some vegans worry that it's too polarizing and will alienate many meat eaters but I would argue that the ones that would get alienated from the message are the ones that wouldn't have changed to begin with. I suppose that's debatable. In any case though I don't think that these quiet vegans should get to bitch unless they too have their own youtube channel and show us how it's done. \n\nOn the other hand you've got people like bite size vegan who aren't extreme and who have a pretty large following so not everything is black and white. But I would say that someone like Vegan gains is just as necessary (or maybe even more seeing his amount of subs) because they most likely reach two completely different demographics.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling a bit but yeah I mostly agree with you /u/pepsicolanewyork\n\nEdit: Also the reason why you got downvoted is precisely why I don't spend much time on this sub. People are so fucking negative here even towards other vegans. This should be a loving community, I mean people become vegans out of compassion so I don't see why people here can't be nice, especially to other vegans who want to make a change. I guess I don't understand people.",
