Emissions is the only concern.\n\n2: maybe, but the companies who are now throwing in to fuel cells are not doing so in order to get away from emissions heavy vehicles, but for compliance reasons. They also dropped their EV lines which is a big disappointment\n\n3: the assumption here is that batteries won't get better and cheaper, which they will. FCVs are late to a race with a less efficient, less environmentally friendly product. As fueling time is one of the biggest digs on BEVs, it really is the only improvement FCVs have until we build out the electric infrastructure.\n\n4: I love this actually. Fuel cells are just a bad idea for personal transportation. For mass transit and cargo though, where battery electrics might never work as easily or quickly as our current system, hydrogen cells would be great.\n\n5: only, no. Currently kinda feasible (no FCV trucks just yet), but when the focus here is selling commercial vehicles for individual use, that's kinda what BEV advocates have to focus on\n\n6: we've been using silicon processors for decades. Have computers stagnated?\n\n7: the solution for varying ranges and temperatures is electric charging infrastructure. If you drive 40 miles and make 3 stops totalling 3 hours, that's enough time to charge fully what you used. Average American drives less than 40 miles per day. When we see statistics like that it's easy to scoff that 80 miles of range is a \"problem\".\n\n8: just as every bomb is a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, every hydrogen refueling station is going to take money that could be used for electric charging infrastructure. At $100k per station, that's potentially 50 to 200 level 2s that could be spread out around the area.\n\n9: because he was working forward with the companies now making FCVs, and they're taking steps backwards by going the focus on compliance car route\n\n10: because FCV companies and advocates have attacked BEVs at each chance they get. They aren't trying to coexist, just supply the easiest compliance to California's laws so they can keep selling cars and avoid fines with no real interest in trying to improve the environmental impact of our personal transportation.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.12368897475835028,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11224162890059895,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21793746729144425,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27031430532224476,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22185028312323993,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2919426957766215,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08934163908871867,"ev_1":-0.15010580101719012,"ev_2":-0.17932818766949055,"ev_3":-0.11830524603525798,"ev_4":-0.01034234891890508,"ev_5":-0.14589520605063247,"ev_6":-0.2243939845539981},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (for 1, 4, 7, 8, and 10)\nNo (for 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9)","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for personal transportation)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Hope it helps:\n\n\nThe (solar) Federal Tax Credit was developed to help make purchasing a residential solar system more affordable. It works as a tax credit worth up to 30% of the total solar system cost. However, this is not a Treasury check for the value of the tax credit like the tax refund checks you are all familiar with. This is a tax credit that offsets the amount of federal taxes you owe. The Solar Tax Credit can roll over from year to year to a maximum of 5 years if your tax liability is less than the 30% of the system cost in one year. The assessment for the tax credit also applies to any other work deemed necessary to install your system, including, but not limited to; roof replacement, electrical work, and panel upgrades. \n\n\nExample:\nYour new solar system cost $10,000. You are eligible for a 30% tax credit equally $3000\nIf you owe $5000 federal taxes at the end of the year, the  solar tax credit will lower your tax liability to $2000 that year. \n\n\nThis tax credit has been extend at 30% to 2019 and will lower by 4% each year until it expires on December 31, 2021 at 22%. In order to qualify you must claim this incentive you must obtain your solar system through a cash purchase or a loan. If you lease your system, the leasing company will claim the tax credit. \nPrincipal  and secondary residents  are eligible, but not rental homes.

Had to plan everything outside a builder b/c as you mentioned, no one builder will know all these silos and frankly many were burned as early adopters of something else and never recommend the other silos.  \n\nFor solar, I would suggest you get the new for this year Enphase IQ8 microinverters which have sunlight backup, meaning in a blackout you can still get power if there is sunlight w/o an expensive, big battery. Microinverters are great for our northern latitude and any shade you might have on your roof.  \n\n  \nEnphase IQ8 Sunlight backup  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK950rn6HVw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK950rn6HVw)\n\nAlso, if you ever plan on getting an EV, newer vehicles plan to have bidirectional charging so you can use that giant battery in the EV also as a means for emergency backup power coupled w/ Sunlight Backup from the microinverters.  Enphase just acquired a EV charger company and planning just that so you may not want/need to have a bunch of Tesla Powerwalls around.\n\nEnphase enters EV charging market\n\n[https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/03/enphase-enters-ev-charging-market/](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/03/enphase-enters-ev-charging-market/)\n\nGeothermal is a great pairing to solar and probably more so than EVs as ROI is 10 years or less if you have a decent price for solar (under $2.50/watt before incentives) and geothermal install. On the upside, you are mostly eliminating fossil fuel for HVAC and effectively taking \\~2 cars off the road for a 25 year lifespan of a HVAC if it lasts that long. Just replace the unit air filter every year, keep it dry and it should last forever.  \n\nOne note on geothermal, I would suggest you listen to your geothermal SME and get the thermostat they recommend which is usually a Honeywell unit instead of Nest or even Ecobee as there is adaptive algorithms used in the Honeywell that is just not available in the others to reduce the energy consumption.  For some reason, pro HVAC technicians don't like the Nest HVAC functionality and think they are garbage compared to the Honeywell units.  \nWe haven't discussed hot water heaters yet which there are some newer split heat pump units using R744 refrigerant (CO2) but requires a willing, reliable installer that wants to deal w/ new-ish tech (immature distribution, parts, expertise, etc.) so it's complicated to provide a recommendation.  Another idea is propane tankless hot water heater which is cheap, reliable and cost effective.\n\nI use an induction stove and think it's great coming from gas stoves.  Propane is great for smokers/bbqs in the patio.  Today's latest induction stoves have beefier power to the burner which give you great cooking power, finer control than electric stoves of yesteryear that I hate.  It's the fastest, most efficient way to boil/heat up water/liquid.  Also they are much safer w/ toddlers around since they do not get hot, only the pot/pan, but you may have to replace your pots/pans if they are not induction ready like glass/ceramic.  Another reason is that it reduces your need to have a powerful range hood exhaust.  For asian wok cooking plus propane burners, a lot of exhaust CFM is recommended, but if you adapt to an induction stove and pan, your venting needs are reduced.\n\nUS (I'm assuming you are in US) Fed credit is 26% and you will have state and local incentives so that helps, but yeah you're basically trading variable rate utility opex for capex that will not change over time. There was talk of increasing the fed credit to 33% in the Build Back Better Bill but republicans are blocking passage in Congress until further notice. External stressors and macroeconomic factors like pandemic, war, OPEC politics, and other factors out of anyone's control will largely determine the next decade's energy prices. \n\nAlso read r/geothermal and r/hvacadvice","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.04885990667510972,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09940471469114225,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.05220685247286383,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09518980672312183,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3778483051624208,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.046442073148985706,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.007982723414897919,"ev_1":-0.1863848272815254,"ev_2":-0.29102325174611066,"ev_3":-0.1750038448468937,"ev_4":-0.24434480797693206,"ev_5":-0.025635263562432915,"ev_6":-0.10937986654209333},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.

What I like and dislike in my installation, for my usage pattern:\n\n* I should have chosen 48V instead of 24V. I regularly get &gt;100A on battery cables in an engine room, that's best avoided if you can: a vibration-induced loose connection can heat up very fast. For my couple of 24V appliances I could have used a DC/DC converter. Even better, I could have used 48-&gt;12V rather than 48-&gt;24V, as 12V gear is easier to find and cheaper. Also, converters can be put closest to the consumer, so you need only ¼ the wire gauge for the same intensity: it matters for motors, e.g. in pumps. Finally, in a few years, there're likely to be very atttractive, drop-in LiFePo replacements for 48V lead batteries, but probably not fr 24V (because sane people avoid high DC intensities whenever they can; even electric bikes are giving up on 24V batteries).\n\n* I had flooded batteries similar to what you're looking at (mine were from Crown IIRC). It sucked, because they  can't push high intensities unless they're really full: with 75% of remaining capacity, they struggled to push 1kW to the coffee machine in the morning. Moreover, they need to be fully recharged regularly, and it takes &gt;12h: end of charge is a slow, loooong trickle, longer than a sunny summer day. So either you run your genset all night for a 200W trickle charge or you ruin your batteries. I switched from 430Ah open to 210Ah AGM, and it's _much_ more comfortable, I have much more effective capacity. They're expected to last 7 years, but open batteries abused by solar panels won't last longer, and in 7 years I expect to have very attractive lithium-based solutions available.\n\n* I have a Victron MPPT, I'm happy with it. My problem isn't the total amount of solar watts hitting the panels, it's the number of hours of charging, i.e. the ability to start producing early in the morning, and to go on as late as possible. MPPTs are supposed to help with that, but I've never had a PWM so I can't compare.\n\n* If you have more room than a typical RV or leisure boat, high-end 230V equipments are more economic than RV stuff. My fridge + three-stars freezer uses less electricity than an RV mini-fridge. Germany, the country of serious engineering and of the €0.5 kWh, produces excellent stuff which wouldn't make sense in cheap electricity countries.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3158317043217937,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11641393545266965,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2315317558838987,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1705691635048466,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13961494893676038,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.31730105881412884,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3745572295350333,"solar_1":-0.13224477642952273,"solar_2":-0.22328352268567997,"solar_3":-0.2121795618290548,"solar_4":-0.10242242122189162,"solar_5":-0.04204385988293238,"solar_6":-0.07284500625882095,"solar_7":-0.30840958984966466,"solar_8":-0.20221118107413835,"solar_9":-0.2801272644876599,"solar_10":-0.17753865725171303},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

There may be a bit of additional silver in the bypass diodes, but 20 grams per panel strikes me as a bit high for 2018. \n\nHere’s where your task gets difficult: This is a rapidly moving target. 20 grams was probably spot on in 2016. The solar industry has been pretty aggressive about driving down silver consumption because it has historically been the second-highest-cost line on the bill of materials (behind silicon). This trend will continue, and there are already solar modules on the market that use less than 10 grams, though they are not yet the norm. \n\nThere is also a push to try to eliminate silver altogether, though that is a difficult task and so far only SunPower has had any commercial success in doing so. \n\nAs far as new solar technology goes, perovskites get the most press and there are many projects devoted to silicon/perovskite tandem cells (essentially two cells stacked atop one another). The main problems at the moment are that perovskites degrade rapidly when exposed to light, and the best perovskites for solar cells known to date contain significant amounts of lead. It is definitely plausible that we will see them in large-scale commercial deployment by 2030, but I wouldn’t bet my retirement savings on it. \n\nGraphene for solar cells is way too early in development to make any predictions about it. \n\nThe main limit to scale is not materials, but dispatchability — we often need electricity when the sun isn’t shining. Low-cost storage is widely viewed as the answer to that, and if it comes in the form of Li-ion batteries then availability of cobalt — especially ethically sourced cobalt — could be a problem.

If so, you should check out the [U.S. Department of Energy's American Made Challenges Solar Prize](https://americanmadechallenges.org/solarprize/round3.html) program. \n\nThe American-Made Solar Prize is a $3 million prize competition designed to revitalize U.S. solar innovation and manufacturing through a series of contests: \n\n\\- **Stage 1: Ready!** (20 winners, $50,000 each)\n\n\\- **Stage 2: Set!** (up to 10 winners, $100,000 each and $75,000 in vouchers to work with National Labs and private facilities.) \n\n\\- **Stage 3: Go!** (2 winners, $500,000 each and $75,000 in vouchers) \n\nThe competition is run in Rounds (ex: Round 1, Round 2, etc.) and each round has it's own Ready!, Set! and Go! competitions. Right now, Round 3 Ready! is open for [new applications thru December 10th](https://www.herox.com/solarprizeround3).  \n\nThe coolest thing about the prize IMO is that any prize money you win comes with no strings attached. If you know anything about Government funding, you know that it can often come with lots and lots of red tape but with the Solar Prize, if you win you get to decide how you want to use the funding.  In fact, one of our [Round 1 winning Go! teams](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2019/first-ever-american-made-solar-prize-concludes-awards-round-1-winners-phase-3-photovoltaics-solar-inventions.html) said \"$500K of completely flexible prize funding is more valuable than $2M of restricted grant funding\".  \n\nLet us know if you have any questions - we're here to help! \n\nPS - check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE1idCSIBk-jmiH-78fw9rw) to see and hear from our Round 1 teams and learn more about the prize.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007295394704366723,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23448632476025855,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16388091417984393,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16013578136698095,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23944529213890506,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25537192578042817,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0740913670694378,"solar_1":-0.12377698061268545,"solar_2":-0.19416860496479074,"solar_3":-0.004822545614539801,"solar_4":-0.0044004069077345775,"solar_5":-0.0028732409919030033,"solar_6":-0.001052896682570766,"solar_7":-0.001877487494008771,"solar_8":-0.004452228766240296,"solar_9":-0.004124683405583103,"solar_10":-0.023637905653231428},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Do you know which inverter you have? There are a number of si23 models. Here is a [longer manual](https://www.cfptechnologies.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Veichi-si23-solar-pump-inverter-manual.pdf). \n\nDo you know how your 22 solar panels are electrically connected? (how many in series and how many series strings in parallel) \n\nWhat pump are you using? \n\nWhen you have a problem with inverter does the keypad display show an error code? The error code will help you pinpoint the potential problem. \n\nAs far as programming the inverter to only use some grid electricity- do you know this is a feature of this inverter? I read over the website and installation manual a bit but didn't see this as an advertised feature. If you think it is, you might want to [contact the Veichi via their website](https://www.veichi.org/product/solar-water-pump-inverter/si23-solar-pump-inverter.html). \n\nIf the inverter is not able to be programmed to limit grid usage, you may want to consider installing an inline timer between the grid and the inverter. The timer could be set to turn on at say, 8am and turn off at 10pm. That would at least be a way to limit how often the inverter is able to pull from the grid. A timer used for a pool may do the trick here.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001432342930153633,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10450317175350392,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19409976216653982,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09205845122536023,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2955561201742804,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3127146974850948,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.024040823123262573,"solar_1":-0.08400278915360104,"solar_2":-0.05567302649433259,"solar_3":-0.011954253750445787,"solar_4":-0.014979609438645033,"solar_5":-0.002095364308236943,"solar_6":-0.01624324098035383,"solar_7":-0.13807705712194243,"solar_8":-0.005992234724544687,"solar_9":-0.05441005847387714,"solar_10":-0.38063714901606244},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (no possessive and not a specific social group mentioned)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

So barring any really unusual weather patterns that accounts for both the high production in summer and lower production in winter.\n\nSolar degradation is also a thing. Which means your panels became slightly less efficient over time. Your panel warranty should actually include an acceptable solar degradation threshold. \n\nSo it’s definitely a good idea to oversize your system a bit to cover whatever may come. But right now you’re 65% over which is a lot. IF last year represented a normal year of usage for you (no long vacations, etc) then that amount would not be used without some major addition to how you use electricity for your home.\n\nWe’re very lucky in NYC because we have so much covered by incentive that if you want to go excessively over a bit then your cost is not as high as it would be elsewhere, but it’s good to be aware of.\n\nThink of net metering basically like this. With ConEd you have a full one to one net metering agreement. Which means every kwh your solar system produces you will get full value for. All the excess you produce in the summer will roll over into the winter months. That’s already included in your yearly estimate for production.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004092737411459287,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19006811617049196,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1941308474444262,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2279881195475658,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3230695107215432,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3208511291507658,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18526545694718757,"solar_1":-0.17307736784071132,"solar_2":-0.16816249082118825,"solar_3":-0.12039244911492375,"solar_4":-0.09697499960201546,"solar_5":-0.08481789591417313,"solar_6":-0.012556912314418392,"solar_7":-0.09735104600258637,"solar_8":-0.18578958009311464,"solar_9":-0.13600913213034752,"solar_10":-0.21952037310875608},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

The remainder is absorbed as heat or reflected away.\n\nBlack roofs, common in colder climates, absorb even more energy than solar panels! While white roofs absorb less solar energy than panels. But a good chunk of the reflected light ends up as planetary heat anyway due to the thickness of our atmosphere and reflective properties of water vapor (humidity, clouds). So these effects are minimal and would be quickly balanced out by increased outgoing infrared radiation into space (hotter objects give off more infrared radiation).\n\nAt least that’s what would happen if not for the actual cause of global warming: CO2 reflects infrared radiation much better than other gases in our atmosphere and the earth loses much more energy via infrared radiation than it receives.

Some animals are not even close to domesticated and keeping a wild animal as a pet is going to be torture for them. Cats are believed to have evolved to get along with humans after seeking out human settlements, where there were rats and doves for them to feed on. This is unlike dogs that were domesticated from wolves basically for our benefit. Some animals need a great deal of company for their well-being , rabbits are among them, and hence it's a good idea to keep more than one if you cannot spend a huge amount of time with them. \n\nAs for whether it is ethical to keep pets, my take on it is that it depends a heck of a lot on your attitude towards them. If you're going to do so you ought to be prepared to treat them like another family member. I'd also definitely get one from a shelter if I were to keep a pet. After all if I'm going to basically adopt an extra family member then why not pick one that needs a home ? \n\nThe greatest challenge imo is how to properly care for a carnivorous animal. While some cats manage on special vegan cat-food that has been reinforced with many nutrients, it's not going to be the case for all of them. I also doubt there's special vegan-food for all animals.

You're human. Our minds and our beliefs are ever evolving and responding to what's around us. No one here knows what this past year has been like for you, except you. \n\nYou do have a choice in front of you. Of course, seeing that this is a vegan community it's obvious which choice we would encourage. But in the end these decisions are up to you. Spend some time with your own thoughts, maybe do some journaling, and see what feels right to you.\nBefore anything else, we have to take care of ourselves.\n\nIf you do decide to stay vegan, then as others suggested maybe try seeking out local vegan groups.
