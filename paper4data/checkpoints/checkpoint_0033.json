Buying a car which gets 300 miles on EV rarely makes sense, why haul all that extra battery when on average, you won't do more than 50 miles a day or so.",

"comment": "For current Model S owners? Certainly. Current vehicle sales are a very small tip of the iceberg.\n\nFor future vehicles, including Gen III? Potentially.\n\nThe cost to Tesla is very small. I estimate at 120 kW my driving needs strictly at Supercharger stations would require 20 to 30 half hour charges per year. At national average rates (Tesla will surely do better) of $0.115/kWh, that costs Tesla $138 to $207 per year.\n\nSome number of charging stations will self-charge from solar with a very large storage battery. It's possible that these stations could be self-funded through operating additionally as grid storage facilities; but they will also be significantly more expensive to set up.\n\nTesla can bury the installation, maintenance and marginal energy costs in the purchase price of the car, in the supercharger upgrade, or perhaps include them as part of a maintenance agreement. They can also charge an annual fee or a per-charge fee. There's a variety of ways to structure the costs - but consumers ultimately **will** pay for the electricity used.\n\nTesla has, to date, been very careful to explicitly say the Model S when talking about lifetime free charging. Musk is less cautious [here](http://vimeo.com/66853584), but he's also talking somewhat informally.",

If we'd had to stop for 22 minutes every 130 miles, that would've been 14 or 15 stops, and 7 hours, apart from the places of interest. Oddly enough, I don't count a Tesla charging station as a place of interest. I'm just not that much of a geek or a cultist. Not to mention that Tesla will *never* in my lifetime install its Potemkin charger network where we went.\n\nThat thing is no \"road trip car,\" unless what you call a \"road trip\" is a couple hundred miles down a California interstate highway, in which case I pity a lot more than the $105,000 hole in your bank account. The day will come when EV batteries get 1,000 or more bad-weather miles on a charge, and there are megawatt chargers all over the place in what are now gas stations, squirting 500 miles at a time in 10 minutes. \n\nAnd when that day comes, I don't think \"Tesla,\" or any successor, will be anywhere to be seen.

"comment": "I assume he's talking about the entry-level 40 kWh Model S, billed as $50k after rebates ($57.5k actual price).\n\nTesla cancelled the 40 kWh Model S in April 2013, claiming that only 4% of pre-orders were for the 40 kWh model. They fulfilled existing orders by delivering a 60 kWh Model S that was software-limited to 40 kWh, which was in some ways better (virtually immune to battery degradation, more powerful, faster 0-60) and some ways worse (heavier, likely somewhat less efficient) than the original car.\n\nThe 40 kWh Model S could be software-upgraded to 60 kWh, and after doing so could also be software-upgraded to enable Supercharging.\n\nThe least expensive Model S currently available is the 60 kWh Model S, which starts at $70k before rebates.\n\nLast year Tesla stated the $35k target price was without considering any available tax credits. We'll see what happens then they actually arrive. Keep in mind the $7500 federal tax credit will phase out after Tesla has sold 200k vehicles that have qualified for the credit.\n\n&gt;Barclays Capital – Question about $35,000 price point – before or after tax credits?\n&gt;\n&gt;Deepak Ahuja (CFO):  The $35,000 does not assume that the $7,500 federal tax credit is no longer available,  but that the 35,000 Tesla Gen 3 pricing is without any subsidy.\n&gt;\n&gt;Elon Musk:  Helpful to have credits, but Tesla is not counting on them.\n\nhttp://insideevs.com/highlights-from-teslas-2nd-quarter-qa/",

They probably overplay the certainty of climate change and the damage it will have, \n\nThat's very astute.  It's this \"overplaying\" that has driven so much skepticism in the first place.\n\n&gt;I agree that we don't know everything and can't predict how bad things will get. \n\nI think this is the key aspect I take umbrage with when activists tell us how settled the science is.  You are correct, we don't know.  I won't rule out the possibility that things could be bad.  I think there are reasonable policy responses to that kind of uncertainty, and they should be discussed.\n\n&gt;I guess it's less depressing, for me at least, to know that the climate won't change significantly. \n\nI'm glad of that.  I do think that part of the problem in discussing the issue is that people on both sides become emotionally invested.  That leads to lashing out, which only further distances the parties involved.\n\n&gt;However, in the back of my head, there is slight doubt. I can't claim to be an environmental steward, and quite frankly I emit just as much carbon as everyone else. The only thing I try to do now is very little. \n\nI think those who want to take action are often well intentioned, but I think they often don't understand just how little changes in daily living actually contribute to their overall goals.  If the goal is to reduce CO2 emissions, then people will need to get their heads around the fact that it will take decades to really reduce emissions.  People like actions that result in immediate benefit, and there just aren't that many choices people can make that will result in much reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\n&gt;Let everything play out, because I honestly think that while the Earth is resilient, we can be too. \n\nI very much agree.\n\n&gt;I try to make small changes, but I'm not going to try and convince anyone anymore.\n\nMaybe I can make some recommendations.  Feel free to accept or reject them as  you like:\n\n- If your goal is to really reduce CO2 emissions, you might consider calling out the big ENGOs (like Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, etc.) on their ill-informed energy policy recommendations.  Follow [James Hansen's advice](http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2014/10/11/james-hansen-climate-change-speaking-truth-power/17118625/): \"It is not always easy to speak truth to power, but all citizens have the opportunity if they choose. I have one minor, easy suggestion for you to consider, and another requiring more effort.\nThe first concerns \"Big Green,\" the large environmental organizations, which have become one of the biggest obstacles to solving the climate problem. After I joined other scientists in requesting the leaders of Big Green to reconsider their adamant opposition to nuclear power, and was rebuffed, I learned from discussions with them the major reason: They feared losing donor support. Money, it seems, is the language they understand. Thus my suggestion: **The next time you receive a donation request, doubtless accompanied with a photo of a cuddly bear or the like, toss it in the waste bin and return a note saying that you will consider a donation in the future, if they objectively evaluate the best interests of young people and nature.**\"\n\n- Inform yourself as much as you can about both climate science and energy policy.  You'll find hucksters that try to take advantage of worried people.  If you are informed, you can call bullshit when people tell you that X or Y is the only solution to the climate change problem.\n\n- Don't assume people whose opinion differ from your own are uninformed.  That was your mistake in your submission today.  I get that you want to change the world, but as my reaction shows, it's not a great way to get people to see your point of view.\n\n- This is a big one: recognize that there will be common ground with those people who do disagree with you.  Maybe they are less concerned about global warming than you are, but maybe they take issue with pollution from coal plants.  Maybe they aren't fans of oil companies, or see these resources as limited.  The will support many of the same policies as you.  For example, a few regulars here drive hybrid vehicles or electric cars.  Several have solar panels on their houses.  You can change your whole experience with everyone you meet if you look for common ground.\n\n- Finally, be careful who you promote.  As I've pointed out with John Cook, there are some bad characters who promote alarmisms.  Cook, Al Gore, Michael Mann, Phil Jones, Peter Gleick, and others are people I wouldn't want on my side regardless of whether they agreed with me or not.   There are people on the other side of the debate who are just as bad.  Be careful who you choose to promote.",

I've had the same opinion for a few months now but I live in Paris: high population density, frequent pollution peaks, and many clean alternatives (autolib, velib, metro...). I don't understand why most Parisians tolerate an oil-based transportation system in such a big and well-equipped city. I hope the mainstream thinking will change swiftly in the coming years, as Tesla pushes the industry to offer \"ok\" EVs.",

You'll make your commute every morning cold, as they're super slow to heat up with no engine block to steal heat from and never really get toasty warm.\n\n2. The batteries have degraded so fast over the years people have owned Leafs thus far, that in the next 5-6 years you planned on keeping the Accord, a used Leaf will probably need a $6K+ battery replacement to maintain the range for your commute.\n\nIf you're truly happy with driving the Accord another 60K miles, then that's probably a better financial move. The $12-15K you're not spending buying a Leaf and replacing its battery in a few years would cover a lot of maintenance on the Honda.\n\nSo it comes down to, \"am I really asking this because I *want* to drive an electric car and need justification\"?",

Its possible if it wasn't for Tesla there would be no Bolt.\n\nThe problem is watching GM try to fight Tesla by ~~bribing~~ lobbying state officials to keep them out of the marketplace.  These kinds of tactics make people like me willing to wait a few more months for a Tesla, not to mention the super charging, auto pilot, and other 21st century features and NOT having to deal with dealership bullshit.\n\nBut with that being said- even as a Tesla fanboy with two on pre-order-- I am happy to see a REAL ev hit the roads, I hope it is successful and pushes Honda and Toyota to get some skin in the game.",

Even then, they will not be able to deliver enough power for your tractor, plus they will degenerate quickly.\n\nI would have chosen an already existing battery system. There are Tesla Model S P85 modules available for about 1450$ for 5,3kWh. Alternatively, you can choose Tesla Smart modules, 690$ for 3kWh. Both of these are proven, have already driven in a car and are ready to install - including everything prepared for a BMS.\n\nWhere I see the problem with your project is the BMS. For self-configured battery systems, it is a pain in the ass to find a BMS that doesn't let your cells explode, disintegrate, become too hot, or prevent anything else like under/overvoltage fail.\n\nJust my 0,02€.",

"comment": "&gt;Did they also make 2 versions with under 4 seconds acceleration time? They did.\n\nBut that is the point. They probably can't to what they promised in the time frame they promised to the price they promised.  \n&gt;Also, who is stopping Daimler from making a 1000 km range heavy truck and sell it for $300000?\n\nYou know developing and testing a car and even a truck is really expencive. So when they would bring out a 3M$ truck no one would buy one and all the money is lost.  \nMy guess would be that it's a mixture of price and kg/kwh.  \nBut I guess we'll see in 2019 or 2020 if Tesla is able to do it or if someone else is faster.  \n\n&gt;It's like telling me in 2010 that Nissan launched a 20 kWh Leaf ahead of the 85 kWh Model S.\n\nWhich one is currently selling better world wide? The Nissan leaf or Tesla model S.  \nBoth are in different segments the Mercedes one is more of a local truck for delivery of bakeries, supermarkets and other businesses in the city. It's probably even a bigger market than the long haul one. \n\nT",

My comment is exactly the sort of comment that is directed towards anyone who spreads misinformation about BEVs but somehow it's accepted by FCEVs. It's absurd. I do accept I was little strong. \n\nSMR is a significant reduction in co2 output over gasoline vehicles, removes local nox/pm emissions and offers opportunity for carbon capture. As a transition technology, it's a pretty good one.\n\nIm a proponent of nuclear power, but the present suggests that's not the way things are likely to go. Cost overruns and general anti-nuclear sentiment bordering on hysteria make it unlikely in my view. If nuclear power became the majority, I agree BEVs make more sense economically, since the price of electricity will be more constant.\n\nVehicle to grid is something I struggle with. It's interesting, but there are tradeoffs. The economics of using a car battery to balance the grid aren't clearly in favour, especially with the constraint of expectations of passenger vehicles. People expect their personal car to be a dispatchable form of transport, ie fully charged whenever they might want it.\n\nThe fundamental difference between using demand response of centralised electrolysis is that wholesale electricity prices are more relevant. These prices are already routinely negative, so a constant demand for electricity would stabilise prices, giving value to renewable generators, as well as to hydrogen producers. \n\nOn the other hand, residential electricity prices are what's relevant for BEVs. That's a huge difference in most countries. Centralisation of storage (and indeed generation) is much more efficient, both in energy and financially",

Let's try to stay on-topic here.\n\nI stated that the current Audi charges more slowly than the future Model Y, and I put into perspective what that difference looks like. It's nothing like \"2 hours vs. 6 hours,\" but y'all somehow seem to be unable to grasp my point and keep trying to change the subject.\n\nIf we want to have a real conversation about Model Y charge time vs. a non-Tesla, then let's just wait until the Model Y exists, and then we can compare what's actually on the market. My money is going to be on a Tesla competitor, likely something based on the Taycan platform, but we're all free to speculate, aren't we?",

"comment": "I'm a builder and renovator with experience in this area. You can definitely go all electric. You don't have to have battery backup as it's less expensive to stay connected to the grid. (and the grid actually needs people like you!). However some sort of backup power can be useful. My friend in Westchester county did not have power for a week after that storm in August. He said the worst part was the constant noise of gas powered generators. Then a few people died of carbon monoxide poisoning from the generators. So maybe you do want to get a battery. Not sure if Con-Ed is going to switch over to demand pricing but that makes a battery more attractive.\n\nAs for your renovation, insulation and air sealing is key (but you could go all electric even with normal insulation) to long term savings and comfort. Improper indoor humidity levels are almost always a product of improper air sealing. If you do it right you'll want an ERV or mechanical ventilation. The better your insulation and air sealing the less you will spend on panels and energy. For what you are doing it almost always pays for itself quickly. If you can not get to the outside sheathing you can do flash and bat insulation or even Aeroseal. Aeroseal is a little pricey but they kind of guarantee a tight house. Flash and bat and a good blower door test is cheaper.\n\nThen your biggest demand besides HVAC is going to be hot water heater and dryer. It's worth it to get heat pump versions of those in the long run. Eventually we will all be driving electric cars which is another big draw.\n\nThen for your heat pump you need a backup heat source. Usually it electric resistance coils in the blower but you can also opt for natural gas backup. In a properly insulated house that will only turn on if the temperature is 5 degrees over days at a time. People will tell you to get a gas hot water heater but the numbers say that it's only cheaper in the short run. Solar + electric is cheaper. Maybe you even want an Induction cooktop. Those are sweet.\n\nThe real key to all of this and where you have to make sure you stand your ground is to tell the contractor he has to pass a blower door test. 3 to 5 air exchanges per hour is code for new construction. 1.6 (I think) is passive house standard. It's hard to achieve but makes everything better. If you wait until drywall and you fail there is no fixing it.\n\nGood luck! Having a net zero house is magic! I have one. It's totally the future. In 2-1/2 years I have not put 13 tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Our house is a constant 75 in the summer and 70 in the winter. I rarely touch the thermostat. Fresh air inside. Utility bills are $10/month connection fee but we get back SREC credits. It's one of the best places to put your money and it helps your kids if you have them. Children are keen judges of hypocrisy.",

Another small reason is equipment needs to travel further from the port and big distributors, and finally there is simply less competition. You dont have the same residential grind in CO and even Tesla seems to be slightly higher. There is also only one major solar distributor in Denver. All of these things are relatively small, but they add up to a maybe \\~20 cents more per Watt.",

Will electrical inspectors approve it?\n\nPrior to 2014, the National Electrical Code required every charging station to be provisioned on a dedicated circuit rated for 100% of the station’s electrical service capacity; oversubscription of electrical service was not permitted. However, EV charging stations don’t need full power when they’re not in service or when EVs are plugged in but not charging, so the National Electrical Code added a provision in 2014 to allow EV charging stations (also called electric vehicle supply equipment, or EVSE) to use “an automatic load management system” to manage the load on the stations. ChargePoint station installations using Power Management will be approved in states that have adopted the 2014 National Electrical Code (most states have), which allows oversubscription in Provision 625.41.\n\nChargePoint stations are also UL Listed as energy management devices, which validates the safety of the system and helps gain approval from inspectors. Our solutions engineering team will develop site specifications to share with electrical inspectors for approval.

"comment": "&gt;They do not need to be that big.\n\nGuna partly disagree with you there. \n\n1) Agreed. And this is really the elephant in the room. The gap is enormous, since only a fraction of non-Tesla EVs sold in the US are even capable of CCS DC Fast Charging and even less would be likely to use it due to either slow charging or limited range. For instance, in 2019 Tesla sold 192K DC Fast charging capable BEVs in the US, everyone else sold a combined 37K (excludes CHAdeMO). \n\n2) True, but misleading. Most people would trade three 1 or 2 stall 50kW stations for a single 8-stall 150kW+ station. That's because while you might be more limited on locations, the smaller stations are less reliable and more likely to be occupied. Hints the need for networks like EA. Now if DCFCs were like gas stations, where any station was basically as good as the next, I'd agree. But the gap between your average CCS station and the average Tesla station is just way too big right now.\n\n3) That's true, but it's not the crutch you make it out to be. If the CCS network was always better/bigger, then sure. But it hasn't been and still isn't, so Tesla was going to be forced to build out their Supercharger network regardless of whether they used CCS or not. \n\nAnd the advantage for Tesla that you're missing is that they know the cars they charge will nearly all be capable of very fast charging. This means they can build out far fewer stalls to support their customers. For instance, it's a much bigger burden for EA to support charging a Bolt's from 10% to 80% than it is for a Supercharger to support charging a Model 3 LRs since the Model 3 LR will stop less often and charge more than twice as fast.",

My bad, very rational of you. \n&gt;The point was humans are omnivores, no follow up needed. It was in contrast to the shaming of people who eat fish. \n\nThere is clearly a follow up needed, being an omnivore does not mean you need to eat fish, and it has nothing to do with anything being said. You obviously meant to make a point. My examples about what that point might be  making were because you were clearly defending eating fish witch implies being an omnivore to you justifies killing, and destroying the enviornment. My third example is because you are too much of a coward to actually say your point to open it to challenge.\n\n&gt;You’re a very hostile bunch and a group of hypocrites. I sure hope you don’t drive a car that isn’t 100% electric because that’s not vegan. I also hope when you’re vegan you don’t eat avocados, almonds, melons, kiwi, or butternut squash in the US because that would be hypocritical.\n\nWe are hypocrites because we might do things which you assume are against our beliefs because once again you can't tell the difference between other peoples points and your random thoughts?\n\nKilling fish isn't comparable to killing chickens but eating an avocado is? I honestly can't tell if you are a troll or just can't form a coherent thought.",

I think Hyundai needs to price the IONIQ 5 well to compete with the ID4 and Mach-E, but that means it would be very close to the current MSRP of the Kona. So if Hyundai expects to sell the Kona after the IONIQ 5 is available they should be dropping the price even lower.",

Which is much better than Tesla’s approach for 2 reasons. First is ease of use, you can have all your driving assists and speed in your gauge and leave the rest to the screen to have a easier view of everything and less confusion. Second is that it’s a sign of luxury and commitment. When you’re charging 40k plus for a car you need to make sure it lives up to the price, that’s luxury car territory. Having a gauge cluster and a good one represents that the automakers cares enough to not cut a cost there. More buttons and features let’s you see how good the car is and gives it a different feel. Tesla’s minimalism is something but it’s not luxury.",

Very similar to what we have now, just with less swing (ie, $7000+ off new cars, $10k markup). Instead, for that yearly release just like Apple the car is going to go up in cost, or stay the same but include less. A manufacturer direct to consumer sold vehicle is not going to reach points where they’re losing money to sell it. MSRP or bust. \n\nDealers are not worried about EVs. Who should be worried are small independent shops. These cars are going to become very technical and will require a more scientific approach to repairs. It will become difficult to bring your car to anyone other than the manufacturer service center(ie tesla). That small shop will not have the tools or the know how.",

I have yet to see an EV (including the 2000 horsepower supercar Rimac) beat a top performance ICE. 0-60 is held by ICE, 1/4 mile is held by ICE, 1/2 mile is held by ICE, nurburgring lap time is held by ICE, braking performance is held by ICE, Laguna Seca is held by ICE, Formula 1 is dominated by ICE, top fuel dragsters are dominated by ICE, etc.\n\n\n2. EV charging infrastructure is not even close to please the average person. Gas stations are just more convenient regardless of the Tesla fan Bois showing videos of how charging is better because you can watch YouTube. But if I'm filling up, I don't need to watch YouTube.\n\n\n\n3. The technology is not there and it probably won't happen in our lifetime. Fuel is 105x MORE dense than lithium ion batteries. Fuel is 90x more dense than even the supposedly upgraded solid state batteries.\n\n\n\n4. Road trips\n\n\n\n5. Car enthusiasts. These people like to work and modify their cars. Hear their engine, etc. How do you customize or modify an EV for either power or cosmetics? You can't unless it's a wrap or wheels. Which is why you see more Teslas with wraps than any other car.\n\n\n\n6. Cold weather\n\n\n\n7. Car companies make much more profit selling ICE believe it or not. They meet the minimum requirements for EV production, then the rest goes to ICE.\n\n\n\n8. Damn oil companies have too much power.\n\n\n\n9. Unrealistic with anything larger than a pick up truck. If a Porsche sports car weighs 5200 lbs, how much would an electric semi truck weigh? Yeah not going to happen.\n\n\n\n10. A lot of people could care less about ICE or EV. They just want a car.",

Hybrids replacing ICEs now is good now, but if the lifetime of those cars is say 12 years on average and you could ramp up lithium mining in &lt;6 years to replace with a BEV instead at that point, the comparison then should be between 12 years of a hybrid OR &lt;6 years ICE and &gt;6 years BEV. In that case (using Pratt's own conservative numbers) the ICE and BEV case comes out ahead! And that assumes a BEV doesn't last longer than a hybrid which I bet it does.",

Keep in mind most of the rooftop solar is being installed in places like California and Hawaii where everything costs more.  Utility solar is going in places that have much lower cost of doing business.  Also, cost of rooftop solar may be skewed by the large leasing companies that over-inflate the cost to get a larger tax credit.",

I also do math and compare to other sources of electricity. I try to find the cost of projects, the output, adjust for capacity factor, and compare. \n\nThe one in the image was part of a 10 school project, the largest of its kind, although every single one of the schools in my town, well over 60 of them, have fairly large solar installations on their grounds, almost all of them parking lot canopies. Also in the area is the largest solar thermal, the first modular solar power tower, a couple of projects using concentrated solar, the first parking lot wind project, the first Costco to put rooftop solar, the largest area of photovoltaics in progress as we comment,, possibly the largest wind resource area in the world, which was definitely the first large scale wind project. \n\nCalifornia had a lot of pumped storage, is putting in more or upgrading, has upgraded or installed on demand natural gas fired plants to deal with the intermittencies of the wind and solar.  Yeah, I kinda know how it all works, and am very interested in the maths behind it all.",

"comment": "Kind of tacky to go to the press before the article in PiP online, but it is an impressive, and important, number. They are using the \"spectral splitting\" approach: the light is first concentrated as in normal CPV, and then before arriving at the solar cell it is passed through / reflected by a series of dichroic filters, that physically seperate the different wavelengths onto different solar cells, each of which can optimally convert that subband. Its an interesting way to get high efficiencies, but it is doubtful that the added complexity, compared to multijunction cell, will be worth it in terms of cost.\n\nIf anyone is wondering why this 40% number is considered higher than the 46% world record efficiency that was reported last week, it is because that was for the solar cell only, not for a concentrator module using them (which would have optical losses).* This number presumably is for a sort of module or system, including optical losses. Although those 46% cells could be built into a module with 85% optical efficiency and produce 40% module level DC efficiency. We will probably see that result next summer.\n\n'* And if you just put that cell outside in the sun it wouldn´t produce 46%, those cells are more efficient at 100s of sunpower than in normal light.",

"comment": "It's massive, massively expensive, yet the output is absolutely humbling if you are or were pro solar, then add to it having to deal with the intermittencies.\n\nThe ten school project, which I like to use because it was recently completed, I got to watch it, and one of them is right down the street from me, cost $52,000,000. \n\nEach school has about 15 canopies, with all of them together having around 40,000 Trina Solar monocrystalline panels, so top of the line.  It's rated at 9.6, which means in best case scenario, and that won't happen, is less than 2  MW after adjustment for capacity factor. \n\nObscurity could be as much as 50%, because no practical way to clean them when they're spread out like that, and atop some 150 canopies. In any case, they're going to be obscured to the point of significant degradation due to the nature of weather in a dry desert.\n\n Nuclear power plants have 2 to 6 reactors. Nameplate on one  European pressurized reactor is 1600 MW,, and most plants have more than one. Most existing US reactors generate 1100 to 1400  per single reactor, and most plants have two. Canada's Darlington Ontario plant has 4 reactors each generating over 800 MW. All can operate at 90 to 100 percent nameplate.\n\nGrand Coulee dam has a nameplate of 6,800 MW, although like most hydro, the capacity factor is much less, 35% in the case of Grand Coulee. \n\nWorld's largest solar is south of me and has a nameplate of 392 MW, but a capacity factor of 30%, so less than 1/3 of nameplate, but that's quite a bit better than solar PVs less than 20% capacity factor, and most utility scale plants have a weekly or biweekly washing regimen.",

"comment": "The main reason we are finally making big progress on renewables is countries like Germany and China and parts of the US like CA are investing in it and so finally we are getting economies of scale in things like solar pv, something that we never had before, which has resulted in solar PV going from costing $4 a watt down to costing $1 a watt in just the last 5 years. Now those same market forces are turning to the grid storage problem and billions is funneling into R&amp;D on that front, we'll probably have good market options within 5-10 years in grid storage. \n\nNuclear gets the same zero emissions subsidies as wind and solar, it also gets other forms of subsidy as well. So if investors want to invest billions into more nuclear, i say go for it, but i think they will get their asses kicked with increasingly cheaper renewable tech over the next 5-10 years. And nuclear plants take forever to build.",

"comment": "I am a very DIY guy, but I think it's generally true that installers are a good idea for solar PV. It's frighteningly more complicated than just \"buy and install some expensive equipment\".  While I love working on my house, I would not have learned how to design the system and deal with permitting myself.\n\nAnd when I say \"design\", I don't mean \"figure out which panels and inverter I want\".  I mean a stack of architectural and electrical drawings for your AHJ. I mean getting engineering stamps on roof load calculations. I mean power justifications with your utility company.\n\nThe obvious parts are the easy parts. Any ol' schmoe can size their system with PVwatts.org, buy some equipment from solarpvgreenwarehouse.com, bolt it to their house, and wire it up. Honestly, those are easy and obvious parts.\n\nBut can you get your AHJ to permit the system and get your utility to accept an interconnection agreement? That's the hard part. That's the part that takes months to complete.\n\nIn my case, my girlfriend works at a prominent US solar company. If she didn't already know all the hard parts, we never would have gone DIY.",

Can I put PV panels on the roof and feed them directly into the switchboard? I dont want or need electricity at night and we will remain connected to the grid for rainy days. But is it technically possible or desirable to feed PV (via inverter) straight to the building switchboard without running it through a battery bank to stabilise the current?",

The Model S being projected to pass basically 40k units in 2016 is actually pretty significant volume for an individual model vehicle. \n\nIt's almost as many vehicles as Porsche sells in a year in the US across all their models combined. BMW sold 44,162 5 series cars last year in the US.\n\nHere is the [sales volume by manufacturer](http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2016/01/usa-auto-sales-brand-results-2015-calendar-year.html). Even if Model 3 only sold slightly more models in a year than the S and the X didn't exist Tesla would still sell more vehicles in a year than companies like Scion (56k), Mini (58k), Volvo (70k), Land Rover (70k), Mitsubishi (95k), and Lincoln (101k).\n\nThe point is I'm not sure they need to ship over 100k model 3's/year to be successful or mass market. Even that figure would put them at the volume of companies like Cadillac, Acura, and Audi.\n\nThose companies have other companies that support them but Tesla also has things like powerwall to offset sales volume of battery packs they can use to keep pack costs down.\n\nIt wouldn't be considered \"mass production\" but I think Tesla also has the opportunity to make a Roadster 2.0 and sell it with enough margin to support its own R&amp;D budget.\n\nThere are differing degrees of success and failure and if there is something people hate about the model 3 design I don't think it's their last shot at it.",

The tempered glass on modern panels is some very, very strong stuff, and you can't easily break it.  They're designed to sit outside, get pounded by hail, flying debris, and shrug it off.\n\nI don't think theft would be that big a concern for small panels, but just use some security screws or glue them down as well as screw them down.  The type of people who would climb on a boat to steal solar panels probably aren't the type of people who keep a full set of security bits in their backpack.",

"comment": "In my experience, you can get equivalent pricing on all-black modules if you are patient and separate out the material procurement from the install. Most installers who smush the design phase of the project into the construction side don't have the time or patience to find good pricing, and are wed to a particular manufacturer.\n\nAll-black panels look much better. Down the road, if you ever have to swap a module out, replacing failed panels won't be a big deal if they are all black. It can be very difficult to match the aesthetics if you go with traditional blue/white/silver.\n\nAny price difference should be in pennies per watt, and any heat difference should be in the 5W range. We're talking 1-2% performance. That can ring alarm bells in technophiles who love watts, but they don't know anything about real estate value.\n\nIncreasing your project cost by 1-2% and decreasing your module production by 1-2% will barely budge your simple payback. Having an ugly solar array on your roof, compared to an awesome looking solar array on your roof, will substantially impact your real estate value when it comes time to sell your home.\n\nAs they say, black never goes out of style.",

"comment": "Any inverter that connects to the grid has to be pure sine wave, as it has to sync up with the pure sine the grid is generating. \n\nThere are lots of ways to configure your system, depending on your priorities. For a battery backup system, in general, the solar will prioritize making sure the battery bank is full when the grid is up. So will the grid. Then any extra solar power will be used to power all of your loads, both critical and everyday. If you have any extra solar power after that, it will be sold back to the grid for credit. Once the grid goes down, the battery will provide energy for your critical loads, and your solar will recharge them during the day. Here's a couple of examples of a hybrid grid-tie battery backup solar system. https://www.altestore.com/store/solar-power-systems/grid-tie-solar-power-systems-with-backup-c568/",

Here in the UK, a large part of our network is not electrified, leaving diesel as the only choice at the moment.\n\n\nHydrogen could be the perfect swap in this situation vs electric / batteries.\n\n\nNow let's also talk about electricity generation and the duck curve. Night time and high solar generation periods, electricity could be used to generate hydrogen which can be stored for use later - meaning a more efficient (and cleaner) grid. Think of hydrogen as the equivalent of what Tesla is doing with battery storage.\n\n\nLastly, with trains, you only need to build a very few hydrogen filling stations.

Been up for over a year, and it slightly exceeded the initial estimate for production.\n\nIf anything, I’d think ground mount would be an improvement assuming no shading on the panels. It would allow you to adjust the angle slightly as well as get snow off the panels when necessary. My roof is high enough that it isn’t really feasible to get the snow off safely.\n\nBut even losing 2-3 weeks of production in 2018 due to snow covered panels, I still slightly overproduced. 11.88 kWh on a target projection of 11.7, 10.2 kW nameplate DC. I financed 10 years; paying about 10% more than my power bill was monthly; with the loan paid off my payback looks like ~11 years.",

"comment": "B4 taking the plunge, did you consider renting a M3 (Turo) for a few days to see if it fits your commute/lifestyle? \n\nIf you can afford the extended range model, I'd go all-in with fsd. Ap is already awesome. Last week, drove 70 miles on rural highway with no cell coverage. I was in the boonies. There was no map on the main console and ap handled the road smoothly all by itself. Also, get the dual motor option for winter driving. I considered the i3 but I didn't want to deal with winter driving with rear wheel drive although the range extender was appealing.\n\nI have solar panels. Helps to keep cost of electricity reasonable. Lower gas, higher electricity bill trade off. The EV will help with the payback period on the panels.\n\nYou said there's only one charger at work. What about simple wall charger? You get a decent charge over 8 - 10 hours. Won't cover full commute but it will help. You'd be impressed with the range if you can keep the car plugged in 22 hours of the day.\n\nHybrid wise, new Prius would be safe bet. I have a 100 mile commute. You can get a roof rack for the bike. What you should factor in is that you have oil changes every 5k miles and major maintenance every 10k miles for the Prius which is more than an oil change. Conversely, Tesla recommends servicing every 12k miles. Both can get expensive with your commute.\n\nFor the extended daily commute, I use a hybrid. I deal with semis too and in the winter, I always get rock chips. Easier to replace a conventional windshield than a m3 Windshield. In my mind, I've written off the cost of the hybrid through depreciation. The day I don't have the overly  long commute is the day I ditch gas.\n\nFor everything else, use an ev (preferably a new or used Tesla) for road trips, etc.\n\nI'm glad you're thinking about reducing your carbon footprint for your family. However, your move to hybrid/EV has to make sense for you. Otherwise, it will leave you with a bad experience. The switch should be a joyous one. Good luck!",

"comment": "&gt;  Tesla's wh/kg efficiency was at 202 wh/kg in 2018  \n\nThat's at module not cell level. High-energy 21700s are already at 270wh/kg\n\n&gt; While the supercapacitors have 40% less energy density than Tesla's batteries \n\nI've no idea where you've got this figure, but it's very very wrong. Supercaps are \\~5% of the energy density of high-energy lithium ion cells\n\n&gt; meaning they would be a good buffer to reduce latency in powerpack and powerwall usage, or even regenerative braking in high energy applications (i.e. Tesla Semi, or even Roadster). \n\nNo EV engineer ever advocates this method. Supercaps have such poor energy density that they're useless. It's a much better solution to use higher power cells.\n\n&gt;  This would reduce costs even further and allow Tesla to scale it's production more efficiently since it would vertically integrated \n\nWhy do people believe that vertical integration is cost-reducing. Most major Tier 1 suppliers were spun out from OEMs because the very opposite is true.",

Just look at the solar road debacles playing out all over the place. They were a total scam, officials fell for the marketing material, and then it turns out that the scientists that work on solar panels were totally right and putting PV cells on a road is foolish.\n\nIn fact, the second link sort of disproves the first. ORNL has a research project that was able to transfer 120kW with 97% efficiency. Which means there's no way that a commercial entity has a 200kW system with an equal or higher efficiency.",

Use the pv to pump water back up into the reservoir. This basically increases the potential energy stored in the dam reservoir without needing batteries or chemicals and uses existng infrastructure. Why use the potential energy of water once when you can use the water twice? Then shut down oil, gas and coal.  Or - sigh - 10B to buy an environmental congress. Sighs again.",

"comment": "&gt;Here's my ideas: Solar Panels = cheapest energy source now. Technology will get even better\n\nAnd what makes you believe, that even IF the consumers had a chance to switch that they had the time to inform themselves where to switch to solar power and other things?\n\nLike it's easy to say from the position of privilige \"just go vegan and don't drive a car and just ride an electric bike\". I mean I'm a veggie who doesn't drive a car at all and I am fairly priviliged compared to most workers of the world but even I am struggling to go vegan.\n\nIt also comes from a false point of optimism into a capitalist economy. It does not matter what the average person does, even if they could suddenly give up the little priviliges and freedoms they have (and that's why people are still all on about cars because it's theirs and they feel a little freedom inside of it under a socio-economic system which alienates them from their labour and removes freedoms on a regular basis) and everyone could just magically view into the production process the production will not change because it's cheap and will be financed by the government.\n\nYour arguments are not \"shitty\" or \"useless\", they just are classist. You can and should strive towards those goals but they will only bring about change if you also change it on a fundamental level. Start organising workers around you to overcome capitalism and to plan a sustainable economy.",

"comment": "What kind of farm, and where? In west Texas 60 acres supports about 10 cows on grass: the farm is your hobby and you have a day job. In East Texas I understand there is a lot more rain and so you can live off those cows on grass.  The above assumes pasture, land, but there are also feedlots.\n\nRegardless though, step one is contacting your local university extension office to figure out what they know.  They are a big resource and you don't want to invest a ton of money without making sure it is to make your ranch the best it can be.  Don't just build last year's seemingly good ideas when today we know something even better.\n\nLikewise step two is the same for everything: contact your utility.  State laws are for a small time homeowner.  If you want to install solar on your house, or a similar amount on a barn you are fine, but anything more than that and the utility will define you as a big producer and state laws want protect you.  Instead you need a contract with the utility.  They need to have some renewable energy that you can provide, you want to make sure they will continue to buy from you even if state law says they don't have to - that means a long term contract.  Note, the contact need not be with you - they might have a contract with some company that will lease your land for solar, the important part is legal fine print protects you from an investment that doesn't work out because the the rules change next year.\n\nIf you have pasture you live off of, then solar is only for the house or barn roof (if you have a barn..). While the numbers show you can cover a pasture with solar, and then use solar to power LEDs that emit only the light needed for photosynthesis, the numbers also show that this will cost far more than it ever returns.  You should look into wind power though - there is probably someone who wants to lease enough land to put a windmill on, they pay a surprisingly high rate.  (make sure you are dealing with the company building the windmill and not a broker - those middlemen often want to sign you a bad deal, while those building the windmills want a win-win)\n\nIf you have a feedlot things are different.  First, pave your entire lot over with a type of concrete that isn't too hard on the feet (your university will know), with a slope so that all manure runs to a methane digester to power a generator. This is your best bang for the buck as all the methane generator will run when power is expensive and so it worth for more than solar. When you pave the whole thing over add supports for solar panels. The shade will keep the temperature down and make the cows more productive for you.  One way to explain all this you are putting all the cattle in mono-slop sheds where the roof \"just happens\" to be designed at the ideal angle for solar.\n\nI suspect that the above will make some sense to other cattle farmers. I know just enough about cattle farming to be dangerous.",

"comment": "The bill also provides for a **$4,000 rebate on an electric vehicle purchase starting in July 2022**, which Pritzker said would be available to all Illinoisans, not just those in certain counties, as had been discussed during floor debate of the bill. \n\nThat could be clarified in follow-up legislation which lawmakers have said will be considered in the fall veto session to clean up portions of the nearly 1,000-page bill.\r  \n\r  \nThe law also **provides subsidies to convert coal-fired plants to solar or energy storage facilities at about $47 million annually starting in 2024**. That provision, according Hastings, will be a boon to downstate by helping “transition shuttered coal plants into state-of-the-art solar energy sites with world-renowned battery storage,” a provision aimed at boosting the reliability of otherwise intermittent resources such as wind and solar.\r  \n\r  \nEquity advocates said the law sets Illinois apart from other states by creating a **$180 million annual investment in clean energy workforce diversification programs**, as well as training programs aimed at providing the fossil fuel workforce with inroads into renewable energy.\r  \n\r  \nAmong many such provisions, the bill directs the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to create the Clean Jobs Workforce Network program, which **establishes 13 hubs in different communities across the state that rely on community-based organizations to provide job training and a career pipeline for equity-focused populations**.\r  \n\r  \nIt also establishes training programs for those recently leaving incarceration, and **creates a “Climate Bank”** within the Illinois Finance Authority ***to help fund renewable projects and a “Jobs and Justice Fund” aimed at ensuring “the benefits of the clean energy economy are equitably distributed.”***\r  \n\r  \nDelmar Gillus, a social equity advocate with Elevate Illinois, praised the equity provisions as “nation-leading.”\r  \n\r  \nAt the bill signing Wednesday, he explained how it would help those who, according to the bill, hail from areas where “residents have historically been excluded from economic opportunities” or have “historically been subject to disproportionate burdens of pollution.”",

To keep the AC going for 2 hours you will need about 2+kwh of lithium battery storage, or about 4kwh of lead-acid battery storage.  Even though this is /r/solar, you don't need to charge these batteries from solar, you could use an hybrid inverter without solar panels and let it charge the batteries from the grid when the power comes back on.  Or, if the outages are always during daylight hours, you could have solar panels and thus need less storage, perhaps just 1kwh of storage plus 600w of panels.  These would be an example of a hybrid inverter you could use: https://www.ginverter.com/Off-Grid-Storage-Inverters/44-593.html",

"comment": "What's really amazing about the Green New Deal advocates is that they are apparently ignorant of the amount of fossil fuels required to manufacture both wind turbines and solar panels. Both of these technologies are solely based on the non-renewable fossil fuels and the energy that makes the manufacturing of systems possible, without fossil fuels neither could be manufactured. \n\nWhat most people don't know is that every step in the production of solar photovoltaic power systems requires fossil fuels. From the carbon reductants, otherwise known as coal or charcoal, needed for smelting silicon from ore, to providing the heat and power for manufacturing, every step involves and requires the use of much more than a small amount of fossil fuels that can't be replaced with known  alternatives and I'm not even counting the intercontinental transportation of raw materials, or that which is needed for on-site deployment. \n\nThere is really only one renewable material used in the process and that is the huge amount of forest woodland and natural habitat that is needed to be cleared for the installation of these behemoths. \n\nBut that's not all, and you won't hear their advocates mentioning the fact that in addition to all mineral resources and fossil energy required for construction of  factories, manufacturing processing equipment, there's also the necessity of maintaining the manufacturing infrastructure itself. \n\nWe hear about the seen, but with any product there are also numerous unseen requirements; for that there are the silicon smelters, then there are refineries of polysilicon and of course there are the crystal growers, all of which require an uninterrupted power source that must run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and those power sources are primarily coal-fired generation plants and some uranium power plants. \n\nSo while the media pumps the propaganda for the politicians and the environmentalists making their grandiose claims that wind turbines and solar panel farms can somehow \"replace\" fossil fuels for the generation of electrical power for the world they fail, either through sheer ignorance or willful malice, to address the fact that their renewable fantasy is based on something other than reality.  \n\nThe really horrible fact is that this \"Biden Administration\" is going headlong with policies that will not only not work but produce as much emissions as Fossil Fuels because they actually require more of those Fossil Fuels than what would normally be produced if said  \"renewables\" were not being employed. \n\n• Chet M McAteer",

"comment": "Don’t know if 4% is the right number but it certainly adds some value as it’s basically a scheme to fix your electric price over the next 20-25 years. \n\nIt is far from a no-brainer as with any investment you have to consider the opportunity cost. Sure it might “save” you a few hundred dollars a month on your electric bill, but you likely paid many tens of thousands of dollars for those savings. \n\nAdd in the fact that solar panels are a depreciating asset that is worth $0 at the end of its useful life and you really need to consider all the facts. Basically it boils down to how much did you pay per watt of installed cost (systems over $3/watt will have difficulty netting a positive return - $2.50 or less is preferable), what is your current grid price, and how fast do you think prices will rise over the next 20 years?\n\nYou get wildly different results just tweaking the assumptions from 3-5% grid price increases per year. In almost all cases though, you’d do much better if you stuck to that install cost money into a cheap index fund.",

"comment": "Yes.  \n\nTo better understand the challenge for utilities, operators, and PUCs...imagine a scenario where there's just your home and your neighbor. just two homes to supply electricity.  \n\nThose two homes provide all the revenue for the utility.  Then one home gets solar, your home, or even you get solar+storage so you use very little power from the grid.  \n\nWith you on solar now the utility has lost half, and has to function effectively on one customer's worth of revenue.  but still has to have the ability to provide electrical service.  \n\nThey need the revenue from somewhere to keep the grid functional so they raise per kWh rates for everyone, but your neighbor is effectively the only customer so they're gettin the brunt of it.  The PUC recogizes this so later a fixed charge for you with solar ao your neighbor isn't shouldering it all.\n\nBut the utility has another problem, they have to balance how much they generate with how much is used.  You use it at night, or more often in summer when it's hot and like a cool house with A/C.  In particular if electrical demand grows or spikes it costs the utiliry more by a factor to produce that energy.  Or they have to invest in more generating capacity.  So they like when that you as a customer invests in solar or efficiency so that don't have to.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, there's an equity component.  In this same \"two customer\" scenario, imagine your neighbor doesn't have the money to afford solar or the space on their roof or property.  They're getting squeezed by the increasing rates, because you can afford to get solar or efficiency upgrades.\n\nAnd to add yet another in this scenario, imagine there's a third neighbor, but they rent the home, so they don't even have the option to get solar whether they can afford it or not.\n\nThe above is what happens but at an aggregate of thousands of customers. Just some of the issues utilities and PUCs face when solar+storage capacity grows.  They do want some customer investment but not too much, and when they fear it's too much, then come the fixed charges, reduced net metering, zero export rules, ad infinitum.\n\nA common refrain is \"why don't we all just get solar and batteries and fuck the utility\".  That's a slippery slope of of question, so gonna leave ot here.\n\nThink through the above and put yourself in utility's shoes and how would you manage it. \n\nps.  this is coming from someone that works in solar, in CA, and can't have solar on my home.  def not a utility shill",

Not a single term or requirement in the contract about the solar except by me in the counter. \"36 Solar Panel Array in the back does not convey and any lease take-over does not convey to the buyer (me).\" They agreed and signed. Our inspection is this Wednesday. So check this out, I found that the current owner doesn't even have a lease agreement with SunRun. The owner previous to this owner does and was unable to get the current owner to take over the lease. Abstract completed and no liens on the home title or property. According to the previous owner (The one before this current one who is selling to me, this guy took out a 25yr lease for the panels. Build a well and was hoping to make this place an off-Grid place. He did this beginning of 2021, COVID shut everything down, and he decided to sell the property for whatever reason.  Sold it, but the lease could not be transferred ot the new owner. He has been trying to get the new owners to take over the lease, but has been unsuccessful. (He has not reached out to me yet, and probably won't until inspection is done and we close.  The current owner basically says he has no place to put the panels, cannot afford to pay for them to be taken down and then transported, reassembled somewhere else, etc. Doesn't have the money to have SunRun come get them. Pays $130/mo and they are currently not turned on or operational right now.\n\n  \nI noticed SunRun is in dire financial stress. I am thinking if I close, that I will offer SunRun to continue to use my property for their panels at a rate of $300/week, or they can come get them and not pay a thing. (Which chances are they won't because it is a complete tear down and chances are they will not be used again, because you don't sell used panels or lease used panels to prospective leaseees, etc. After about 6 months of being pon my property I might be able to confiscate them as payment for the property they are using. Then maybe use them and build my own power wall for off-grid power. Thoughts? Ideas?",

"comment": "Ask for quotes, that can’t hurt. Reputable solar installers will have insurance and guarantee their work against any damage they may cause. They will be on the hook to repair any leaks they cause. When done right there shouldn’t be any leaks. I had my solar installed 2 months after a new asphalt shingle roof was installed, after 2 heavy rainy seasons still no leaks. Asking for photos is not a bad idea. Some roofing companies also do solar and that is probably your best bang for your buck since they will do it all in one mobilization, and will have to answer for the work if there is a leak (no one else to point a finger at).\n\nAs for solar: plan for more than you currently need, unless you already have EVs. Better to oversize now than undersized and pay for a second install. Labor is more than 50% of the cost for solar. A lot of installers will want to match your current usage because they know they’ll be back for a second bite when you realize you need more juice.",

"comment": ">How many parking lots have a solar installation on them vs. total?\n\nSouth Australia is definitely the leader in Australia & there's possibly only a half a dozen carparks with solar that I know of.  However, a lot of business/building owners install solar panels & us public wouldn't have a clue.  For example, I've some friends who own 3 warehouses & in 2022 they put solar panels on all 3.  You can't see it from the ground & the only way someone on the ground would know is by noticing the inverters, which are inside the building.  They've done it because they can feed the power into the grid & make money.\n\nThe state has a very proactive stance on renewable energy & has set up the system so that anybody who feeds extra power into the grid makes money.  It's the reason why the state did a deal with Musk & had the world's first large solar battery installed (see reference).  The main issue now is to install more battery power (we're fairly flat so pumped hydro isn't an option), but some days we have over 100% of our power from renewables & export the extra to other states. \n\nThe major power station, Torrens Island has recently converted from coal to gas & the gas turbines will be retired in just a few years.  They've installed a 250 MWh battery & will be increasing the size of it.  From memory they're also experimenting with a flywheel system as another way to store energy.\n\n**So, yes, it can be done.  It just needs the government to get on board & set up suitable conditions to encourage it.**\n\n[https://hornsdalepowerreserve.com.au/#:\\~:text=The%20Hornsdale%20Power%20Reserve%20is,was%20completed%20in%20November%202017](https://hornsdalepowerreserve.com.au/#:~:text=The%20Hornsdale%20Power%20Reserve%20is,was%20completed%20in%20November%202017).\n\n[https://www.agl.com.au/about-agl/media-centre/asx-and-media-releases/2023/august/agl-opens-250-mw-grid-scale-battery-at-torrens-island-south-aust?7zs43y=jpts1o](https://www.agl.com.au/about-agl/media-centre/asx-and-media-releases/2023/august/agl-opens-250-mw-grid-scale-battery-at-torrens-island-south-aust?7zs43y=jpts1o)\n\nnote: we sometimes still need to import energy from other states, but that will improve.\n\nmore info . . . \n\n[https://reneweconomy.com.au/wind-and-solar-meet-stunning-87-pct-of-south-australias-demand-over-month-of-october/](https://reneweconomy.com.au/wind-and-solar-meet-stunning-87-pct-of-south-australias-demand-over-month-of-october/)",

It's a labelling program to certify meat that meets certain welfare standards.\n\nhttp://www.rspca.org.uk/freedomfood\n\nThe SPCA, worldwide, represents the most conservative and mainstream end of the animal welfare/rights spectrum. We (vegans) may oppose any use of animals, but millions of cows &amp; chickens are still going through the industrial system each year. Converting a few hundred or even thousand people to veganism makes an imperceptible dent on this vast food system. The SPCA's approach may not advance the view of animal rights, but they do have a demonstrable effect on the degree of suffering within the meat industry, and potentially on the cost of meat: as standards raise, so prices may as well, which contributes to economically induced reduction in consumption.",

You saying that you eat animal byproducts in breads, cereals, and soups without much concern is kind of the antithesis of being vegan. Vegan means you actually pay attention to that kind of stuff, not just when it's impossible to ignore. You are also showing people around you that it's kind of okay to consume animal products.\n\nCurrently, you aren't actually following a vegan lifestyle, sounds like you're a vegetarian with vegan leanings. You frequently consume animal products, and no matter how much you try to minimize the fact, you are directly and indirectly supporting the animal industries by doing so.\n\nThe fact that you're writing several paragraphs in defense of eating eggs and dairy while calling yourself vegan, as well as telling us that you \"make up\" for it by buying second hand clothes, shows how uncomfortable you are doing it. Just something to think about.",

"comment": "Everyday life is pretty normal for me; I'm a student in the UK and [apart from checking that what I consume is vegan] I live the same life as my omni flatmates and friends. I shop in the bigger supermarkets near me, where I have no trouble finding dairy-free milk, cheese and egg free bread and biscuits, and there's a vegan-friendly organic shop where I get my treats - vegan junk food and ready meals. My very favourite foods are pretty simple, I like chutney and salad sandwiches a lot [bread, lettuce, red pepper, cucumber and tomato chutney has been my recent favourite], and I make a lot of soups, as I work on a very low budget (not including alcohol or meals out, I live on about £10 a week with ease) I bake my own bread to save money and I bake quite a lot of vegan cakes. As a treat, there's a vegan-friendly restaurant in my city that do a Caribbean vegan burger + chips meal that has made me cry with joy. I take a multivitamin with iron very irregularly. I walk about an hour a day, do a kickboxing video most days, swim on occasion, and used to frequent the gym 5/6 times a week, where I would do an hour and a half of mixed cardio and strength and half an hour of swimming. Next week I'm starting a yoga class and hopefully pilates, too! I'm a student of English Language and Literature. I live with two pescatarians and know the vegan that works in my local organic shop but I live, study and am friends with omnis, mainly. Sometimes that makes life difficult; I can only have the salad and the chips in our Student U, when we go out to eat, and our flat occasionally smells like the meat/dairy that they've cooked, which can make me ill. Normally it's okay though! Hope I've been helpful and good luck in your research!",

What kind of 'serious discussions' are you talking about? If you're suggesting that more people should be discussing more extreme means (like the A.L.F. for example, then feel free to post a thread about that or set up a subreddit that's relevant\n\n&gt;I don't think many people have thought about these problems further than \"if everyone stopped eating animal products it would be the end of the animal industry\", sadly.\n\nAgain, I'm not sure what your point is here.

If I'm tired of oats, sometimes I just bring a container of cereal.\n\nLunch: last night's stir fry with portobello, kale, broccoli, tofu, and brown rice.

It should be - veganism is one of the biggest proposals ever made. Your biased studies full of confounding variables barely makes a dent here. We're closer to the dark ages than we are to figuring it all out 100%. Like I said before, show me a society from northern Europe that survived more than 5 generations completely 100% vegan. That would be a better argument.\n\n&gt; What do you mean \"who knows how healthy they really are?\"\n\nBlood panel of \"key nutrients\" is far from enough. 90% of our obese diabetes ridden population can pass those tests. Nutrition and how it all interacts long term is extremely complex science. I doubt we even have the technology to measure every single variable in a human body. How is this unreasonable? I'm saying science is just not there at the moment so I'd say it's healthy to remain skeptic.\n\n&gt;  So who knows how healthy meat eaters really are? Who knows how healthy anybody is? Can we ever truly know anything? \n\nExactly! We don't know jack either way (although in terms of world history, meat has had a fantastic track record). Which is why I'm saying - veganism is still a theory to me. I don't want to gamble with your theories. What you have is simply not enough. Maybe after 50 more years we'll see where we are by then.

You can work on fixing the ideas other people have which you have learned enough to now understand to be incorrect, when and if you want.  \n\nBut you should stop making your own happiness dependent on getting other people to learn all the things they don't know yet.  Especially the kind of people who don't even want to learn new things.  \n\nIf you choose to, you can focus only on directing your attention towards people who ask questions, or who are interested in changing their views and acquiring knowledge that *is different from what they currently know*, instead of trying to confirm what they're already doing with obstinacy, no matter what sort or amount of new information they learn.  You can try to choose friendships and communities filled with people like these, rather than the opposite. \n\nIt sounds kind of counter-intuitive.  \n\n\"How can I keep talking to people about this issue without getting worked up, *when I'm supposed to have strong emotions on it*, when I'm *justified* in having strong emotions on it, because I know how important it is, (and they often don't know how important it is)?\" \n\n\"If it wasn't important, I wouldn't feel so strongly about it!\" \n\nI'm not telling you that you're incorrect, or that you shouldn't feel strongly about this idea, or any other.  I'm not saying your *emotions* are incorrect.  What I'm saying is, you cannot let your *happiness* be dependent on other people ('s incorrect ideas).  \n\n------\n \n2). Take a break.  Really!  Activists of all kinds constantly are the kind of people who push themselves when they shouldn't.  \n\nIt's okay to take a break once in a while.  In fact, it's not only okay,  it's a *good thing*.  Yes, even for the animals- because it may be the best we can do for them in the long term.  It's better to learn how to deal with these feelings now, than to try to ignore them, until they *do* grow into a real issue (which they can).  You have to take some time to yourself, and learn to reconcile your new viewpoint of the world with what your previous expectations of it was.  \n\nAgain, kind of counter-intuitive.  \"I don't what to take a *break*.  This issue is important!  It's important to me!  It's so important, I have to keep pushing for it *right now*.\" \n\nThere are different ways to work towards something.  Not every type of productive behavior shows immediate, obvious (well, obvious to the far-sighted, even if they're non-obvious to the short-sighted) results.  \n\nIt is better for you to take a couple days (or weeks or even months) coming to an understanding about these \"societal\" or \"human\" implications of veganism you might have been trying to ignore until now (maybe the human limitations you didn't want to face, because you thought there was no way to acknowledge these inadequacies and maintain empathy for other people- which isn't true.  You can acknowledge that people, including yourself, are flawed, and still choose to care for them, if you want), and then end up living a long and healthy life as an effective advocate for veganism, than it would be to work another couple days (or weeks or even months) without stopping until you've reached your limit and become exhausted or disillusioned.  To prevent that from happening, you may have to take some time to rethink how you want to go about viewing others in the future.  Again, it's is not only okay to take a break once in a while, it can ultimately be a *good thing*.",

"comment": "\"So it's not vegan enough to eat vegan pizza from pizza hut because they're not vegan\"\n\nThis is essentially up to the individual as to what is vegan enough, i merely shared my opinion and you and about 5 other people got really upset.\n\n\"but you're not saying pizza hut has to cater to vegans in order for the pizza to be vegan enough?\"\n\nWhere did i say pizza hut HAS to cater to vegans?Where have i said that pizza hut HAS to do anything at all? You are assuming things that i haven't said.\n\n\" What are you talking about?\"\n\nRight back at you.\n\n\"Let's go back about two years. Domino's had just closed an investor meeting where vegan pizza was discussed and denounced. I remember the vegan community being lit. Their vegan options were the same as pizza hut. Thin crust, basic sauce, veggies. \"\n\nCorrect, they shot it down.\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/vegan-dominos-aint-gonna-happen_n_7174942.html\n\n\"The race for vegan friendly options in the US begins and domino's is slow to jump on the bandwagon. Pizza hut had more menu items to offer than domino's, even if it were unintentional. Now, for some odd reason, all of their crusts are vegan so you can happily order a cheeseless vegan pizza with a side of cinna stix to your door. \"\n\nCan you link that info? i cant find anything saying all of either companies crusts are vegan. \n\n\"Coincidence? Probably not. Plenty of big chains are making small arrangements to offer vegan and vegetarian options on their menus. The continued business and demand will inevitably push them to offer more vegan options, just like it has the past year.\"\n\nI don't know if its a coincidence because i don't even know if what you are claiming is true at all. Couldn't find anything about all of either companies crusts being vegan. It could be entirely coincidence, it could just be cheaper to make the a vegan crust therefore more profitable,\n\n\"Coincidence? \"\n\nMore likely than not. These small arrangements aren't aimed at vegans, they are aimed at people with allergies in every case ive seen except for one instance in Israel. Meaning that yes it was unintentional and therefore a coincidence....\n\n\n\"The continued business and demand will inevitably push them to offer more vegan options, just like it has the past year.\"\n\nYeah from the allergen page right? are you going to just keep ignoring the fact that they cant accurately interpret a VEGAN demand from that?  Or are you just going to keep repeating an entirely unsupported claim? What vegan options has pizza hut or dominoes offered earlier this year due to this demand? \n\n\"If nothing else, if all of us are completely wrong and you really are floating in your aura of proper vegan morality and righteousness\"\"\n\nWhy are you under the impression i view myself as the arbiter of veganism just because i have an opinion i defend just like you?\nI love(/s) how you just have to keep trying to characterize me as irrational though, its fairly childish. Maybe actually read what im saying instead of looking for easy misinterpretations to build strawmen out of.\n\n\"why do you have to come to this thread and shit on the people who are excited that a huge portion of America have more vegan options from a major food chain? What is this doing for you, veganism, or the animals? \"\n\nWhere did i shit on someone, even verbally? you are getting really emotional about pizza. \n\n\"What is this doing for you, veganism, or the animals? \"\n\nYeah Id like to ask you the same.  Going to a place that doesnt serve 90+% animal ingredients is better for animals than one that does. I understand that you probably want to make the slippery slope argument to this, but that's why i said its up to the individual as to what is vegan \"enough\". Isn't the point of veganism to reduce the animal industry and not fund the companies that directly support it? especially the ones that do it by a much larger %?",

The closest thing to raw I eat now is overnight oats with banana, blueberries, peanut butter and almond milk (I know not even close), and that's about the only thing that fills me up until the next meal. \n\nFrom what I've briefly read, certain raw foods are more fiberous and keep you full longer.\n\nI wasn't really planning on 100% for now, just to try and see how it makes me feel.

There are hundreds of stories of animal farmers switching to plant based farms.\n\nYou say \"blind vegan rhetoric\" call it what you like,  but it is the objectionable truth. Stop buying into the meat industries propaganda. \n\nDid you research the holocaust survivor? Who are you to tell him the comparisons aren't just? He literally lived though the holocaust and you are telling him how to feel! Its laughable.\n\nThe examples I give are examples in which a victim is oppressed, the only reason you'd disagree is if you don't view animals lives worth enough to be oppressed in the first place. \n\nYou're clearly not educated enough on the subject matter, so you get your kicks posing as a vegan who tries to undermine the movement. Being vegan is about animal rights, yet you're on here defending the oppressors and abusers.",

And they had pasta and he was like this one is alright and I even emphasised again that they should not put cheese on it because that is a common mistake. Well, surprise I get some pasta with tomato sauce and cheese on it. Except the cheese it was fine. So I told him that I can't eat this and then they topped it. They got me the same but this time without cheese. Sounds good so far but what a twist: they put some sausage in it (didn't do that before). I was like tf?! That is meat I said no meat. And he was like that is no meat that is *insert name of the sausage*... the guest on the other table was starting to laugh and was also like wtf and was like that is meat and he was like no that is this sausage. Well, I ended up getting the pasta without meat and without cheese but damn... it sucked",

However, you are morally and financially implying that animal abuse for the sake of producing meat, dairy, eggs, etc. is okay with you. If you’re attached to dairy and eggs, I recommend checking out the vast array of extremely cool dairy and egg alternatives out there. Watch some videos on how aquafaba can be made into meringues and try Silk soy milk or barista oat milk with your coffee. There are even extremely cool vegan cheeses out there. (If you’re ever in NYC, check out Riverdel.) You’re so ahead of your classmates in realizing all of this so young. Sounds like you are headed on the right path for sure (gee, how old does that make me sound haha).",

It opens up room for people to think that our entire way of life is subjective and doesn’t have clear cut lines. \n\nLook, be vegan or don’t; don’t do this half assed. Veganism is the abstaining of using animals for food, entertainment, comfort or convenience. It doesn’t exclude “animals that can’t feel.” You don’t need them for survival, so this is clearly using them for convenience and comfort. \n\nMy kosher MIL has to watch out for oyster sauce at Chinese restaurants. Her solution is to find specific Chinese restaurants that don’t use oyster sauce. If she has these strong values for a religion, and you have yours for ethical reasons, the cause alone should be enough to abstain.",

Following steps is basically spreading the idea and convincing others just as we did with veganism. \n\nThere are other things you can do right now in certain scenarios that are morally righteous and prolly obligated and there would be no detrimental effects to the environment. But that’s getting deeper. And something tells me ur snappy on time, which is why I could link some videos that express the ideas. \n\nHonestly, just take a look at Humane Hancock’s YouTube channel and his videos on the topics of wild animals suffering :)",

My empathy is absolutely just for the animals, because in this scenario you're not being birthed, farmed and killed for some fake redditor vegan to feel bad about. It isn't even a comparison - slightly difficult conversation with daddy or kill 250+ animals for your wedding?? I'm not treating you like shit mate, I'm pointing out that you can't claim to be \"100% ethical vegan\" while also enabling the murder, cooking, and eating of animals. It's the same way that you can't be a nationalist while advocating for a planet without borders. Almost disgusting how you'd rather kill so many animals rather than have a slightly inconvenient and awkward conversation with one bloke.   \n\n\n  \nAlso, gender neutral language exists.
