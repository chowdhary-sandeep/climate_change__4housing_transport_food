Sorry if my post sounded like I was arguing against someone opposed to them.\n\nFor my situation, I live in middle Tennessee, which relies heavily on hydroelectric; I don't know what our electricity costs are compared to the rest of the nation's, but the Leaf owners I've talked to have expressed very high satisfaction with the tradeoff between the higher monthly electric bill and the lack of gas station trips. That we don't have an EV tax (that I know of, heh; I'm still in the beginning stages of my number crunching and financial research) is nice too.",

"comment": "The sensibility of EVs. To me, they're just cars with electric motors and a battery instead of a gas tank. Any \"sensibility\" is really about cars themselves. We load all kinds of psychological baggage into our vehicles. I get major Seattle smugness cred when I drive the Think around town, especially to the farmer's markets, which (by the way) are shameless energy hogs compared with supermarkets and evil corporate soul-crushing agribusiness. Then I put on my cowboy hat and climb into the 22-foot, one-ton, full crew cab, turbo diesel, long bed Ram pickup truck with the Bambi bars on the front and drive it to the rodeo in Eastern Oregon and pose as a rancher.\n\nCars are American kabuki theatre, and long may it live.

"comment": "A 2,200 mile road trip is not something I would do every month. Maybe every 5 years?\n\nYou can subtract maybe 5 of those stops as you would need to sleep sometime, so you can't really count that as time spent waiting for the car to recharge when you're not going to be driving it in your sleep.\n\nFour hours of waiting around doesn't sound so bad when you compare it to the 36 hours of time spent on the road, but I'd still probably pick another vehicle to do that sort of trip.\n\nI'm not insisting a Model S is a \"road trip car\" I'm just stating it doesn't appear to be an insurmountable challenge that destroys any other positive aspects of the vehicle.\n\nThe Model X is probably going to attract even more derision, if they choose to promote it as able to tow a caravan.\n\nI doubt battery range and charging times will have any incentive to increase much further beyond what consumers think is practical, and evidently 500 miles seems plenty for current vehicles. Probably 240 Miles in 15 minutes will be reasonable enough for some.\n\nReally, it's a chicken and egg problem with EVs and long distance charging infrastructure, and if the Supercharger maps and Tesla can be trusted, it's going to reach a partial solution.\n\nTesla's a Rolex on wheels,The Volt is a Citizen, and the Leaf is a Swatch?\nThey are all statements on the disposable income of the owner, and they are all potentially investments in advancing the future of Electric Vehicles.",

"comment": "Electric cars don't need a subsidy either. In my thoroughly explained example, the subsidy accelerates market adoption of a new industry, which can have positive net benefits.\n\nA subsidy is a conscious choice to manipulate the market for net benefit. We do that all the time. That's what patents are supposed to be, for example. A patent has an immediate negative effect on the market, but the theory is that having a patent system encourages more innovators, which theoretically is a net positive for the market. I question the efficacy of our current patent system, but it still stands as a good example of the way we manipulate the market. There's countless more examples - every tax or regulation manipulates the market in some way, but many of them result in a stronger society.\n\nOf you're going to make broad declarations about the value of something, maybe present some evidence or comment on the evidence I presented? I gave a nice example of the value of subsidy and you just replied with \"no they're not useful\". I clearly presented an example where there are no net drawbacks seemingly disproving what you said, but you said it anyway.",

"comment": "One thing I attempt to do, is attempt to deduce reasons or possible reasons that EV manufacturers chose the batteries the batteries they did. The reasons you suggested do not sound reasonable to me, there must be more considerations.\n\n&gt; Could you link me the AESC page with the information about the Leaf and the Volt's batteries?\n\nhttp://www.eco-aesc-lb.com/en/product/liion_ev/\n\nNissan Leaf cells are 157 Wh/kg, Tesla cells are around 230 Wh/kg. So that's 47% increase in energy density by mass.  Tesla cells are closer to ~620 Wh/L whereas Leaf are 317 Wh/L. So that's about double energy density in terms of volume. However, obviously each pack needs a different design in order to support the cells. Tesla has an individual fuse wire for every cell, thermal material, and liquid cooling channels. It is a work of art honestly. Nissan however simply puts 4 cells in basically a sardine can, then adds lots of modules (much simpler). GM uses pouch cells with flat liquid cooled plates between every couple of cells.\n\nModel S also has a much bigger battery than either, I assume there's some economies of scale.\n\nNissan Leaf was also released in 2010, whereas the Model S was released in 2012. My understanding is Panasonic came out with its NCA cells in late 2009, which was around the time pre-production Leafs and Volts were already driving. LMO also contains less Cobalt and Nickel than NCA, perhaps GM / Nissan thought this would lower cost.\n\nSo while the difference in energy density is large I don't think it's perhaps as large as you are suggesting (almost 2x) and the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf came before the Model S too.\n\nAlso note that the powertrain of Mercedes B-class Electric Drive is made by Tesla. While the car is a compliance car rather than a purpose built EV, it doesn't seem to offer massively better performance than other similar cars like Ford Focus EV. Obviously it's not a very good example, since it's not a purpose built EV.\n\n&gt; From what I recall, owners of the Model S said that the 0 - 60 times at 10% charge were 25% slower than the times at full charge.\n\nNissan Leaf is a 1500 kg car, Tesla Model S is a 2100 kg car. Nissan Leaf has a 24 kWh car, Model S is a 60, 70, or 85 kWh car. The Nissan Leaf battery will therefore use 1.8 to 2.5 times the energy per unit of overall battery capacity to get the car to 60 mph (ignoring wind and rolling resistance) compared to the Model S. So the impact could be much greater than you anticipate.\n\n&gt; double the energy if it was using NCA cells instead of LMO\n\nIt's also not just NCA versus LMO - batteries can be optimized for power or energy, pouch cells also tend to have lower energy density than cylindrical cells. Panasonic have higher capacity NCA cells than what Tesla uses, but they have worse discharge characteristics.\n\n\n&gt; It's true that I don't KNOW exactly how GM, Nissan, or Daimler approach battery safety. \n&gt; Andrew Farrah, to Prabhakar Patil, to Ann Marie Sastry, to recycling experts, talk about safety in the same way.\n\nGood point, but keep in mind that Prabhakar is CEO of a chemical company, Ann Marie Sastry is working on new chemistry. I'm convinced there is technical documentation somewhere on the web on why Nissan / GM went with the pack design they did, I just can't seem to find it.\n\nRegarding chemistry:\nhttp://insideevs.com/external-form-factor-2016-chevy-volt-battery-unchanged-compared-current-volt/\n\nInteresting article on the GM batteries:\nhttp://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/16/gm-expands-warren-battery-lab-to-better-test-elr-next-gen-volt/#image-4\n\nIn a Volt, the demands on cycle-life are much greater than Tesla because the range is so small. The usable SOC is also much lower than the Leaf so discharge power AND regen power are always high enough, and also so that range does not reduce as the battery ages. (Obviously Nissan failed at battery longevity which is rather poor honestly).\n\nFYI the highest energy density NMC pouch cells that I have seen are these:\n\nhttp://www.cdiweb.com/datasheets/ctc-battery/FEI-DataSheet-IMP06160230P25A-Pouch-25Ah-v5.pdf\n\nhttp://media.zeromotorcycles.com/press-2015/press-kits/2015-zero-press-kit-us-e.pdf#page=13\n\nA 27 Ah variant now exists, but I can't find the datasheet, but it's probable 440 Wh/L and 195 Wh/kg. They are used by Zero Motorcycles who can cram 15 kWh of them onto a Motorcycle, which is extremely impressive. Also note that Tesla 7 kWh power-wall is also NMC, which is interesting because the 10 kWh version is NCA. Tesla also hired Jeff Dahn who I believe was one of the inventors of NMC (although he works on other battery related things). Point is, like NCA, NMC seems like a very good chemistry.\n\nSorry, I think this post is more a collection of thoughts over a concise argument. I agree with you about pack design and Tesla being the leader.\n\nThe factors you suggest seem real, however I don't think they are not the only factors at play. I also don't think the lead Tesla has is as large as you are suggesting. In the future, there is absolutely nothing stopping LG Chem or perhaps AESC from coming out with a cell somewhat better than the 27 Ah Farasis, with Nissan &amp; GM putting &gt;40 kWh into a long range EV to compete with Model 3, which is seemingly exactly what they intend to do. I also think this will be a much better comparison between the approach traditional automakers take versus Tesla, since the size of the battery should be closer and the time-frame should also be similar. I think Tesla will edge out in terms of energy density and capacity somewhat (but not massively), will have superchargers, and will end up with a sexier and more unconventional product.",

"comment": "You're right, cars are pretty reliable in general these days and a lot of things will still need to be serviced by the dealer but there's a lot less that can go wrong and the maintenance intervals for EV's are spaced out pretty far. For my Rav4, Toyota recommends a check-up every 6 months, and it's still optional so I'll probably only take it in once a year unless something breaks. For my Genesis sedan I was visiting the dealer at least 5 or 6 times a year for oil changes, radiator flushes, filter replacements, intake cleaning, brakes - and that's not including an issue I kept having with the gas tank that was covered under warranty twice because they couldn't fix it (and they never really did). That's a big difference in maintenance costs. So while ICE cars might not be throwing rods all the time, dealerships won't make as much money from EVs in the long term and that's something they'll definitely notice.",

"comment": "Well considering we own and drive an EV, my comments are certainly not based on conjecture.  They're also based on real world experience.  But yeah, go on acting like you know me, yeah?  \n\nIf you spent less time trying to 'talk down to me' and more time actually doing some research yourself, you'd find all the points I've explained to you have actually been accurate. \n\nFor instance, nowhere in my comment did I remotely claim that the U.S. doesn't contribute to automotive development.  Yet again, you continue to put words into my mouth. I simply stated that many Americans arrogantly act as if theirs is the only country of relevance.  \n\nSpecifically, I pointed out that U.S. political hurdles involved with installation of a new charging station are not the same as international hurdles, and you shouldn't falsely assume that just because legislation to install chargers is difficult in the U.S., that is therefore must be difficult elsewhere.  This has nothing to do with consumer trends driving the global market.  \n\nAs an aside, I am curious how you got the impression that the US drives global automotive trends.  I can tell you for certain that most Europeans have always purchased vehicles that are far more suited to European towns and cities; these large pick-up trucks and 4x4s are not common.  \n\nOur market tends to favour towards smaller, more economical vehicles.  As such, hatchbacks and city cars are the top sellers.  Heading east into Asia there's a greater - sometimes overwhelming - emphasis on two-wheelers such as scooters.  Quite simply put, American car buyer's purchase decisions really have little bearing on the rest of the world.  \n\nHowever, I am not denying that companies like Google and Tesla, etc, are probably going to become the largest drivers in the next generation of the automotive industry in the coming years.\n\nPlease have a little respect.  Almost every reply you've given me has been highly patronising.  It's as if you take some perverse delight in trying to point out how much I 'amuse' you.  Are you unable to have a mature discussion?    It's so incredibly ironic how you claim I lose all credibility, and yet in the space of two comments you've managed to falsely assume I don't drive an EV, and  writing things like \"LOLOLOL\".",

I run with a 10% reserve in case of a grid outage, I live in semi-rural Australia and outages/faults occur fairly regularly. Once summer hits I'll drop the reserve down to 3%, 10% just makes more sense to me in winter when solar generation is so low. We get plenty of warning about planned outages and they can last half a day or more.. obviously when I get that letter I'd be setting a higher reserve the day before the outage with enough to cover the planned window (+ some margin).",

"comment": "On your points: \n\n* The reviews all talk about a wider, lower ride - more grip, less sway, but not overtightened like the i3. Gone is the top-heavy sway, it's supposedly very responsive. \n* ...let's come back to 2\n* Right now estimates are 150-165, so 160 is very likely spot-on. \n* It has emergency auto-brake! According to Nikki at TEN, if you mistakenly press the gas instead of the break you won't crash into a store window or out the garage; the car just won't do it. \n\nOn 2 - I've driven a few EVs on weekend trips (ahem, extended test-drives) and I thought a lot about my experience with the Zoe ZE40 vs the Leaf (30kWh). With the larger battery and longer range, and given that it's most-always going to be charged normally, not DC fast charged, I'm not sure it's an issue. Everyone uses the original Leaf as an example, but realistically - that was then. The battery formulations have improved, you're charging it up perhaps HALF as often because it's a bigger battery... unless you live in the desert where it's always hot, it's likely never going to be any issue. And now with vehicle to grid, that's supposed to help maintain a perfect battery. Plus, the 8-year warranty. \n\nI think it's a fear we have to put to rest.",

It doesn't seem like it.\n\nYou've given no rational reasons as to *why* the threshold is set where it is. \n\nYou've said \"more than 20 - 30 kWh for a car [the general capacity for entry-level EVs]\" and \"More than 200 miles of range\" without *any rationale* reasons as to *why* a threshold that *conveniently* excludes everything other than a Tesla is at all reasonable.\n\n&gt; A little over 300 km or 200 miles has been for years an industry quoted number for good enough range\n\nAgain, what is *based* on?  Certainly not the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/subject_areas/national_household_travel_survey/daily_travel.html) that [GM used to determine that 40 miles/~16kWh was generally enough](http://gm-volt.com/2007/12/06/how-did-gm-determine-that-78-of-commuters-drive-less-than-40-miles-per-day/) to practically move commuters off of fossil fuels.\n\nSo where does this number come from?  If it doesn't have a rational, *data driven* reason behind it, then it is, [by definition, arbitrary.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arbitrary)",

I think that most of the electric startups like Via, Bollinger, Atlas, etc are hoping to get bought out by an established manufacturer. \n\nIf you are trying to sell cars for a reasonable price it is incredibly difficult to raise the capital you need to build assembly lines and supply chain needed for volume production. Launching a new product requires 4-5 years of cash burn without any revenue. Tesla's aggressive growth and new product launches are the reason why the company has been unable to post a profit despite strong sales in the luxury market. During the lean years Tesla was able to make some revenue by selling drive-trains to Toyota(Rav4 EV) and Daimler(Mercedes B-Class, Smart). Now that market has dried up with more established equipment manufacturers offering electric drive-trains.",

The Model 3 is currently on pace for production at around 250,000 a year, going to 350,000 a year rate early next year. The Model S and X are around 50,000 a year each. In comparison, the I-Pace is about 15,000 and the Kona is about 20,000.",

This motor type is lighter, cheaper and more energy efficient than the motor of any other BEV sold today. But it doesn't matter that much.

The spares are scarce and apparently Tesla is rather jealous of them and Certified mechanics few and far between.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the police much rather takes a model using parts, which cars are produced by the million and just their bulk standard not so special in house mechanic can handle the repairs or any of the dozen repair shops in town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould they arrange it all? Yeah, but that is gonna cost. That cost is away from other resources like say officer pay and the on duty strength of police.",

"comment": "On another note, changes in driving trends is a far superior solution to making every new EV car have a 300 mile range, and building an extensive charging infrastructure capable of handling peak volume driving days.\n\nThe average daily commute is ~34 miles.  Most people will drive less than 50 daily miles on average, accounting for 90% of their annual miles.  Yet, they feel the need to get a 200-300 mile range battery for that 5% of annual miles used on a road trip that they may or may not take.  One year a person may go on a road trip for their vacation, the next they may take a plane.\n\nWe really need to see a trend of people moving to lower range EVs or to PHEVs.  Want to road trip with a low range EV?  Well, since you've saved about $8k on the smaller battery... how about renting an HEV, PHEV, or efficient ICE and use gasoline?  No massive charging infrastructure needed, and your annual carbon emission reduction is still substantial.\n\nI'd mention that lower range EVs have tended to have lower overall miles/kWh efficiency versus larger battery cars.. but then the Hyundai Ioniq EV went and proved that this isn't true at all.",

I'd buy the business trim for about 9k euros less than a TM3 here (\\~37k vs \\~46k), in part due to local subsidies, and that includes a heat pump which is not available on the Tesla. That's 20% less, pretty significant if you ask me.",

But also keep an eye on what's available at your workplace.\n\nIf you got 20-cent/kw-hr charging at your work, that's roughly equivalent to  $2/gallon to $2.50/gallon gasoline (depending on the make/model of your car of course). So if you can charge at work (albeit at higher costs than charging at home), its an option.\n\nAnd as I always like to push, PHEVs for condo owners! Charge electric when possible, gasoline otherwise. Even if you get the home/condo charger, who knows what your next living quarters will be like?",

So it is much more roomy than the last Golf.\n\nHaving got used to the ID.3 name now every time I open the boot, I kind of like it, whereas I didn't in the beginning. But agreed, I think renaming it Golf could be better. Or, if VW bring out an inbetween cheap car, remembering that the original Golf was quite small, a new BEV Golf could be a genuine 25K in dollars or pounds car. With an E-UP successor at the bottom. Maybe a new Polo?",

If you're running 600 kW of electrical service to a parking lot, surely a handful of 7 kW L2 chargers isn't much more cost.

You can't just\n\n>Secondly, agrivoltaics are just a way to make solar more expensive than it needs to be if utility-scale plants are used instead. \n\nYou're missing the point that if you use agrovoltaics you reduce water usage and France is running out of water so they can't sustain power production.\n\n>Congrats on the profiteering\n\nThe EDF sells nuclear energy at the cost to produce it, the customer pays up to the price cap of electricity and the government pays the rest.\n\nWhen French nuclear reactors can't meet up with peak power demand they start importing electricity from Germany. The EDF buys it at the same price they're selling nuclear at in order to get producers to sell to them directly and since Nuclear is the most expensive resource on the market everyone can sell it to them and pocket the difference in their generation cost.\n\n€400/MWh is what the EDF has to charge to stay afloat.\n\n>The second's not a good thing\n\nHigh Speed Rails are less efficient than normal rails.\n\n>and the first can easily be explained by the fact that the population density of continental France is 48% lower than Germany's and much more highly concentrated close to the cores of a smaller number of metro areas.\n\nSo in your opinion France wasted their money on unnecessary high speed rails?\n\n>Cope, the fact that you can't do Frankfurt-Berlin by train in less than 4 hours is unbecoming of a developed country when they're only separated by 550 km by road. Madrid-Barcelona is 2h 30 min and they're 620 km apart, Rome-Milan is 3h at 581 km.\n\nYou didn't realize that this paragraph directly contradicted the previous one? You're like ChatGPT levels of stupid.\n\n>You do know HDI is not an exhaustive measure of a country's developmental status, right? It's just an amalgamation of life expectancy, average schooling years and gross national income per capita because those three datapoints *broadly* correlate to how not shit a country is to live in. And even then, South Korea is in 19th place yet you couldn't pay me enough to live and work in Hell Joseon.\n\nThere are 254,000 French people living in Germany, versus 130,000 French people living in Germany.\n\n>For a country that's supposedly without clean drinking water, France sure outpaces Germany in life expectancy and other health metrics. Someone's trying to convince himself of a bullshit idea to cope.\n\nFrance has twice as many HIV infections per capita. They probably get it from fecal transmission through their drinking water.\n\nMeanwhile I am posting to you from Fiber Optic internet in the middle of my farmhouse in Baden Wurttemberg \n\n>*And*, more crucially, a lower percentage\n\nFrance has 4% more rail electrification in total, it's absolutely nothing in the real world and aAI generated web article isn't going to change reality.\n\nBy every functional measurement France is inferior to Germany, Hence why they've lost every war to Germany since 1812.",

It's never idling or redlining. When it's on, it's running at the best RPM possible if running at all.\n\nEven in PHEVs where the ICE do provide direct tractive power like the Prius Prime, the eCVT (don't confuse this with unreliable conventional CVTs) is found to be far more reliable and longer lasting than traditional automatic transmissions in road cars.",

You can get it new for rather less than a grand, it'll ride eleven miles with no issues at all, and it's one of the most reliable scooters on sale today.\n\nNote that it *is* rather heavy, so if that's a problem the Ninebot G30 might work better for you. It's an older model but remains a perfectly sensible choice: it has no suspension, which makes it somewhat less comfortable but also a lot lighter.\n\nThe Niu KQi3 is also an option. Its reliability is a little less proven, though generally considered quite high, and it has the advantage of a 48V powertrain which makes it a bit faster.",

"comment": "You might want to wait until next year when Toyota and Honda introduce their Hydrogen electric vehicles. [Hyundai is going to lease one starting this month](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3027144/this-new-hyundai-car-runs-on-the-poop-of-california-residents-and-the-fuel-is-free).  \n\nIt's a game changer- they are electric vehicles but instead of a half ton of lithium batteries to lug around and replace one day the cars make their own energy.  \n\nCheck out this Top Gear review of the Honda Hydrogen Electric Clarity from 2008 http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/honda-clarity  \n\nHonda H20: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tU6vio6xns  \n\nOne day sooner rather than later you'll be able to make your own hydrogen at home with the solar panels on your roof. Honda is working on home solar hydrogen stations and has just recently installed one in Japan http://world.honda.com/FuelCell/SolarHydrogenStation/  \n\nThe Kelly Blue Book chimes in:\n\n&gt;Better Than a Battery\n\n&gt;Since they're basically electric, it begs the question: Why not just drive a battery-electric vehicle? Ronald Grasman, general manager of U.S. fuel cell vehicle operations with Mercedes-Benz, explained the problems with EVs during the conference. \"Battery vehicles are great,\" he said, \"but they have their limitations when it comes to range and charging time. This is where fuel cell vehicles make a great difference.\"\n\n&gt;In theory, a hydrogen car can beat a battery electric thanks to convenient and quick refueling, and a somewhat esoteric concept called \"energy density.\" An EV requires long recharging times, and even with a big battery, the range of an EV is usually limited to 100 miles or so. However, hydrogen can be pumped into a tank similar to gasoline, and that tank full of hydrogen holds a lot more energy than a battery does. The upshot is that you can get zero emissions, the rough equivalent of gasoline-car range, but without the long wait of recharging, or the hassle of engineering a gigantic battery pack into the vehicle. http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/hydrogen-cars-close-to-reality/2000010655/\n\nEdit: To Whoever-Thanks for the downvote. You have no idea how much it motivates me. The sheer ignorance and negativity shown re: hydrogen is staggering. Since this is an ELECTRIC Vehicle forum, and Hydrogen vehicles are ELECTRIC vehicles, I'll keep posting relevant items. At least until the mods don't want it.",

"comment": "&gt;most of what climate scientists suggest might happen will not happen.\n\nYou know that is a BS statement designed to sow doubt. That I expect you to admit it is a BS statement is my mistake.  You care not for truth, you only care to keep people from taking action on climate change to preserve the fossil fuel status quo.  You are doing a fantastic job at that. If I am right, you are going to kill a lot of people and some people have already died because of your deceitful practices.  \n\nBut that's ok, because climate change will eventually negatively affect you. It does not matter where you live or how much money you have. At that point I hope you remember this conversation.\n\n\nIt does not matter. I will try again.\n\n&gt;No, we were talking about specific outcomes that occur if the right tail of that distribution comes about.\n\n\nLets talk about that [right tail].(http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/climateqa/what-if-global-warming-isnt-as-severe-as-predicted/)\n\nThat's NASA's graph. Look at it as if you life might depend on it, because it might. Do you understand that a worst case scenario is much more likely than the comfortable best case scenario you claim will happen?\n\n&gt;No. Again, I'm showing you basic physics. If you accept that winter mean temperature in the Arctic is below -30°C, then you accept that there will be a refreeze. It's not bias to look at actual data.\n\nAnother comfortable lie. There is absolutely no data that tells you the atmospheric temperature of the arctic when refreeze starts with no sea ice. There is no usable data. Only speculations. That you believe there is data just shows the extent that you would lie to yourself and others  to protect fossil fuels profits. Either that or good old fashioned fear.\n\n&gt;If temperatures are below freezing, then water freezes. It's as simple as that. For water not to freeze, water would have to remain above freezing.\n\nAs simple as that. Except that the 34C you throw around is completely out of context.  It is true that 34C is the average annual temperature of the arctic atmosphere at the surface. However, every single time that temperature has been measured, the arctic starts its annual refreeze with million of kilometers of thick ice. That covers an ocean with minimum temperature of -2C. Further more at the beginning of the re-freeze season the temperature is -10 to 10 C. Once all the ice is melted it will be much higher than that.\n\nWhen all of the Arctic sea ice disappears, the initial conditions for the re-freeze process will be very different to anything we have ever seen. Instead of starting the refreeze process with a thick layer of ice helping the freeze,  the refreezing process will start with an ocean much warmer than ever before. The arctic Ocean would not be protected from warming by the sun by sea ice. Carbon and methane from the melting permafrost might form an additional warm blanket. All those forces might be enough to preclude the arctic from re-freezing. \n\n Even in the best case scenario, the first time the arctic is without sea ice, it might refreeze with very thin new ice. That thin ice will be completely melted at the beginning of the melt season warming the ocean and delaying the refreeze even further.    Repeat that cycle for a couple of years and soon you have an arctic not covered in ice for most of the year. \n\nThe worst part is that some fools actually think this is a good idea because of newly opened shipping lanes. They will collapse the economy and every treasure they have will be worthless except for food,water and shelter. The shipping lanes will be useless.\n\n&gt;I think they are bad, but I don't think they are new. Drought has happened in each of the places throughout history.\n\nIs the National Academy of Science good enough for you?  I doubt it, but here it goes anyway.\n[Substantial increase in concurrent droughts and heatwaves in the United States](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/11484.abstract)\n\n\n&gt;Because most proposed climate mitigation policies focus on energy policy, specifically producing energy without CO2 emissions. Did you really not know this?\n\nOf course. Fossil fuels are the main culprits on this debate. As I told you before I know the significance of fossil fuels in our standard of living. Our nice and comfortable world was built with fossil fuels.\n\n While it is true that fossil fuels are the main cause of global warming our debate is not about the causes of global warming. Our debate is about its magnitude and its consequences. That is completely independent of the causes of climate change.  \n\nIf you want to debate causes and solutions to climate change, go ahead make a thread and we'll debate fossil fuels, solar power and nuclear energy if you like, but there is not much to debate. Fossil Fuels cause global warming, but fossil fuels also allows the modern world to exist. We need to substitute fossil fuels, but so far there is no technology that can match the energy density, price and portability of fossil fuels. That is the simple horrific true. Fossil fuels, we can not live with them, we can not live with out them. It is quite a pickle\n\n   \n\n\n&gt;Then why did our species decline to between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals? A whole lot of nomads froze to death.\n\nOnce again you missed the whole point. If you are a nomad and your water source dries up, you pick up your stuff and move somewhere else. But we are not nomads. Our cities and farms depend on long established water sources. If those water sources are depleted, you can't just move cities and farms to the next friendly location. But it sounds good enough for you. If the cavemen survived climate change by moving to nicer places, so will modern cities. That's crazy talk.",

Save money, **fight climate change**. Sounds like a deal.... Those factors were enough to tip Weissman in favor of installing panels.

Here in Aus you are better off maximising a system, whatever you can fit on your roof within guidelines on a single phase property (3-phase supply properties are different) as adding more panels doesn't cost much more, and the extra feed in tariff you get pays off the price difference in systems anyway. \n\nI would suggest Enphase, with some Tier 1 affordable panels.",

Unsubsidized solar is already competitive with coal in much of the world.  And coal is subsidized by externalizing the cost of pollution, at a very minimum.\n\nHmmm, should i put solar panels on my house?  Nah, i'm going for a coal boiler in the basement.",

"comment": "&gt;The value per kWH is entirely dependent on relative demand at the time. If there is more demand is between 9am and 5 pm then new solar is more valuable and cost effective than new coal fired.\n\nThe value of a kwh to the grid is the same whether its generated by coal or solar.  Coal can generate 24/7 and any weather conditions, therefore it is more valuable overall than solar.  In other words, if it cost $2,000/kw to build and operate a new coal plant, that is more valuable than a solar plant (without storage) that costs $1,800/kw to build and operate.  So you can't say the solar plant is cheaper than the coal plant unless you include battery storage.\n\nAlso, peak demand is already shifting from afternoon to evening hours.",

"comment": "I might advise not having your goal to rarely/never draw from the grid.   While it's nice in theory, you're still going to pay for a grid connection (I presume?) and for much of the time power isn't murderously expensive.   Do you have a time of use rate or a demand charge?  Most battery products now go to markets where you can use them to avoid paying for power when prices are higher, rather than just avoiding buying grid power altogether.  Just where the best economics are for vendors at the moment.\n\nIf you're looking at hurricane proofing your electricity, keep in mind that panels and their wiring can easily be damaged in a hurricane.  The timeline to repair that may well be longer than the power coming back on.  And while your battery products right now are sized for a few days of power storage, none of them will go a week unless you are very capable at shedding electrical load in your house.    \n\nAdditionally, making all of your power go through your battery will degrade your battery much quicker than using it to limit your demand from the grid on the day to day operations.   Not the biggest deal, but something to consider as they're not cheap and degrading quickly would impact their capacity when you really need it during an outage.   I would say the more mainline economic option (not saying you want it, just what the market serves most right now) is a battery that works as a backup to your grid connection rather than the other way around.  \n\nIf you lose power, you have to rely on the solar array to fill the battery on a daily basis, not the battery to be large enough to hold you over for a week.  In your case the battery is there in large part to actually let you use the solar production without the grid to stabilize it (like it would without a battery), not so much to store days of power.   \n\nIf you have a 7kW systems, you can think of that producing 70 kWh (10 hours of decent sun) a day (just for a rough math example, it will definitely vary seasonally).  If you pay $.10/kWh, that's 7 dollars of power a day.   Putting in your own figures there (use PVWatts on NREL for actual production), that'll get you an idea of how much power you need daily.  Your power bill should have a kWh quantity on it as well to get an idea of a daily average.  \n\nThe Powerwall 2 has a 13.5 kWh capacity according to google.  Two of them do 27, but lets call it 25 to simulate some reduced size after a few years.    For the comparison, even a 5 kW array produces twice the energy (in kWh, not kW) than the batteries can store.  Any residential battery you buy is a bucket for power, not a tub or a pool.  \n\nThe idea with current equipment/economics is to have the battery hold you overnight (but honestly still use the grid most times as needed, night power is cheap), and during the day it just smooths out your solar production (in an grid-less scenario) so that it's usable (the production right out of the panels isn't usable for you house, it's hugely variable).   The battery is like a giant pasta maker.  Throw dough in (the lumpy solar array output), get pasta out (usable residential power) as fast as you want to crank.",

"comment": "From doing a fair amount of research into making and productionizing safe lithium home batteries, I would not recommend that anybody buy used cells and make their own pack. It isn’t nearly as cost effective as one might expect. I’d say the largest reason for that is because the cycle life’s claimed by Tesla and other advanced cell manufacturers is enabled by a very precise understanding of how their specific cells age over time. Without knowing that for your cells, you wouldn’t be able to properly charge/discharge them without damaging them eventually. Perhaps it would be safe to severely oversize your diy powerwall and keep it within a 20%-80% range and forego the full depth of discharge, but that loss of storage adds to the cost of the project. I would also insist on cell level fuses and lithium BMSs attached to every cell, and constructed in a way that allows for cell balancing. That gets pretty complicated pretty fast, but it’s still possible to do at home... if you’re an expert :) .",

"comment": "Nuclear energy is essentially infinite, we have a rather large supply of usable material for nuclear fission and fission compared to other non-renewable resources. Nuclear energy does create waste, but extremely manageable waste that does not pollute unless we let it. \n\nNuclear energy can potentially be disastrous, but other non-renewable resources cause much more issues that are not as immediately obvious (increased risk of cancers  due to pollution) compared to the instant results of a nuclear explosion.\n\nNuclear energy today is extremely safe and is a cheap way of producing large amounts of energy without producing harmful pollution.\n\nRenewable energy of course is the best way to go. Renewable energy lasts as long as the sun does, and current technology does not pollute while harnessing these energies (manufacturing these technologies may cause pollution however). \n\nThe current issue is that renewable energy is usually more expensive, and that specific renewable energies require specific geographical locations and weather. Solar panels are pretty terrible in London. Wind turbines are terrible where there isn't wind. You can only have geothermal or hydro plants where there are heat sources or bodies of water respectively. \n\nTldr; Nuclear energy is cheaper and is not restricted by geography and weather. Nuclear energy has the highest potential to be immediately disastrous but modern safety standards make that chance effectively null. Renewable energy is best if the location makes sense, because it is usually pretty expensive.",

"comment": "You first want to figure out if the owner of the house owns the panels or leases them. If they are leased you need to figure out if you are willing to take over the lease. If you are not you are most likely going to not get the house, as the owner will not be likely willing to break his lease and face a huge penalty with his leasing company. Even if he is willing to, he's going to pass that cost on to you by asking more for the house. \n\nhttps://rcenergysolutions.com/selling-a-house-with-leased-solar-panels-how-it-works/\n\nThat being said, if you purchase the house and want to upgrade the panels from 75a to something a modern house would use like 200a, any licensed electrician would be able to handle the solar aspect. They may need to be in communication with the solar installer for specific schematics or disconnect instructions during the upgrade.",

And we would definitely invest in battery storage, and battery technology in whole to create less environmental unfriendly storage devices that current lithium ion batteries. \n\nI don't know what power to gas is, but I'll dig in to it.\n\nAbout waste, nuclear waste is stored efficiently and hidden in bedrock, but solar panels end up in the landfills because they are not recycled.\n\nYou're right nuclear is not the optimal solution in the long term, but until we actually get co2 emissions to even lower a little annually, I feel like nuclear is an option to help achieve that. Current rate of renewables will take ages to cover our all energy needs if that's even possible and as you said government bodies everywhere aren't too fond about the investments it demands.",

"comment": "I did the vast majority of the work myself.  Total investment was ~$17,500 CAD.\n\nIf you already have double pane windows the smart investment would be to ensure they're well sealed around the window typically using caulking on the inside, and possibly replacing the seals.  Same for the doors.  Just replacing the seals might make a world of difference. \n\nBefore you do that though, see if your area has a program for efficiency upgrades.  Generally there will be a process for a professional to come to your house and examine it, called a home energy audit or something similar.  Hopefully they'll include a blower door test and identify where you'll be able to make the most effective upgrades in air sealing as well as everything else.  Once you have that done, just following the recommendations would take you a long way.  Many areas have rebates for the upgrades as well, they use the before and an after audit to figure out the rebate amounts. \n\nAlso, check your library to see if they have power meters such as a kill-a-watt.  These are useful for measuring plug loads to see if anything is using more power than it should be.  I found my microwave was using about 24W of standby power, which is astronomical.  It was using almost as much as my fridge when the microwave wasn't in use.  Similarly for an old stereo in my work shop.  Those are both on switches now.  On the other hand my 16 year old fridge and freezer use very little compared to a lot of online estimates that recommend replacing those items based on efficiency alone.",

And you're unaware that many utility companies are gradually switching to solar power too? You don't think that while people are individually getting solar power for their rooftops, power companies are not also building solar parks? You don't think major companies and government facilities are increasingly changing over to solar power either? What's with your response? You just want to argue about problems that won't exist? Or you think somehow that issue you think there is, is some sort of reason against change?",

For the Texas situation, generators is generally a better fit despite the maintenance that you may need to do.

If humanity doesn’t stop using fossil fuels, we will be overwhelmed by devastating floods, heat waves, droughts, fires and crop failures.\n\nBack on the non-parallel-universe Planet Earth, a truly unlivable world would be one without fossil fuels. Not just to generate electricity, cook food, heat homes and water, and power cars, boats, trains and planes – but for fertilizers and insecticides to grow more food on less land, and for plastics, pharmaceuticals, paints, cosmetics, clothing and other essential products. For us today; for billions more tomorrow.\n\nFossil fuels to extract and process trillions of tons of raw materials, too, and manufacture the millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of battery modules and millions of transmission line towers that would blanket our croplands, scenic areas and wildlife habitats if we didn’t have fossil fuels.\n\nIn fact, far worse than a warmer planet with more airborne plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide would be a colder planet with less CO2. That would mean less arable land, shorter growing seasons and much lower crop yields, on top of losses from a devastated Ukraine and sanctioned Russian wheat crops.\n\n➖ Why Is It That Twitter Twits Never Cancel, Suppress or Even Fact-check Climate Fear Porn? \n\n➖ Why Is It Never Just Climate Change, but Always Climate Cataclysms? \n\n➖ Why Always Manmade Climate Change, as Though Past Natural Climate Changes Never Happened? \n\n➖ Why Do Guterres, Gore, Kerry, Biden and AOC Always Have to Top His, Her, Hir, Ver, Zir Fellow Alarmists in Hysteria? \n\n➖ Why Is the Fear-mongering Always Based on Computer Models, Never on Actual Data and Evidence? \n\n➖ Why Does It Always Ignore China’s Massive Fossil Fuel Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions?\n\nInstead of parroting scare stories – and demanding that fossil fuels be replaced by pseudo-clean, pseudo-renewable energy – it really behooves us to think, analyze, ponder the many ways fossil fuels improve our lives, and demand real evidence instead of GIGO computer models for any supposed climate crisis.",

You normally do have a grid inverter used as PFC in the onboard charger, but the article is not about that.\n\nAs other mentioned, the onboard charger in the e-GMP does have V2L ability, but V2G is a little bit more difficult, because you need to comply to more regulations if you want to feed back to the grid. From the technical side, you have to synchronize to the grid, instead of creating your own island grid for V2L. And you have to monitor when the grid is removed (e.g. when a fuse in your house is blown). This is not everything, but all of that is doable, especially since it's bascially only software and certification. Every solar inverter can do that. But it's still additional effort that no carmaker has bothered with.",

The roof angle looks pretty steep too :T\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in South OC so under the death grip of SDGE and hate it after having been under SCE for a long time (used to be in Irvine). I've heard that the transition points between the clay tile and comp shingles are where you are bound to have issues the most but I would think this goes back to finding a competent roofing contractor who has the foresight and knowledge to prevent that as much as possible. We are in a tract so most neighbors have the same type of roofing. A few have completely changed out their roofing. One benefit is that it seems these kinds of tiles really keep the heat off of the house. So I do wonder what effect solar panels will have as far as R-Values and the heat gain to our house...

The house is nearing completion, but the panels have been running for about three months, and with three air conditioners running full-time as the house is being finished, my electric cost through ComEd has been $14 a month. So I’m generating what I think is of power and selling back to the grid as well. but I have held off on a battery, and was waiting for the new Enphase 5P to come out which it has. My solar installer gave me a price of $17,000 for 2  5p batteries, and the combiner. They did a good job on the panels, and took care of all the paperwork, but is this a reasonable price. Thanks for any help. The other alternative which they indicated I cannot use is a Tesla power wall but I really can’t understand why I can’t. Does anybody have any thoughts on that, or is this just a sales tactic to steer me to Enphase.\n\n_",

AND the distribution substations connecting the various portions of it didn't safety shut down themselves... they will continue to run for as long as generation exactly matches consumption which is very unlikely to last long at all without managed generators actively controlling phase angle / power factor, and current to closely follow demand. The moment there's a mismatch in either voltage or HZ, they will rise (over supply) or fall (under supply) and things will start to safety shut down. A home battery with gateway to positively disconnect a down grid can do this for your home. A literal island in the ocean not connected to a bigger grid does this on that scale too. IIRC Hawaii requires batteries for all solar installs now for this reason if I'm not mistaken.",

The numbers get closer but still aren’t super close. \n\nI have a killowatt device that I’ve put on everything in my house at one point or another, and it just doesn’t add up. Of course there is electricity draw for things like the fridge and chest freezer 24/7, but it just feels weird. Especially since if I look at xcels reporting from one angle, another angle shows different numbers. \n\nAh well just another reason to mistrust Xcel. Pity I can’t add more panels to my install right now, since in the past 7 months we’ve picked up a PHEV and a full EV so electric usage is a wee bit different from when we installed at the end of 2019. If we ever build a garage in the yard boy howdy that’s getting solar panels too.",

Because when I recently calculated it myself admittedly not taking into account every single detail I arrived at an estimate of two days. \n\nThe reason why I did calculate that was that someone claimed that waste heat from electricity was heating the earth dangerously or would be soon. I was surprised by the two days, because I would have guessed the sun to be even more powerful, however I still felt justified in thinking that the waste heat was not a significant problem yet. \n\nHonestly I hope my numbers are off because it‘d mean we would cover like 0.5% of the earths surface in solar panels to power everything with solar. I assume that’s a very significant part of the total inhabited land mass. Next rabbit hole here I come.",

"comment": "Sorry but you are completely out to lunch in your assumptions. It is not just about the loss of power in the transmission over 1000km of high voltage power lines.  Have you paused to consider the capital costs to build a system of that magnitude?  How much steel and concrete would be used?  How much extra 'carbon' is burned to smelt the metals, prepare the ground, power the heavy equipment and helicopters to build the infrastructure?  I would suggest it would be a multiple of the 'carbon' saved by 'clean' solar panels, which would also require enormous amounts of conventional energy for manufacturing and install.  \n\nThis is the probably with linear thinking.  People just want to FORCE all participants to go along with their agenda, regardless of the reality and limitations or inefficiency associated with 'green' technology.  How about the loss of land use for a huge area dedicated to solar that could instead be used for productive capacity?\n\nI think its brilliant to adapt large surfaces on top of factories and office buildings to install solar power in certain areas of the world.  The combined effect of this strategy would offset a lot of conventional energy, used right on point.  Consider just air conditioning, where the panels generate power during the hottest times of day that AC is most necessary.  **There are lots of good ways we can implement alternative power options to create a net gain in efficiency.  Speculating on ridiculous concepts that make zero sense is not how we get there.**",

So they'll say you exported 30kWh @ $0.10/kWh and imported 10kWh @ $0.60/kWH so you owe $3 even though you exported way more than you imported.\n\nI'm in NY on Long Island, here they just do 1:1 net metering, in the above case, they would add the difference, 20kWh, to your bank and your bill is otherwise just fees (but it includes a per-kW fee, the CBC charge).",

"comment": "&gt;You see, you said that those who said honey wasn't vegan did so because they did not believe insects were animals.\n\nI was speaking of personal experiences. Yes, I have literally had people tell me that insects aren't animals. A LOT of people. And some don't even believe fish are animals. It's quite sad. \n\n&gt;All plants that require pollination are also animal products by this logic\n\nBut they aren't *necessarily* the products of animal exploitation. When vegans talk about \"avoiding animal products\", they mean the products of animal exploitation specifically. After all, we're not telling people to avoid feeding their children breastmilk or enjoying sex with consenting adults. Nor do I think any vegan would object to eating something because it was fertilized by wild worms and pollinated by wild bees. \n\nBut there's a difference between managing hives for a product that requires stealing from bees what they have produced for themselves, and enjoying the fruits of plants that were pollinated by wild living pollinators. True, many plants are pollinated by exploited insects and the process itself isn't vegan. Veganic gardening does not use captive pollinators but rather encourages wild pollinators. \n\nHowever, veganism requires us to do only what is \"possible and practicable\" to be vegans. As veganic farming is not widespread, it is not practicable for the vast majority of people to eat only veganicly farmed food. It is, however, practicable -- and even quite easy -- for most people to avoid products with honey or beeswax in them. It's listed on ingredients lists even, unlike pollinator sources for ingredients.",

"comment": "This has happened to me a few times as well, and I love when the cashier is interested.  The latest time was just a few weeks ago shopping at around midnight, and the conversation actually started with the woman in front of me chatting with the cashier about Veggie Fest in Chicago.  It turns out that both the cashier and the other shopper are both vegetarian and both leaning towards veganism, and had both been to Veggie Fest in the past but not this year.  Since I have volunteered at Veggie Fest in the past and know the coordinators quite well, I joined in on the conversation (more like butted in, but who's keeping track?).\n\nWe all chatted about the fest and veganism in general for a few minutes, and it really perked up my otherwise tired, miserable night.  I always enjoy pleasant surprises like that, as most encounters I've had with a cashier while buying vegan items have been pretty neutral or even a little negative.  I should probably go back to that same cashier so I can butt into more conversations like that.  :)",

Gary Yourofsky is very much an \"in your face\" vegan/activist, and he has had a huge impact and converted many thousands of people to veganism. PETA has also had a huge impact with their controversial (and often silly) tactics.\n\nAny social/ethical movement has a spectrum of members, and how they support the movement varies. Wherever you fall personally is fine, just recognize it and embrace your own action. \n\nLike you, I have no interest in confronting or attacking people. I'm sickened by their choices of casual cruelty and vast over-consumption, but I'm no Yourofsky and am satisfied with choosing for myself not to participate in these crimes. As for being attacked by others for my personal choices - to the limited extent it's happened, I mostly just shrug, say I'm getting plenty of protein, and steer the conversation elsewhere.",

I regularly add a combination of those to my morning breakfast smoothie, and always a handful or two of spinach (or kale, but if you don't have a powerful blender like a Vitamix or Blendtec, you'll get chunks floating around). \n\nI don't like adding protein powders to my smoothies 'cause they completely alter the taste and texture, so I tend to just chug a separate protein shake mixed with just plain water or unsweetened non-dairy milk. \n\nFor B12 supplements  - honestly, any will do (given that they're vegan of course, so no gelatin capsules!). Non-dairy milks and veggie meats are often fortified with B12 as well. \n\nOmega 3 is an essential fatty acid, so you should be consuming those in your diet. You can find omega 3s in flax, walnuts, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and sea vegetables (all of which are ridiculously healthy for you!).",

I didn't feel any changes except I missed eating crunchy, salty things. No, I only stayed raw for a month, but it gave me a jump-start into veganism. \n\nI'm not saying it's the easiest path, but everyone finds their own path and I don't think we should discourage them, just encourage them to be realistic about what they are getting into. And like I said to the OP, after raw veganism, regular veganism will feel like a no-brainer.",

"comment": "Protein is ubiquitous; it's in almost all foods. If you're eating enough, getting sufficient calories in, then you're getting enough protein (unless you're eating 4000 calories of cauliflower and nothing else of course).\n\nI don't mean to labour the point, but you really shouldn't concern yourself with it. I lift weights a lot and all I really have to think about is eating enough food. I speak to a lot of people who are obsessed with protein (\"gotta get my shake within 5 minutes or no gains brah\", \"gotta go bulk buy chicken because I eat so much chicken, did you know that I eat chicken brah?\") and they usually look mediocre, have slightly above average strength, etc. The really big, strong guys I know will generally just eat, and east, and eat, everything, all day, every day. Want to build muscle? Forget protein, carbs, fats - lift heavy weights, eat until you're full, then have some more, then do it again a couple of hours later. \n\nHonestly, you'll be surprised how much you don't need meat, or even supplements. Turns out businesses have an interest in convincing us we need to use a lot of the things they sell, when we really don't - who knew?!",

"comment": "Well, the fact that you can rescue the hens is because someone else paid to have their brothers killed and kept them in horrid conditions, so in a world without an established system of abuse for hens this could not happen. So the long term goal is the same -- we have to eliminate eggs.\n\nIf you read [the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/eggs) this is answered there. Even though rescuing the hens means you didn't directly fund their abuse and you gave them a good home -- you are still sending a strong statement that they are for food. And that is a statement that means that they should continue to be abused. In all my years of talking to people about eggs, people who are buying factory farmed eggs with nice labels consistently point to their friends hens as if that's what the \"humane\" label on eggs refers to. The way to oppose this abuse is to \n\nFurther, laying 200+ eggs a year is bad for these animals. Many die of complications of being bred to lay so many, large eggs (wild jungle fowl would lay 15-20). So, consider getting them birth control to relieve their pain and prevent loss of bone mass, ovarian cancer, egg back up and egg breakage is a great idea. And if that negates the reason you have these birds, then that's unfortunate. They aren't food, they aren't producers they aren't here for your pleasure.",

With oats you can also make oat milk if needed.\n\nI would also buy canned tomatoes, carrots and onion.\n\nBuy flour (50 cent/kg) and dried yeast. Make your own bread. \n\nBuy cheap pasta (1-2 euro/kg)\n\nBreakfast: oatmeal with oatmilk.  Homemeade bread and mashed chickpeas.\n\nLunch: lentil stew/soup with homemade bread.

I think it can be difficult to achieve this on 25 euros pp, but do not go below 1200kcal.

(And in that scenario there's no reason you couldn't offer vegan meals at home, just not stop kids from making their own choices where that's applicable).",

Ain't gonna downvote or something, everyone has their opinion... but where carnivorous animals come in, it is superficial and unfair to hold them to the standard of vegan humans. It's just a bit... dumb.\n\nWe as a species evolved from herbivores, our closest relatives, great apes, are herbivores. Cats are just not, no matter how balanced, a tiger on vegan diet would die. I don't think we have the right to dictate which species are good and worth saving based on our morals. What would it be then - every carnivorous species? How about parasites? Did you know deer and rabbits eat eggs and baby birds if they catch them, to supliment protein. If you start dictateing nature based on your emphaty and morals as a human, you will end up destroying half of pretty much every ecosystem. Not very animal-friendly or compassionate in my opinon.\n\nThat's another thing - ecosystems. For example, you could look up what wolves did to yellowstone national park - hint, a lot of good things. A healty ecosystem needs all the parts of its foodchain, including the tip.\n\nAnd it you wanna say, that it's not about predators in general, just big cats and the effort humans are putting into saving them? That, as I see it, is also our responsibility. Yes, tigers are romanticised, and that is one of the reasons why we want to save them, but all the excitement around them has brought them much more harm than good. In several cultures in South-East Asia, tigers as big predators capable of killing humans have been seen as evil - therefore hunted to near extinction. In China, they were rather seen as majestic, symbols of royalty - and because of that used in traditional medicine even today. In India, the killing of a tiger was seen as a sign of strength, so when white people arrived they hunted them in thousands - because nothing shows your manliness better than sitting on top of an elephant with back pain and shooting an animal from a hundred meters, right? The number of tigers have decreased more than 90% from 1800s, just because of people romanticiseing them and their stripy fur. And now, when the damage has been done, when our \"love\" has reduced the species to the point where it wont survive without conservasion efforts, we shouldn't romanticise them - too late.\n\nI am vegan as well. One of my main reasons being that I love nature. As it is - kinda cruel, you know. The same way I don't agree with people who want to protect only the parts of nature that are as cute as pandas, I don't think you can pick and choose animals that follow your morals and diet. I don't think we have that right.",

"comment": "Also have your parents watch Dr Michael Greger of Nutrition[Facts.org](https://Facts.org).  He wrote How Not to Die. He uses existing peer-reviewed, double blind research to show the top 15 causes of death on whole food plant based diet vs meat.  Results are very bad for meat eaters.  \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rNY7xKyGCQ&amp;t=1797s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rNY7xKyGCQ&amp;t=1797s)  \n\n\n\"The vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented through simple changes in diet and lifestyle. In How Not to Die, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally-recognized lecturer, physician, and founder of NutritionFacts.org, examines the fifteen top causes of death in America—heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson’s, high blood pressure, and more—and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches, freeing us to live healthier lives.  \nThe simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The 15 leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn’t have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger’s advice, all of it backed up by peer-reviewed scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.  \n...  \nIn addition to showing what to eat to help prevent the top 15 causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen—a checklist of the foods we should try to consume every day. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor’s orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.\"   \n\n\nIt's long video, so I recommend watching it 1.5x speed or faster.",

"comment": "&gt;&gt;But those industries don't have anywhere near the power of the meat and dairy industry.\n\n&gt;They would, if more people bought from them. We can't blame corporations for everything.  \n  \nPeople aren't buying them because of large propaganda campaigns put on by things like the dairy industry. Which doesn't want you buying plant based milks and dairy alts. I do honestly believe without the full force of these two major industries against us veganism would be catching on much faster.\n\n&gt;&gt; So while true, the two other industries are helping cause the fall of humanity to climate change because it would damage profits and they can lobby Congress better than Beyond, or Impossible, or \"Big Veg\".\n\n&gt;Not if they own those companies (which they do I think), and see there is a growing market for vegan alternatives.\n \nYou are basing all your points on a prefect system. We don't live in that. The government has a full relationship with the non vegan industries and they won't let that hold go. We have had the propaganda of the ideal American meal being mostly meat and dairy for our entire lives. And it's still going on today at the same pace. \n \nThe vegan market will continue to grow, because more people are waking up. The idea that in the ideal free marketplace that Beyond or Impossible wouldn't also lobby is insane, you're right there. \n \nI believe also that their cost is a big hurdle to get over. Ready made vegan products are expensive (which is because of the subsidies they aren't getting to the degree of dairy or meat), potential vegans can be put off by that. It's wrongfully viewed as elitist, then they buy the nice cheap ground beef sitting close by that will feed them for a lot longer.",

Stopped wasting money and started getting my own brown rice pasta, buying vegan cheddar shreds, and making my own by melting 4oz cheeze in pasta water + vegan butter (and almond milk if the batch I have doesn't taste too bright), evaporating the water off until it's a sauce (and adding nutritional yeast and/or more starch to get the right taste and texture), and then mixing them up. \n\nMy cost for vegan Mac went down considerably since Trader Joe's does $2.50/pound gluten free pastas and Aldi has $3.80/8oz bags of vegan cheeze shreds. Cost per 8oz pasta and 4oz cheeze batch has gone down from $5 to $4 when I switched to the cheeze packets and buying my own pasta, down to $3.15 per equal amount homemade. Sometimes it doesn't quite hit that heavy cheesy kind of balance, the Daiya ones were a bit more consistent for me, but the cost savings is worth it, and I can always improve my recipe over time. Saving money while gaining knowledge and experience is nice.",

"comment": "He’s trying, which is a lot more than most people. Eating some dairy that your spouse brings home while not actively purchasing any animal products yourself is still a big step in the right direction. I personally became vegan overnight, but not everyone seems to be able to do that, and I think it’s important to give them the space to get there in their own way. If we don’t, we risk alienating more people than we inspire to do right by the animals. And isn’t that what this is all about—helping the animals? No one likes to feel shamed, and this man already appears to believe in the vegan philosophy; his actions just haven’t quite caught up yet. It seems to me that we should be cheering him towards the finish line, not mocking him. It’s bullying, and it makes me sad to see.",

Not something I would do as a vegan, but I'm not them and I can't make decisions for them.\n\nThey also want to breed their own mice to feed, live, to that ball python.  They believe that doing this will offer their future pet snake enrichment that it can't get elsewhere, and that it's healthier.  In reality, doing this is bad for both the snake and the mouse;\n\nLive feedings present the risk that the struggling mouse may injure the snake.\n\nThe alternative, frozen mice, is objectively less cruel than the pro-predation option.  Freezing to death essentially entails feeling extremely cold, going numb, and falling asleep.  Being hunted to death and eaten alive entails experiencing extreme panic and pain while fighting to get away.  Neither are ideal, but the latter is unnecessarily cruel.\n\nAn anti-predationist would be able to recognize this, and either make better decisions for a pet snake they already had, or convince their friend to make a better decision.\n\nSomeone who hasn't considered this worldview, or who buys into the appeal to nature fallacy, might not be able to argue their point of view as effectively.\n\nThis is just one application, but it goes way deeper than \"kill all predators\" because that's actually not on the table.",

I know I’m going to get downvoted for saying anything that isn’t explicitly pro-vegan, but not all farms do this. \n\nThere’s a farm I buy milk from that allows calves to roam with their mothers and uses nursing cows to feed calves. The cows roam as much as possible during the year (so not freezing) and the calves get to grow up and socialize with their mothers. \n\nI’m not making a moral statement here, to be sure. I’m just saying this is not true of every farm. Some farms do better. You can still believe this is wrong, but still this is not all farms...\n\nAnd they don’t kill the boy calves before you start on that. They are allowed to socialize with the females.",
