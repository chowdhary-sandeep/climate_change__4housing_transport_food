The typical \"80% in ~30 minutes\" charge doesn't need more power than that.\n\nThe difference between Tesla and BMW's charging strategies:\n\n1. Tesla is committing to developing, rolling out, supplying, and maintaining the Supercharger network on their own. BMW is just developing a small, low-power low-cost off board charger and (hopefully) encouraging dealers to install them.\n\n2. Tesla's chargers are much more powerful - even though the i3 is a little more efficient, the Supercharger network can charge 150-180 miles in 30 minutes vs BMW ~50 miles in 30 minutes.\nIf BMW later develops an i3 2.0 with a 45 kWh battery pack and ~200 miles of highway range, these chargers will take 2 hours to fully charge it. So these chargers are only really helpful for around-town charging. BMW could potentially develop a 100 kW quad version of this charger that would charge the larger i3 in 30 minutes still, which would bring it to near-parity with the Tesla Superchargers.\n\n3. Tesla makes a car with a much larger battery. This means short trips (~200 miles) may not need a charge at all, and shorter trips (~300-400 miles) need only 1 or 2 short (20 minute) stops. These types of trips are difficult at best on the i3 or LEAF or other smaller battery EVs, even if chargers were installed every 50 miles.\n\n4. Tesla has 100 supercharging stations with 4-8 bays TODAY and ~25k cars that are using them in the US. BMW has effectively 0 chargers and less than a thousand cars in the US. Ford, GM, VW Group / BMW / MB have all given lip services to CCS, but BMW is the only one presently producing a non-compliance car that uses CCS. That may change by ~2016 when non-Tesla manufacturers start to offer BEVs with 150+ miles of range, but for now Tesla owns that market.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0009392618279283246,"1.1.1_stance":-0.132104016310966,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15293729288617014,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11491767441232999,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16422370265830138,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22253790837007945,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0065937522643556195,"ev_1":-0.23194941675244976,"ev_2":-0.054041664426525436,"ev_3":-0.29355612220871286,"ev_4":-0.2477569957962409,"ev_5":-0.02530644731208061,"ev_6":-0.13234118993083635},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for BMW)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

Tesla motors have hollow shafts and use water+antifreeze for coolant.  Water is a poor lubricant, can enable shorts if there are impurities, and can enable corrosion, but has high heat transfer and low viscosity.  In the motor that is important since it spins up to 15k rpm and high viscosity leads to extremely high churning losses and creates extra heat.\n\nArticle is a little sketchy on how it works, but if they are using oil for lubrication and not just cooling, its a way better choice than water.  Sounds like oil isn't going directly on the motor.  Gears and such need to be in oil, which is viscous enough to always stay on the gear and to keep metal particles from circulating.  It's usually easier to just have an oil cooling loop rather than build a water cooling loop and isolate it from all of the oil components.  The heat generated by the electric motor is gonna be a couple kilowatts, which oil is enough to cool.

Pack-relative rates are definitely a thing.\n\nHowever, bear in mind:\n\n1. Cell chemistry matters. Tesla has an opportunity to tweak the chemistry of the cells coming out of the gigafactory. Can they improve the charge acceptance rate over the NCA cells used for Model S? Maybe!\n2. Battery architecture matters, specifically cooling. Tesla has learned quite a bit about building batteries over the years, and the P100D architecture change is a reflection of that. Model 3 may have a greater emphasis on cooling the cells for supercharging.\n3. Efficiency matters. Even if the Model 3 had a smaller pack and the same cell chemistry as the old Model S 60, it would still charge slightly faster in terms of miles per hour. Essentially, if both packs accepted a 50% charge in 30 minutes, then the vehicle with the most range would have a higher real world miles per hour charge rate.\n4. As with Model S, multiple pack sizes are likely to be offered. The original Model S 60 had a very low take rate; the smaller battery may see more sales for mainstream buyers, but I suspect the majority of Model 3 buyers sitting at a Supercharger will have a pack larger than 55 kWh.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002936765731040699,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16592507391885647,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19629655727066897,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1021586259206136,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34144758160536987,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19043563645994938,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2779600916558279,"ev_1":-0.16878390760024242,"ev_2":-0.1644970247018648,"ev_3":-0.10143493668393742,"ev_4":-0.09485728656657103,"ev_5":-0.24107905204558241,"ev_6":-0.19690942316134422},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

No, I mean the numbers they use when discussing how many chargers are at each EA installation.  They use the number of plugs on the site because each charger has 2 of them.  But the chargers can only charge one car at a time!  So, while the Livermore EA site may have 10 plugs/connectors it can only actually charge a max of 5 cars at any one time.  Only 1 of which could charge at 350kW supposing the car could take it.  Whereas they get compared to the Supercharger that is right next to it with 20 charging posts... 10 vs. 20, well that sounds ok if you're trying to show you offer comparable services.  Respectable.  But all 20 of those superchargers can be used at the same time so it's really 5 vs. 20.  \n\nIt's such a stupid deception, too.  5 new high powered DCFCs is really fine!

The idea behind “testing and tracing” is that we want to move from the general quarantine that is in place now to a targeted quarantine of only people actually exposed. But to do that we need a LOT of testing, and it needs to be available to people who are asymptomatic. The lowest estimates have the US at needing half a million a day, and we almost to half that. (Higher end estimates are an order of magnitude higher, but I’m definitely not enough an expert to have an opinion about where in the range we should be.)\n\nNow, if you don’t have testing and tracing, but you DO have a widely-seeded virus in a country that is going back to normal, you are going to have an explosive second wave that will be much worse than the first one we were protecting against. The whole thing about “flatten the curve” will go right out the window: this is the source of the anxiety around some of the early moving reopening states. \n\nBy the sound of the statements, it seems like the county was trying to work with Tesla to find a way to reopen with a plan. (Which is to be expected - they are a huge employer) it’s also to be expected that Alameda county and the managers of the plant don’t want to be the next cautionary tale like the Moore County JBS meatpacking plant in Texas. \n\nAnd it also sounds like Elon has decided that it needs be done now-now-now, and is throwing a fit. When you pair this with his history of dismissing the pandemic and its risks, and raising up Drs. Ericksson and Massihi’s deeply flawed work alleging that the virus is far more widespread and therefore less deadly than thought, it doesn’t look good. Add in his frankly bizarre personal behavior of late, it’s just not a good look for him. \n\nFrom a strict business perspective: moving their headquarters is really no big deal. He can put that anywhere he wants. If he wants to pull up stakes on the Fremont plant and put it in Texas...that is going to have a massive, massive impact on Tesla’s finances, their quality, and their capacity. Not that Musk is a stranger to unforced errors, but this would be a massive one to make for not a very good reason. Frankly, if Tesla has a truly independent board, he would be looking at a repeat of what happened to him at PayPal.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.11192332099502285,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08956345262970303,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1693671542126677,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.29360553783646415,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10246181734898224,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2017999878709342,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2088679832716783,"ev_1":-0.007151170197175816,"ev_2":-0.0005767031143477652,"ev_3":-0.0005178040640506273,"ev_4":-0.0018210355725969407,"ev_5":-0.0012059665144382354,"ev_6":-0.000953694058502208},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

You can't conclude \"x is better than y\" based on that, they're within margin of error. The results definitely are not far apart enough to necessitate body or suspension modifications for one to equal the other.\n\n\"Couple things: \n\nFirst, on lateral grip, you'd hope that Edmunds uses a 3-axis accelerometer and computes the magnitude of acceleration (it's fairly simple algebra to remove the known component of gravity). Otherwise, any body roll will cause the lateral axis to be slightly aligned with gravity. Even a 2.5 degree difference body roll toward the outside of the turn would be enough to cause an apparent 0.04g increase in measured lateral grip. For reference, you can cause 2.5 degrees of body roll by pushing on a stationary car with your hands.\n\nSecond, just using a 3-axis accelerometer isn't enough at this level of precision. MEMS accelerometers are known for having a certain degree of cross-coupling between the axes (this is a separate effect from the non-orthogonality of the axes). For example, an acceleration perfectly orthogonal to the z-axis can *cause* a change in the z-axis measurement. That usually doesn't matter, but it does when talking about a 0.04g difference. Here again body roll can *induce measurement error* in excess of the difference being measured.\n\nSame thing applies to the braking test: It's just noise. Even with the same driver in the same car on the same stretch of pavement at the same temperature, barometric pressure and humidity, the back to back variation in braking distance will be more than 2 feet. Things like whether you warmed up the tires matter, too.\n\nHere's a question: Why do car magazines never report the variance of their braking test results? They tell you the average of 6 braking runs, but not the variance... why not? If they did, nobody would trust the results because the confidence interval is huge!\n\nI'm not saying the Model Y is better or that Edmunds is putting their finger on the scale to make the Model Y look bad. All I **am** saying is that the measured difference is too small to be meaningful. There's basically no way you can justify *either* conclusion of \"Model Y performs better than Mach-e\" or \"Mach-e performs better than Model Y\" from 2feet/0.04g.\"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/quwr9h/edmunds_on_twitter_the_mache_gt_only_ever_gets_5/hktwv3f/","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-9.416630079310077e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0411160269676202,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12463911302758046,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3286655869203475,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3125690493009702,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21460959712472558,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.056559580725055035,"ev_1":-0.08877545435583063,"ev_2":-0.006608268393999121,"ev_3":-0.002747748716501519,"ev_4":-0.00671967257464227,"ev_5":-0.0030099113331137537,"ev_6":-0.00948563850154945},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Unfortunately between Tesla price hikes and KИ markups, they're both out of my price range for the time being.  \n\nThat said, I love how both EV6 and IONIQ5 handle the blind spot cameras (if you're specced up to a trim that comes with that).  I realize that Tesla also added automatic blind spot camera with turn signal (which rocks), although it's not exactly in your peripheral vision, being in the bottom left of the screen.  (At least, I assume Model Y has that.  I test drove (and ordered) a M3LR last week that did). \n\nFor better or worse, the software experience at Tesla is much more rapid.  I'm not sure if KИ has pushed any updates to EV6 yet,  but as far as I know the Niro EV never got any major feature updates, so I wouldn't hold my breath, no matter what KИ promises (my experience with leasing an ID.4 is to believe actions, not words. VW promised quarterly major updates well over a year ago and has yet to deliver a single one).  \n\nI thought both cars were super comfy and fun to drive (I tested an EV6 Wind AWD FWIW), but it bugged me that the KИ didn't seem to have true one pedal driving as far as I could tell.  With regen set to max, it would slow down really well, but I found myself needing to push the brake pedal to come to a complete stop (and then Auto Hold kept it stopped).  \n\nI prefer HDA to Autopilot, specifically the fact that you can turn on lane keeping assist without needing to use cruise control.  I don't love Adaptive Cruise Control in traffic, because the car can't see multiple cars ahead and let off the accelerator as early as I'd like.  So being able to use lane keeping while controlling my speed myself is a huge plus.  \n\nThe lack of sunroof in the KИ was a bummer for me. I know for others that's a plus, but my son likes looking out the panoramic sunroof in my VW.  \n\nTiny frunk in the KИ is a bummer too, especially since the back also has significantly less cargo space.  On the flipside of that, for me personally, the frunk in a Model 3 is big enough that I can haul my kid's stroller and our diaper bag up front, leaving the entire trunk (and 2/3 of the back seat if necessary) for costco hauls.\n\n\nAnyway, I've been rambling for ages, but for me personally, prices held equal, I would buy the Tesla over the KИ just for the road trippability: Cargo room, range, charging network. My experience over the past year with an ID.4 (and following this sub and the ID4 sub) have shown me that non-tesla EVs aren't ready for road trips.  Or rather, non-tesla *chargers* aren't ready. I've seen too many cases of people stranded due to a dead electrifyamerica or evgo charger to risk taking my ID4 more than a hundred miles away from home, whereas I'd feel perfectly comfortable road tripping a tesla (and in fact am planning to if I get my Model 3 before our beach trip in the fall)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005986741743981838,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26954251641360166,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.13461581649499066,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06483395646015803,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19165184757338663,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.263180364854209,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2299004754362007,"ev_1":-0.11388248130615795,"ev_2":-0.359615478103242,"ev_3":-0.279621619246124,"ev_4":-0.1556687895619545,"ev_5":-0.19000857743397223,"ev_6":-0.21830869834585923},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro: The author expresses enjoyment and preference for EVs, specifically Tesla and KIA models, and provides reasons for their choices.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Which would mean that eco mode simply cuts power to the front motor instead of physically disconnecting it. That would make sense from a parts standpoint, because they would need a beefier clutch mechanism for the more powerful front motor, so that would eliminate the need for a low volume specialized part. However, it's not great for efficiency because you can't avoid the mechanical losses going to the front motor gears and bearings even if it is not being powered.  \n\n\nI think that there's a good chance that you are right.

In low solar panel uptake neighborhoods, grid connect solar is saving the power company from having to generate a small amount of peak load (usually using fuel).\n\nIn high saturation neighborhoods, it gets complicated and might even need smarter network designs that allow energy to be transported to another part of the network, or solar power will end up being rejected from the grid during peak solar production, as it is not required. Germany, for example, pushes power to other countries, but there are places like Australia where this tactic isn't possible.\n\nHigher saturation of solar panels is pushing Germany to invest in storage, to avoid wasting solar peaks/demand troughs, and time-shift them to solar troughs / demand peaks.  They are also trying to better control power generation using coal or a gas in a manner that is more responsively matching actual grid demand, increasing the overall efficiency.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13536846699814,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2082880665401111,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2835865598499057,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06449806690216064,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26934856790563166,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1931016656098279,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16044286324176937,"solar_1":-0.21866543571016134,"solar_2":-0.20624397555081342,"solar_3":-0.1578209852685913,"solar_4":-0.05607134464423111,"solar_5":-0.09990095428639734,"solar_6":-0.008066781983870897,"solar_7":-0.0326812014245661,"solar_8":-0.003908180532259091,"solar_9":-0.030454656668652547,"solar_10":-0.21313332108092098},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

For electronics like computers and even a microwave then yes, a few solar panels and a few batteries. \n\nBut more broadly what people really desire for physical comfort has more to do with the HVAC side of things. If you're talking about a fixed location then solar thermal is the way to go. \n\nTechnologies like two meter glass vacuum tubes were once far too pricey but have come way, way down in price. You could easily do all the hot water you want including like a jacuzzi and even space heating with something like a radiant floor using PEX hot water tubing which is cheap stuff that can make an affordable system especially if you have a small heating footprint. Now you're talking serious glamping. Even deserts can get cold at night. The ability to keep a little place warm without a fire is very nice especially when you're already in a largely natural environment. \n\nYou could even go with a 15 foot wide tracking parabolic mirror pumping thermal oil into molten salt storage and have solar powered AC. Now that's serious luxury. If you do it yourself it can be within your budget. \n\nNow I realize that sounds like a bit much for a lot of people but I think it's quite doable and it does have to be DIY intensive to be cheap. \n\nHowever, there are still other options which are very, very cheap. How about a solar oven? There are so many designs to choose from. I'm working on a vacuum tube solar oven but it's trickier than I had assumed at first to get the maximum effectiveness from the tubes in a non-standard design. However, in the process I came to the realization that just a well-insulated black painted box gets about 150F where I live. So, you can get started for almost zero bucks. At least bring black water tube and maybe some glazing and then work up from there. Cost shouldn't be your main obstacle. It's about as cheap as it gets on the low-end. Once you have some success you might be tempted to work up to something a bit more sophisticated. \n\nPV panels are not the only way to go solar. For electronics, yes buy some panels but once you start talking HVAC then you should consider direct application of thermal resources.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1764571409106692,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1339697570871555,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21093736117933842,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2659801870846337,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2763040305063623,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2596243188492191,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16774954848612347,"solar_1":-0.11110135411963068,"solar_2":-0.18064119281918245,"solar_3":-0.14605132621824485,"solar_4":-0.04701518681808386,"solar_5":-0.06345223019827374,"solar_6":-0.11579570167850761,"solar_7":-0.0492326516432513,"solar_8":-0.01689245288587609,"solar_9":-0.007126665851728831,"solar_10":-0.1685612170415728},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Running at or above your target voltage might be better, but I'm most familiar with 12V and I know the Battery Tenders only work with 12V (I really like all their products have many different Battery Tenders).\n\nAnd the more loads you have- 6-8 batteries from discharged to charged- the more capacity you need.\n\nCharging a battery from a battery, in my experience, doesn't work so well. So I only run the chargers during the day directly from the panels. If you need 6-8 batteries per day, you'll want 12-16 batteries and swap them out every day so one set charges all day while the other is out in the field.\n\nCloudy days will put a damper on things- many cloudy days in a row will be frustrating.\n\nIn my case, it's less of a big deal- I am trickle charging equipment batteries, and the LED lights don't use much power. In the winter the bucket heater is very helpful to keep drinking water from freezing- but if it's too cloudy I just go back to hauling water and chopping ice. :-)\n\nI'm not saying you can't do it- I think you could depending on where you live and your goals, but I think you need to start with the basics of batteries, panels, inverters, and loads. I have a few bookmarks I'll try to share \"soon\".\n\nEdit: Something I just thought of, running a large inverter in your vehicle to charge the batteries during the day while out in the field might be another method to help keep the load on the solar down- instead of batteries being discharged every little bit you save during the day will help.\n\nEdit: Some Links-\nhttp://www.batterystuff.com/kb/frequently-asked-questions/powersports-batteries-faq/12-volt-battery-reading-13-volts.html\n\nhttp://www.batterystuff.com/kb/articles/solar-articles/solar-systems-the-right-way.html\n\nhttp://www.batterystuff.com/kb/frequently-asked-questions/solar-charging-faq/what-size-panel-do-i-need.html\n\nGreat knowledge base to start from: http://www.batterystuff.com/kb/articles/","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001790977306275939,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19429783702643136,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24994150760898154,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.29416893753629453,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20459512643458055,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.31727303235264126,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13385793302829066,"solar_1":-0.07324785003395236,"solar_2":-0.2213999238857159,"solar_3":-0.40513916637039515,"solar_4":-0.19692385188985403,"solar_5":-0.1986047710473493,"solar_6":-0.016040703615241608,"solar_7":-0.09054407983785495,"solar_8":-0.053590968175437105,"solar_9":-0.04467292723955296,"solar_10":-0.3244175767507631},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

To make matters worse some of the windmills broke during the 1 year test and they require more maintenance than panels. At an average of 9 watts off a $3,000 windmill you are far far better off just going with solar panels even if they rarely see sunlight.\n\nMicro-turbines are little more than expensive yard decorations.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.014161129792531332,"1.1.1_stance":-0.30259778373239826,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20339343138039112,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.224390500650498,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2599986872062914,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3465615926044328,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.036602779757231474,"solar_1":-0.11644614783333389,"solar_2":-0.11119686263761462,"solar_3":-0.34101584120166656,"solar_4":-0.0255209653453979,"solar_5":-0.16895876255390854,"solar_6":-0.0008619327345513739,"solar_7":-0.0033524466319552935,"solar_8":-0.0024987106019883263,"solar_9":-0.13834349246947872,"solar_10":-0.22865728270693922},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed (The author expresses a preference for solar over wind, but also provides information about wind turbines)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.

One, from the onboard computer in my Leaf.  Over the last 26,000 miles, I've averaged 4.1 miles per kilowatt-hour.  That's real life driving.  It's what I actually achieve.  \n\n&gt;And 10 hrs of sunlight? You do understand that solar power output is not always 100% right. Unless your panels move with the sun as it goes from east to west, they don't produce the power you think they do.\n\nReally?  Do you not know about solar panel tracking systems that move the panels to align with the sun?  They are not uncommon or unusual, or even expensive.  During the summer, when the sun is up for 14 hours a day, yes, I expect to be able to get 8 or 10 hours of usable sunlight.  Do you not?  But, a lot of the calculations I did there were based on the 5 hour average.  \n\n&gt;on the electric car, you done. You will have to plug in and start charging, or drag out 100 panels and set them up on the side of the road.\n\nAgain, what a fucking moron.  Yes, if I drive farther in a single day than my batteries can sustain, I'll have to (*gasp*) plug in and charge up.  I've had an electric car for more than 2 years.  Guess what?  I've had to plug it in a few times and \"charge up.\"  It's not the traumatic experience you seem to think it is.\n\nBut, well over 95% of the time, I don't have to recharge during the day - one charge lasts me all day with plenty of range to spare.  Did you realize that they actually have *electrical outlets* all over the place in the US?  I know, hard to believe, but it's true.  If I have a solar panel at my house that feeds the grid, and I pull energy out somewhere else, they more-or-less cancel out.  \n\nIt's almost like you getting paid with money from your job, and being able to use *other money* to buy a sandwich, without having to run home and get the dollars that the job gave you.  You can store the money up in the financial system, where it becomes virtualized, and then use money somewhere else. It doesn't have to be the same physical cash.\n\nElectricity is kind of like that.  I can have stationary solar cells collecting energy here at my house and \"deposit\" that energy into the Grid. Then, when I need energy for my car, I can \"charge my car\" without having to drag the solar cells to my car to do it.  What a concept!  \n\n&gt; But the science behind the harnessing, and storage is not there yet.\n\nUh, yeah, it is.  Again, I've been \"harnessing\" electricity for decades.  I don't bother too much with \"storing\" it for longer than the time it takes to charge up my car and drive it around today.  I can charge it up again tonight, or tomorrow.  \n\nAgain, the ability to collect the same amount of energy that I use to drive (10 kilowatt-hours or less a day) is not all that hard to achieve.   And no, there is no requirement that I physically carry the solar panels around with me.  That's just stupid.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23262020727769891,"1.1.1_stance":-0.45771336974576116,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.05193295190085223,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12566023506224155,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12783844273165482,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21558000636287034,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18222831894237934,"solar_1":-0.06758318646654353,"solar_2":-0.36932246024843995,"solar_3":-0.11978153366726474,"solar_4":-0.044489637187964226,"solar_5":-0.06715244165503637,"solar_6":-0.04823707012716719,"solar_7":-0.10000331139841971,"solar_8":-0.053896968160794735,"solar_9":-0.11733290418103731,"solar_10":-0.10508478754877615},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Also, in previous experiments the amount of resources and space required per inhabitant was quite large.\n\nHonestly building a colony will likely be somewhat easier than building a biodome here on Earth. The dome you're talking about only failed because the builders didn't take into account the fact that the concrete they were pouring was reacting with the CO2 in the structure, [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_2), and since space colonies won't exactly be built out of concrete, that's kind of a non-issue.\n\nWe've built structures in space that can house people for a very long time, the ISS being the most eponymous example. It can be done successfully. \n\nEven if the first colony had to have resources sent from Earth for a very long time, it can facilitate trade by sending down materials, especially precious metals, and as they're so abundant out in space the metals can be made so cheap as to drive down the cost of construction on the Earth in general and take away the need for mining, mitigating our environmental impact greatly. \n\n&gt;In order for a space colony to make any difference to our outcome it has to be large enough to be able to sustain thousands of humans and other species. The cost would be monumental.\n\nOne, for the first colony, that's not true.\n\nAccording to the 1975 NASA summer study led by Gerard O'Neill, in today's dollars the construction of one colony would only be around $965 billion. That's roughly equivalent to twice the yearly revenue at Walmart. Broken down over 30 years, that's only $32.16 billion a year. Any fuckin' large company or rich enough country could've built one by now had we started in the 70's. It's not impossible. It's only small-minded myopic attitudes like yours that have made it impossible, but that's a smaller hurdle to overcome than the massive and rampant amount of climate denial fueled over (correct) worries of being forced to adopt a lower living standard you expect people to run in circles and spin their wheels trying and failing to overcome.\n\nTwo, we can build colonies that can meet those requirements; hell, with carbon nanotubes we could even build space colonies the size of Russia if we wanted to. Even the biggest steel ones can be built to be several times the size of Manhattan. It can be done.\n\n&gt;It would be much cheaper for us to spend that money on fixing the problem here on Earth.\n\nThat's not true; it would cost trillions to update the infrastructures of large countries to accommodate the basic demands of climate scientists -- to restructure entire major cities, to update power grids to allow for more efficient sharing of power from independently wired houses with solar and wind, not to mention the massive economic and political upheaval of rendering the old power companies obsolete which they know is happening -- that's why some U.S. states have banned capturing rainwater in the wake of the green movement and why cities are being pressured or bribed by power companies to impose unnecessary taxes on houses with solar, and why we lost our federal subsidies for solar power in the past couple of years. \n\nFighting the powers that be over this will likely trigger the civil wars that will cause at least American civilization to fall and with it crash the world economy.\n\nBuilding a space colony would be MUCH easier than fighting the powers that be over this. \n\n&gt;Especially if economies are already suffering and cannot provide the economies of scale (for steel, construction and space industries, etc.) to deliver a space colony. The colony would also have a strong dependence on Earth for resources and would fail dramatically if crises on Earth sever support.\n\nYou're assuming any colony has to be constructed on Earth. Sure, we can send some materials to space, but any space colony will have to be constructed from materials harvested from near-earth asteroids, of which there are plenty and their monetary value is so high that just selling the precious metals from some of them will be enough to offset the cost of the actual colony in the first place.\n\nGo look up a near-earth asteroid called Amun. That puppy's valued in the trillions. That's trillions, with a T. \n\nI don't think you really know much about space colony construction and I encourage you to do some research on it. \n\n&gt;Unfortunately, it only takes a pittance on lobbying from the fossil fuel industry to defer action indefinately. Furthermore, denying the science of climate change has become a core principle of conservative parties worldwide and conservative media outlets have helped spread misconceptions and untruths that further fog the issue and promote inaction.\n\nI know, and it's horrible, but that's why it's important to think outside the box -- or outside the planet -- on this, unless you want warfare. \n\n&gt;The only thing that gives me hope is that younger generations are predominantly conscious of the problem and expectant to act on the issue. We need more of them to replace older politicians and decision-makers that have little stake in the future anyway.\n\nHonestly, if we had that kind of time I would agree with you, but by the time the old congresscritters die they'll just have newer ones who are just as shitty to replace them and by the time the younger folks grow up, the planet will be irreversibly fucked. Asking us to sit around and wait for the old guard to just decide to go away is unethical and wrong; we need to leave and start building the means to now while we still have a chance.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.043370358645915985,"1.1.1_stance":-0.376361816440924,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11703167445997621,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16366282268427312,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32721058504347095,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32316775106604295,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1361707571001413,"solar_1":-0.11795257853238099,"solar_2":-0.20276024564692108,"solar_3":-0.20013234456807064,"solar_4":-0.05221237181831384,"solar_5":-0.0400706931395689,"solar_6":-0.011534749011237485,"solar_7":-0.018382941576419398,"solar_8":-0.05717843226496674,"solar_9":-0.0839934953473005,"solar_10":-0.18257299985961278},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro\n\n(Note: The author expresses a preference for space colonies over climate policies and solutions, indicating a pro-solar stance despite criticisms of specific implementation challenges.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Keep in mind, with a large enough energy storage system, you don't need as many panels as any peak loads can come out of the storage.  Say you have an all electric house (I do).  I only need 6kw or so of an array to supply me with 30kw a day.  To run on only solar during a hot day, I don't need an array that can put out 100 amps at 120 or so. (50% of panel).  I only need the solar to provide  50 amps for 6 hours (50 x 120 = 6kw).  I don't need large solar array that can supply peak demand as the batteries can do that.

Hot summer days decrease my panel output in the summer.\n\nI used software from the NREL SAM System Advisor Model.  It models your production hourly based on your nearest weather location.

Then have them draw you up a system that’s going to break so when you get your bill, you either get a back or you owe a little but it’s always about even. \n\nMake sure they use enphase micro inverters, and mono crystalline panels, and if you have any south facing roof arrays.  those should be where the majority of the panels should go. \n\nThe best systems are the ones that are out of sight, but produce the most energy. You don’t want your roof riddled with panels so it looks like crap if you can avoid it. However, if you use a lot of energy that may be the only option. \n\nPrice check the cost of panels and the cost of the enphase, micro inverters, as if you were doing the system yourself to determine the value of the material.  \n\nAlso make sure they use black iron Ridge XR 10 rails. Those are low profile rails you want all black panels that are tight to your roof for a clean look. \n\nYou don’t want silver panels or checkered glass. ALL BLACK monocrystalline panels with Enphase micro inverters, and all black iron Ridge XR 10 rails.\n\nBattery storage for night use is preferred. Make sure they use lithium ion batteries. \n\nAgain, it’s important to know all the material they’re using and price check it so you can get an idea of what the material cost so you know how much you’re being charged for labor. \n\nI did my whole system myself, I spent about $8500 for 13.6 kW system in California. \n\nIf I payed to have it done.

Those are far more scarce, or “finite” as you put it, and the refining process is extremely environmentally destructive in places like china where most of it comes from.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06500417987505595,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21413154317616273,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3378062679538299,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25993460837169524,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16315028002054532,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18125809565065623,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02590478661780556,"solar_1":-0.1438622490475633,"solar_2":-0.15548136465020115,"solar_3":-0.11556144924934804,"solar_4":-0.13570779418902626,"solar_5":-0.17271931585855782,"solar_6":-0.013649908491061069,"solar_7":-0.008021802961593494,"solar_8":-0.010597209552846229,"solar_9":-0.1321554850631704,"solar_10":-0.1539544502559996},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (I like solar but hate the mining and refining process for solar panels)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I don't think that we'll see the end of rape anytime. Not in my lifetime. Does that mean that we should focus on ways that rapists can rape nicer? No. We should still tell people, \"Don't rape.\" And while some people scoff at the idea that people don't know they shouldn't rape, there are a lot of cultures where rape is practically acceptable and people think they have a right to get away with it (hence why people rail against \"rape culture\"). So, taking a stand does make a difference. \n\nThe thing is, I think that any exploitation of animals is wrong. So, I'm going to try to do my best to avoid it when practical. It's not just about how big the cage is. And I know that be being vegan and buying vegan choices instead of non-vegan ones that I reduce demand for animal products and that keeps more animals from being born to be exploited at all. Plus, I raise awareness even with those who aren't planning to go vegan. I have friends and family members eating more vegan stuff and reducing their overall consumption. And just by supporting vegan choices at my local grocery store I am sure that others will see them and try them. Since becoming vegan just 3.5 years ago I have seen the number of obviously vegan (and marketed as such) products rise in local stores and restaurants. A recent article talked about how many non-vegetarians are buying veg meats even. In the meantime, we're waiting for certain size chicken cages to be phased out over the years for others that are just slightly bigger. It seems to me that supporting vegan choices and not non-vegan ones is having a much bigger impact.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"yes","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.11760140986492,"1.1.1_stance":-0.007689434996185203,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3188100535360877,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0942953044306658,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.017082350931013936,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.045949105095739164,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1820508441887796,"diet_1":-0.253406342313004,"diet_2":-0.11962234039668829,"diet_3":-0.11439654062890202,"diet_4":-0.10826786951169096,"diet_5":-0.16747289718171582,"diet_6":-0.10691713179696088,"diet_8":-0.02938461679635414,"diet_9":-0.0070490286307176575,"diet_10":-0.17840660416792767,"diet_11":-0.01760239123541396,"diet_13":-0.12588077013236157,"diet_14":-0.18772534298235163,"diet_17":-0.22100233346767104},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"Explicitly present.

I could have compared your indifference to nonhuman suffering to the customs of the aboriginals of the Vilcabamba valley or whatever. I chose the Nazis simply because we both certainly know more about them than about most of the other people/tribes in history.\n\nExactly the point.  Instead of actually saying that my logic is incorrect you just call me some evil group that killed a ton of people.\n\n\n&gt;The statement “nothing ever matters” doesn’t provide any philosophical application. As I said before, all you wrote explains pretty well why things are how they are, but you’ll never be able to say how the things should be. \n\nThere is no such thing as \"how things should be\"\n\n the statement \"nothing ever matters\" is a fact, at least on an objective basis, it cannot be changed or edited.\n\n&gt;Until then all I can say is, the universe doesn't owe us a good life, but we do.\n\nUs, we, humanity.  That's my point.\n\nWe are a group, we protect each-other, animals are not part of that group and never will be, unless they suddenly evolve and start being able to do the things humans can to participate in society and be considered \"part\" of humanity, such as how we have bred dogs to suit our needs.\n\nYou are nearly repeating my philosophy on how the world works word for word.\n\n&gt;Actually, I think that our conscious subjective experience is the only thing of any importance. In my view society, science, technology and every other aspect of human civilization are only useful because these things enable us to optimize the ratio between pleasurable and unpleasurable experiences.\n\n&gt;However to me my feelings are important. And every evidence I have suggests that the feelings of other conscious things are just as important to them.\n\nBoth of these are incredibly true.\n\nEveryone is most important to THEMSELVES.  Morality is an entirely selfish construct, and when you look at pigs being killed and feel bad about it is it because of a flaw in the logic.\n\nThe phrases \"killing is bad\" \"respect all other things around you\" and other similar ones are oversimplifications of how real morality works.  It is these simplifications that cause so many issues with things such as religion and things like people feeling guilty about watching pornography or killing animals.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005902671497703219,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07218578133233677,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17762534140970415,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13341220375150442,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2772553215091404,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2663425620800758,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0921083761495538,"diet_1":-0.13139394911316535,"diet_2":-0.050994204968446866,"diet_3":-0.19472972358441135,"diet_4":-0.008170363017901158,"diet_5":-0.01129855450381001,"diet_6":-0.004783964486705372,"diet_8":-0.003623825721660978,"diet_9":-0.0034835850674426183,"diet_10":-0.01966825376439374,"diet_11":-0.01926567290017071,"diet_13":-0.009080394399158346,"diet_14":-0.0371855783717668,"diet_17":-0.047004282377505056},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I think actual trigger to switch to veganism was visiting a vegan animal sanctuary and meeting lots of animals, including a turkey named Sherman.

They all had some kind of animal products, whether it be prawns, pork, chicken, beef or egg. I just thought it was so disappointing that people have devalued these animals to merely an ingredient and taste palette. It's not like we were stranded in some food scarce region that couldn't go grow crops, no, people are just eating harming these animals out of taste and convenience. One thing I do notice that many Southeast Asian cuisines don't typically go heavy on is cow's milk and cheese. There was a few vegan cooked food options, not as much as all the cooked animal products foods, but it was still there and that's what mattered to me. I ended up eating this oven cooked, pastry dished that was filled with broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potato, pumpkin, peas and carrot. I mentioned to the cook and owner that this vegan food looked like it was a super food with the sweet potato and pumpkin in it. She said that many people eat it because they like the taste. Then she asked me if I was vegan to which I responded with a silent and powerful nod. She served me the heated food and I took it away in a small cardboard box. After finding a quiet bench by a duck pond, I lifted the lid to a bit of steam rising. Raising one of the food to my mouth, I ate like I cared.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.07576976375033458,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18438966910613627,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12428881721670677,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23776286326330331,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1932540048942162,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20938901423396492,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.007084513859202464,"diet_1":-0.00838203923679733,"diet_2":-0.22379966629649317,"diet_3":-0.04569049571728101,"diet_4":-0.06316285651215973,"diet_5":-0.009580641106974023,"diet_6":-0.012767666237171701,"diet_8":-0.0006981638295352847,"diet_9":-0.05029199039789774,"diet_10":null,"diet_11":-0.0014078512516183157,"diet_13":-0.07236397898426124,"diet_14":-0.16570059799899658,"diet_17":-0.39881513698490756},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Judging by the fact that you don't even specify how long you've been vegan(or if you even are) or have reddit flair on this subreddit to show for it demonstrate how long you have been(not that that ultimately matters) I can assume you're not vegan which makes you a poor candidate in telling people, especially an animal rights activist/vegan of 4 years(ok, that was boasting...) , how to do vegan activism the \"right\" way.\n\nSince you're making terrible assumptions, I've been vegan 13 years. I just don't feel any need to advertise it like you do. And it's not about \"vegan outreach\", it's about human nature. Sure, some people can be shamed into doing things, but a much higher proportion of people will respond better to support. Some people can stop doing something cold turkey, some need to do it gradually, whatever that thing may be.\n\n\n\nYour methodology is going to turn people off and ultimately hurt the cause more than help it. It doesn't matter what the cause/movement/group is. If someone is trying to get into it, having trouble, and reaches out for support, and they get someone basically telling them to fuck off if they can't do what they're supposed to, there's a good chance they'll be turned off of whatever the thing is. Just basic human nature.

And killing carnists is not going to help. Let's look at the first part first:\n\nThis is based on the concept of *equal consideration of equal interest* which was invented by Peter Singer, one of the most influential vegan philosophers of today. The concept works out the idea of justice for actors that are (very) different and is applicable between humans, between humans and nonhumans, and between nonhumans. Let's first imagine a simple case between two humans with equal interest. Imagine that two people were stranded in a desert due to some terrible accident. After a horrific ordeal and life threatening circumstances they manage to make it to your oasis. You see these two poor souls heave their feet through the heaps of sand and you rush outside. You help them in and gather all the water you have. It is not much. Your well has recently run dry and though you are not in any danger yourself (a water caravan is coming in tomorrow, and you were leaving the oasis anyway) you have a mere two bottles of water for your destitute guests. The obvious fair way to distribute this water is to give each person a bottle. They both have an equal interest in surviving till more water comes tomorrow and would die if they got less than one bottle.\n\nThe above example seems clear to almost anyone right? But what if one of the strangers, let's call him Jake, lied? What if Jake secretly stole some of his companion's water during the previous day? And still has this stashed away somewhere? Now it seems fair to give Jake less water or even none at all to punish him for his bad behaviour. Jake has less interest in the bottle of water because he already has water stashed away and we should give less consideration to Jake's desire for an entire water bottle. This gives us *proportionally disequal consideration of disequal interest*. \n\nNow let's look at cows and humans. What would be the interests of a cow? One obvious interest the cow has is to stay alive. It also has an interest in food, water, happiness, love and the absence of pain. Humans have these interests too. However humans and cows are not the same and humans are a bit of an odd one out in the animal kingdom. Maybe humans have some additional different interests due to the fact that humans have developed culture and greater social interactions between individuals. This I think is the case. But would that mean humans ought to be able to breed, maim and slaughter as they please? I'd also say this is different. While humans have some additional interests these are not proportional to the behaviour of carnism. The interest of a cow, staying alive, having food, water, warmth, shelter, love, kids and the absence of pain are larger than the interest of a human who wants a hit of seratonin hormones by eating a good tasting piece of meat.\n\nWhy? Well imagine the following situation. You are an 19th century explorer and you venture upon one of the last remaining undiscovered regions of the world, Papua New-Guinea. There you stumble upon a group which identifies themselves as the Korowai tribe. At first everything seems fine, though underdeveloped for sure. Then at dinner that evening you get a delicious meal of some kind of extremely soft and delicious meat. Curious to find out which animal you are eating you ask \"Gosh what is this delicious food made of?\". Oh that is made of Dani comes the happy reply. You enthousiastically continue to stuff yourself with the delicious food and eventually after observing some festivities later in the evening you fall asleep. The next day you try to learn more about your hosts and ask if you can see a Dani. Sure! They laugh no problem! And they take you with them to a hut on stilts in the shade a bit near the edge of the village. As they gesture you up the ladder you peek into the hut and are momentarily confused. The entire hut is filled with children no older than two! As a sickening feeling rises in your stomach and the realization hits you with the force of a hammer you puke all over the Korowai clans men below. They are cannibalists! How did you not realize! The delicious food of last night were the remains of roasted children! Appaled by what you were tricked into doing you gather your fellow travelers and murder the entire village of savages for what they have done (remember this is the 19th century, it wasn't very peaceful). Still appaled but with a sense of righteousness you leave the village to report to civilisation of your ordeals.\n\nBut were the Korowai really so different? Was the interest of the little children and infants really a different interest from that of a cow or a pig? At such an early age human children are unable to speak and most likely have a very limited form of consciousness, not yet being able to understand what goes on around them. Cows similarly have only a limited understanding of what is happening. Both the infant children and the cows understand that screams and loud noises are terrifying and that pain is bad. Both will be afraid and longing for safety and the warmth of others. Both the infant children and cows have equal interests. Yet we treat them differently. We eat cows but not children. Even though animals are equivallent to children. From the vegan perspective this does not make sense and has to stop.\n\nWas killing the Korowai justified? Certainly it brings a degree of satisfaction of revenge served to those who were disserving of it. But was it really? Would it not have been better to simply imprison them? Or transport them a remote island where they would not be able to hurt Dani children ever again? Best of all of course would be to simply teach the Korowai that eating children is not acceptable behaviour. This would prevent killings, deportations and much other harm and stress. Teaching the Korowai not to eat children is not easy of course but would be the best solution. And it would also prevent Korowai from seizing modern weapons and eating you too! \n\nI think that is basically how vegans look at most of humanity.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.017967503207425278,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16429397294630532,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27287187116841477,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1965754110312476,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.42580684420338455,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20715753478528887,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1809034753944919,"diet_1":-0.29942598434785267,"diet_2":-0.24463508058993916,"diet_3":-0.2350833415054397,"diet_4":-0.09931098357386266,"diet_5":-0.05429802291594873,"diet_6":-0.025307041158763848,"diet_8":-0.030721236992879614,"diet_9":-0.012963794157258235,"diet_10":-0.0269446099846391,"diet_11":-0.08735422237077728,"diet_13":-0.04356365366159783,"diet_14":-0.19156594798065876,"diet_17":-0.06379210614250042},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.
