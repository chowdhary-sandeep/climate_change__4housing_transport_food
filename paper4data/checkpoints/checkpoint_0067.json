"comment": "&gt;hen you go on to say, \"those inefficiencies\" as if you've identified some inefficiencies already\n\nEvery system has inefficiencies. The point being made was the accumulative inefficiencies involved to get an electric car to run. There is no such thing as a system with 100% inefficiency. The more systems you add to the process the more they add up. It isn't just a direct comparison of Battery vs. Combustion.\n\n&gt;But, compared with other ways of generating motion, such as the 15% efficient internal combustion engine in most cars, a large power plant is very efficient.\n\nThat wasn't the point I was making.\n\n&gt;If coal is responsible for around 40% of the nation's electricity, that means that 60% of the electricity generated is NOT coal\n\n68.3% of power generation in this country comes from fossil fuels. Coal is the dirtiest. The idea that you can disconnect an electric car from coal energy is disingenuous. 45% of all power generated is from coal.\n\n&gt;Burning natural gas produces less emissions than gasoline\n\nIt produces 30% less CO2 emissions than coal. It is definitely a cleaner fuel.\n\n&gt;highly efficient power plants rather than burning gasoline in small, inefficient internal combustion engines is more efficient and less polluting,\n\nYou do realize the inefficiency of the power plant is one of many in a chain? The generation of the power.\n\n\"Typical thermal efficiency for utility-scale electrical generators is around 33% for coal and oil-fired plants, and 56 – 60% (LHV) for combined-cycle gas-fired plants. Plants designed to achieve peak efficiency while operating at capacity will be less efficient when operating off-design (i.e. temperatures too low.)[3]\"\n\nhttp://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3\n\n7% is lost of the remaining energy produce from the power source.\n\nThe best batteries used in electric cars get roughly 80-90% efficiency (when they're new). For both charging and discharging, though some places claim it is 100% (which is impossible for any system to accomplish).\n\nYour 15% figure for combustion engines includes all energy loss in a vehicle, not just the combustion engine. Many of those inefficiencies also apply to electric cars. \n\n\"In gasoline-powered vehicles, over 62 percent of the fuel's energy is lost in the internal combustion engine (ICE). ICE engines are very inefficient at converting the fuel's chemical energy to mechanical energy, losing energy to engine friction, pumping air into and out of the engine, and wasted heat.\"\n\nSo it's more a long the lines of 38% efficiency if we're comparing the two technologies directly. Add in the inefficiencies above which are exclusive to electric cars and you are looking at very similar efficiency. This is assuming both systems are new and working at top performance. I have no clue how either system degrades with age.\n\n&gt; If it was so inefficient, why is it so cheap?\n\nYou already answered your question. Supply and demand. Currently there is little demand for electricity at night, yet the supply is large due to generation methods. If you had 100 million Americans driving electric cars this would be a different story. You would see *very* high demand for power generation. Thus your costs would sky rocket.\n\n&gt;The car gets an estimated 129 miles per gallon equivalent energy rating from the government. The batteries do degrade with time, but they can be recycled, so they are not \"worthless\" after 10 years.\n\nDepends on the battery. If it uses Cadmium which a lot of batteries do, it becomes toxic. This means there is no recycling, it is toxic waste that needs to be disposed of. And as a end user who doesn't care about toxic waste you are replacing 10,000 dollars worth of batteries every 10 years.\n\n\"Scientists at Technical University of Denmark paid $10,000USD for a certified EV battery with 25kWh capacity, with no rebates or overprice.[17] Two out of 15 battery producers could supply the necessary technical documents about quality and fire safety.[18] Estimated time is 10 years before battery price comes down to 1/3 of present.[17] Battery professor Poul Norby states that lithium batteries will need to double their energy density and bring down the price from $500 (2010) to $100 per kWh capacity in order to make an impact on petrol cars.[19]\"\n\nI've had my car for 10 years and I have not even come to half that cost in mechanical repairs for my combustion engine. And yes I have resale value. An electric car at 8-10 years being sold will face the skeptical view of buyers that they will get stuck with a major 10,000 dollar replacement in the next few years.\n\n&gt;but since I'm leasing, it's really the car company's problem, not mine.\n\nThat's good for you.\n\n&gt;Also, I have no scheduled oil changes, tune ups, transmission fluid checks, engine air filter changes, or other costs. I don't anticipate doing anything but rotating the tires and washing the car.\n\nAgain maybe 1,000 dollars over 10 years. And that assumes you don't do this work yourself which isn't hard to do. But not all of us have free time, so we will count that against the combustion engine. The batteries still are significantly more expensive (currently).\n\n&gt;If you can't see that this is a cheaper way to drive, then I suggest you should be happy paying whatever it is that you're paying for your driving. Me, I'm happy to have paid nothing for gasoline since the middle of December. At an equivalent of 129 miles per gallon, I'm driving at somewhere between 20% and 25% of the energy used by my other car. I suggest that a 75% to 80% more efficient ride is better for everyone.\n\nGood for you, you're exploiting it while it is viable. It is not viable for anyone who wishes to drive any distance outside of a city. Leasing seems to be a smart idea for these type of cars, I can only imagine these companies won't be so eager to lease after they find they can't sell them off later.",

Part of the reason Tesla was able to get a foot in the door was because of wealthy Californians who wanted to see electric cars on the road.

"comment": "Ok, this article is BS, or Toyota hired some really dumb people.\n\n&gt; However Toyota’s deputy chief engineer Yoshikazu Tanaka, who helped design the Japanese company’s hydrogen fuel cell car Mirai ...\n\n**Ok, one should stop reading that article now.**\n\n&gt; ... believes that improving charging technology will only result in energy being used at such a rate that it will reverse any good intent EV held as an environmentally-sound alternative.\n\n**What?  I know there are some charging inefficiencies, but \"at such a rate\"?  And considering energy can come from green sources such as wind, hydro and solar, electric vehicles will always be more environmentally-sound.  And let's not even begin to talk about energy security, which is another massive benefit.**\n\n&gt; “If you were to charge a car in 12 minutes for a range of 500 km (310 miles), for example, you're probably using up electricity required to power 1,000 houses,” he explained during a presentation at the first test drive event for the Mirai production version. “That totally goes against the need to stabilize electricity use on the grid,” Tanaka added.\n\n**This is a problem with grid design, not electric cars.  Tesla already uses batteries to help lessen the load on the grid, this isn't news.  Out of all places, Japan has one of the largest CHAdeMO deployments, plus they also had a massive power infrastructure failure, yet they seem to be just fine with electric cars.**\n\n**In fact, during the massive power grid failure in Japan, electric vehicles were the only ones still running around.  Some dealers were asked to provide more Nissan LEAFs because of this.**\n\n&gt; Currently lengthy charging times are driving potential customers away from market-available EV vehicles. For example, Nissan’s Leaf takes around eight hours to charge completely at a 200-volt charging point, which would give a driver approximately 84 miles of driving range.\n\n**Takes me 4 hours, and many newer vehicles are shipping with a 6.6kW charger.  Is the 6.6kW charger not a common option in Japan?  What about the fact that Japan is crowded with CHAdeMO chargers, so you could do 80% in 20 minutes.**\n\n&gt; “Toyota isn't denying the benefits of EVs […] But we think the best way to use them is to charge them at night (to avoid peak power consumption hours), and use them for short distances during the day,” said Tanaka.\n\n**But isn't that what most EV owners do?  Isn't that what we do with our smart phones, watches, drones, cameras  and other battery powered devices anyways? Then why bash BEVs (rhetorical, we know better)?**\n\n&gt; Toyota instead will continue to promote its hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) which it claims will promise the greenest alternative to conventional transportation due to their similar refuel speeds and driving range.\n\n**See how he said *conventional transportation*, and not battery electric vehicles ;)  As for range, Tesla, the next gen LEAF, Chevy Bolt, ...) are making that a moot point.**\n\n&gt; Although these cars will require great investment, Tanaka argued that in the long-term hydrogen will be the preferred option thanks to its portability, abundancy and storability compared to electricity.\n\n**Portable as in requiring you to haul your own refinery around, while also requiring access to infrastructure which doesn't even exist yet.  Electrical outlets on the other hand, can be found in so many places, you could even go to a gasoline station, and charge there!** \n\n&gt; “Of course, there are technological hurdles that need to be cleared to make this commercially viable,” concluded Tanaka. “But remember 'Back to the Future'? In that movie, a car from 30 years in the future comes back to the present — the year 1985 […] The Mirai doesn't fly, but this year, 2015, is that future.”\n\n**The Mirai is about as practical as that BTTF hoverboard, couldn't have picked a better movie!**\n\nElectric cars have been around since the 1900's, and the very primitive grid seemed to handle it ok.  I'm probably biased towards battery powered vehicles, and don't have a reason to 'hate' fuel cell vehicles (I'm sure they will have their advantages, maybe cargo and passenger hauling), but Toyota's negative attitude really makes me wonder what they are thinking.\n\nWhy bother developing a new version of the Prius Plug-in if it's that bad of an investment?  I look forward to the day when Toyota announces it's developing a BEV again, and watch them flip sides again.\n\nI actually had to do a quick search to see if thestack.com had any relationship with Toyota, this was pretty bad.",

"comment": "&gt;That article uses electrolysis as the source of hydrogen. Not fossil fuels. Interesting, isn't it?\n\nNo, because it said the same thing that I said about electrolysis, that it's much less efficient than charging an EV directly, which will make the hydrogen fuel itself completely noncompetitive. The alternative, of course, will be hydrogen sourced from the reformation of natural gas. \n\nAlso, did you miss the part about why the Japanese were interested in HFCVs?\n\n&gt;Both have advantages and disadvantages.\n\nSure, but one is cost effective and one isn't. HFCVs not only use more expensive fuel, they also use more expensive technology in the vehicle itself, and the refueling infrastructure will costs many, MANY times more than the charging infrastructure for EVs, which already partially exists. \n\nNotice that the comment below the top comment has more upvotes. Also, r/energy is jam-packed with fossil fuel industry shills.",

"comment": "**Hold mode literally does exactly what you want.** I think you've been given some poor explanations from people and gotten confused.\n\n\"Hold mode charges the battery\" is a technicality. In the Volt for instance, most of the time the gas engine doesn't turn the car's wheels directly, the electric motor is still driving, and the gas engine is used as a generator to keep the battery charged. In other PHEVs, the engine does drive the car, but it still uses some power from the battery/electric motor to supplement the engine. If you turn on hold mode at 68% battery for example, it will *hold* the battery at 68%. If you floor it and the car needs some help and brings the battery down to 65%, the engine will briefly run a tiny bit harder to bring it back to 68%. If you slow down from highway speeds to 0 and the regen brings you up to 70%, the engine will turn off and stay off until you're back at 68%. If the battery is \"empty\", the battery is actually at 20-30%, and the engine is trying to keep it there. All PHEVs work similarly in hold mode.\n\nThis is actually one of the big advantages of PHEVs. Gas engines have specific RPMs/gears at which they are more efficient. Maybe running the engine at 10% output is more efficient than 20%. Maybe 70% is more efficient than 60%. In a gas car, you have no choice, however far the accelerator pressed is how hard the engine needs to run. A PHEV can run at 40% engine output instead of 30% and give the extra power to the battery, if hold was enabled at 68% battery then once it goes up to 70% from this or regen it turns off the engine and uses that extra battery power, if it's running at 10% engine output instead of 20% it can use up some charge and when it drops to 65% then ramp the engine up to 30% for a while, etc. This will all happen whether the battery is in hold mode or if it's \"empty\" - though hold mode at a high battery level is generally more efficient, since most cars will do more of this efficiency management with more battery wiggle room.\n\nThere are two notable exceptions where the car does actually INCREASE the battery's charge level significantly on purpose. One, is that some PHEVs have 4 modes, EV/Auto/Hold/Charge, with Charge doing what it sounds like, runs the engine higher to charge up the battery; IMO this is pointless as it's worse for fuel economy and engine wear. Fortunately I have not heard of a PHEV that only has Charge and not Hold--Hold does what you want. Secondly, the Volt has a \"Mountain Mode\": in the Volt, the gas engine is about half as powerful as the electric motor, so if you were to need more than 50% of the car's acceleration for a long time continuously, say driving up a mountain at 60mph, if the battery is _empty_, the car wouldn't be able to handle it. If you turn on mountain mode at the start of your drive, it'll switch to gas when the battery is 40% full or so, so that there's a buffer; if you turn on mountain mode when the battery is \"empty\", the engine will run harder to charge that battery up to 40% or so, in order to build up that buffer by the time you get to a mountain. Naturally, unless you live in a mountainous area, this mode is irrelevant; hold, again, does what you want.\n\nYou don't need to worry about any of this, though. At the end of the day you can just turn on hold mode in any PHEV (except the Pacifica) when you get on the highway then turn it off when you get off. It does exactly what you want.\n\nEDIT: it should be noted that if your entire trip is within the EV range of your vehicle, you shouldn't use hold mode since driving on electric is more efficient than gas. Hold mode is only useful if your trip is longer than the EV range of your vehicle, and includes city driving at the end, like you described.",

"comment": "To be fair, that commercial was about the JD Power Dependability study, which the Bolt was not yet on the market long enough to be a part of.\n\nAnd there are a number of recent commercials where it has made at least a cameo in the background.\n\nI've read stories about dealers actually not running interference on prospective Bolt buyers, and even helping them join waiting lists and submit orders, so that's promising. But these dealers are in compliance states. The story could change in the greater US, especially in places like Texas.\n\nGM seems to have an internal conflict of interest. On the one hand, beat Tesla to market, 1-up them on that affordable long-range EV space, and make a solid platform for their autonomous electric ridesharing service. On the other, help the bottom line by selling low numbers of a low-margin car that is replacing the Spark EV compliance car, and for now appears to be treated as a compliance car in much the same way by the bean counter strategists.\n\nStill there are things that make me hopeful. For example, the low numbers comes on the heels of the announcement that they will deploy \"thousands\" of autonomous Bolt EVs within the next year. It could very well be that these units took priority in the production line.",

However, this is average weight, the sleeper cabs go higher* which Tesla will not exceed. If there is a reason why diesel trucks will still be used for heavy cargo is because range might not be good enough since it's calculated with a GVWR of around 36 t and cargo that fits inside a covered trailer to keep the energy consumption low. If the cargo is on an open trailer the extra drag will reduce the range, assuming they travel at the same speed.\n\n*23000 lbs = 10432.62 kg weight claim for upper limit diesel trucks, source, Tesla competitor Nikola Motors\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/one",

In fourth place (third prior to today's record break), is a full electric NIO EP9.\n\nFor street legal cars, the Porsche 918 Spyder (a plug-in hybrid from 2013) is no.6 on the board.\n\nEdit: The McLaren P1 was apparently declared not road legal on its run only because it didn't have a front license plate. But its time is faster than the current record holder for street legal cars (Porsche 911 GT2 RS).",

To see how well *that* is going, we should compare Tesla sales to ICE sales. If we do that, we find that we have barely made a dent, Toyota are still shipping 30k Camrys per month, same as always. People like to point out that BMW 3 series sales are down, but that's probably mostly because the 3 series is about to be refreshed this year. The Model 3 is a good start, but Tesla is nowhere close to being a major car manufacturer or having a noticeable impact on the US carbon footprint.\n\nI look at the above chart as a sign that Tesla has failed to stimulate competition among their peers rather than seeing it as a sign of success.",

In the 80’s, the pollution predominantly from car exhaust would get so bad it would burn their eyes. They also had problems with acid rain for the few times it did rain. \n\nThen catalytic converters were introduced in cars, and later made into law. Over the next 20 years, the air quality has improved noticeably to them. \n\nProbably less than 1,000 cars on the road there don’t have a catalytic converter now (classic cars and old unregistered cars). But now cars are starting to hit the road that are completely free of all emissions. And they are powered by a grid that is predominantly nuclear and hydroelectric, and mixed with natural gas, solar, and wind. I think over the next twenty years our air quality will improve even further as more EVs hit the road, even if more cars hit the road.",

"comment": "Six miles a day is living on a 3mi dirt road. When I lived in Vermont and when I lived in NH, plenty of people lived on dirt roads that were off of major roads, and sure, many drove ordinary sedans (Accords, Corollas, etc). Just because a road is dirt doesn't mean it's like the surface of the moon and you need a truck to get down it. \n\nMy bigger concern is that if the Model 3 is picking up this much dirt, it would pick up a shit ton of snow as well with that aeroplate design, which is a recipe for said plate eventually breaking away. It also would likely catch a ton of road salt, which, thanks to the plate, would then not clean out easily with an undercarriage wash at the car wash. \n\nSeems like something that could be tweaked pretty easily with an aftermarket replacement or a new version from Tesla that could be bolted on in its place. For that matter, I assume it's mostly there for undercarriage efficiency, so I wonder how much of a range hit it would be to pull it off. \n\nTo be clear, this is very much **not** a Tesla-unique problem. As more and more manufacturers added plastic plates to the undercarriage, whether just under the engine, or like the Tesla M3, covering other less-aerodynamic components as well, getting crap trapped above them became a thing. If, like the guy in the video, I drove a Model 3 and lived on a dirt road, I'd add dropping the plate to clean it out to my every-six-month maintenance routine. While the plate was down, I'd do a *very* thorough wash of everything covered by it to reduce corrosion damage from road salt, etc.",

"comment": "&gt; *(By 'souped up hybrids' I'm making a distinction between a 'EREV' PHEV that has a true pure EV mode for the full driving envelope like the Volt, Clarity, and i3 versus the ones that have &lt;30 miles of electric range and/or turn on the ICE for accelerations or heat or at high speeds and that function basically like regular hybrids except with a 8-12 kWh battery that can technically be plugged in)\n\nYou're doing a significant disservice to shorter range hybrids IMO. Despite the fact that a significant proportion of my miles (close to 50%, though probably just under) are longer distance trips that would force any PHEV onto gas for most of the trip (and about 40% of my miles, for effectively the entire trip), my long-term average basically since I bought my car is above 85 mpg. That means that even relative to the traditional hybrid version of my car, the \"P\" part of PHEV has made a larger improvement in gas consumption then moving from PHEV to BEV would. In comparison, having a Volt or i3 like range would have provided little benefit; maybe move it up to 100 mpg or something even optimistically. [*Edit*: I ran some numbers, and probably 90-95 mpg would be pretty accurate as an absolute optimistic guess. That's a 10% improvement at best by more than doubling the battery capacity.]\n\nDo I wish that my car had a few more kWh? Certainly. But do I think that \"that function basically like regular hybrids except with a 8-12 kWh battery that can technically be plugged in\" is a gross misrepresentation? Also yes.\n\n*Edit*: The other thing that attracted me to PHEVs is that I have a *very* short commute. (And to be clear, I *try* not to drive, though I'm successful maybe 50% of the time.) It's barely more than a mile, and in winter that's not even enough time for an ICE car's engine to warm up. That means that I was extremely harsh on my previous car and would be now if I didn't have an EV, but even if I had half the range I do, a PHEV would *still* largely solve this problem. \"Functions basically like a regular hybrid\" my ass.",

"comment": "Totally this. \n\nEven if the L1 charging doesn't cover your daily needs it can still be very worth while and cost effective.\n\nSay you daily commute uses 25% of your battery capacity but you can only recharge 15% over night on your L1 charger. If you started off at 100% charge on day 1, then  each following day you'd have the following start and end percentages.\n\n100 .. 75\n\n90 .. 65\n\n80.. 55\n\n70 .. 45\n\n60 .. 35\n\n50 .. 25\n\nSo as you can see even whilst maintaining a healthy 25% emergency reserve you'd only need to visit a public fast charger every 6 days rather than every 3 if not home charging.\n\nIf you can have a good chunk of charging over a weekend you might not need to public charge at all to start the week at 100%. My wife and I run two cars and on weekdays go our own separate directions to work, but on a weekend we travel as a family in one car so each car could get a whole day extra charge on a weekend.\n\nA friend of mine bought a Tesla a couple of years ago and had a 7.2kW home charger outlet delivered to work. There were some issues getting a cable under a drive which delayed the install. Well, two years later the charger is still.sitting in the original  box in the office waiting to be installed. He charges with a \"granny cable\" from standard outlet and rarely needs public charging.\n\nDo the maths on how long your car sits on the drive per week and how that affects the start and end of day battery levels.",

I assume Intel Atom E8000 series should be more powerful than Snapdragon 820A. Maybe that cool down your fan boyism.\n\nHowever, the assumption that best UX designers are going for Tesla is WRONG period.\n\nAre you saying Apple UX engineers, Google UX engineers are not getting paid better than Tesla? I have friends/classmates on both companies and no they do not pay better at Tesla. Now some people go to there or SpaceX because of the mission because they like the company but that is not majority, the most talented goes to FAANG.\n\nI am not going answer your personal questions, specially for an account created a month ago. But from my experience with both Tesla and FAANG, FAANG pays better and we know what happens when one side pays better, right? most Talents go where they pay better. You can look at median salary for FAANG and compare it to Tesla.\n\nlong story short, I do not care about VW you can shit on them all you want, I care about wrong info you are providing which is misleading others about best UX engineers mostly are going to Tesla. They DO NOT period.",

I have heard that Tesla gives some of the best deals on systems (even if there are tough install stories out there), its a good place to establish a 'good price' to shop against.  Also, though your rate is going down to the heating months it will go back up, and in general will trend upwards in place as EVs, heatpumps, etc. drive up the world's energy demands faster (IMO) that the world is building more generation so ther is the cost of power in the future to consider too.",

Even for Teslas the chargers aren't \".. every few miles\". There are some pretty dry stretches, and especially so for cars that use CCS plugs. And given the long holiday weekend, those chargers may be packed.\n\nIt would be a fun adventure if you had experience in EV road trips and were adept at using all the different apps you'd need for non-Tesla charging. But I figure you need to be somewhere for Thanksgiving and that doesn't lend itself to a learning experience that may take a lot more time than you think. I think you're setting yourself up for a bad experience that may sour you on EVs in general.",

"comment": "&gt; Yes, at considerable cost. How come you are SO convinced that this adaptation cost will be so much cheaper than investing a little bit in emissions reductions now instead?\n\nNobody has ever put forth a realistic idea on how to cut emissions, especially ideas that don't involve insane levels of government tyranny and supply side cut via regulation(aka Ban coal, oil production, etc).\n\nYou want to reduce emissions? fine... unless in involves our competitive advantage with the world, and our own standards of living.  Nobody I know can afford solar panels. Nobody I know can afford more taxes to subsidize more solar panels. Nobody I know can afford higher prices for everything after energy goes up.\n\nMy idea, deregulate the shit out of any green energy technology.  Zero government fees or bureaucracy for;  battery raw material mines, solar manufacturing plants, hydro electric dams/reservoirs, off shore wind farms, etc.   Then get rid of the taxes on fossil energy producers for all energy they divert into solar/hydro dam manufacturing.  No new taxes or subsidies, just tax cuts that promote renewable energies.",

Maybe some glue?\n\nWouldn't there be a benefit from being able to take up the entire installation's worth of panels at once, since they're so light? \n\nIf the panels did get blown off, wouldn't there be significantly less risk of breaking whatever the panels fall on than there would be for heavy silicon panels?\n\nWhat do you think the major contributors to falling solar panel prices will be, or do you think the price is going to bottom out around where it is now?",

"comment": "Assuming you want to get close to being zero-net electrical energy each year (but still on the grid), follow these steps:\n\n1) Obtain the Peak-Sun-Hour value for your location (which you can get from the Pvwatts.nrel.gov tool that mrCloggy suggested).  Examples: If you're in the SW US, that figure might be around 7 hours (annual average direct sun per day).  If you're in the upper Midwest US, that figure could be between 3 and 5 hours.  \n\n2) Add up all your kWh for the year.  Figure should be around 3000 kWh X 12 months = 36,000 kWh.  \n\n3) Divide your annual use by your Peak-Sun-Hours.  The result is an approximation of what you need for total kW in your array.  If your Peak-Sun-Hour figure is 6 hours, that means you're looking to install 6,000 kW.  \n\n4) Most mono-cryatalline and poly-crystalline PV modules produce around 11 watts/square foot.  (Top of the line SunPower modules produce about 17 watts/SF.)  So divide your array size by 11 (e.g.: 6,000,000 watts / 11watts/SF = 550,000 SF, or about 12.5 Acres).  Obviously, this is way bigger than your roof.  Might even be bigger than your property.  \n\n5) Rough cost estimate for this scale of array:  $2/watt installed:  $12 million.  Balanced against annual electric bill savings of what?  $3,600?  \n\nI suggest starting with insulating and air sealing your house first.",

"comment": "Without having seen the PPA and understanding the SCE tarriff structure, the gotcha is that you are paying SolarCity for all the power you generate at 0.157, but for the power you don't use SCE is paying you a (presumably) lower rate than 0.157. So you are subsidizing SolarCity with the difference between what they charge you and what SCE pays. Another thing to consider is that SolarCity has a pretty shaky balance sheet. What happens to all these systems and contract structures if/when they go out of business?\n\nPersonally, I'd want to own the system myself for the tax credits and the ease of selling it as a fixed asset to the home. It also lets you shop around for the best deals on parts where you source the major equipment components yourself and have several smaller solar installers bid on the install. You'd be surprise how cost-effective you can make the install cost when you don't tag on the bloated margins (read:overhead) of a big corporation. Did you look for PACE or other financing programs in your area, maybe even a HELOC? They can make a lot of sense, plus you can make a a big pay down on principal  when you get that big check from Uncle Sam.",

"comment": "When flooded lead-acid batteries are only half full, the solar energy is used for some chemical wizardry involving all that lead to charge the batteries, but it will also break down some water into hydrogen and oxygen (which is a good thing, as those bubbles will agitate the liquid before they re-combine, so the acid is mixed properly, see [top](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/water_loss_acid_stratification_and_surface_charge)).    \nWhen the battery is full there's no more lead and all the energy goes into water splitting, making the 'boiling' more visible (and letting some of that gas escape into the outdoors, hence the need to check water levels), but you still need to go to that level occasionally to prevent [sulfation](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/sulfation_and_how_to_prevent_it).    \n \nGoogle-fu'ing the *EWC-30* charge controller, that is limited to 23V on its input (from the solar panels), it is (can only be) the controller used for the 4x 85Wp panels in parallel, the 'other' controller should be suitable for &gt;45V input from the 200Wp panel.    \n\n&gt;All these merry batteries are then connected together    \n\nNot unusual, it could be two separate purchases, the 2nd set of batteries+panel after he found out the capacity of only 6 batteries was a bit low for his usage.   \n\nEdit:    \nDifficult to see on the pictures, but the wires on that charger (from the panels and to the batteries) seems a bit thin (heat and energy loss), a minimum of 4 mm² is recommended (loud-speaker wiring from a car-stereo shop would work).",

Over that year you make 365 x 5 hours x 4kw = 7,300 kw hours\n\nthe word hours means that is your energy produced or used over time.  It is how you are billed and how energy is most often measured for money purposes.\n\na solar array rated for 4kw (no use of the word hours) can make 4kw when operating at its maximum potential.

"comment": "And you mention ROI, which again isn't a function of efficiency at all, it's a function of LCOE ,or levelized cost of energy. It's the cost per unit energy over the life of the system, or $/kWh. There are many factors that go into calculating LCOE i.e. system cost, system production, power degradation, o&amp;m cost, etc. but efficiency isn't one of the variables used to calculate LCOE. LCOE is what PPA's are signed for. This is the number big banks funding solar projects look at. LCOE is the reason people should pay more upfront, as you mention, rather than lease a resi system. But why increase the $ without increasing the KWh production? This is what going with SPWR module's does for you, it increases your LCOE. If you want a better ROI, IRR, and payback, go with a solid tier 1 poly module. This is why companies like solarcity and sunpower sign huge master supply agreements with Canadian, Trina, and REC. And not premium mono products like LG, Panasonic, SPWR. You're simply paying more for the same energy",

You generally pay the fees up front.  Solar installers will role the fees into the cost of the solar so that you can claim the fees as part of the cost for your ITC credit.   If you secured your own loan then you can more clearly see all the fees and interest.",

So just using 270w panels you're going to be able you fit an 8.9kw array. \n\nThen work out how much power you are going to produce.  Go to a site called PVwatts from the NREL and put in your address and see how much that system system will generate and see if its going to need to meet your needs. You want to use standard, not premium panels in your calculation. \n\nI would only use Jinko, Talesun or Canadian Solar myself.\n\nOnly if you can't get enough juice using your maximum available roofspace would I consider going for more energy dense panels.    \n\nGood size inverter for that size array is about 6kw.",

But, I really feel that has to do with Model 3 right now. Most negative reviews I saw prior to installing mine were for SolarCity.. Prior to Tesla purchase, SC did a lot of sloppy installs in New England area and did a lot of Solar Leasing. I live in FL where Tesla has only been doing Solar for past few years. They price matched other companies and gave me the Panasonic panels I wanted. My install was great - 0 issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I didn't already have panels, I would likely be getting a re-deployed system now. It seems a lot of folks either love or hate Tesla.",

"comment": "That image helps. \n\nThe out of pocket cost of the system is $10,642 according to the image. I'm curious why there is no state incentive.  I would expect it to be [around $1600 to $1900.](https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/connecticut/#incentives) Anyway, assuming there is not state incentive, I think you should use the $10,642 number as your cost. \n\nThat number seems consistent with the Solar Power Rocks number of $15,400 for a 7.5 kW system after the federal tax credit:  \n\n&gt;Installing a typical 7.5kW solar system should start at about $22,000 after the state's [generous rebate](https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/connecticut/#rebates).  That's cheaper than solar has ever been, but it still might seem like a big investment. Don’t worry, because after tax breaks and energy  savings, your first-year costs will be considerably less than that.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  Feds calculate their incentive based on actual out of pocket costs, so  take 30% of $22,000, for a tax credit of $6,600. Your total investment  is now down to just **$15,400**.\n\n[https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/connecticut/#solarbuy](https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/connecticut/#solarbuy)",

I hate leftist propaganda but of all the things to attack them on i don't think this one we should. There are endless ways to create free non-fossil fuel based energy. You can stick a turbine under a water fall and as long as water is running you get endless free energy. You can even terraform that waterfall from scratch. Couple that with solar, wind, nuclear and magnetic energy and it becomes a wonder why we're still even using natural gas. \n\nHanging on to fossil fuels just because you don't like a group of people is disingenuous. Science has got us this far and can continue to take us much further, why draw the line here? Imagine cave men stopped at the invention of the wheel and just said \"yeah we're not gonna top this, fuck it\". It doesn't make sense.",

"comment": "So, the question was if, not how, we brought down the co2 levels within a century, and would that cause runaway global cooling. Just like global warming is a hypothetical and just like moving to renewables to curb global warming is a hypothetical, the ops question is valid. We tend to dive head first into things, or resist change, but to ask a question regarding the impacts of things is not done enough. Like killing birds with wind farms or changing weather patterns. Like removing heat in soil due to solar panels. Like impacting marine life and ocean currents with wave farming. The question should still be valid since we might have some scientific breakthrough in the next 100 years that could reduce the carbon to pre 19th century levels. To not ponder that possibility is not scientific.",

All of these are **highly** recyclable materials.\n\nIn Europe they already have 100% recycling of panels in a EU-wide program. Such does not exist in Canada, but when I called my local recycler company they said they would do it all for free.

"comment": "Couple of things - just looking at the main losses. First up the temperature coefficient of your modules is [\\-0.29%/C](https://us.sunpower.com/sites/default/files/media-library/data-sheets/ds-x21-series-335-345-residential-solar-panels.pdf), that is basically how much efficiency you lose as the temperature increases above the standard test conditions (25C) where you module was tested at 335W output. So you will get less watts out at higher temperatures. You said 90F which is 32.2C, or 7.2C greater than standard conditions. So that means your 21x335 = 7,035W system will output 7,035x(1-0.29%\\*7.2) = 6,888W.\n\nSecond, that 335W is measured at normal incidence, meaning that the light is shining directly at the module. But in San Diego you are at a latitude of about 33 degrees north - so given that we're close to the summer solstice the sun is nearly 23 degrees north of the equator and so appears  90+23-33=80 degrees above the horizon at local noon, but your modules are at an angle of 18 degrees - so the incident angle of the sunlight on the modules is 18+80-90=8 degrees (0 degrees would be directly overhead). This means there is a slight cosine loss cos(8)\\*6,888 = 6,820W. Note you said the modules were facing directly south, if they're not then there are additional azimuth losses. \n\nLast, I assume that this graph is your AC output, whereas the 6,820W is the DC input to the inverters. But inverters are not 100% efficient and their efficiency is also derated for temperature. So it looks like your inverters are running at 6,470/6,820 = 94.8% efficiency. Which is probably close to correct as they will be hotter than 90F (they are also dissipating the efficiency loss as heat).\n\nSo I think you system is working about right. Your installer should have given you an energy estimate as part of the quotation process, that is really what you should compare to.",

"comment": "&gt; If we wanted grids to go 100% renewable we’d need to store at least a few days worth of power \n\nNo. Its wasteful.  Model I described accounts for this.  Longer version:  https://www.naturalfinance.net/2019/09/renewable-hydrogen-economy-economics.html\n\nThe model uses small battery sizes.  Using your 68 twh/day (excluding much larger scale of 100% of energy from renewables not just current electricity production)  can be served by just 22-34 twh of batteries.  Vehicles are extremely useful storage tools. 50kwh battery packs would mean 100M EVs provide 5twh of that storage.\n\nIn the link I gave, hydrogen electrolysis production costs are very close to being low enough that households with moderate/cold seasons could get all of their energy from hydrogen at lower cost than electric grid connections.\n\nAs to the scaling issue, soar+batteries is growing far faster than nuclear.  Doubling production each year is \"easy\" for these techs\n\n\n&gt; pumped hydro, thermal storage, hydrogen etc. are all low efficiency, less than 30% meaning you’d need the solar panels to produce 3x more power than we actually need because 2/3rds of it will be wasted as heat.\n\nEfficiency is unimportant when source is surplus (free) energy.  In the case of hydrogen, only electrolysis efficiency matters, commercial efficiency ranges from 70%-80%, but not because its impossible to get 90%+.  The only important cost in electrolysis is volume-produced/hr * the running time: ie the capital costs of the electrolyzers.\n\nThe reason that only electrolysis efficiency (not return trip) is important is that hydrogen is a valuable product.  We use gasoline even though it is only 25% efficient in engines.  Fuel cells are over double that efficiency.  Just as battery EVs are useful in grid stabilization, FCEVs can be valuable in extreme backup requirements.  But the goal of hydrogen production is not to reverse it for primary electricity needs.  It is to power vehicles and industry and reduce reliance on expensive electric grid.",

"comment": "I think we can debate this endlessly and will simply never agree with one another so we're just wasting each other's time now honestly.\n\nOne major thing you left out is tax credits and storage rebates (SGIP in CA).  Some in CA got batteries for free or 85% off.  Your prices for Powerwalls at 10k per pop is also overly inflated.  I had an old Tesla 8.16kW system and 3 powerwall quote at like 41k.  Add in ITC and that's 30k.  Add in SGIP and that's prob near or sub 20k.  Yes, SGIP isn't in every state, but not everyone has $0.50-$0.60/kWh prices neither and heading higher.\n\nWith the ITC and SGIP, that makes my cost almost 40-50% off and in places like Hawaii, they had 30% federal, 30% state alone for solar and now, just launched a new storage incentive due to removing large plants and wanting to go folks to get storage and go green.\n\nUtilities have economies of scale and I'm sure, tax incentives as well (let's not kid ourselves that utilities don't take advantage of tax breaks), but remember if you are trying to generate/store/use storage just for 1 house, you simply don't need/have to support/pay for all the vast transmission lines that utilities need to support everyone in the city/rural areas.  Like the post office delivering 1 letter to 1 guy in the middle of nowhere, that's just not economical and they raise prices for everyone to suppor that 1 person.\n\nSan Diego had a bad fire in 2007, but unlike PG&amp;E, actually did a lot more to prepare for the next one and you hear less issues compared to PG&amp;E and the mess they are in daily.\n\nMy cost of ~20k for 8k system + 3 powerwalls after all incentives makes the power 6.849c a kwh from an actual Tesla quote I had earlier (no fuel/maintenance), but putting less \"trust\" on the utility company and more on myself is worth it IMO.\n\nTL:DR - The utilities aren't in it to support the consumers honestly.  I don't know why you're trying to justify that being more independent from them is a good thing for any of us looking at solar/storage.",

Your fridge probably won't use 50W Continuously though! I have two compressor fridges in my camper and my 95Ah battery copes well with them, helped out with 200W(peak) of solar panels though",

"comment": "Very hard to evaluate what's going on here without seeing the details. Your system should have been designed to provide monthly savings, factoring in the energy savings on your bill and the solar lease/loan/PPA.  Sometimes that savings is only like 10%, so when you say \"no difference in savings from before getting solar panels\" - is that accurate? Or is it just a little bit of savings? Like 10%?\n\nFrom the sound of it - you got a lease, PPA, or maybe a loan. Probably $0 down? So, if you are even saving a little bit, the system is probably working as promised. But, those financing deals are not the most cost effective way to get solar.\n\nOr, maybe something is wrong with your system, your utility bill, or something else. We can't tell. I would call your original solar provider, and ask them to explain all the bills, and determine if the system is working as it is supposed to.",

"comment": "I'm a PHEV driver and a clean energy advocate who has built his own solar array and battery storage but I want to combat some of the tendency for this sub to selectively process information and even propagate clean energy misinformation when i see it, because while clean energy and electrification is the direction we should go, we should be clear eyed about all the costs which can only be done by really objectively looking at the data.\n\nI think you're mistaken on your assertion about the lifecycle analysis of ICE vs BEV, from the paper's own methods section:\n\n\"Lifecycle GHG emission intensities are calculated using GREET 1 and 2.(35) GREET is a widely used, publicly available full-vehicle-lifecycle model developed by Argonne National Laboratory.(35) GREET 1 models the lifecycle emissions of fuels and of electricity, and GREET 2 models the lifecycle emissions of the vehicles themselves. For each powertrain technology and model, the vehicle class (car, SUV, or pickup), curb weight, fuel consumption, battery power (for HEVs), battery capacity (for PHEVs and BEVs), and fuel-cell power (for FCVs) are determined\"\n\nSo it is the same well to wheels source for both BEV, HEV, PHEV and ICE. Which should include all exploration. Also don't forget BEV would need to factor in gas exploration, fracking, pipeline transport, etc for the percentage of the grid that is fossil powered as well. But this is why the researchers MIT and the DOE do this as objective scientists and not EV evangelists.\n\nAlso here is a summary for the GREET model, which clearly says it is meant to be well to wheels for all technologies. \n\n[https://greet.es.anl.gov/](https://greet.es.anl.gov/)\n\nAnd well to wheels certainly includes drilling and exploration, refining and transport part of what you were talking about. Argonne has a long history of publications analyzing the various lifecycles associated with the production chain. \n\nIn short I don't believe BEVs were shortchanged in this analysis by any means.",

They are very well known in America but unfortunately outside, they are competing with chinese products that are much cheaper. Enphase has a high end product, so many people go with the cheaper alternative.\n\nWhen it comes to accounting, they are agressive. If you check the previous acquisition, I highly doubt it helped them in any way. They literally paid so they could sell more microinverters but there was dilution involved and I highly doubt it made any sense, they just overpaid for growth.\n\nRight now we have federal solar tax credits and that will end in 2024 so let's see if it affects the demand.",

"comment": "&gt;\n&gt;If that owner took the credit and is trying to charge you full price, you are being ripped off.\n\nI'm in Maryland. I paid $2.50 per watt.\n\nI concur. This is really steep. \n\nWho owns the system? Does the homeowner who is currently selling to you own it outright (with a separate loan)? Or did their solar installer push them into a lease to own deal? If the latter, I can definitely see that they got taken for a bum deal. Some buyers only looked at their monthly costs unfortunately and didn't look at the overall cost. When I shopped for installers, a few did get back to me with outrageous loan terms.\n\nIf there is still some negotiating room on your end, tell the installer to come back, remove all panels and fix the roof because you agreed to purchase the house, not assume the loan. They might then decide to renegotiate with you the terms of the loan.\n\nIf ultimately you do own the system, as the owner you can sell SRECS in the state of Maryland. For a system that large you're looking at about 10 Mwh generated a year. At $70 a Mwh you're looking at about $700 a year that can help offset cost. I know it doesn't sound like much but every little bit adds up.",

We had 100amp service and were planning on upgrading to 200amp. Our solar panels went in and two months later we upgraded the service and electrical panel to add a heat pump. A year later I’m adding as many panels as the inverter will handle and have the biggest inverter available for 100amp service… had we waited three months I’d be adding in even more panels #clippingat140%",

The best I've seen is around 3.8% for a 10 year CD which would get you $1140 a year from $30k before taxes. Even other investments, assuming an annual 7% ROR would net just over $2k a year before taxes. \n\nFourth, we got about $8k back in tax credits, so the actual system cost was closer to $20k. \n\nOverall, it was a good investment for us considering our location (lots of sun), our energy rates and usage (rates are likely to increase in the future), and the net metering agreement we have where we can bank 100% of extra production resulting in near zero electricity costs except for the grid connection fee.",

"comment": "utilities with large fossil fuel facilities have a lot of capital invested in those projects that they fold into the price of electricity that ratepayers like you and me pay for, these costs are socialized across many ratepayers.\n\nIf cheaper power in a deregulated market like Texas shows up (like utility-scale solar and wind), they risk stranding the capital investment they made in the fossil fuel plant because there is cheaper electricity, unless they can find ways to make that electricity more expensive and/or harder to build and operate. Brand new wind and solar (inclusive of the cost of equipment and construction) is rapidly becoming cheaper than existing fossil fuel facilities that have already paid off a fair share of their capital costs. That is like saying that the new house with a full mortgage is worth more than the existing house without any mortgage! \n\nRooftop solar, while not competitive on a bulk power basis with fossil fuels and utility-scale wind and solar, represent a special kind of risk. First, if you put solar on your rooftop and don't need to rely on the grid as much, you've just removed a ratepayer paying off the mortgage if you will, and the utility has fewer customers to shoulder that cost. To make matters worse, if you are allowed to sell power back to the grid, you've just not only removed a paying customer but turned that customer into a competitor! That's why so many states have made it hard to sell rooftop solar power to the grid, because it's terrifying to utility shareholders.",

"comment": "Exactly this. Everyone who runs the economy knew that this machine makes money by running on gas. If  nuclear could have made the same global economy, we would have switched, but instead, it encourages things like public transit, which discourages personal spending which is the backbone of this whole machine. \n\nI dont know what we were expecting. Everything in our lives is a war machine/technology with the guns taken off, that makes money BECAUSE it burns fuel and because it's free to add carbon to the air. \n\nAll we had to do to corner the rich was insist on carbon pricing in the 80's (when it was first proposed) which would have leveled the playing field... also ended the car industry and made our concept of aviation seem as insane as it actually is, which is why it didn't happened. \n\nAnyone pushing for alternatives as the answer should be very clear that if they worked and could power this society without totally upending it, why isn't it already part of this system? The answer is disappointing but no less real. It's not here because it's not what this machine was designed to do, which is to turn ancient life into money by exploiting its capacity to do work in any setting, for virtually nothing. \n\nAnother good exercise is to look back at the age of slavery and ask yourself \"how many slaves would I need to live this modern life in the recent past?\". I know someone did the math and I want to say it's something like 400 slave years of work per year for the average American. This weird idea that we somehow \"evolved\" into a world of technology rather than burned our way here needs to be exposed for the lie that it is.\n\nJust like chimps couldn't one day decide they're not chimps but people with identities that matter, and that deserve to be supported and glamorized with decorations and toys all fueled by slashing and burning the forest around them... seems pretty clear the result is the same. \n\nThere was simply never a budget for any living thing to live outside its niche -which was once plentiful- and that's how the system works. The second something decides it can kill/consume everything it doesn't recognize as part of itself,  the whole system falls apart. \n\nAt the very least, a climate neutral existence means never having to dig for more resources, because the earth provides everything we need. \n\nI dont understand what people envision in this world of solar panels, Ev's, and all the other stuff. Are we still maintaining roads in this world? How? Are we still buying food at a grocery store rather than growing it ourselves? How? \n\nThis is a cancer we have created in the world, in the same way that cancer consumes the body without regard for the body's survival while treating any cell that isn't cancerous as fair game. It eats and eats and eats until there's so little left of the body, it's mostly cancer... and here we are thinking we can probably survive without the body after we've killed it... after all, we have all those movies that show us! How this whole thing isn't so obviously a lie to hide the true nature of our activities, I dont understand. Why do people want remote work to end? Because there's an entire economy built on you driving to work and spending money there, too. \n\nIt's a doomsday device built by war mongers who figured out they could keep the pace of global war up and never return to peacetime if they kept the basic manufacturing the same, but changed the shape into modern conveniences.\n\n... and here we are being told \"you gotta get out! The building is on fire and the roof is about to collapse!\" And our response is something like \"i just need a little more time! I've whittled a prototype of a fire extinguisher out of wood and am right on the verge of putting the fire out!... I just need a little more wood and fire to get there!\"\n\nI dont understand any of it, frankly. We've proven this is a suicide pact, but use the excuse that we \"need to put food on the table\" (i.e. survival) as the reason it still makes sense to keep making the same mistakes.  \n\nI really cannot wait to hear people's response when it becomes manifest that's what they're really doing when they go to work; making tomorrow worse. All we had to do was stop and do literally *anything* else and life on earth would be thriving. We wouldn't have screens or cars or any of this, but id bet we'd be much happier in a quieter, living world, than in this insane pace of self destruction \"why isn't my money buying the same things!?\"... maybe because the value of money is finally catching up to the consequences of what created its value?\n\nBut im intensely curious how it lands when people realize it's too late to fix and the fix was going back to before we lived in giant cities and sticking to our tribal organization that our ecosystem supported, complete with predators and no health care... because that's what living on earth without causing a mass extinction demands, not because it's what anyone wants.",

And I could DC couple my old panels at another location. And connect my F150 Lighting to a generator input for additional storage?\n\nAny other ideas? Franklin? Bueller? (sorry, wrong movie)",

"comment": "&gt;Promoting veganism may not directly involve you in the practice, but it will do almost nothing to alleviate it.\n\nIt does MUCH more to alleviate it -- and NOW. Not in the near future, NOW. We don't need to spend money and time on lab meat. There are vegan choices right now that are available. And every person that goes vegan is one more that has decided to try not to contribute unnecessarily to any animal exploitation, not just for meat. That's HUGE. \n\n&gt;Mass conversion is not a practical solution.\n\nIt's the only real solution their is if you see a problem with *animal exploitation*. You can't solve animal exploitation with more animal exploitation. You have to change how people view animals. And you really think there will be any mass conversion to lab meat? I highly doubt it.  \n\nVeganism is a growing movement and things are changing. I can see it around me. Even in a rural area people are talking about it. More vegan products are showing up and others are being labelled vegan that wouldn't have before. People who aren't even vegan are buying vegan products and, yes, more people are becoming vegans. How many are eating lab grown meat so far? I think we're ahead. And what we don't need is the message that, well, some exploitation is o.k. after all because well it's not so bad as what some people do. We have enough of that with the \"happy\" meat movement as it is selling people on the idea that if they pay $8 for a carton of eggs they're doing a good deed and can enjoy their omelettes guilt-free even though they're still the products of exploited, suffering animals.",

The lipid hypothesis has been thoroughly disproven, so I have no idea why anyone would want to pursue a fat-free diet other than to starve their brain and other vital processes. \n\nIf weight-loss is your goal, substituting carbs for fat is the wrong path. You can eat plenty of fat while losing weight, maintaining excellent cardiovascular health, and reversing conditions like type-2 diabetes. You just have to limit your carbs to some extent. Moreover, there is very little \"falling off the wagon\" (to use the words of the writer of the above blog, who admits to not being able to follow a fat-free vegan regimen), because your body is satisfied. \n\nLook up The Primal Blueprint or The Paleo Solution. You can be vegetarian if you want, but it would be hard to stay vegan. It's MUCH healthier than almost any vegan diet.",

"comment": "Greetings fellow vegan Canberran redditor, we are not alone. Although in a world that does not seem to value compassion as much as it could, it sometimes feels like it.\n\nI have found social media to be a great outlet for my thoughts, as well as a great way to read about other's experiences. I prefer those communities that allow me to have more control over who I interact with, so Twitter is better than Facebook even though I don't use it much any more. It's nice to live in a vegan bubble every now and again, and interact with those who feel the same way as I do.\n\nIf unlike me you are more into meatspace (lol?) interactions then check out Animal Liberation ACT (http://on.fb.me/ZYeVas) or the ACT Vegan and Vegetarian Society (http://bit.ly/ZJHspP). Volunteering at the Living Green Festival (http://on.fb.me/10NmjNi) might also be a good idea to meet other like minded people.\n\nAs far as interacting with others face to face though, I suppose for me it's mostly a matter of perspective. People can be cruel, thoughtless or act in ways intended to get a reaction out of you. It's not easy at times but I find it's a good practice to turn these interactions into ways to learn more about how other people view the world, as well as good ways to challenge your own beliefs. \n\nRead as much as you can about the realities of farming practices, nutrition, horse racing, the life cycle of kangaroos, anything else that gets constantly brought up in these types of conversations. I find that it helps to have clear and complete information on hand, but at the same time don't feel bad about not having all the answers. There are always grey areas, and you can always go away and research something to have in your mind if the subject comes up again.\n\nI don't see a need to preach to others, but I'm usually pretty clear on the reasons why I'm vegan and not interested in celebrating something like Melbourne Cup Day or showing up for a bacon and eggs breakfast.\n\nAs you mention, some people find it quite confrontational if you don't conform to what they expect as far as diet and heath goes. I think that living the way you are is the best example you can show people that the way you live your life is valid and to be respected. Be peaceful, be compassionate, be healthy and be informed and respectful. By doing this it makes preaching redundant, nobody wants to be around that preachy vegan guy. Incidentally, I have never met that guy. I have a feeling he doesn't exist.\n\nCheers,\n\nG.",

"comment": "yeah, watching freelee is what kick-started my veganism too, because i did want to lose weight, and she's fucking hot and i wanted to look like that. i felt like shit on raw-til-4 because i was trying to follow her ridiculous standards, 2500 cals a day? seriously? i would stuff myself until i felt sick trying to eat enough calories, i was constantly bloated and my digestion was terrible, and i was so upset because i couldn't figure out what i was doing wrong. it almost turned into an eating disorder, i was definitely obsessed with it. i quit that shit months ago after i started hanging out on r/vegan and now i eat a much more relaxed and balanced vegan diet. i still eat low fat, but i don't shun things like avocado or nut butter, i just eat them in moderation now. i quit tracking my calories so obsessively, i just make sure to eat only when i'm hungry, and i eat super clean (no processed foods). i lost 50lbs being vegan, and i was afraid that relaxing my diet would make me gain it all back, but what do you know, i haven't. my digestion is great now and my stomach is not constantly distended from forcing so much food into my gut. i'm convinced that portion control, moderation, and healthy choices are much more sustainable diet guidelines than the stuff that freelee recommends. plus, now that i don't have to focus on eating AS MANY CALORIES AS POSSIBLE and looking at veganism as a means to an end, I've been able to cultivate more of an ethical/moral connection to veganism, plus I've been learning to produce amazing vegan baked goods, which is something I never wanted to do on raw-til-4 because OMG FAT YOU GUYS.\n\nstill, she is getting a lot of people into veganism, which is good i guess, i just worry that a lot of people will get fucking crazy about it like i did and give up, and blame it on veganism being a stupid fad diet, rather than blaming themselves for  taking shitty advice.",

We would love to have you as a member(you can usually attend meetings even if you are not currently a member, no problem). :) I know personally being a vegan and not knowing anyone else that was vegan did get hard after a while, you can only handle being the \"odd vegan person\" for so long. Check out www.djurensratt.se to find out more about your local group. Most have meetings 1-2 times per month, besides any other activities that might be scheduled.",

It may work fine for you to eat 1200 but that would be incredibly unhealthy for most people. Including women (edit: I am F/5'7\"/currently 105lbs, eating 2000+ per day myself).\n\nMore specifically, since this is a vegan sub: if people follow this advice and massively under-eat, they're more likely to feel ill and give up veganism. But there is also a risk that in a minority, validated under-eating can send someone down the path of developing anorexia, if certain genetic underpinning is in place.",

You are going to need to eat as a very healthy vegan to give it a fair shot of any diet related underlying problems.  Eat a ton of fresh fruit, greens , bright vegetables , legumes, whole grain breads and try to keep fat under 10%.\n\nI would recommend a book such as \"The Engine 22\" Diet (forget the name but that is close) and \"Forks Over Knives\" recipe books, they stay true to the WFPB health eating\nGood luck!",

You actually will help prevent the suffering and death of around 200 animals per year by being vegan.\n\nEven though an individual vegan's actions are likely a rounding error in terms of sending a demand signal to the farming industry, the \"expected value\" of each vegan's actions is unchanged.  At some point, it's guaranteed that a single less chicken ordered by a grocery store will cascade to another 1000 fewer chickens bred at a farm.  That vegan will have essentially won the vegan lottery, but the benefit is shared across all people who abstained from buying the chicken.",

"comment": "Vegan Christian here. I've maybe had an option for me like... Twice at a Christian event? And one was organized by my dad, so....\n\nAs far as I can tell, American Christian culture tends to be tied to conservative culture (maybe less with younger generations), which doesn't encourage things like vegetarianism or veganism, and a big bulk of Christians live in the South, where culture doesn't encourage things like vegetables. I know, broad strokes. I live in the deep South, so my perspective is skewed towards those specifics. \n\nOf course, there's Seventh Day Adventists and other denominations that tend to veg*anism, but those aren't part of mainstream American Christian culture. Stewardship of resources, compassion to all animals beyond just pets or exotic hunted animals, and fasting - those are concepts rarely talked about. It's often frustrating, especially since local Christians talk a lot about accepting people and loving them, but.... They very rarely even provide other food options for other people that make the choice to be vegetarian or vegan, much less care about making the choice personally to keep animals from suffering or to harm the environment less.",
