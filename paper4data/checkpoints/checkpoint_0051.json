Not just making a better electric car but a better vehicle overall regardless of fuel source. Right now tesla gets a A in worlds best sedan and a F in affordability. Manufacturers want to fight over the electric car market as they see it as a niche market when what they should be doing is making vehicles better and as affordable as ice vehicles with a quick, inexpensive, and available recharging network where all electric cars use the same adapter. Currently tesla is the only manufacturer with a rapidly expanding charging network.

I agree it's disgusting, but don't you dare think that China is the world leader in solving environmental issues because right now they are the main cause of it, Unless they start to really kick ass with Nuclear. \n\nWhat I'm talking about is keeping USA Solar tax money inside the USA.

EVgo is turning up the heat on EV charging with a station capable of charging at a rate of up to 350kW. The new chargers being installed are seven times faster than any fast chargers currently available and represent a new level of convenience for EV charging.\n\nWhen complete, EVgo’s High-Power charging station at the site of World’s Tallest Thermometer, will link Southern California to Las Vegas, furthering EVgo’s position as the leading national fast charging provider. The High-Power Charger complements EVgo’s existing fast charging stations throughout California and the U.S., allowing EV drivers to travel with confidence.\n\n“EVgo is laser focused on the needs of our customers, and they want faster charging at more locations,” said Terry O’Day, Vice President, Product Strategy and Market Development at EVgo. “The World’s Tallest Thermometer High-Power station is an important step for the EV industry, as this new standard will open the EV market to even wider audiences. When this station opens to the public next year, EV drivers will enjoy a new level of freedom.”\n                                                                           \nThe World’s Tallest Thermometer High-Power station will include four High-Power DC fast chargers capable of up to 350kW each, and can accommodate expansion of up to eight chargers in the future. The site will include a solar canopy to help power the chargers, as well as backup batteries. The High-Power chargers will be compatible with the two protocol standards used by all EV manufacturers, CCS and CHAdeMO. EVgo expects the project to be completed by June 2017.\n\nBy owning and operating charging stations, EVgo provides EV drivers with better service and enables them to go faster and farther with their electric vehicle.  EVgo offers the most convenient fast charging options to EV owners, with more than 800 DC fast charging sites in over 60 U.S. markets. EVgo utilizes a variety of flexible payment solutions including pay-as-you-go, low-cost membership plans and unlimited charging for customers of partner automakers, including BMW, Nissan and Ford. \n\n\nAbout EVgo\nEVgo leads America’s electric vehicle revolution. Our mission: Build the nation’s largest EV charging network while improving the planet and boosting the economy. We put the right chargers in the right places. Together we unite the EV movement for all, making it unstoppable. EVgo provides access to hundreds of public charging sites across the United States.

Inspired partly by the Impact's perceived potential for success, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) subsequently passed a mandate that made the production and sale of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) a requirement for the seven major automakers selling cars in the United States to continue to market their vehicles in California.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002963125807582401,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11954835059245852,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.02738905946413676,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.03388300289710363,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31561872859795886,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.335260056880157,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.060906116579038404,"ev_1":-0.013509654272638727,"ev_2":-0.0007194588949156847,"ev_3":-0.0004648374542739475,"ev_4":-0.00023182566110335756,"ev_5":-0.0011530696477469367,"ev_6":-0.001305550188893297},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neutral/mixed.

Cadillac and Hummer lines will be like Tesla where price and tax incentives just aren't important factors to their target market. And, GM claims to be achieving profitability with Bolt. Ultium is a big step forward tech wise, funded largely on ICE and Bolt successes. With cost sharing, Ultium should be profitable pretty quickly. \n\nSo, tax incentives are in their rear view mirror, more likely GM would lobby to eliminate incentives for all.

As it stands, we wouldn’t have enough to just run only EVs and nothing else.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002002376209323605,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3412462454637428,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23397872799397168,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1966365833156227,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.41346042721931603,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22836424479364723,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23796957426974943,"ev_1":-0.16167251655557438,"ev_2":-0.003835112467641011,"ev_3":-0.14789360590899983,"ev_4":-0.08610720055488248,"ev_5":-0.000872149738521936,"ev_6":-0.003359257219318105,"1.1.1_stance_lack_recheck":-0.13120247361074652},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(The author is expressing concerns about the insufficient grid capacity to support the transition to EVs, indicating an opposing stance.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

It took back all 1,117 cars after their leases ended and crushed them, symbolizing the death of a promising new technology. Electric vehicle activists even held a funeral for the beloved cult car.\n\nBut in 2011, Paine released “Revenge of the Electric Car,” showcasing the production of new electric cars by — yep – GM, Nissan and Tesla as concerns about global warming were growing and interest by consumers in clean vehicles was accelerating.\n\nSince then, the global auto industry has largely embraced electric vehicles as governments around the world are working to phase planet-warming gasoline-powered cars out of existence. \n\nBut there’s a new enemy of electric cars trying to kill them again: Republicans beholden to the oil industry and who oppose government efforts to address climate change. Their tactics threaten the viability of domestic automakers that have poured billions of dollars into electric vehicle development.\n\nRepublicans are being led by former President Donald Trump — again a presidential candidate — who has characterized the United Auto Workers strike against Detroit Three automakers not a fight for better wages, benefits and working conditions, but as the result of electric vehicles.\n\nTrump, in a visit last month to a nonunion, Macomb County auto parts supplier, engaged in his typical nihilistic hyperbole by saying moving to electric vehicles is “a transition to hell” and that “the entire car industry will be packed up and shipped to China” in two to three years. China is the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, batteries and their components.\n\n\n Former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a political rally while campaigning for the GOP nomination in the 2024 election at Erie Insurance Arena on July 29, 2023 in Erie, Pennsylvania. | Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\nHe and fellow Republicans blame the strike on President Joe Biden’s environmental policies, which call for two-thirds of all new cars and light trucks to be electric by 2032. Republicans say that will kill auto factory jobs because electric vehicles have fewer parts than gas-powered cars and trucks.\n\nRidiculing electric vehicles is an easy thing for Republicans to do. Most believe climate change is a hoax. And if the climate really is changing, they say human behavior is not responsible for it. In their minds, there is no reason to turn away from the internal combustion engine that has powered cars and trucks for more than a century.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, many other world leaders and even some automakers see it differently. They view planet-warming greenhouse gasses spewed by cars and trucks as a mortal threat to humanity. \n\nAbout 40 countries are in the process of phasing out gas-powered engines. Six automakers, including Ford and General Motors, have pledged to end global sales of gas- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040.\n\nThe Biden administration is handing out billions of dollars in cash and tax credits to U.S. automakers and battery manufacturers in a move to lessen dependence on China, which dominates raw materials sourcing and refining, and battery cell production.\n\nBut Republican lawmakers in Washington are taking aim at Ford’s $3.5 billion battery plant in Marshall that licenses battery technology from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., the world’s largest battery maker.\n\nStarting next year, only vehicles that have certain battery components from countries friendly to the U.S. qualify for the $7,500 consumer tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act. Republicans are investigating whether Ford’s licensing agreement with CATL violates the “foreign entities of concern” provision.\n\nFord has paused work on its Marshall plant, which has received $1.8 billion in state financial incentives, amid the contentious UAW strike. Some experts say Ford may be rethinking the factory, expected to employ 2,500 workers, in light of the dispute and Republican opposition to it.\n\nU.S. Rep. Lisa McClain, a Macomb County Republican, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the pause is “GREAT news” for Michigan. “Chinese technology has no place in our country and I am glad to see this battery plant be put on hold.” \n\n\n U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain at a President Donald Trump rally in Washington Twp. on April 2, 2022 | Allison R. Donahue\nHouse Select Committee on China Chair Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) called on Ford to scrap the project.\n\nFormer Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, now the U.S. Energy Secretary, more than a decade ago blamed Republican opposition to clean energy legislation for China’s dominance in electric vehicles and other green technologies.\n\nWriting in Politico in 2012, Granholm accused Republicans of being “Manchurian candidates” by opposing the kind of government investment in new technologies that China was making. The GOP, she said, was helping China “win the gold. And smiling all the way.”\n\nShe was right. The Detroit Three are lagging far behind China in electric car production, as well as American automaker Tesla.\n\n“Detroit automakers have no choice but to sustain their pursuit of electrics,” Michael Dunne, a consultant and former Asian auto executive told me. “The alternative is capitulation to China. \n\n“The world’s largest market by far, China, and Europe are going electric,” he said. “America is already seven to 10 years behind. Further delays will only widen the gap.”\n\nBut Republicans aren’t looking to make it easy for Detroit to catch up.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.12103587264762912,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20843505372276747,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14327870624095485,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.045522865218420826,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10593804429546393,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.02601225348189473,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.00472293677739799,"ev_1":-0.17528936980950383,"ev_2":-0.0140422631908829,"ev_3":-0.03259086659333358,"ev_4":-0.026813439093520703,"ev_5":-0.02954378894840441,"ev_6":-0.2297044893105801},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (due to opposition from Republicans)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The limit for me (according to my installer) is about 30 kW of solar panels.  In other words, in order that I don't pump too much electricity into the grid that would blow up the local transformer, I have solar panels that if the panels were pumping 100% of their energy INTO the grid (and I was using none of it) then the transformer on my street wouldn't blow up.  It makes sense, I just wish there was better technology where it would always limit what I was pumping up into the grid, but if I'm charging my batteries and also using electricity I can go higher. \n\nNow, if I disconnect from the grid I can go higher!  But ideally for me I would stay connected to the grid but run for a year that way and see if I ever needed to draw any electricity from the grid.

They aren't looking to scale or make a profit, they're just looking to research and understand all aspects of various technologies.\n\n2) Find a startup that is trying to roll out an innovative new idea / technology. In the world of solar today, this will most likely be someone trying to do thin film (maybe CIGS or Cad Tel) or a unique manufacturing process of mono or poly crystalline. This would provide an opportunity to do something truly revolutionary and meaningful but comes with a SERIOUS risk that everything fails and you are left unemployed.\n\n3) Go to one of the big established manufacturers. FWIW this is what I would do. I know First Solar spends a toooonn on R&amp;D and to someone else's point I'm sure SunPower and all the others do too. Here your work would be more focused - i.e. probably just trying to drive down cost and improve efficiency on the current process.

There’s a great conversation going on in this thread, and I just wanted to offer a bit of clarification regarding what Wholesale Solar offers, how we design our systems, etc.\n\nFirst of all, it's absolutely true that a DIY solar install project is not for everyone. I speak to folks every day who, for a variety of reasons, ultimately decide that they’d rather hire someone to install their system versus installing it on their own. \n\nHowever, Wholesale Solar has been in business for over 20 years selling mainly to DIY homeowners, so clearly, DIY is a good fit for a large number of people. There’s a significant amount of money to be saved by installing one’s own system, and for many of our customers, there’s also the satisfaction of having done the work on their own.\n\nAll of our packaged systems are designed with a DIY install in mind, and to this end they each include a three-line electrical design drawing specific to the equipment being installed. These are prepared in accordance with current NEC regulations, and because we know that there is variety in local requirements throughout the country, we are able to quickly update a drawing if needed, or even prepare a fully custom diagram ahead of time.\n\n(As an example, a customer of mine was recently told that the AC disconnect for his system needed to be shown between the inverter and the meter vs. between the meter and the utility service panel. We made this adjustment and sent a revised drawing within 24 hours.)\n\nAll of our packaged systems include IronRidge roof racking, which can be upgraded to IronRidge SGA (“scalable ground array”) racking for ground installations. In either case, all IronRidge equipment is pre-engineered, which allows us to generate the standard engineering information required for permitting. This information is specific to each customer’s location, equipment, array size and configuration, wind and snow expectations, etc.\n\nYou can check out the design tool that we use on IronRidge’s website, here: http://www.ironridge.com/asce710/rm_projects/new\n\nAdditionally, IronRidge has stamped engineering letters available for each state. As with all aspects of life, there are exceptions, but by and large, this documentation from IronRidge is enough to get our customers through permitting.\n\nTypically, the only other documentation our customers need for permitting is a set of spec sheets for the major system components — all easily downloaded from our website, though my colleagues and I typically include them as attachments with our quotes — and possibly a plot plan, which, unless your local inspector has specific requirements, can be as simple as a Google Earth screenshot of the install site with panels drawn in using MS Paint.\n\nIt’s true that our packages do not include flashings. This is simply because not every customer will install the same style of roof (or on a roof at all), nor will they necessarily need the same number of flashings. The number of attachment points for an array will vary depending on final panel layout. For roof installations, we offer QuickMount PV flashings (http://www.quickmountpv.com). For ground installations, we offer the previously mentioned SGA racking.\n\nIt’s also true that our packages do not include conduit, copper ground wire, sealant, etc. (Though I should note that all IronRidge racking includes integrated grounding hardware.) This is for much the same reason that we do not include flashings: every installation will be different, with different code requirements and equipment needs. Beyond that, we also have faith that when it comes to non-PV equipment, our customers will be able to find what they need at their local hardware store, Home Depot, etc. (And likely at prices more competitive than what we would be able to offer.)\n\nFinally, all of our customers receive lifetime technical support for their purchases, and while we are unable to be on the ground with our customers during installation, my colleagues and I make every effort to be available to answer whatever questions or concerns may arise throughout the entire process. Nearly everyone on our design &amp; sales team has either installed a solar array on their own home and/or helped a coworker with an installation, and we participate in ongoing series of training sessions, which have included everything from wire and conduit sizing to when and how to derate a utility service panel to full custom system design.\n\nIn short, while a DIY install may not be for everyone, if it’s something that you want to do, I am confident that we can help you make it happen, as we have for so many other folks over the years: http://www.wholesalesolar.com/reviews-comments-testimonials.html\n\nThanks so much!\n\nRegards,\nAnna\nSystem Design &amp; Sales\nWholesale Solar","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"yes","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.21738528708611207,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23029775239944228,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18353821981144774,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14733325131237507,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.009872474464584105,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3030678474654754,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17911014892158997,"solar_1":-0.14380985722611556,"solar_2":-0.1215288398804785,"solar_3":-0.16141544263897206,"solar_4":-0.04428788105805966,"solar_5":-0.07171107740173067,"solar_6":-0.08614713548751637,"solar_7":-0.17876640552682663,"solar_8":-0.017438804393770276,"solar_9":-0.023765098676086893,"solar_10":-0.18387569472830817},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro\n\nExplanation: The author, Anna, is an employee of Wholesale Solar and is expressing her support for the company and its DIY solar installations.

So, what I'm saying is, unless things have changed, ground mounts really are a lot more expensive.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005964517525474852,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2044302976925764,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1959126818604789,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23140417163570723,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.03686876009038542,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.05135004719098409,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09508871527699132,"solar_1":-0.09241568462069456,"solar_2":-0.001442392681686518,"solar_3":-0.17698834785905335,"solar_4":-0.19726885641601452,"solar_5":-0.0021533572871703655,"solar_6":-0.0965549498253777,"solar_7":-0.004240699747848946,"solar_8":-0.006012572840215095,"solar_9":-0.04557088425159842,"solar_10":-0.18225779262762956},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Ours works out at 7c a kWh for solar (we don't get net metering so that's all we get paid for any energy we export so I might as well use it to charge the car) but we're paying $2.30 per litre of fuel. My MINI for instance will cost around $14 to cover 100km but even charging our LEAF on the most expensive peak time power we have here (20c per kWh) means the LEAF would cost $3 to cover the same distance. Using our own solar drops that to $1, or $2 if we use the cheap rate 14c per kWh. However I look at it, the LEAF costs 14x less per 100km than a MINI Cooper. The best hybrids will manage to go around 2x further per litre of fuel (3 litres per 100km) so are still going to be 7x more expensive per km to run. Then there's the servicing costs and our LEAF cost us $99 for a full dealer service at 30,000km. Other than that, I've replaced the wiper blades and had a new set of tyres fitted at 50,000km. Comparing the annual running costs to an ICE or even a hybrid the LEAF is still way cheaper.\n\nBased on your number, if we were paying the same it would cost us $6 to cover 100km in our LEAF which is still much cheaper than petrol for my MINI and still less than a hybrid at our fuel prices so your fuel would still have to be cheaper than ours to make it the same as an EV and that also assumes the EV running costs versus an ICE are the same which they aren't.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005195137578994036,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24709055633450458,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3168146332584598,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3158892490966557,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2452549067592271,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2573970457162815,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.020909264315074932,"solar_1":-0.23942425663426364,"solar_2":-0.20599149690806395,"solar_3":-0.014834618645788092,"solar_4":-0.2000243328748675,"solar_5":-0.009246025181103809,"solar_6":-0.011295605140427748,"solar_7":-0.03476319393424395,"solar_8":-0.17351607377107334,"solar_9":-0.18965281361269845,"solar_10":-0.07082018813525792},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Maybe it will go this way when bartteries hit the right price, but right now there seem to be some economic arguments as to why it doesn’t make as much sense as centralized generation.\n\nTake a look at the whitepaper I posted above, quite an interesting read. One of the other issues they raised with part of the population going grid free is that it places the burden of paying for the centralized generation/distribution still required on a smaller group of the population - this would likely mean higher energy costs for poorer people who cannot afford solar/batteries yet and also cannot afford those higher energy costs.

That didn’t work out and when I came back to the Enphase system I got a couple more quotes around $45-46K. All quotes are pre rebate cash price. Mind you this was mid last year so price may have gone up. I can pm you my installer if you want. \n\nI haven’t had the system turned on for very long but I’m loving it. On a sunny day like today it’s producing 60KW. With the batteries I’m getting by with only single digit KWH imported every day while exporting more depending on how Sunny it is.

I hear this a lot - that if we can increase solar panel efficiency, this would be feasible. But if you do the math you'll find it probably will not. \n\nThere is a finite amount of energy in the sunlight hitting a given surface. So even panels that are 100% efficient would still be limited. And I'm going to go out on a limb here and say we will **never** have 100% efficient solar panels. \n\nIn a similar thread a while back I did some napkin math showing that in somewhere like Vegas, you might see a 5 year payback. That was making some very generous assumptions. And in places with less sunny weather, the payback period would easily exceed 10 years (which is to say you would never recoup your costs). That was with current technology if about 20% efficiency. So let's say we could increase efficiency to 80% (which I think is a stretch in short yo medium term). It would become cost effective in some climates but still be marginal in most areas. But even at 100% efficiency you will never get enough range to extend your range significantly so as to eliminate or reduce the need for charging. So a much better and more cost effective approach would be to put a slightly larger 80% efficient panel on your roof that would charge a stationary battery, then plug in at night.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0013993904770662386,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3098320799665953,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2598634583271776,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20738972833238625,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1669824382170177,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.31452714775999385,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22883407693977156,"solar_1":-0.16517693248840187,"solar_2":-0.12526087941264702,"solar_3":-0.11643546397421627,"solar_4":-0.21613960559239662,"solar_5":-0.16389765952285082,"solar_6":-0.0056600899309463175,"solar_7":-0.005413334833671494,"solar_8":-0.19128123893218194,"solar_9":-0.03926437317153386,"solar_10":-0.07537671419295829},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

You will get as much protein as you need from a vegan diet provided you're not just eating junk food. Eat properly, take an active interesting in cooking, and understand your nutritional needs. You'll only need to supplement protein if you're an athlete or you're trying to build muscle etc. This is no different than meat eaters who eat tons of meat and still supplement protein. Too much of anything is bad for you ;)\n\nB12 is the one thing you will need to supplement - everything else you just need a varied, healthy, conscious diet.\n\nThe problem with challenges like the one you're undertaking is that the initial switch is the *most difficult part*. Radical dietary changes always have uncomfortable side effects, such as feeling hungry, feeling gassy, bloated, grumpy etc. Its not veganism that is doing it to you, its your body adjusting to radically different input. Its not dissimilar to withdrawal symptoms. \n\nIf you have no interest in being vegan after the 90 days is up, then just suck it up and get through it. Your problems will pass, but in order to not feel like shit *all the time*, then you need to eat properly. That means taking an active interest in where you food comes from, discovering new recipes and new styles of food etc. For what its worth, I've never eaten better since I became vegan, but I did it because I actually wanted to and so invested the time to learn how to cook using vegan ingredients and find and research new foods and recipes.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, the food you've mentioned is literally the blandest, most boring vegan food you could be feeding yourself. Buy a decent recipe book or just look online, there's plenty out there! You can't just eat boring food and then complain that it's not satisfying you. If you're hungry, eat more. If you literally cannot stop feeling hungry, its likely that you overeat generally. Most people do, to some degree.

It's the categorical imperative I think-- act on that principles that you would want to become universal.

They are saying that those corporations are the clinate problem.\n\nWhen people repeat this constant ideological  personal responsibility mantra, it becomes instantly clear that they don't understand the machine, they only see the gears.\n\nWe are not all equally responsible. And despite what elementary schools brainwash kids to believe, supply and demand isn't governed by how many people want something, it's governed by how many dollars get paid for it.\n\nVoting with your wallet is not a democratic concept. 90% of all of the contents of those wallets belong to 10% of Americans. And Americans have larger wallets than a lot of people.\n\nThat said, rich people choose what resources are being spent on. They in turn have the most access to those resources.\n\nWhen people say, \"71% of GHGs are produced by 100 companies\" they are not saying that they sell things to consumers that make 71% of GHGs. They are saying that these companies produce that much doing business with the people who have 90% of the wealth, a group that is not dictated by 90% of us.\n\n90% of the population could abandon meat and driving but oil companies would find a way short term to sell bullshit to the top 10% to make up those costs. Oh, look, another war for anorher pipeline to ship barrels of oil on tankers run on oil to power more tanks and jets and private airliners.\n\nBecause a single transatlantic flight cancels out two people going vegan for a year. Who do you think owns enough wealth to fly two to a plane? Do you think you deciding not to fly commercial matters to those people?\n\nHell, they could simply do like GM did and decide to stop making vehicles that threaten those prices and then lobby for tax breaks for hummers so the top 10% can consume even more resources.\n\nAnd what if the top 10% invest the 84% of stocks they control in the things that 90% of Americans don't want? Will they take a vote or will they just go ahead and secure their investments?\n\nThis is what they understand and you don't. You are not playing the same game that those people are.

Supply and demand. Say a store is used to buying 5 pigs per day for an average of 50 customers. You’re right in saying that if 10 of those customers went vegan, for a period, about 1 pig per day will go to waste; however, it’s foolish to think that the store’s inventory manager wouldn’t lower their own demand from the slaughterhouse, as they are losing money on the last pig. I’m obviously oversimplifying, but it is simple supply and demand.\n\n* this has already been the case in many industries. Dairy is a good example, where there have been HUGE drops in demand in recent years. Yes, a lot of milk has gone to waste in the meantime, but that is better than us continuously breeding the same number of cows into existence for us to abuse.\n\n2. A side effect of the drop in demand for animal products is usually a rise in demand for plant based products, which leads to more incentive to put out plant based products, which makes it easier and easier for people to transition to veganism, as the biggest hurdle for a lot of people is psychological.\n\n&gt; how does changing what food you eat have any effect whatsoever?\n\nI mean, I can take that argument and use it to justify just about anything then right? Why try to reduce my own waste? Why bother with a reusable water bottle? Why not sexually harass people to get my way, as it’s not like I’m making a huge difference one way or the other; millions of people everywhere face sexual harassment. You get my gist I hope. There are a lot of things we as individuals cannot influence (like I can’t change the entire animal agriculture industry on my own), but that’s why people have to make morally conscious decisions where they do have control. Diet is by far the easiest one.\n\nAs for the downvotes, someone below pointed out that you spoke respectfully and asked a valid question that didn’t deserve downvotes. I honestly think a lot of the downvotes are fair, even though personally I think your comment contributed, because the point of this sub is for vegans or people also interested in veganism, and not really for debate about whether to go vegan (r/debateavegan) might suit your questions better.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20216574386769864,"1.1.1_stance":-0.33684237015797763,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21145522093942384,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2708074205653805,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2817235106693165,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.280629394927415,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.27033187842850265,"diet_1":-0.2082557114578473,"diet_2":-0.21159001814416764,"diet_3":-0.12388189181086773,"diet_4":-0.20759608313286057,"diet_5":-0.14116931873043845,"diet_6":-0.06922922957407233,"diet_8":-0.05429163067431849,"diet_9":-0.007829838558488214,"diet_10":-0.1099085289267047,"diet_11":-0.1727799179969051,"diet_13":-0.026321972138248384,"diet_14":-0.2158055695690564,"diet_17":-0.0028556038281143024},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I get this kind of shit all the time.

They take offence rather than realise and accept that they're being not very smart and change their behaviour for their own sake if nothing else. Maybe I ought to stop, as it's clear I'm just wasting my own time and energy. \n\nI guess I just want to see the vegan community/movement stop martyring themselves and start setting an example for everyone else - that we stand up for the animals _first_ and as such, we take full responsibility for ourselves - we don't roll over and cry about it when dickbag restaurant staff deliberately mislabel things or refuse to accommodate allergies. Don't give them your patronage. Just get up and go and eat somewhere else. And do it in a dignified manner - don't make a big scene. \n\nOP did right by the animals and the movement to warn us that this sort of thing happens, but the sub's general reaction to it shows serious weakness. Just pearl clutching and \"oh that's dangerous, they could kill someone with allergies!\" Peak victim mentality and a total loss of sight of what the whole point of all of this even is.
