"comment": "&gt; Most people will charge their car at night at cheap off peak rates.\n\nThat doesn't fit with my perception of cities tbh. I see a lot of people living in apartments or not having off-street parking or a personal garage and so a limited ability to charge \"at home\".\n\nIf my local garage where I can rent parking spots had charging abilities, sure I'd be looking to plug in there.\n\nI agree about charging at work places (and although they may be free now this may be similar to rest stops where people are looking to \"cash in\" on charging stations in the parking lots.\n\n&gt; The only chargers that people would be willing to pay a decent amount for are fast DC chargers located conveniently along freeways.\n\nI think this is the crux of it. I think people would pay in one way or another for this.\n\n&gt; Tesla owners may be unlikely to be willing to pay for access to third party superchargers since they can get their juice for free.\n\nIf you consider those people who can currently afford a Model S likely have enough to pay for charges when convenient they may be as likely as anyone to use what is nearest rather than what is cheapest. Superchargers are not so common just yet.\n\n&gt; The charging rate(mile/hour) is very high which is a premium service.\n\nCompletely agree here. If you can get a full (or 70%) charge in ~20mins as with the Superchargers then you are competing with ICEs on convenience and true freedom of movement. How the infrastructure of the next gen charging standards needs to rise to match Tesla's is not yet clear.\n\n&gt; Personally I hope that other automakers adopt Tesla's connector and charging system which is more affordable and provides higher power through a smaller cheaper connector/socket than other standards.\n\nFor me, this was the highlight of the open sourcing of patents earlier in the year by Tesla. Why not allow others to use the Superchargers and share in the technology, even if it does cost those manufacturers who agree to pay (or pass the cost on to their own consumers). Suddenly charging times are another worry free aspect of driving EVs longer distances - whoever you bought from. I think the smarter and less egotistic manufacturers might take them up on it if it makes business sense / money.",

"comment": "Oh very cool! I was actually looking into getting a Tesla roadster because I love open top driving in CA. There were less used ones on the market than I would have thought for the bay area. A 1.5 was about the same list as what I got the ELR for, but it had nothing on the creature comforts, and since it was used was actually 10k more in loss incentives. The 2.5 was worth considering. I wonder what this new battery upgrade will run you. \nThe thing that tipped the scales though was the insurance! As under 25 male even with no accidents it was close to 300/mo. \nEven with the limited run of ELR under 1,000 we aren't cool like roadsters that are numbered.",

"comment": "&gt;polluter extremists    \n\nFaulty comparison. Electric cars require more energy and infrastructure for instance, coal being the source for not a few of them, requiring more raw materials be constructed to create that infrastructure. Their production alone emits about as much carbon as an inefficient old ford bronco might over the course of 20 years.    \n\nOf course, you're still transporting those cars through conventional means, strip mining to obtain the increased rare earth required to construct them (Internal combustion engine requires far less than vehicle sized batteries) and eventually have to deal with the disposal of hazardous waste.   \n\n--------------   \n\nTo boot, you don't even know who you're talking to. I drive the same small, fuel efficient car that I have for nearly a decade now, only use lights when necessary in the house, nearly never use the heat or AC. Lights are turned off when not in use, recyclables are recycled. I work for a company that has purchased a number of acres in the area for preservation, and strives to protect our enviroment.  \n\nI simply think there's no cause for alarm, no reason to use alarm to shove poor policy and products down people's throats.    \n\nWant green energy? Go nuclear.   \n\nIt's sustainable, thorium reactors are safe and cannot melt down by design, they can also use nuclear waste of certain grades as fuel. \nOf the 3 incidents with nuclear:   \n\n3 mile Island was evacuated and no one was harmed.    \n\nChernobyl was conducting dangerous experiments with safeties disengaged.    \n\nFukishima was built on the cheapest land available, wasn't a matter of if a tsunami hit it, but when. Even then, only 2 have died directly from the radiation released. Far more died from the tsunami itself.  \n\n\nMost reactors are more or less prototypes, and hundreds are still running fine, without incident. If we cut away the red tape, we'll have far more efficient, safer, greener energy available for everyone.",

"comment": "The estimated profit seems unrealistically high without mentioning the cost to you.  Numbers from the article: \"$1100/year or $5/day.\"   These two numbers don't even mesh, $5/day = $1825/year, so we'll do the math in favour of realism at $1100/year. \n\n$1100/year = $3.01/day or at $0.25/kW that's 12kW a day.  Now $0.25/kw is quite high but that is in favour of realism as far as opportunity and degradation cost to you.  We're also talking profit so to profit $3/day by selling 12kw it would have to cost you nothing to charge. If it costs you $0.10/kw to charge, you'll have to sell 20kw to make that $3/day. \n\nSo 12 to 20 KWs of a 55 to 60kw battery is a loss of 20 to 33%+ of the range of the vehicle.  It also means keeping the battery charging and discharging more often as well as keeping it at higher states of charge more often meaning it will not last those 10 years stated in the article with only 20% degradation.\n\nAdding things like one way delivery charges from utilities narrows your profit and increases opportunity cost.\n\nTLDR It's a realistic and useful idea with the potential profit vs loss stated very unrealistically.  Absolutely large numbers of Evs can and will be used to stabilize the grid in the future but at a significantly smaller impact to individuals and their vehicles than stated in the article.",

"comment": "For the same reason ICE cars publish their BHP numbers: because everybody else is doing it, and it's an easy \"bigger is better!\" metric.\n\nYou talk about the Reduction Gearing, but... are you aware that, by convention, the Horsepower numbers Ford, Toyota, etc, cite are all [Brake horsepower](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-hp-and-bhp/)?  That they're doing the same thing?\n\n&gt; all we need to know is 0-60 time\n\nAnd they beat us over the head with that, too, at the trim levels where people pay attention to that sort of thing (ie, the $60k+ price tag).\n\n&gt; max power and max speed\n\nThose two metrics actually *cloud* the picture for most people.\n\nFor comparing two cars of the same drive-train type, they're generally pretty good, but an EV has such completely different performance characteristics that it ends up obscuring the differences, the *real world* benefits of the vehicles in question, how they'll perform in scenarios that the cars and their drivers are likely to find themselves in.\n\nLet's compare a Dodge Challenger Hellcat to a Tesla P90D, shall we?\n\nMetric|[Dodge Hellcat](http://www.caranddriver.com/dodge/challenger-srt-srt-hellcat)|[Tesla P90D](http://www.zeperfs.com/en/fiche6023-tesla-model-s-p90d.htm)\n:-|:-:|:-:\n0-60|3.6 s|[**2.6 s**](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/10/29/tesla-p90d-ludicrous-0-60-in-just-2-6-seconds/)\nMax power|**707 hp**|532 hp\nMax speed|**199 mph**|155 mph\nMax torque|[475 ft lbs](http://www.caranddriver.com/dodge/challenger-srt-srt-hellcat/specs)|**713 ft lbs**\n\nThe Tesla wins in Torque and 0-60 (the numbers EV's push), and loses in Power and Top Speed.  So, given the higher top speed, the higher horsepower (which is generally considered to be a measure of power *at speed*), you might think that the Hellcat would beat the Tesla in a quarter mile, wouldn't you?  If so, [you'd be wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp41d3Z2ypI)\n\nSo sure, if you're going to be cruising the Autobahn at over 150mph, top speed and horsepower are important to you, and the Hellcat would be better.  For everything that actually matters to the *average car buyer,* 0-60 and Torque are what's important\n\n...so that's what EV manufacturers are pushing.  They're selling you on the numbers that show you the benefits of *their* cars, and ignoring the ones that would give you an impression that they would perform differently than they actually do [on the things that affect their customers' lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1iJJZfB7i0).",

The value of an electric car is greatly diminished for me if I have to move it a couple times after getting home, or might not be able to charge at all because the queue was too long. Seeing all the holiday posts on the Tesla sub about people having to wait hours in line at a charging station makes me hesitate on getting an electric car. Sure I have a garage right now that I could put a charger in, but I might move next year. If I can't have my own dedicated charger at home, then I might as well stick with more conventional vehicles. That said, I'm switching to ebikes for shorter commutes when I don't have a lot to lug around. At least I can charge those with any 110V outlet.",

The same model with the same trim here would cost $47k. For instance, Mustangs in the US have a base price of like $25k for the base version. Here, it's such an elite product that they don't even have a price on their website, you have to go into a dealership and ask. They start at around 45K €, or a staggering $52K. \n\nI wish I could find a Tesla S here for the price you quoted. $40K here won't even get you a new VW Golf Diesel hatchback, let alone a Tesla. \n\nI really appreciate the input! Thank you.",

So probably also need ramps to get under the car, also a special tool to remove the filter, a tub or pan to collect the oil. Then go to the store and buy oil, get really dirty and then transport old oil to recycling and keep all your oil change gear in the garage somewhere taking up space. \n\nI know because I have done a lot of oil changes in my life. I still do them on my gas truck.. I much, MUCH prefer the electric car without having to waste all that time and money and have all that junk and get all dirty. \n\nSome people might actually enjoy it, though. Not me!",

What really matters is the actual measure of energy, usually in Watts. The DC-DC system in most EVs is capible of delivering 2,000 watts (2 kW), which wouldnt get you by in luxury, but would keep you afloat (the average fridge-freezer combo only needs 780 watts).",

When dividend/rebate is used with the funds, its also a solution that costs residents a net nothing.\n\nWith gasoline $2-$5/gallon higher, EVs are very big cost savers instead of just about break even with current vehicles.  It also rapidly increases FF electric plant closings.\n\nWith nat gas $20-$30/mmbtu higher, replacing with hydrogen becomes a customer driven mandate.  Planes, trucks, heating, industry will want hydrogen.  Its no longer essential for government spending to spur transition. (though they can still help)\n\n&gt; But I don't think that's enough to solve the whole problem at relevant speed.\n\nI see it as much faster decentralized action.  Regulation is slow to get voted on, and has delays, and lobbies to overturn/exempt.  Pricing is harder to exempt.  Rebates/dividend is popular enough to not overturn.",

The vast majority of Redditors won’t know that the M3 only starting delivering that month in the UK, and won’t know that the UK, and that the UK has fairly mediocre EV adoption so maybe this is the turnaround for them, but probably not.\n\nI genuinely don’t think there are many actual Tesla haters here, but as others have said there are a small number of Tesla zealots that regular posters respond to. As I say, I’m a huge Tesla fan but I make a point of adding context like the OP ahead here and to downvote clear Tesla fanboi posts because that’s just not what this sub is for, people here want to see the success of all EVs, not the dominance of Tesla and not the knocking of every attempt by other manufacturers.",

"comment": "Hi #rejexulous, if solar customers could have stayed with TOU D-A they would have come out much ahead of tiered rate customers. But even with the D-A customers being switched to TOU 4-9 after 5 years, they come out slightly ahead. It depends on the way one measures savings. We calculated the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) which, to put it in layman's terms, is the discount rate (which is like interest rate) that has to be applied to the stream of annual avoided costs so that the sum total of the present values of the annual avoided costs (AKA Net Present Value) equals the initial cost of the panels (less rebates, credits etc.) This calculation eliminates the need to assume some arbitrary value of discount rate.\n\nAs you indicated the customers' lifecycle stage, ownership of EVs etc can make an impact on the savings. I have read the Aurora paper. I don't know if they will update the paper with the current plans (4-9, 5-8 etc.).\n\nWhat is clear is that the rate plans are moving in a direction that is less attractive to residential solar customers. The recent request by SDG&amp;E to quadruple the minimum charge, while unlikely to be approved this time around, is an indication of the direction in which rate plans are headed. After all IOUs have a financial responsibility to their shareholders to turn a healthy profit, and as much as I hate paying more for electricity, it is in my interest and that of all utility customers that the IOUs don't go belly up. It is a delicate balance, and I don't envy the task that the PUCs face.\n\nI will post a link to the paper once it is ready.",

What is the meaning of the word \"ember\" in this context? \"Embedded\"?\n\nI understand that the system could back feed. But something like a Tesla Powerwall takes care of this, by breaking the connection with the grid, creating a microgrid when the main grid is down.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a system that does the same thing, but with a much much smaller battery (only enough to regulate and balance power generation to keep wall voltage static). Ideally, this would be much cheaper, since most of the cost of the Powerwall is the batteries.\n\nYes, I agree my rep should have mentioned this, but I feel that they were mostly up front. I asked a lot of questions, and got good answers. I think I just may have assumed the system would still work, and so didn't probe it. Guess it pays to be thorough.\n\nThx, again.",

It has been designed completely in-house. Since trucks are already body-on-frame designs, they have sort of always been skateboard chassis, but the Lightning chassis goes even further in that direction.",

I’ve heard indications that they’re looking at more than €50 million in infrastructure investments in Germany alone - over the next year or two, that’s not including chargers and installation. \n\nEA is investing $2 billion over 10 years for the entirety of NA. \n\n*It’s nowhere near enough. *\n\nIt’s the same story in Norway too. All the while 60% of new car sales the last year was BEV the amount of DC fast charging stations not operated by Tesla is mainly unchanged. \n\nIonity, the EA counterpart in Europe, is not doing a lot. I don’t get it. \n\nWhy are they waiting? The only reason I can think of is that the hardware seems to be rubbish. Every time I visit a non Tesla site 20-50% of the chargers are out of commission (or partially). Most I’ve seen with Tesla is 10% (2 stalls out of 20).",

It's a reason I'm a huge fan of Ego+ lawn equipment - they were an OEM with gas-powered equipment before they made the conscious decision to make battery-powered equipment.  The battery quality etc is great, but more importantly the underlying components and engineering has already conquered the mechanics of the situation, it's just the power source they swapped out.\n\nHighly recommend Ego+ imho",

The stronger the Regen the better is also safer in dry road conditions because you start slowing the instant you begin lifting your foot as opposed to the extra split second it takes to move to the brakes.\n\nAs for efficiency, most EVs do not have blended braking on the pedal, and even in ones that do coasting isn't saving you anything over just modulating the accelerator to the coasting position. I have always beaten rated efficiency in my EVs driving this way, and done much worse in low Regen modes.",

In that order for the most part for 2023 to now. I live outside of Sacramento and in our neighborhood there is a EV in almost every driveway with Tesla dominant with all their cars. I have seen lots of Mercedes but that might be because there is a dealership down the street. The f150 is also super popular, and rivian is the one biggest change, 2 years ago there were only a few now I see a handful everyday. \n\nI think Rivian will make it at this point, I think Lucid is on the fence it will depend on if the Saudi money keeps flowing. Fisker and the others are likey not going to make it. Making cars requires billions and early adopters are willing to put up with more bs then traditional buyers and we are past the early adopter stage already, so products need more refinement and a lower cost.",

The city value is weighted at 55 percent, the highway number at 45 percent. Decades ago, the EPA decided that's a typical ratio for an average driver.\n\n\n> Before the highway number is plugged in, though, it is reduced. The EPA takes the HFEDS number and multiplies it by 0.7. That's meant to account for aggressive driving and HVAC use. The EPA says that most automakers use this factor for their figures, but it's one place where automakers can tweak their figures.\n\n\n> Automakers can use the 0.7, derived 5-cycle data covered below, an approved 5-cycle equivalent, or \"using adjustment factors which are based on in-use data.\" If an automaker thinks its models perform better on the road, it can use a better number and get a higher range. **Most do not choose to do this, according to the EPA.**\n\n\nThe one company I know of that uses a different adjustment factor is Tesla.  So basically Tesla has an overly optimistic highway range reported while all other companies are slightly pessimistic.\n\n\nHere's another story you might find illuminating: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/doj-subpoenas-tesla-in-probes-of-autopilot-and-driving-range-estimates/",

I think you're likely to see some states and utilties react to this by arguing that policies such as net metering should be revised to lower values now that a federal credit is looking to be implemented for another 5 years. Interesting that California just be issued an extension to its net metering before the ITC announcement. It will be interesting to see how that will influence their final rule making process and whether they end up revising that extension.",

So far one of the best portable solar panels I have found is the Anker 14W solar charger. I take it everywhere I go and it charges my devices in around the same time as a traditional wall outlet (sometimes a little longer depending on the sun). \n\nSo far the charger has been great and I havn't had any issues with it. There are other chargers out there though if you need something with an internal battery. I personally didn't need one, but idk about your particular situation.\n\nAnyways this is the article I found that helped me when choose my charger. http://www.portablesolargadgets.com/5-best-portable-solar-battery-chargers-reviewed/\nHope this helps with your question!",

Using straight resistance heating its inefficient but using it to run a heat pump increases efficiency significantly. \n\nI haven't compared that to the efficiency of solar hot water but increasing the PV capacity can be used for other purposes when heat is not required, such as running AC in the summer. \n\nAlso my understanding is with a good charge controller I can dump any extra solar power I cant store to a dump load like a hot water tank element. So if my batteries and loads cant take all the power the panels are putting out my last resort is to dump it straight resistant heating.",

"comment": "There's a lot you've got going here, and way too much for an ELI5, so I'm going to ignore that.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have a premise that is not quite right. You say you want to find a way to only pay your utility for actual power, but most of a utility's costs aren't in providing that small amount of power. They need to build and maintain the distribution poles, they need to answer the phone if your power goes out, they need to dispatch trucks in a storm, and they need to own a power plant with spare capacity at the ready in case your solar panels go out on the hottest hour of the hottest day of the year. They also, because this is how most traditional utility regulation works, need to recover the costs of plants they built to supply you 10 years ago when you didn't know you were going to install solar. \n\nThese are all mostly fixed costs that don't go down that much if your energy use goes down from solar. Distributed energy storage would likely reduce these fixed costs some, but it would depend on the size and operation of the system. \n\nAs you no doubt know, there is a huge ongoing debate about the value of rooftop solar, the value of net metering and the costs for utilities to provide their services, but the key thing to understand is that this debate is happening because the answers aren't quite clear and people are trying to figure it out. The debate is specifically about how to apportion those costs and how to write regulations that are fair to consumers and support the utilities.\n\nI suspect distributed energy storage will create a similar debate. A lot of work needs to be done to figure out what the cost is for a utility to serve a customer with a Powerwall versus one without a Powerwall. If the systems are very smart and powerful, maybe it saves a lot. But if you still need the utility to be able to run the dryer, tv and charge your EV at the same time, maybe it doesn't save so much. \n\nThe trick for energy storage is that most states currently don't have policies that really incorporate it, so there is an uphill battle that still needs to happen to just get on the agenda. Ultimately, if distributed energy storage becomes economic, then I would expect policies that enable it to spread, but if storage never becomes economic, then many states may not ever implement policies that treat distributed storage fairly because it's not worth their time. \n\nSimilarly, if storage turns out to be more vastly more economic to deploy on the grid, instead of in the home, that could crowd out the economics of an in-home system. In such a case, it would be relatively easy for a utility to make it cost prohibitive to go off grid simply because... it was more expensive. \n\nAt the end of the day utilities are creatures of the states and cities that regulate them. And states and cities are run by politicians, so, yes, you have a way to \"fight back.\" Yes, utilities have a lot of clout in most statehouses, but there are a lot more consumers voting than utility executives, so politicians are going to listen to any broad desires about how their constituents want thing structured. \n\nPoliticians though are going to worry about keeping rates low for everyone, not just solar homeowners. If loads of people switch to solar and storage and that harms the utilities / forces them to boost kWh rates a lot, then they will react and change how they charge for the service.",

This way, the solar chargers at home is completely disconnected from the grid, relieving solar designers/vendors from battle with utility companies. It feels large amount of resources is wasted with trying to find a business models that try to fit solar charging panels into existing grid. \n\n-Why make street single charger with 10, 15, 20 or X No. of connections that can connect up to that number of cars simultaneously and selectively charges each connected ev-s at set intervals in a round-robin or some scheduler fashion so that to alleviate \"charge-rage\" incidents.. drivers fighting over ev parking spots and charge cords.",

"comment": "Thanks for sharing your use case. Interestingly, a good friend of mine uses a CPAP and has had the same troubles - I've offered to build him a solar solution for that and do free labour, but he hasn't shown much interest yet. \n\nIf you know the wattage of your CPAP, I can help you through getting more accurate numbers based on the actual usage you'd be putting on the batteries. This also tells me an important data point: You need to effectively recharge the system (or at least the previous night's usage) in one day. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOkay! So, PWM versus MPPT. Is it worth it for you? Well, the answer is, it depends. And, it depends. Also, it depends. Let's see if we can get into what it depends on. \n\nTo start with, let's see your current system from above: \n* 4x 35Ah batteries, 12v nominal. Total 140 amp hours capacity. Assuming 50% discharge, that's in the region of 840 watt hours.\n* 2x 100W solar panels, total 200W PV input. \n\nThis math was done above, but I'll do it the way I learned. We have 840 watt-hours divided by 200 watts input = 4.2 peak sunshine hours to recharge, assuming discharged by 50%. Using the ballpark for daylight above, we can call that \"one day\", but again, the number of hours of peak daylight you get will vary by location. I get what you were doing by reducing the solar output to 80% because you don't get much maximum brightness sunlight, but doing the calculations using \"peak sun hours\" and then finding out how many of those your area gets per day is more accurate, as I understand it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat else might impact this decision?\n\n**The Weather**\n\nA PV panel works more efficiently in cold weather. An [HES-20](http://hespv.ca/hes-20) I had was measured at about 23 volts on a sunny winter day at -25C. Its normal rating is about 18V. The higher voltage means that the MPPT controller has more advantage over PWM. \n\n**Existing Investment**\n\nYou might already have some of this equipment, and so \"tossing it\" and starting new may not be worth it to you. \n\n**Array Flexibility**\n\nAn MPPT controller will allow you more flexibility in voltages and panels. For example, you can string panels in series to boost the voltage, allowing you to use a longer wire run between the panels and controller with less power loss. (More on a specific advantage about this, later.)\n\n**Cost**\n\nSo the cost of an MPPT controller is typically rather more. That'll factor in. But your use case (about 200W of solar power into a 12V nominal battery bank) leads to an interesting situation. I'm going to use examples for panels and equipment available to me, in Canadian dollars, because that's what I know. You'd have to figure out the costs with your own local suppliers to see, but the below should be a fun example to illustrate my point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's start with your current system (no batteries), and price it out. \n\n* 2x 100W Solar Panels. [These](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/100w-monocrystalline-solar-panel/) are $180CDN each, for a total of $360. \n* One PWM solar controller. I like Morningstar, so I'm going to pick the [SunSaver SS-20L](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/morningstar-sunsaver-20-amp-controller-w-lvd/) for $123 CAD. You could also get the [SunKeeper SK-12](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/morningstar-sunkeeper-12-amp-12v/), more closely matching our PV input at 12 amps for $103 CAD, but I think the low voltage cutoff on the load terminals and room to add more panels is worth $20. \n\nTotal Cost: $483 CAD (plus shipping, etc.)\n\nCharge time: 6.5 peak sun hours. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCool! That went well. Let's price out an MPPT system. \n\n* [Same pair](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/100w-monocrystalline-solar-panel/) of 100W panels is still $360 CAD. \n* Again, I like Morningstar, and the SunSaver [SS-MPPT-15L](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/morningstar-sunsaver-mppt-15amp/) is rated for 200W of solar capacity when charging a 12V system. It should fit the bill nicely at $332 CAD. \n\nTotal Cost: $692 CAD\n\nCharge time: 4.2 peak sun hours. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo the extra $210 gets you about a 55% boost in your charge time, as measured in peak sun hours. Is that worth it for you? Depends on your use case. For the record, it's about 43% more expensive, so it's mathematically more bang for your buck for MPPT. \n\n*But, greggorievich! That's not an interesting situation! You **said** there would be an interesting situation!*\n\nRight-o! I'm about to get to that. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Interesting Situation**\n\nThere are two important points I want to illustrate - one about MPPT controllers in general, and one about Morningstar units specifically. \n\n* The appropriate MPPT controller can be used to charge 12V battery banks with a nigher nominal voltage panel, like a larger 24, 36, or 48 volt panel. \n* Morningstar openly allows and recommends using larger panels than the rated capacity of their MPPT controllers. Check here: http://www.morningstarcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MPPT-Technology-Primer.pdf (See Q2 and Q3) \n\nThis allows us to do a fun thing: use a large, higher voltage, residential scale panel to charge a small battery system. Why is this fun? Those bigger panels are made in huge bulk, and often bought dozens at a time by contractors for big house installs. Since this is where most of solar business is, the panels are *cheap*. for example, [this 265W panel](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/265-watt-polycrystalline-solar-panel/) is only $250 CAD. Not only is it $110 less expensive, it has 65 watts more output. \n\nI can't do a direct bunch of math on how well this panel will charge the batteries - because during peak sunshine, it will be limited to 200W, the same as the two 100W panels, but during lower light, it will produce more than the 200W panels would in the same conditions. So for charge time using this system, I can only call it \"Definitely less than the two 100W panels on MPPT, but it depends on the light conditions.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's price that out! \n\n* [One 265W Panel](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/265-watt-polycrystalline-solar-panel/) is $250 CAD. \n* The [SS-MPPT-15L](https://www.solarwholesaler.ca/product/morningstar-sunsaver-mppt-15amp/) is still $332. \n\nTotal Cost: $582 CAD ($99 more than the PWM set, a 20% increase)\n\nCharge time: Definitely less than 4.2 peak sun hours, but it depends on the specifics of the situation. \n\nSo this is a 20% price increase for more than 55% boost in performance. You could drive the cost lower with some clever shopping, too. Lots of solar installers buy these panels by the pallet load, and any extras end up going back to their shop or office. If you make a good relationship with an installer, you might be able to pick up one of their \"extras\" for cheaper than you'd be able to buy it new. \n\nInterestingly, by using this method, in the ~500W range or more, MPPT and high voltage, cheap panels actually becomes *less expensive* than a comparable PWM system, with more power output. I don't know of any panels more than about 160 watts that are 12V nominal. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**But what does it all mean?**\n\nThis third option is the way I'd go, assuming I had nothing to start with . It maximizes the performance out of the panel you buy, gives better performance in cloudy/crappier conditions, and delivers the most bang for buck. \n\nSince where I am we have really cold winters, this increases the MPPT advantage further (this may matter less for you, as camping is a summer activity). \n\nIn your case, you may want to deal with the extra costs of the lower wattage panels because you need portability in your setup. They're significantly more expensive, but you may want to look into thin flexible solar panels since they'd take up less trunk space. All of the controllers I linked should be suitably portable for your needs. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about solar controllers, you should check out Morningstar's website. They do [monthly webinars](https://www.morningstarcorp.com/live-webinars/) that go over their products, the oversizing scenario I mentioned earlier, and some of the basics of solar systems. I've watched a few and they've been really helpful to me. It looks like you can also dig through their library of [webinar recordings](https://www.morningstarcorp.com/recorded-webinars/) and pick ones of interest to watch. \n\n*I am not affiliated with Morningstar, nor Solar Wholesaler, or the solar industry at all.*\n\nEdit: Formatting, spelling, etc.\n\nEdit2: Apparently this is worth gold to you, thank you kind stranger! I do hope I help you get a better night's sleep in the outdoors. :)",

It sucks that 30 years ago we had the start of it all. Would could have been 30 years into capitalism on these type of cars if GM would not have caved and kept the EV1 program going. Now look. Gas prices are low and car companies all over the world are making pure electric and hybrid cars. I completely agree with the Maglev trains. They work very well in Japan and I think the younger generation who will grow up it will be more accepting of it.",

It will protect you from future rate hikes and in San Diego we average the largest rate hikes per year. \n\nWithout Powerwall you'll save about $1500 off that SunPower quote and get a slightly larger system with slightly better panel.\n\nSource: I am the marketing manager for a San Diego solar company.",

"comment": "&gt; We'll see how their grid handles increasing amounts of non-managed generation. Rooftop solar (\"Blat out all the power I possibly can right now!\") works fine in small (trivial) deployment percentages, but it's rather the pain for grid stability in larger quantities, because it's not controlled by anyone. \n\nUtility scale isn't \"controlled\" in any way like a spinning power plant either.\n\nSolar at all scales has its advantages. Utility scale is needed without question. But solar homes are a useful complement too. I can point to thousands of homes as an example that are on a specific section of a Southern Cal grid. Comparing seasonal and daily peaks over a 6 year period shows how distributed solar has been key in steadily requiring less peak energy from the utility. Each year. Which in the view of the utility means they automatically have new reserve capacity. That section happened to have a pretty high capacity - around 12%. I'm going to search for it but it isn't at my fingertips today.",

Sometimes I get them mixed up. The 2nd phase of the Citrus site included the addition of DC coupled battery storage. This is where the Alencon SPOTs (string level DC/DC converter system) was implemented.",

Not certain that is precise but gives a sense that Germany values solar PV technology *despite* having a relatively modest solar resource (lack of fuel). \n\nCA is a very huge state with a wide range of solar conditions.  The desert part of Southern CA might be 1,700 kwh per 1 kw of installed capacity or even more. Coastal and Northern locations would be less output depending on the solar insolation of the site.",

If you want a setup where it just uses your solar power first and then sips any other needed power from the grid I think you are going to need the net meter. In a case like this, you should be easily about to make back the $500 for the meter on the net metering. There are going to be plenty of times that you aren't home and can be selling your power back. (In Florida, it is only a credit on your bill.  FPL doesn't write you a check.)  \n\n\nDo you have the engineering drawings for the system that was in the permit application? I hate to suggest it, but you may need another installation company or an engineer or an electrical contractor to take your system through the permitting process and interconnect process for you. If the county finds any issue with your system, you are going to be hosed without them. Do you know if they filed the interconnect agreement with FPL at least?  \n\n\nCheck your finance company paperwork on whether they should have paid the installer or not. You may want to file a complaint with the state agency that regulates them because they are going to start asking for your first payment now and I don't think you are going to want to pay them.",

Enphase I think takes rough measurements every few minutes, because its going to the web probably and they dont want to DoS their own servers.  The generation meter is analogue I think, but it has an LED pulse which my other monitor counts back into Wh and power output, of course that can fail if the rising/falling LED pulse isnt counted correctly by the sensor.\n\nIn the end none of it is perfectly accurate, i view it all as \"guidelines\".  My solar array makes what it makes, if I can get a decent idea of when to turn appliances on/off, get my incentives, and tell if a panel is working properly, thats all I need and what each of those various systems does.",

I think as an intro claim it’s a good way to make news.  Solar panels will keep you running as long as you don’t need to go more than, what, 40 miles a day? That’s novel but not earth-shattering. Seems like a concept car put into limited production, but impractical. I like that there is funding behind chasing crazy ideas like this though.

"comment": "Any power generation including solar panels and wind turbines can only be considered sustainable once we set a hard cap on how much energy each person can uses in a year. Also heavy industry of aluminium and steel must be in countries of effective government and high regulations like Finland. \n\nYou might not feel it in Finland because you do not have to deal with the aftermath of aluminium extraction like the people of Brazil do. I am from Brazil and many people in the state of Minas Gerais had their homes wiped away from by products of aluminium production. Several dams holding red mud from aluminium production were breached and it wiped away whole towns, it ended up in rivers that killed off fishing in the area. Finland has much higher quality regulations than Brazil and Finland could produce all of its aluminium in the country if it wanted to and due to its high quality government no aluminium dam would be breached. The problem is that with globalization it is cheaper and easier to make Brazil, India, and China built aluminium for Finland. But that is not sustainable. Aluminium production for renewables have a tremendous cost to the environemnt and until the Northern European countries don't produce it themselves it will never be sustainable. More lives will be lost and the environment will continue to suffer in places like Brazil, India, China. \n\nNorthern European countries are delusional to think wind and solar panels can be sustainable by importing aluminium from third world countries with no environmental regulations. Many Nordics believe Bolsonaro is a terrible president for the environment, so why import aluminium from him? \n\nThere is a lot of aluminium smelting in Northern Europe. Nordic countries could just focus on smelting and recycling aluminium but they have to make sure to buy aluminium only from companies that are reusing it. A company like Tesla that is very popular in Northern Europe only uses primary aluminium, because it is higher quality. How many Finnish people hate Bolsonaro's environmental record but drive a Tesla made with aluminium from Brazil? The worst is they think they are being good to the environment by driving that Tesla.",

The first is that it will autostart the generator when it senses a grid down event (with the option to NOT start it during certain times like late at night). Second, The Sol-Ark supports some of the more cheaper generators with high fluctuations in frequency. This way the solar power + generator work together to power the house, and the inverter only takes what it needs from the generator.",

That's still pretty decent, but not as little as you might think. Also, nuclear power plants can't just be built anywhere, they need to be in geologically inactive area's, near large bodies of water for cooling, and have to be built away from people. \n\nBut when it comes to renewables, finding the space really isn't the issue. Just 1% of the earth land's mass covered in solar panels would be enough. In Europe, models have shown that a combination of on + offshore windpower alone could fulfill energy needs. Solar also doesn't need exclusive use of the land, as it can be installed on top of buildings and be combined with agriculture.",

"comment": "Absolutely. There are certain crops that this could work with (mostly vegetables) but it's never going to work with all of the cash crops that I had just listed. The spacing alone is enough of a challenge to make it not worth it.\n\n\nLet's look at wheat and alfalfa.\nFor example our [seed drill](https://imgur.com/gkYilTj.jpg) is 15 feet wide so naturally that's the spacing that should be between the panels. The problem is that our [combine header](https://imgur.com/E7PU3Ix.jpg) is 20 feet wide. So let's switch the spacing to 20 feet wide plus a bit on each end. Well now you have to have a variable rate seed drill and make two passes to grow anything between the solar panel rows. Now look at fertilizer spreading. Instead of making one pass that covers 60' wide now you have more compaction in the soil to make individual 20' wide paths. Same thing for spraying. Same thing for cultivating. Same thing for mowing. This also locks you into only growing particular crops because of the spacing. \nYou can't grow alfalfa anymore because you could never mow the crop down, spread it out, windrow it, and [then pick it up] (https://imgur.com/FeIZasI.jpg) while still having solar panels between the rows. All of that equipment would have to be specialized. So now you can't grow alfalfa anymore and you lose out on a rotation crop that is very important for nitrogen fixation.\n\nI'm pro solar, I'm trying to get a system on our roof. I'm also pro farming. They can both work, it's just that in large fields it's only one or the other.",

"comment": "So with a string inverter the solar panels get hooked together in a big string. That specific inverter has 3 MPPTs which means it can manage 3 different strings. Each string gets connected to the MPPT and the inverter optimizes the voltage on each string to get the best power. Then it inverts the combined power from all three MPPTs\n\nIn your case I would expect the installer to say it's going to be 2 strings of 8 for the rear, and 2 strings of 12 for the front with the rear two sharing an MPPT (or maybe 4 strings of 6 in the front)\n\nBasically, each MPPT must only be connected to one kind of panel, and all panels connected to it must be on the same roof. As long as your installer does that mixing panels is fine.",

"comment": "Shouldn’t these numbers reflect all the years since the installation of the solar panels? There is no way that a home solar panel system can net over 9000 kWh in just a few summer months.\n\nAlso while it is true that you produce the most electricity in the summer months (my panels produce a bit more than 20kwh on a sunny summer day), you likely also use more electricity in the summer as well : the fridge has to work harder, you have the fans on more often, and you also have the AC on more often. Whereas in the winter months, in Los Angeles at least, you likely use less power.",

They have sales off and on throughout the year, some just trivial markdowns, but occasionally actual good deals.\n\nTwo of these 30kw/h racks and a decent hybrid solar charger/inverter, and you're pretty much set.\n\nIf you aren't in immediate need of battery capacity, I personally would wait a couple of years because of the huge, I mean completely unprecedented level of industrial development for battery technologies that's occurring in the US and many other parts of the world right now.  While a lot of this is geared towards EVs, a significant amount of it is being purpose-built for fixed grid electrical storage.\n\nIn a year or two you should be able to buy comparable batteries, possibly for as low as half as much per kilowatt hour, as production ramps and demand is met.",

Figure out your solar potential between roof and ground mount. This will help determine how much power you can generate and which electrification measures could make sense. This can be done for free by having a solar consultation. Probably having a couple is a good idea. If you want to avoid the hassle you can easily request virtual consults so there’s \n\n2. Don’t put green on brown. Get a comprehensive energy audit to make sure all insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, lighting, controls, etc are making the home as energy efficient as possible. \n\n3.

I hope you can make them fix the installation and get your money back for the last two years.\n\nIn addition to lawyer, you can also file a complaint to [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/search?find_country=USA&find_text=sunrun%20solar&page=1&sort=Relevance). I'm not sure which state are you from, but it looks like Sunrun Solar has an A+ rating on the BBB profile.

"comment": "IMO, there will be some short lessening of installation costs, but some installers will go bankrupt and others will switch to other businesses.  Costs will go back up.\n\nCosts to install solar have actually gone down (not sure whether or not it's gone down or up lately) at one point.  Around 2013 or so, we looked at getting solar but were given a quote for $28k.  The numbers didn't make it worth it as our average bill was much less than the monthly bill to pay off the solar loan.  So we declined.  Fast forward a few years to 2017 or so, I buy a PHEV and our electricity bills start to go through the roof.  We look at solar again and this time the quote is for $23k for pretty much the same size installation. We snuck in just before NEM 2.0 took effect, so it was a crazy busy time for solar installers.",

"comment": ">They haven't provided any evidence that BEVs, solar panels, or wind farms will stop or slow climate change. They *hypothesize* that such technologies may slow climate change. That's a big consideration when deciding if you want to make agriculture exceedingly difficult by tossing out nitrogen fertilization and electricity unaffordable for the vast majority of those 8 billion people. You're gambling, and the odds are not in your favor considering climate change has so many variables besides carbon that there is really no way of proving that \"green\" technologies will do anything to stop it.\n\nYou'd have to be pretty foolish to think that if CO2 is causing the temperature to rise which is causing climate change that reducing CO2 from increasing would not stop the temperature from rising and counter the climate change that it is causing. \n\n>As an example, humans had a much smaller carbon footprint when the last ice age ended yet the climate still warmed, almost completely without humans putting their foot on the scale with fossil fuels. \n\nScientist know what causes glaciation and interglacial periods which is the Milankovitch cycles. And they know it took 15,000 years for the climate to warm. Since we have warmed 1.3C over the past 100 years it's not possible for it to be the same reason. So that example clearly doesn't explain the warming. And the other reasons for the earth warming have been eliminated through measurements.\n\n>It's still debatable whether the correlation of industrialization with climate change is valid and equivalent to a causative determination. There's no evidence that conclusively proves that.\n\nIt's not debatable by the scientific experts. The evidence is physics shows greenhouse gases retain heat. Laboratory experiments shows that greenhouse gases retain heat. And climate models correctly project the increase in temperature which proves the theory is correct. You don't get better proof than that in science. And the fossil fuel industry now admits that emissions are causing the rise in temperature.",

"comment": "One note - you do not necessarily need to hire a licensed electrician.   Most jurisdictions allow homeowners to do their own electrical work without licensing.   Proper permits and inspections are still needed.\n\n\nI do think 5 panels is not a bad start.   Yes it will not get a zero dollar electric bill.   And won't fulfill OPs dream of filling batteries or creating income.   But it will shave a good chunk off your bill.   In areas with no net metering, smaller systems have faster payback.    Another option with 5 panels could be a supplemental solar DC mini-split, which puts it more firmly in DIY territory with no major electrical work and no PTO paperwork.   It will still shave off the bill.\n\n\nBiggest issue I see is that this fence looks to be one of those vinyl fences, hardly structural for mounting panels",

Their main problem is that they don't excel in any particular metric and have no super-cool standout traits that could entice someone to take a chance on an unproven brand. \n\nRivian has off-road prowess and cute outdoor camping features.\n\nLucid has beautiful styling, 800V fast charging, and class-leading range/efficiency.\n\nEven Fisker tried to stand out with things like California Mode and solar roofs... obviously didn't help but they still tried.\n\nWhat does the VF8 offer, apart from the novelty of being Vietnamese? Anecdotally all the Vietnamese immigrants I personally know have zero interest in VinFast lol.",

Vegans are alienated enough as is, and you're putting an unfriendly face on the vegan community when you argue semantics.  \r\n  \r\nYes, you are technically correct (the best kind of correct!) when you say they're not vegan for still using animal products outside their diet on account of the \"lifestyle\" definition of \"vegan,\" but stop focusing on the negatives; they're cutting animal products out of their diet (reducing their carbon footprint down by *two fucking tons!*), adding one more warm body to the vegans at the dinner table, and that is a **huge** step in the right direction that more people need to take that heps all vegans everywhere in one way or another. Focus on that, and argue the rest if it comes up in conversation.",

No matter how nice they may be to you and other humans, they are still completely okay with the torture and killing of a subgroup of persons who cannot stand up and fight for their own rights.\n\nOf course, this does not mean that a relationship is impossible. Even murderers on death row have family and friends that come to visit. But you can't just be blind to the idea that the person you are with is fundamentally evil. You have to accept it and do everything that you can to get them to realize the truth.\n\nRemember that most meat-eaters are meat-eaters because they do not know any better. You can't blame them for being brainwashed into false belief. But meat-eaters who are actively dating/married to a vegan are made fully aware of the truth of the situation, and yet still do not care enough for the well being of others to do without the taste of meat. Ethically speaking, these are the worst meat-eaters that exist.",

While I agree that one can, sometimes, go with the \"Paris Exception\" for example I hardly think that Oreos are vital. \n\nTo tell people who are trying to live according to their ethics that bone char is not something you need to look out for because it does approximately nothing, in your opinion, to further the promotion of animal rights is an odd thing to say. Bone char is still a product of cruelty and exploitation. It's something that I would argue most vegans are dedicated to avoid as far as possible and practicable, and I don't consider Oreos to be that important. \n\nAnd while this topic might be discussed more \"in depth\" in places like a vegan subreddit I highly doubt \"omnivores\" have heard many vegans jump down their throats in order to tell them how horrible they are for not checking where they get their sugar from, neither do I think that makes vegans look unreasonable to \"omnivores\". That ship apparently sailed with honey \"because the bees aren't killed\". At least bone char requires an animal to die. It is a by-product of slaughter and as such it is every bit as reasonable to avoid as gelatine in my opinion. \n\nAnd that's just it, everyone are entitled to put out their opinion about items, but telling others that they are doing \"veganism\" a disservice for adhering to their chosen code of ethics in the way they do is a little more crass then telling people that a cookie is not vegan because the sugar is not, which is true. And not eating that particular cookie and perhaps going home and making your own, or buying a certified vegan one rather than compromising ones ethics for a packet of Oreos that one could, just as well, do without seems quite reasonable for those who chose to do so.",

"comment": "I think we have a lot of difficult challenges but I don't see any as insurmountable. Look at my original question -\"what things need to be done to ensure the propagation of the vegan diet and ultimately, lifestyle is possible on a massive scale\".  \n\nWhat I'm **not** saying is, 'the vegan diet can't be adopted on a global level', what I am saying is that changing the food economy of a country is not a simple thing. \n\nMany people in this thread have the opinion, 'change your diet and the economy will react'- yes, this is true, but half the issue. The economy is not something in a void- it's filled with real people, real workers, real machines, doing real things. My role in society, or in 'the vegan movement', is on the reacting side. As more people transition to vegan diets, you need people like me working on the infrastructure to support this change. The changes in infrastructure is what I came here to discuss but I'm getting the feeling this is not the right group to have this discussion with, and I'm fine with that. I might just stick with /r/sustainability or /r/farming - but those folks don't necessary share my thoughts on veganism.",

I must admit I do find it both depressing and frustrating to think about something that I consider quite bad but cannot really change. \n\n&gt; I try to take a similar approach to arguments, it's a far more healthy way to have a discussion. For what it's worth, you have given me some new perspective, and I have given consideration to things that I have ignored up until now. I don't think I'll be going vegan anytime soon, but I'll make an effort to cut back on animal products.\n\nI'm glad I may have given you something to think about!\n\nOne thing you could try is going vegetarian for some set amount of time, perhaps a month. I have a theory that people unconsciously try to protect themselves from ideas that would require sacrifice or changes in behavior, and that if you've already essentially made the sacrifice it will change your perspective to some degree. You might also find that it is easier than you anticipate and possibly discover new foods that you enjoy.\n\n&gt; I just realized now that I've been using 'You' to refer both to you individually and vegans/animal rights activists as a group. That was very rude of me, and also probably confused my message somewhat, I apologize.\n\n&gt; I didn't mean to belittle your personal efforts, which I find no issue with.\n\nNo offense taken. I don't consider myself an activist, to be honest, since in general my efforts have only resulted in a modification of my own behavior. That was the main point I was trying to convey there.\n\n&gt; I meant that I feel like the animal rights movement's approach is unfocused.\n\nI think that is because different people have different motivations. There isn't really a monolithic \"animal rights movement\". \n\nI'm not sure I personally would even consider animal rights a *thing*. Rights make sense to me when dealing with an individual that actually has a concept of its own agency and can comprehend when that agency is violated (so pretty much only humans, perhaps some apes). I find it more logical to deal with pragmatic effects on individuals for other species: Whether an individual is deprived of potential pleasure, or is made to experience negative mental or physical stimuli.\n\nPreviously you said: *Rally around your strongest argument and your most direct solution. Environmental impact (acreage, water usage, runoff etc.) and cutting subsidies granted to the meat industry.*\n\nSo I would assume this is what you would consider the most useful focus?\n\n&gt; I'd like to end this discussion at this point, as I should really be doing something about all this classwork that's been piling up. If you've any final comments to give, feel free, and I thank you for your time and insight. You are a gentleman and a scholar.\n\nThanks for your kind words! It's been nice talking to you. Don't feel compelled to respond, even though I asked some questions. If you do respond, it is no problem if you take your time. Classwork is more important, for sure.",

"comment": "Employers buy pizza for everyone every Friday. Once they realized that there were a few vegans working there now, they got a vegan pizza one week. I thought they would keep up this trend, so the next Friday I didn't bring a lunch. Well, I guess consistency shouldn't have been expected. Had to skip lunch that day. A couple of weeks later they got vegan pizza again. Seems like they will be a little more consistent after the vegans got pissed at the diss.",

"comment": "It's such a shame they abandoned the idea that future humans were all vegans.  I'll never forget season 1's Riker in Lonely Among Us telling the Enterprise's alien guests that humans no longer enslave animals, opting instead for replicated food, but they never mentioned such a thing again and time to time ate real meat just because. When it got to Voyager, Chakotay's veganism was a defining character trait all to himself, used specifically to set him apart from others, and that was even actually more religious than ethical.\n\nI feel very confident that we won't even finish the 21st century before first world countries no longer find eating real meat acceptable.  Substitutes and nutrition is only going to get better, and young kids born into a world with these foods already existing will find the older generation who knows nothing but eating meat as old fashioned, heartless idiots, much like how the young generation of today sees the older generation as idiots for opposing gay marriage.\n\nStar Trek backtracking on this by having many characters using \"the replicator is just not the same as the real thing\" excuse to eat real meat like there's no moral question about it at all is just going to make the show look that much more old fashioned when my kids or grandkids end up watching it.\n\nIt's not just Star Trek either, Sci Fi writers across the board need to realise this.  Taste and nutrition is the only things keeping real meat around, and once that's done tradition would be all that's left, and one generation is all that's needed to kill tradition, especially in this information age. A tasty, nutritious, cheap meat substitute seems much sooner than a lot of the crazy advanced sci-fi stuff writers come up with.",

This combines with peoples strong desire, conscious or not, for the underlying principal of veganism to be flat out wrong to give people the need to insult, mock, or villify vegans. For example, if we are all just privileged punks with spare time wanting people to pity us then surely nothing we say could be believable, carry on consuming the baconator. \n\nLuckily we can combat these misperceptions and disprove their stereotypes by simply being the people we truly are, that is just like everyone else. It doesn't make it less of a bummer when people we otherwise respect behave ignorantly but at least we can know we're each doing our part to change this attitude.",

Their physiology is 100% carnivorous, their bodies are not designed to live off plants like humans, they will get sick and can easily die without proper nutrients. I understand and seriously sympathize with you not wanted to harm other animals in the process of taking care of your own, But your cat doesn't share your ethics and dietary choices. It's a sacrifice you must make if you care about your cat being happy and healthy. \n\nThink about this. Cats collectively kill over 4 billion birds annually in the United States alone. That doesn't even account for rodents and insects. Most cats kill more than what they need to eat (they like to play with their kill). They are wired to be hunters, it's their nature and completely normal for them. So if it makes you feel better, if you have an indoor cat that you feed meat, you are helping protect hundreds or thousands of little animals from being hunted by your pet.",

"comment": "Seconding *Eating Animals* as it really is a great book as well as the health books /u/JordyVerrill mentioned but adding:\n\n*[Eat Like You Care](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Like-You-Care-Examination/dp/1492386510/ref=tmm_pap_title_0)* - by Gary Francione. This is a great and short book that lays out a very simple argument against consuming animals. You already know this of course but it's such a nice way of presenting the info I think it's great for plenty of vegans just to better describe why they're vegan.\n\n*[Slaughterhouse](http://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Shocking-Inhumane-Treatment-Industry/dp/1591024501)* by Gail Eisnitz which is a fascinating and frankly disturbing series of interviews with Slaughterhouse employees. We all appreciate the horror we do to animals in these places but often forget the immense damage both to body and mind that we do to the people who slaughter animals.\n\n*[World Peace Diet](http://www.amazon.com/World-Peace-Diet-Spiritual-Harmony/dp/1590560833)* by Will Tuttle. Just a great read with some interesting takes on the reasons for going vegan.\n\n*[Food Choice and Sustainability](http://www.amazon.com/Food-Choice-Sustainability-Buying-Eating/dp/1626524351)* by Richard Oppenlander. A great look at the immense envirnmental consequences of using animals for food.\n\nWell really I can go on and on but hopefully these will give you some interesting and fun reading choices! I really like the variety and quality of a lot of the books out there about veganism and I'm glad that more and more keep coming out :)",

Every vegan I have ever talked to about Peta, they always say they have real mixed feelings over them. The point of my comment was to illustrate how vegans do not emulate Peta like a god.",

(Replace butter with vegan butter. Try serving it with mashed potatoes (make with vegan milk and vegan butter)) and a crusty baguette.\n\nPasta is another good option, try pasta with potatoes, green beans, and pesto (2 cups basil, 3 tbsp nutritional yeast, 1 handful nuts, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 lemon juice, 4 cloves garlic, pinch of salt, in the food processor until it's kind of a paste) \n\nOr this one https://www.veganricha.com/2017/06/vegan-garlic-pasta-roasted-cajun-cauliflower.html \n\nA recipe I've been making lately: Halve a spaghetti squash, remove seeds, put in oven at 400 f for about 1h. Put a drained can of white kidney beans, 2 cups of halved cherry tomatoes (or a few diced tomatoes), a diced onion, a chopped red pepper or two, a couple tbsp of balsamic vinegar, a small handful of chili flakes, s&amp;p, and a drizzle of olive oil in a baking dish, bake in the oven with the squash for 1/2ish h. Scrape squash out of shell, scoop beans on top, done. \n\nMaybe something like chili or soup? \n\nFor desserts, if you're a pie person many premade pie shells are vegan and you can fill it with cherries or apples or pumpkin or what have you. \n\nThese brownies are always a huge hit http://servingrealness.com/easy-vegan-avocado-brownies/ (try with icing: 2c icing sugar, 2 tbsp vegan butter, 1/3c cocoa, a few tbsp vegan milk)\n\nHope this helps! It's awesome you're accommodating your vegan family and trying some of our food :D",

It's a fine diet and it's the one I'm gravitating towards but if you have yet to discover beans then eating vegan cheap and healthy is impossible.  But that eating cheap and vegan requires a bit of knowledge means those intending to go vegan lacking that knowledge will fail, not that they shouldn't obtain that knowledge.  I'd get it as to why they break and go back to eating animal products on occasion but in theory they ought be persuadable, given the know.",

Maybe adopt a Sulcata tortoise, or an iguana? Many of these reptiles are bought as babies when they’re small and cute but are given up in the hundreds by people who aren’t prepared to care for them in their adult lives.\n\nAlso, even aquatic turtles require a heat and up lamp over a portion of their enclosure in order to stimulate their metabolism when at rest or when sunning themselves.\nReptile in general can be economically demanding even at their easiest, so you may actually be better off adopting an animal that requires the least amount of food and resources (and if space is an issue, that too) - even goldfish need 30gallons of water for each fish, even if they don’t require heating.",

I don't think that they do live painless lives, or that any of the current methods are painless, but its a huge lifestyle change, particularly if I don't eat a large amount of the alternatives. I have vegan in laws and I have tried and disliked a number of the meals they have cooked, even though others enjoy them.\n\nAm I really expected to change my whole lifestyle in a second, to food that, from the outside, I seem to dislike? \n\n&gt;If you’re actively aware of the suffering and you continue to pay for it, you’re evil\n\nI can assume that you only shop at places that sell exclusively vegan foods? If you ever shop anywhere that sells any animal produce, you would be evil, if we follow your logic?\n\n&gt; tell me with a straight face that they live painless lives.\n\nI didnt say at any point that they live painless lives, just FYI since you seem to have put those words in my mouth.",

The only reason that us vegans weren’t always vegan is because the adults in our lives have always lied to us and made us believe that eating animals is normal and drinking cows milk doesn’t hurt them and they need to be milked so you might as well drink it so it doesn’t go to waste. If I had ever gotten the truth I would have gone vegan much much sooner. In this day and age with all of the information at our fingertips, there’s no excuse that you don’t know about the abuse that goes on. Why would so many people be risking their freedom to get footage inside factory farms? Why would there be so many documentaries on how horrific it is? To say that they just don’t know or you just haven’t made the connection is a cop out. Your therapist will never understand what you’re going through because she doesn’t care about animals and their suffering.",

I'm not comparing the actions or the movements, only the   \nreaction they gain when they do spectacles to gain international media   \nexposure.\n\nI don't think that the kind of actions you listed were received with the same reactions than the milk spilling, actually I am sure that wasn't the case.\n\n&gt;What sounds more likely to you, that every progressive movement over the  \n last century was wrong in doing these things, or that you might be   \nwrong and not understanding activist PR as well as those who do it for a  \n living?\n\nNo, I don't think that every successful progressive movement in history used this kind of tactics. As I said, you are lumping together very different kinds of action which have nothing to do with each other. I don't know about people who do PR for a living, and I may well be wrong; but if that's the case, I just want someone to explain to me why I am wrong in a convincing manner.\n\n&gt;Possible, so then you'd have to actually prove it. \"maybe\"s are   \npointless as anything can be a maybe. Maybe it was a donkey on the moon   \nwho has magic that caused all the movements to succeed. Maybe...\n\nSure, I'm not saying I have the knowledge to discern right from wrong with absolute certainty. But the simple fact that this maybe exists, in my opinion is a good reason to question things that don't sound convincing to me. Discussion and reasoning will never do harm.\n\n&gt;You say that, but we're still here talking about it. Numerous international news stations picked it up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That's hundreds of millions of people who thought about Veganism today who otherwise wouldn't have.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Maybe it's not helping, but it sounds like it probably is.\n\nI'm not discussing the kind of media exposure that this actions grant. I am just saying that maybe no exposure is better than bad exposure.\n\nI always come back to the same example, but flat-earth society didn't really gain any momentum through the massive exposure it got, they just became a mockery. That's obviously an extreme example, but I think it makes the point that it's not enough to just get the media lights on you.",

I prefer the second, but I think the first matters too:\n\n1) agree that we value lives lost by larger farmed animals more than we value the lives of insects. I certainly do, even though I try to avoid directly killing insects without cause.\n\n2) consider the lives we create as well. It's true, pesticide on crops kills a huge number of creatures, and 100% grazed cattle kills relatively far fewer. But grazed cattle locks out enormous swathes of land that *could* be creating untouched life...and isn't.\n\nBonus round:\n3) There are better and worse farming practices out there wrt pesticides. If we in principle recognise that eating crops should result in fewer animal deaths, then we can work towards reducing deaths from pesticides too.",

In another post I write more about what I refer to:\n\n&gt; My vibe is that people who vent over people who are not 100% vegan but kinda adjust their lifestyle and work at their own speed choose an easier way. Afterwards, when you devalue somebody the pay-off is that one feels better. And if you devalue a person who is already trying to instill change you are making it easier for yourself, because it is easier to be aggressive toward more fragile people with values crises than towards people who are avid meat eaters.\n\n&gt; Intuitively, it's just the easiest to hurt people who already want to be better because - on average - imperfect more plant-based people are easier targets. And I don't like when people try to feast emotionally on an easy prey.",

Buying online costs too far too much, and the nearest city is like 5 hours away. \n\nSo you don't eat any type of plants? Only animal products? Vegans don't need \"alternatives\", just whole plant foods like the ones you already eat everyday. The only vitamin you need would be b12. And that is one of the cheapest vitamins out there. edit: low salt vegemite contains b12 as well.\n\n&gt; animals are not sentient, at least the ones we eat\n\n**Sentient**: able to perceive or feel things.\n\nSo yes, yes they are.\n\n&gt; The animals that are killed I know for a fact have a good life before they are put down, which is instant btw. \n\nThere are situations were humane killing applies: euthanasia. It is humane as in benevolent or compassionate (synonyms of humane) because not only is the physical mechanism used humane (painless and stress free) but the act itself is motivated by compassion. The point is the help the animal (or the person) avoid unnecessary suffering.\n\nWhen killing farm animals even if the physical mechanism used is painless, the act itself, that of taking a life, is not humane. It was not motivated by compassion or benevolence towards the animal. The animal doesn't benefit from his life being terminated. The only one benefiting is the one paying for it, and the ones getting paid for it.",
