"comment": "Whoa your comment just totally changed...\n\n&gt;By the way, a RAV 4 EV weighs only 740 lbs (20%) more...\n\nWeight is only one piece of the puzzle. The Rav has a much less aerodynamic SUV body, which is more significant than weight for highway driving.\n\nAlso, the two cars use completely different motors and battery systems, with the Tesla-based Rav using an AC induction motor and 1000s of commodity cells with active temperature management, while the Leaf uses an AC synchronous motor with a purpose-built battery and no temperature management.\n\n&gt;gas version of the LEAF (the Versa) \n\nThe Versa is not at all related to the Leaf, except that they're both hatchbacks, and both made by Nissan. Unlike some other EVs out there (like the Rav), the Leaf is not a \"conversion\" - it was built from the ground up. I'm sure that they share a few parts, but so would any two cars made by Nissan/Infiniti. It's beyond me why people keep repeating this.\n\n&gt;I'd be interested in knowing more details about the E.P.A.'s...\n\nYou keep saying this, so why don't you do the research yourself? Contact the EPA, and make a FOIA request if they stonewall you. I'd be interested to know myself, but I don't really care what the EPA numbers say, except that they give a sort-of-consistent way to compare one EV to another.",

"comment": "The study I linked is more recent than yours, and furthermore looks at where the actual price increase comes from. Your Earth-Policy article argues that raw prices for corn went up, and go straight from there to \"food prices went up\". That's true to some degree, but it ignores—as is pointed out in that study I linked you to—that most of the cost of food is not in the raw ingredients but in manufacturing and transport. And those are heavily influenced by fossil fuel prices.\n\n&gt; What we've seen repeatedly is a Green initiative...\n\nWhere are those mysterious greens that you're talking about? The import tariffs and tax credits for ethanol production in the US reach back to the 70s, clearly predating any climate or other environmental initiatives. Your very own article which rails against corn-based ethanol as written by a environmental advocate, obvious evidence that Greens are *against* food for ethanol, just as I said earlier.\n\n&gt; And US Ethanol policy continues to get worse to this day.\n\nNo it doesn't. You may have missed it, but by now there is bipartisan support for ending corn ethanol subsidies. The tariffs and tax credits were in fact allowed to expire by Congress in 2011.\n\n&gt; None of these industries - not wind, solar, or ethanol - would ever exist without Government mandates or subsidies\n\nVirtually all new technologies not directly aimed at consumers require subsidies at first. Otherwise they would never be able to compete with technology that has been established and paid off for decades. \n\nBut if you want to rail against subsidies, I suggest you start with the massive amounts of subsidies that go into fossil fuels. They absolutely dwarf any public investment into renewable energy.",

"comment": "Hey look, another misguided comparison using coal.\n\n&gt;So it made me wonder if the “zero tailpipe emissions” or even the claimed MPGe (Miles per Gallon Equivalence) is really valid.\n\nThe Leaf generates no *tailpipe* emissions. How is that hard to understand?\n\nYes, if a leaf was 100% coal fired, it would be about as efficient as a 25MPG car including losses. In California however, our grid puts out about [.22kg/kwh, not 1kg/kwh](http://www.carbonlighthouse.com/2011/08/the-coal-powered-electric-car-part-ii/), so a Leaf would put out roughly as much CO2 as a 100mpg car. Interestingly enough, the mpge is right around 100mpg -- so I would say that the stickers are pretty damn accurate.\n\nNever mind electric cars are more reliable, can use any energy source and can preform a lot better than ICEs. The cost advantages myth is flat-out wrong. The Corolla will be pretty worthless when the slushbox transmission goes out in 4-5 years.\n\nThe leaf isn't $30k, it's $19k including CA subsidies. So let's see, ~4x cheaper to operate than a Corolla, better build quality and much better power delivery for a difference of $3,000. I know this because I've driven both.\n\nSounds like a completely unfair comparison.",

That's certainly one way to meet the 2015 and 2025 CAFE rules, but it's no the only way.   Shit, you could just buy a half-billion dollars of credits from Tesla and keep selling RAMs and minvans.\n\nMazda faces the same rules as Chrysler/Fiat does.   And yet they don't build any hybrid or battery or hydrogen vehicles, and they don't plan to do so.   What they do instead is invest heavily in the best efficiency engineering, slap a blue logo and a trademark name on it, and keep on smiling.",

"comment": "&gt;Driving around in little electric cars is not going to drastically reduce carbon emissions. \n\nElectric vehicles do use less energy compared to internal combustion even if the source is fossil fuels. Realistically, it is currently a mixture. These saving might be relatively marginal, but what's important is the bigger picture that EV's are an essential *prerequisite* to drastically reduce carbon emissions. With internal combustion engines, the best we can do is marginal efficiency improvements of a couple percent. \n\nWith EV's going all the way to 100% renewable will one day be possible. Tesla is important for this bigger picture not because of the luxury cars they have on the roads right now, but because the affordable cars they will make within a few years and because they have catalyzed development across the whole industry. They have forced the hand of an industry that has been reluctant move away from its massive investment in previous technology. In the last year pretty much every manufacturer has announced plans for new EV's, because they have no choice if they want to stay relevant.\n\n&gt; This idea that the exploitation of non-human animals is somehow completely categorically different from the exploitation of human animals baffles me.\n\nWell, in at least one way it is. We can communicate and form agreements with humans. This doesn't mean that human exploitation isn't real, or that it is defensible, but it does make it harder to identify. If I see leather, I know for sure the cow didn't agree to be killed for it.\n\nAnyway, the argument that workers rights in Europe were exploitative were used to dismiss the abolitionist movement against slavery using very similar rhetoric to yours. Of course it was true, factory workers were getting seriously screwed over in horrific ways, but was not a good reason for disparaging the efforts of abolitionists.",

"comment": "Experience in one application doesn't necessarily directly transfer to another application.\n\nAs an example, we all know laptops and cellphone batteries tend to degrade pretty quickly, to the point of uselessness or outright failure within 2-3 years.\n\nThe Tesla Roadster is a good counterpoint, on account of a) production vehicles have been in operation for 5-6 years now and b) Plugin America has conducted significant survey information.\n\nhttp://www.pluginamerica.org/surveys/batteries/tesla-roadster/vehicles.php\n\nThere are 19 Roadsters with age at time of survey exceeding 5 years. Of these, 1 has reported a motor swap and 7 have reported battery swap (1 or more of the 11 sheets replaced). The battery swap is an alarmingly high statistic; but bear in mind that Tesla has historically been very aggressive about swapping large assemblies out on any type of failure, and then diagnosing the failure and presumably refurbishing the assembly afterwards. \n\nI would be very curious to see data on how many of those swaps were due to minor component failures (ie sheet refurbished and returned to service) and how many were due to major component failures that rendered a sheet or entire pack unusable.\n\nOf these 19 roadsters with 5 years of wear and tear, the average battery degradation is 8% and the highest degradation is 21% (vehicle with 74k miles).",

"comment": "In the past, the cost of the modules made up the lions share of the price in solar, that's why it's been the main thing that people focus on in term of solar being more affordable. Now that panels are expected to hit $0.45-0.50/watt in the coming years, cost reductions in other portions of solar installations are the bigger deal. \n\nNow that solar, especially in the residential market, is a more mature market, things that typically cost a lot of money for installers (sales, marketing, general customer acquisition, permitting) - the 'soft costs' are starting to fall. \n\nAnd once the investement tax credit expires at the end of 2016, all that's going to happen is that those soft-costs are going to drop even further. Distributors and Installers are going to be able to use their experience to find places to cut their margins throughout the whole process and remain competitive. \n\nIf we can get things like utility and local permitting standardized, companies using effective sales and marketing, along with falling component prices, and labor savings due to simpler racking and wiring innovtions, I wouldn't be surprised to see solar under $2.00/watt post 2016.",

The garage itself had tested it quite extensively (I saw it there) and despite it high costs they had barely enough range to do a simple round trip on the freeway of a total of 100 km's and the cost was way to high to justify buying it. Traditional car makers have been announcing all kinds of models and projects but not one of those have delivered a truly workable car with the exception of some japanese carmakers and perhaps the I3.\n\nAll these competitors have surely announced all kinds of vehicles but none of them have seen any large scale production or even independent testing to confirm their capabilities. They are all set in the medium to short term while the Tesla cars are for sale, driving and working *now*. If you think that Tesla won't enlarge the gap that already exists in terms of capabilities, cost and availability in three years you have a very high opinion of the sudden willingness of all these car companies to really start developing decent EV's. The lage amount of batteries alone will present a huge problem for any car maker truly serious about doing this.",

"comment": "I am curious, what was your average electricity usage in a month before putting in panels? I'm trying to size a potential future install.\n\nAssuming ~5 sun hours/day your 8845 watts of installed panels would be like 1,128 kW/month at 85% efficiency right? I realize there are other efficiency losses (inverter etc.) but I am just looking to sanity check some ballpark numbers.\n\nIf I install a system I may want to overebuild it slightly with the expectation that my electric usage could go up later on with a PHEV or electric vehicle in the mix. \n\nI think a Nissan leaf is about 0.3 kWh per mile for reference so it should be easy to estimate the added monthly demand based on average miles driven.",

I would personally want the specifically engineered Tesla \"skateboard\" over the regurgitated Chevy one given the safety factors I already mentioned. It isn't being disingenuous to say the Tesla is leagues away from any competition. If I am buying a car with MY MONEY I personally can't see an argument for a Chevy over a Tesla. Wanting something of quality has nothing to do with poor people or social status, in fact I think our lack of focus on quality is contributing seriously to the current unfolding environmental disaster of global warming.\n\nBuying poor quality mass produced Volt's or even Tesla's will not really solve our dirty air issues and will contribute to them instead. Buying electric vehicles or even converting to full renewable sources for energy production will not solve global warming. You seem to be mad at me that I don't want Chevy's low budget crap, and upset I don't buy into the \"we can solve global warming and air pollution by mass producing cheap electric vehicles\". \n\nI don't know what to tell you. Tesla made a better product, and global warming isn't fixed with electric cars.",

The only ones that really exist are related to if you need a motorcycle license to drive or or if it requires a helmet and those mostly vary by state.\n\nIn states where it would require a motorcycle license to drive one you could use it for the test so it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI think some of the 3 wheel autocycle companies are fighting helmet laws for them but personally I'm perfectly OK with them being treated the same as motorcycles in that regard because they are obviously not as safe in an accident as a regular automobile with a more enclosed cabin and larger crumple zones.\n\nThe good thing is it's probably safer and more visible than a motorcycle and it would have a lot of stopping power and a really low center of gravity but a helmet is probably still not a bad idea.",

It's also somewhat depressing that Honda still won't export their hybrid Fit, which is even more efficient than the Prius.  They also refuse to give the US fit the pre-collision system that's on the Japanese version for some reason.  It would be a fantastic car, but they're probably right that there's no market here considering even the Prius is bleeding money right now.  \n\nThe Bolt and the 3 are extremely exciting.  They have the range, make economic sense, and of course are zero emission.  On the coasts where infrastructure is good they should finally bring electric cars to the mainstream.  \n\nIt's truly disgusting some of those high emission cars.  If everybody drove a Civic or similar car it would bring emissions down to near hybrid levels at an affordable price-point.  Hell, the Versa is the cheapest car in America and the Spark isn't close behind.  There's not much excuse.",

"comment": "I can't fully answer your question but Porsche is working on getting the Mission E up to 800v (vs the 400v Tesla is at) but that may well be \"up to\". But volts is not a direct measure of throughput. \n\nTesla superchargers  were 100 Kw, they upgraded them to hit up to 120 Kw, and [this article](http://insideevs.com/tesla-cranks-superchargers-up-past-120-kw/) says they plan to get them up to 150 Kw and this is all with their 400v system.\n\nAt a rate of 150 Kw you could (in theory) fully charge a 70D in under half an hour. In reality you slow charging as you near full but a 100D would have a range of ~320 miles. Charged for 15 minutes on a 150 Kw supercharger would give it another ~110 miles of range for 430 miles of range for 15 minutes charged.\n\nThis is not the absolute possible maximum distantly into the future either it's basically the current roadmap. \n\nI don't think Lithium Ion will ever be as fast as gasoline but they aren't fueled the same way either because the only time you have to stop for a charge at all is when you exceed the 200-300 mile range limit which is continually growing and for most people that is just a handful of times per year.\n\nI guess the point is supercharging vs gas station fill time is not an apples to apples comparison. I got in my ICE this morning and it was almost on E so I have to stop at a gas station for 5 minutes where an electric car would have been 0 minutes. That means my yearly average time spent stopped at a fuel/charge station would already be lower with an electric than with my ICE.\n\nAnother interesting point to consider is after we begin to hit diminishing returns on faster charging solutions for Lithium Ion the next steps may be to have both a Lithium Ion battery and a supercapacitor that charges much much faster but has very limited range.\n\nThe way supercapacitors would be used is not to wholesale replace the main battery but to charge in seconds for 3-5 miles of range. 3-5 miles doesn't seem significant but if you grab another charge each time you stop at a store or a red light you could greatly extend the total range of the large main battery and maybe avoid needing a regular supercharger on the trip altogether.\n\n\nIn theory if every 10 miles you stop long enough to charge the capacitor 5 miles you would get about 600 miles out of a 100D. Even well before that point you are hitting human limits of needing food, sleep, bathroom etc.",

I'm not saying it's a bad car even, but it isn't something that appeals to normal BMW owners.\n\n&gt;Yeah the i3 is not the prettiest looking car they make but the BMW Active Tourer anyone? The i3 looks sexy af in comparison.\n\nI'll give you that.  Second ugliest.  But I still think that's a poor defense of it's look.\n\n&gt;Compare the i3 to most of the cars that BMW make in the same price bracket the performance is pretty compatible. Admittedly the top speed isn't that high but I'm not often going more than 100mph. Yeah it's no M6 but no one expects that for £27k.\n\nNot even.  For $2 grand less, I can get a 330xi.  0-100 in 5.8 instead of like 7.4 with a way higher top speed.  It's performance might be comparable to a diesel, but diesels are known to be slow.\n\n&gt;i is a sub brand with an emphasis on environmentally sustainable manufacturing and end of life.\n\nI could agree, but I think BMW owners were so frustrated because we wanted an electric BMW option and this basically stripped everything BMW owners value out of a car.  Sexy exterior, good performance, luxurious interior, good range.  You can find BMWs that don't check all of those boxes, but the i3 can't even check one.",

"comment": "1. Electric motor power density is roughly proportional to rotational speed. So a 1,000 RPM motor could weigh 10x as much as a 10,000 RPM motor for the same power output. Most manufacturers pick a happy spot in the 6,000-12,000 RPM range where the motor is light but efficiency is still high. The overall weight of the higher speed motor and gearbox combination is still quite a bit less than the weight of a motor of the same power running at direct drive speed. I'm not an expert on gearboxes, but I believe automotive size gearing in the ~10:1 ratio range can be up to 98% efficient, so there's not a huge power or range loss either.\n\n2. A lot of it comes down to the design of the individual motor. In general, a permanent magnet motor will be more efficient and more powerful for a given size/weight. However, rare earth magnets are expensive and prone to supply chain issues. If I was making a high end performance car I'd be more likely to use permanent magnet motors, while if I was making a car that expected to see high volume production with narrow margins I'd be more likely to use induction motors.\n\n3. All motors are AC in a fundamental sense, as what makes them spin is the rotor chasing an alternating magnetic field induced by an alternating electrical current. The older \"DC brushed\" motors use mechanical brushes to create an alternating current [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_DC_electric_motor#Simple_two-pole_DC_motor). This is bad for reliability since these brushes have a relatively high failure rate (can't be used for electric vehicles). Newer \"DC brushless\" motors are just permanent magnet motors that have an inverter sitting between them and the DC source making a three phase AC waveform.\n\n4. Look up \"three phase inverter\". A set of six power switches connect and disconnect the battery at a very fast rate (roughly ten thousand times per second) with extremely fine timing. This can be used to create an arbitrary voltage/current.\n\n5. Not necessarily. Electric motor efficiency tends to increase with overall size, decrease with speed, and increase with percentage load. So the most efficient electric motor would be a slow, high power machine that was loaded down close to 100%. An example of this might be a 500 kilowatt industrial pump or fan motor spinning at 1200 RPM - these motors would be 95-98% efficient ([example part](http://ecatalog.weg.net/redirect/index.asp?p_Categoria=197&amp;p_Produto=393&amp;p_Table=YES)). The least efficient electric motor would be a high speed, low power machine, running at low load. An example of this might be a milling machine or lathe drive motor [like this](http://www.ibagnorthamerica.com/ibag-spindles-medium-spindles).",

ICE vehicles are a collection of parts that will definitely need to be changed   The service they need is a large part of the cost of them.

If he had an electric car, he was thinking it was like that - go to hardware store, electric charging station, grocery store, then go home. \n\n'Charging every night at home' just didn't seem like it applied to a car.",

"comment": "&gt; I'm not really impressed by a promise of 330k cars per year in 2021. 330k is 3% of their total production numbers for 2017\n\nAlready Tesla is facing shortages of battery cells for BEV use, even though Panasonic is working exclusively for them. No matter how much BEVs german industry builds if they cannot fill their battery trays with cells, then those would just be \"Flintstones style\" cars.\n\nIt is a big IF whether enough Li-ion battery cells and/or pouches can be made for just 50% of the world's automobile fleet to be replaced with BEVs by 2035. Cobalt, manganese, lithium shortages are one thing but on the other hand there would be a need for 500-800 cells per capita for the 7-8 billion people worldwide, as a typical BEV contains 5-8000 individual battery cells (AA shaped but slightly larger, like 18165 or 2170). That's an insanely large figure, likely would require higher production rate than similarly shaped and sized rifle ammo during WW1 and WW2, times when the whole world was shooting like crazy for 4 and 5 years straight, respectively.\n\nThus some alternative is also needed, e.g. BEV-hyrid, FCEV, catenary electric (Siemens-Scania e-Highway) or flywheel in vacuum energy storage (Volvo) or adiabiatic compressed air storage with carbon fibre tanks.",

Couple of friends got the model 3 and raved about it.  Test drove one and was sold.  It is a different level.  It’s the smartest, fastest and most fun to drive of anything I’ve been in.  When going full electric, keep in mind the supercharger network is a huge differentiator.  No other mfg has anything close.   That being said, it is a bit more that a Bolt, but it is about the same as a Niro depending on options.  Good luck and glad to hear you’re looking at electric.",

Most of the savings is on fuel / oil though. Tesla takes more tire replacements.\n\nTesla wins with time in shop since it's vastly more simple if there are problems, only had one maintenance item and it took them 1 hour to fix it because they remotely diagnosed the problem with vehicle logs and pre-ordered the part. BMW being that there are thousands of moving parts in the motor, and even a minor problem can be a week or more.",

For Tesla, growth in sales is more important that growth in profits because they're trying to kill the internal combustion engine. Since they have access to these regulatory credits, they have the opportunity to spend more money on expanding production capacity. They've already milked the market of early adopters, nobody's paying a premium to be the first kid on the block with a Tesla now. Chances are when you go out for a drive you'll be parking your brand new first Tesla next to someone else's second Tesla at the supercharger. It's not an exclusive product anymore, it can't command exclusive prices.\n\nIt's also important to remember that cars are not Tesla's only product. Grid storage and solar are only small at the moment but their valuation isn't based on current performance but on where Tesla will be in the future: basically controlling entire national energy grids with their Auto Bidder software and VPP.",

Strange, huh?\n\n1 Minute into the video, sourced from a CNBC Aricle that GM is copying some of Tesla's business model.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/gm-energy-launches-to-connect-homes-businesses-with-ev-chargers-energy-storage.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/gm-energy-launches-to-connect-homes-businesses-with-ev-chargers-energy-storage.html)\n\n* Forming an engergy buisness, \"GM Energy\", **battery packs**, **solar panels**, ***Hydrogen fuel cells***, and **software to help optimize home charging and ride out electric grid disruptions.**\n\nThere's some commentary that this is a sign that, while this makes sense on the surface, it's a sign they may be trying to anything and everything to 'Be' like Tesla (capture similar revenue) but they haven't thought thought through the challenges and potential pitfalls.\n\n3 min in..\n\n* Also, that they haven't throught through being able to supply the volume of batteries needed for an Energy businees AND a EV business, considering they also are coming out with dozens of EV models. i.e., They will run into the same constraint that caused Tesla to throttle down battery supply to their Energy business in favor of the EV business: Battery supply Constraint.  While GM has increased the pipeline of batteries with their Single and Sole supplier, LG, it's not enough to **scale** both 30+ planned EV models and an Energy businsess. And all of this on the battery that experienced fires in both EV and Home storage batteries\n\nSource: [https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-Recalls-Home-Energy-Storage-Batteries-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-0](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-Recalls-Home-Energy-Storage-Batteries-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Including Hydrogen Fuel cells is also a sign they are having trouble focusing (not copying the focus of Tesla in this regard) and are saying 'Yes' to everything which is not how successful teams focus.\n\n6 min in...\n\n* Reference to a video where GM CEO Mary Barra claims the EV Equinox will be sub-$30K, but when pressed by the interviewer who stated other's have claimed affordbility before and didn't deliver so how could she confirm / promise this sub-$30K Equinox, Barra backed away not confirming her previous statement. What she did say, at that point, is that GM will offer 'All trim levels' and that they will have \"an entry level vehicle\".\n\nThis 'click baitey'(?) video states it may be a marketing tactic and that GM hasn't taken into account very likely increases in raw materials and other costs along the pipeline.\n\nSource : [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/08/gm-ceo-mary-barra-discusses-new-electric-chevy-equinox-and-ev-production-plans.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/08/gm-ceo-mary-barra-discusses-new-electric-chevy-equinox-and-ev-production-plans.html)\n\nThere's more but... you know.",

"comment": "Doesn't matter if 100% believe the earth has warmed. Objectively this is virtually true over the last 150 years and the last 10k years. That said, a warming earth is no guarantee of cataclysm, as the alarmists would lead you to believe. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nThe dire predictions are modeled on a computer... and until reality begins to trend along a majority of the models... NOBODY should take them seriously. Plus, the Papers based off the models hype up the damage and almost completely exclude the benefits, [As evidenced by Richard Tol of the AR5 working group.](http://richardtol.blogspot.nl/2014/04/ipcc-again.html)\n\n&gt;The SPM (IPCC Summery for Policy Makers) omits that better cultivars and improved irrigation increase crop yields. It shows the impact of sea level rise on the most vulnerable country, but does not mention the average. It emphasize the impacts of increased heat stress but downplays reduced cold stress. It warns about poverty traps, violent conflict and mass migration without much support in the literature. The media, of course, exaggerated further.\n\nClimate may be changing rapidly on geological time frames, a magnitude or 2... but in the context of the technological speed we are moving at, we are adapting our surrounding to suit us at a pace that is 1000s or millions of times the average speed of adaption during all of human existence. In 50 years it might be a factor of a billion of the human history average.\n\nThe economic benefits(or damage) are only one aspect of a far larger issue of cost benefit analysis. **Is spending a trillion dollars a year on solar panels for first world nations more beneficial to humanity then, say, spending a trillion dollars lifting Africa out of incredible poverty induced starvation?** Or put differently, even if climate change is fairly bad, is spending the money in other places a better gamble on the cost benefit range of possibilities? I would argue its easier to adapt on the fly for now until technology is invented, should it become a problem and focus instead on lifting the 3rd world out of insane poverty with whatever means we have.(coal, or natgas, whatever)\n\nBasically, if the climate alarmism proves to be false(which I think it will be)... its going to be branded one of the worst policy decision in human history for the shear effort wasted on it rather then putting the collective of humanity to a better use.",

"comment": "Okay, heating and cooling are usually things that solar is terrible at doing, but with your needs you can certainly pull this off. \n\nAssuming your heating coil is a 120v unit it's pulling a little over .2 Amps. It would draw a little over 2 Amps if being run off 12 volt, which is what I'm going to build off of. An off-the-shelf good 12v marine battery (better than plain auto batteries because they are built to cycle deeper) that has a 100Ah rating , which since you do not want to run lower than 50%, has 50Ah on call in a fully charged state, will run this for about 25 hours. This is good news and will give you a little slack in that your solar PV cell has two days to charge the battery, plus your draw is low enough, and of the type, that you have no need to invest in more expensive pure sine wave inverters or an MPPT charge controller. \n\nSo:\n\n1 x 100Ah 12v marine cell, make sure it is outside or vented; $100 Wal-Mart has good ones sorry to say.\n\n1 x 100W solar cell; part 1 of * $165\n\n1 x Inexpensive (non-MPPT) charge controller; part 2 of *\n\n1 x El Cheapo low watt modified sine wave 12v – 120v inverter**, $25\n\n*http://www.amazon.com/Solar-Panel-Bundle-100W-Monocrystalline/dp/B00B8L6EFA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406339899&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=renogy+100w\n\n**http://www.amazon.com/outlets-inverter-adapter-notebook-MRI3011BU/dp/B004MDXS0U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406340128&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12v+120v+inverter",

"comment": "This is just mudslinging. There were other issues 30 years ago, such as the Cold War. \n\nWhat were we going to magically do that these people stopped? Build cold fusion plants and reduce carbon emissions to zero? Please. The world has to run on something, and there is a ton of active research on alternatives no matter what happens politically.\n\nDecoupling carbon emissions from GDP has been proven impossible in all countries thus far, not just the United States. Therefore, we can be poor and return to prior forms of communication and enlightenment, or we can keep burning and run what Elon Musk calls the \"stupidest science experiment of all time\" (exactly my thoughts on the matter too).\n\nThe bottom line is that we are going to overcome this through technological advancements, not political policy. We also already have a lot of policy supporting sustainable energy, such as the solar tax credits. I fail to see how \"denialism\" is signifcantly affecting either. (And need I remind you that 71% of Americans are Christian? They're denying a lot of things already, and climate change happens to clash pretty harshly with their religion. Perhaps we should be pointing the finger there too.)",

"comment": "Hey, I work with sunrun (via LGCYPower).\n\nLike Shortbizzle said, in whatever decision you make, keep the fact that panels degrade over time in mind. If they are over producing now, they might not be in a few years. Likewise, if it's breaking even now, it will underproduce in the future.\n\nAssuming you're doing a PPA and they work similar to my company, (will use my local numbers) if your used to buying your power for $.42/kwh and they are selling for $.15, they will reimburse at $.15 not . $42. So in months where the panels underproduce you might still be paying alot. If it under produces by 50kwh, that's $13.50 difference in what you paid and they reimbursed  (before transmission and other fees proboblly $20+ after).\n\nBest of luck. Seems like the deal could he better, but it still proboblly a lot better than your local utility.",

If your system overproduces then you're going to be happy. Think about it, each time that sun is shining, you will not be worrying about paying someone and ecstatic that your system is working for you as you intended. If it underproduces slightly, still no worry as you are still connected to the grid. You can compensate by further optimizing your usage like energy efficient lighting and so forth but assuming your system has been designed to cover your current needs, it's better to set it and forget it. Also you can only sell srecs for the first 5 years of production. Hope they disclosed that to you.",

"comment": "Oh definitely, we need people like you. The easiest way for you to figure this out for yourself, is to try going off-grid, and see first hand all the obstacles. If you don't want to go off-grid, you could try building a small 200-500 watt array and then connect that to a cart containing and small battery bank, charge controller, inverter, and all the wiring in between. That whole process should give you a really good feel for what is lacking -- namely, how hard it is for an amateur to get started, and how easy it is to make bad equipment decisions.\n\nThe thing I think is most needed is digital charge control, also known as \"battery management system\" or BMS. This is both a hardware and software issue. You can get a taste for the problem here:\nhttp://electrodacus.com/\n\nIt's difficult to match the output of a solar panel to a battery bank, and have those batteries perform well, because batteries are sensitive to operating conditions (volts, amp), need to be balanced, need to be charged in specific ways at specific times depending on temperature, and mistakes in this area, with no redundant digital backup systems, can be very costly (you can ruin a battery in months or a year when it could last for 10 years with the right charge control). The products available for this are either cheap and unreliable, or incredibly expensive and subject to exacting warranty conditions. The same goes for inverters.\n\nTransparent battery pricing, especially for lithium iron phosphates in the United States, is abysmal. To get a good deal on LFP's you practically have to call China and arrange your own shipping container. Our only low-cost access to these batteries in the US is through local wholesalers who often focus on custom electric car and wheelchairs -- those wholesalers are either extensions of global shipping companies, or mom-and-pop shops that are very unevenly distributed across the US. For instance, I'm in western Pennsylvania and the nearest source for LFPs for me is in Missouri.\n\nAnother area would be online marketplace/product aggregation -- surveying all the available options and making dynamic price comparisons while juggling product compatibility, sort of like Priceline or KAYAK for solar PV systems. In order to get a feel for this problem space, you might want to join a solar installer and see how they spec systems for clients -- it's a very irrational process strongly influenced by vendors and spoken-word tradition rather than a rational search for the very best option -- there are too many options, and not enough cross-compatible system packages, at the low end in the market, so prices remain artificially high across the market, since suppliers can charge more for their product due to consumer and contractor ignorance about the best deals and what equipment is reliable.\n\nTo extend that problem: there's nowhere you can go on the internet and build an off-grid solar system from scratch in a visual sandbox, dragging and dropping options from a catalog of say 100 or 1000 parts, and then have the sandbox tell you about the operational parameters, cost, and potential incompatibilities in the system. Right now local solar contractors do this work in their heads on the commercial side, after getting a phonecall from a clueless homeowner. The homeowner in this situation has no easy way to get up to speed on the available equipment and what is compatible and cost-effective.\n\nSo a \"build a residential off-grid or grid tie system\" simulator would be spectacular. You could populate your simulator with products/specs/prices scraped from websites like these:\n\n* https://realgoods.com/\n\n* http://www.wholesalesolar.com/\n\n* http://sunelec.com/",

"comment": "Sure it will, just not for long. You can always expand with more batteries in a 12V system. If a car battery can start a car it can run an inverter. \n\nA proper 100AH deep cycle lead acid is going for $250 around here.\n\nAnd you can expand the solar panels later too without needing to expand the inverter. So long as the power into the system is more than the power out, you're charging the battery not depleting. \n\nThing is, the 2000W inverter will often give cleaner power than a little 150W, leave room for expansion and not cost that much more.  \n\nBesides. It only produces the power you're using. Connect a 100W fan and you're using 100W, not 2000W. Its the maximum power output not the power consumption.",

But i saw this youtube video of him from a few weeks ago at the \"China Exchange\" or something like that. where someone asked him about HFCs and he thought they where the future. He cited some of the point in this article like fast refueling and that we dont have enough power to power all the EVs.\n\n\nmy first thought was, but what about home power. a powerwall and some solarpanels will produce enough power for most countries. he doesnt take into account that all technology moves forward.\n\n\ni think as solar panels and batteries drop in price we will see power companies renting/leasing out solar panels and battery walls to costumers. power companies will sell the power produced by all the solar panels to factories and commercial buildings unable to power them selvs and the home owner will have cheaper power while paying for the installment of more solar.",

Sunpower makes absolutely the best product, but that price is TWICE what conventional could cost, it should only be 10%-30% higher. They are also offering you AC modules because the install side doesn't have to worry about salesman selling a system that won't actually work, or about their installers wiring something wrong. Not giving you options is a huge red flag that they don't know what they are doing. \n\nJust to give you a reference point, depending on complexities on site and finance charges based on your credit, we would be anywhere from $26,000 to $31,000. That's 3.60-4.25 per watt for the same exact product. Most Sunpower dealers will be close to 30,000, which is reasonable. \n\nA conventional system will run you anywhere from $18,000 for cheap Chinese and questionable installation to $28,000 for a more premium, though non Sunpower product. \n\nKeep in mind I am from Fresno, a slightly different market than Southern CA, and we are a super competitive company, so I still could be low balling for your area.

Unless your panels move with the sun as it goes from east to west, they don't produce the power you think they do. (More pro solar team crap??)  What about clouds?  What about dust?  What about morning dew?  10 Hrs??? Maybe in Alaska in the summer...\n\nThe battery is the part you left out too.  You would have to store that power from the panels?  So the cost goes up even more.  And the size of battery vs the gallons of gas is way different.  \n\ntype \t            -             MJ/Kg \t\n \nLi - Ion \t      -           0.6 \t\n\nNiMH \t             -            0.4 \t   Prius\n\nAlkaline \t       -         0.6 \t\n\nNiCd  \t   -            0.14 \t\n\nLead Acid \t      -           0.14 \t\n\nGasoline \t    -             45 \t\n\nBattery technology is clearly far behind liquid fuels in terms of energy density and compactness: to store the same amount of energy as in gasoline, the batteries would weigh a little less than 100 times more.  \n\n\nAgain, the problem is your skewed math, the problem comes up when you reach the end of the performance of both cars.  In a gas car, you just fill up again, and on the electric car, you done.  You will have to plug in and start charging, or drag out 100 panels and set them up on the side of the road. \n\nI agree, there is potential in solar, as it's a free power source that we can harness.  But the science behind the harnessing, and storage is not there yet.  Maybe in the future we can get the power we need from the solar panels, and create a car that can produce enough power from the sun to keep it charged as it drives.  And batteries that will provide enough storage to keep then running on cloudy days.  That is the only way you could move from gas to electric here in the states.",

"comment": "&gt;&gt; This is not usually how things work in the real world... If an electrician pulls the permit for you, he's putting his name, his reputation, and most importantly his bond and insurance and license on the line for the work you are going to do. If something goes wrong with the install, he's anywhere from partially to fully liable. He's not going to pull the permit and just walk away.\n\n&gt; In the sense of \"hey how can I do my own installation\" that's very much how it works in the real world and a path to getting that accomplished. I've seen it first hand many times.\n\nI've never once seen an electrical contractor, be it residential, commercial, or service,  that was willing to pull a permit for someone other than their own employees doing the work, let alone a random home owner looking to DIY.   Maybe that's the difference between working for contractors that have unlimited licenses and small shops that don't. I wouldn't risk my license for a customer like that, and in the 25+ years I've been in the trade I've never seen it. \n\n&gt; Don't even pretend of half of the local solar installers in the world give a crap about any of that. \n\nThat's the difference been an electrician and a roofer that installs solar panels. I won't even work on an FPE panel with stab lok breakers without getting the owner to sign a release. Never mind the fact you need arc flash gear just to legally remove the dead front of a panel. \n\nLet's just agree to disagree, shall we? I'm a licensed electrician, and I don't believe the average home owner or handy man has any business getting in a panel, let alone doing work that could easily exceed the rating of the panel's bus bars, or any number of realistic what-ifs. Sure, there are aspects of the job that are very easy and require little to no knowledge... it's the one or two things that can lead to catastrophic failure that make blanket statements on the Internet seem like really bad ideas.",

"comment": "But who is carrying out the actions on behalf of the state to provide those services? People. The government isn't some physical entity we rely on to completely exist. Why shouldn't it be groups of people governing themselves, not a handful carrying out decisions for millions of people? Water/sewage/trash workers use each other's and their own services, right? They produce waste, use water, use toilets and showers. If they use those services, they have an interest in producing it for their benefit, but also for the others in their community. Individual communities know what's best for those communities for revitalization and what it needs to thrive. Live in an area with little water? Conserve. Doesn't take a government to tell you that. Takes a community realizing there's going to be future water depletions if they continue heavy consumption. We're in a vegan subreddit, so obviously water wouldn't be wasted on animal agriculture in my ideal vision of society, either.\n\nEdit: Another example. I'm assuming hydroelectric workers use the electricity those structures produce. Same with fields of solar panels that need technicians and upkeep. People do those jobs in capitalism in return for money, so they can pay for electricity, water, sewage, etc. There doesn't need to be a money motive behind it. Services need to be performed, and can work on all sorts of levels and fields we have in communities and could be done in exchange for each other.",

Even with 6m^2 of solar panels, you would get maybe 1 kw per hour for maybe 9 kw in a day. And this is with it on top of the car. A tesla model s has 210 miles range with a 60 kwh pack. So a full day of charging would yield maybe 20 miles. And that is with a completely flat top, reducing aerodynamic efficiency, and adding a large additional cost (that 6m^2 array costs around $10,000 on the low end).\n\nSo yeah, I like the idea of Sonos, but they are using the solar panels as a gimicky marketing thing.",

Usually canopies are next in line because they can be installed adjacent to the existing buildings/feeds and placed on lots that can quickly be approved to proceed. Ground mounted solar is typically the more expensive of the three because, on average, the sites are further from the building (conduit/cabling costs) and often the land requires environmental assessments that start from scratch.

I interpret that as a vote of no confidence in the systems.\n\nOff grid systems tend to be more custom, and tend to have people who want to actually understand the system they'll be living from.  Tesla's market is more \"bog standard houses on waiting lists,\" and \"people who want to write really, really big checks so they can say they have Tesla hardware on their house and in their garage.\"\n\nThey can't deliver on a schedule either, which is a problem when you're looking to power an off grid house sometime within a few month window of the rest of it being complete (or, likely, before, so you can use the power to build it).\n\nI just don't see why you'd want to pay the Tesla tax for an off grid system that you can't repair yourself, can't see the data from, and generally can't rely on.\n\nIf you're living off grid, a \"Two is one, one is none\" approach to hardware, with enough knowledge about it to be able to bypass and reconfigure things, is a wise way to go.",

"comment": "The problem with \"charging your EV\" is what is backing the charger?  Like do you plan to have batteries in your garage or is this going to be a grid tied system? etc...\n\nYou can't just have solar =&gt; appliance because solar power varies wildly during the day on all but the most blue sky days and that's not a good way to run appliances so the typical setup would be \n\nsolar + grid-tie-inverter =&gt; appliance\n\nor\n\nsolar + batteries =&gt; appliance\n\nThen you have to realize that EV chargers are high power demand.  I charge my Bolt EV at upto 7kW from 220V power.  Even if my car only needs a minor top up the rate of power draw is high (even if the energy demand is low).  Most inverters can only sustain 5kW or less.\n\nThe most practical setup is to grid-tie your solar because this means you can charge more than your solar can provide.\n\nGoing off-grid means enormous energy storage.  For instance, on cold cold days my Bolt can draw as much as 16 to 20kWh for a simple 50km commute.  To generate that much energy on a clear sky winter day would mean you need 7+ kW of panels.  And of course many days are cloudy/etc. So in reality you'll need 100+ kWh of storage unless you live in a very sunny part of the world.\n\nSuch grid-storage is better left to things that scale better than electro-chemical batteries like pumped hydro.  The Snowy 2.0 system for instance is 350,000MWh.",

"comment": "\"Air Sealing\" versus \"Insulation\" and other stuff:  \n\n1) Get an energy audit - as in one using a blower door to depressurize the whole house and a thermal imager (IR camera) to find air-seal by-passes and places where there is little or no insulation in the walls - done by someone who knows what they're doing. Best if the auditor is trained &amp; certified somehow, like BPI or HERS/RESNET.  There are several other decent certifications.  Be wary of an audit by a utility - one done without the instruments I named above.  Electric and gas utility \"audits\" are OK, but they are more akin to \"balancing a check book\" than say, like a full, thorough IRS type audit.  \n\n2) Best cheap DIY type book on the fuller topic (whole house energy efficiency) is Taunton's \"Insulate and Weatherize\" by Bruce Harley.  \n\n3) Beg, borrow, rent, or steal use of a blower door and use it for what's known as \"guided air-sealing.\"  This is a very effective method of tightening up a house.  I have three blower doors and have both lent them out and rented/bartered them to folks doing their own air-sealing.  \n\nI was once teaching home energy auditing at a community college and was training many Chicago area insulation contractors on best practice tricks and methods.  At the time, I was certified by BPI and HERS/RESNET and LEED for Homes.  I was also maintaining my professional engineers license (PE), as I was also consulting in the commercial/industrial rank on building energy efficiency.   \n\nSeparately, I was also training people in solar PV installation.  I even replaced the gas HWH with a tankless/demand/instant unit about 15 years ago.  With my own 100+YO home, I got my overall energy (electricity and natural gas) use down by over 50%.  I have both a PV array, a solar thermal system, and now I drive an Volt and a Prius.  It took a few years and I am still working on things.  \n  \nIf you're patient and serious, you can get to where you have a sixth sense of where your energy use is happening and it feels good.",

"comment": "Obviously batteries can store power long-term, but from your description clearly you are talking about storing *months worth of power* and that is the real challenge.\n\nLet's suppose you need just 2 months of power at 5kwh per day, *very conservative numbers*, that's 300kwh of storage. That would take 80 of [these batteries](https://www.altestore.com/store/deep-cycle-batteries/lithium-batteries/simpliphi-power-smart-tech-lithium-batteries-p40602/#SIMPHI3_8-48V), costing $232,000 (but you would probably get a bulk discount!). If you need 15kwh/day over a 4 month winter you're looking at over a million dollars in batteries.\n\nHydro-pumped storage, and other ways of storing energy with gravity or pressure, are possibilities, but not at all practical or cost efficient at the single-home scale.\n\nIt would be much cheaper to build up your solar array to generate the needed power even on short, cloudy days. In the summer it would produce huge numbers, and hopefully you could find a use for that. If you've already air-conditioned the home and heated a water tank, you could use the 'free' electricity to make money with a cryptocurrency miner.\n\nOr, even though this is /r/solar, maybe you could find an alternative winter energy source like wind (or even geothermal??).",

"comment": "That's because you're looking at about a $45K install right there and the inverter capacity is so limited the customer is still picking which circuits to protect.\n\nFor the same cost you can get 4 times the capacity in kWh and 5 times the inverter capacity with Powerwalls so you can just jam your breaker panel's main lugs straight into the Gateway and have everything protected.\n\nTwo Encharge-10s combined 20 kWh with a 6 kW inverter continuous capacity.\n\nThe same money ($43K) instead gets 6 Powerwalls which combined js 81 kWh of storage with a 30 kW inverter continuous capacity.\n\nObviously you'd go with a 2 PW setup to match the pictured setup,  27 kWh battery + 10 kW inverter for $17K.  It's not a hard decision before you even consider the financing shenanigans.\n\nIf you're looking at just storage and have such a large system then due to the 26% rebate then adding an 8 kW solar system becomes less than free with Tesla.",

[https://www.volts.wtf/p/volts-podcast-sunrun-ceo-lynn-jurich](https://www.volts.wtf/p/volts-podcast-sunrun-ceo-lynn-jurich)\n\nShe proposed that most users would want to use the F-150 to augment a solar+stationary battery system.  Because most of the cost of a solar install is in the permitting, the marginal cost of adding battery and solar when you are already there to install an 80A interconnect make a lot of financial sense.  \n\nNow Jurich has a vested interest in installing as much solar and as many batteries as she can. And if you want to carry on as if nothing happened during a blackout (rolling or otherwise) then a combination of stationary batteries and V2H makes sense.\n\nOn a personal level, I am willing to dial back my energy usage in an emergency such that solar + V2G will be enough. As much as I like the idea of virtual energy providers, I don't think Abbott will let ERCOT implement them in any meaningful way.",

"comment": "My place (off-grid) has dual circuits. A 24 VDC lighting and power circuit, and a 240 VAC power circuit. We have 2.5kW solar PV, with panels wired series-parallel to give 24 volts, charging 1320ah of lead-acid batteries through 2 strings, each with their own controller (one controller is the boss, with programmed charge cycles, the other one is just used as a dumb controller). A sine-wave inverter gives me 240VAC, and a backup generator and battery charger rounds it all off.\n\nIt was already wired that way when bought it from the guy who built it. He's a licenced builder with some very good ideas and approaches. I've upgraded the system twice since buying it - more panels, new batteries, etc.\n\nInitially - this was about 25 years ago - the lighting was expensive, because 24 volt DC incandescent bulbs were rare and expensive. Now I can buy drop-in wide-range LEDs that use a fraction of the energy, and don't heat up nearly as much. There are a couple of polarised 24 volt power sockets, because he also had a 24 volt fridge, but the rest of the power is conventional 240 volts - live, neutral, and earth.\n\nThe whole house was wired with conventional 240 volt cabling, but for the DC circuit only using live and neutral for +ve and -ve, and the earth wire taped off. It meant a lot of cable runs, because that cable only takes 10 amps, and three or four 24 volt lightbulbs reaches 10 amps quickly. BUT, conventional 240 volt cable is MUCH cheaper than dedicated DC cable, and it also means I can change an entire circuit over from 24 volt to 240 volt without re-wiring - just unwrap the earth wire,  replace and re-wire the outlets, then cut the other end over from the 24 volt bus to the 240 volt bus.\n\nSo yes, it's viable, but you do need some understanding of electrical circuits, DC vs. AC, watts, volts, and amps. LED lighting is simple, but various appliances might need more research. I wouldn't use heavy-draw appliances like washers on DC, but you might be able to save a lot with DC refrigeration. Some DC-equivalent appliances are VERY expensive compared to their conventional AC types, but then there's a big market in equipping RVs and caravans with DC appliances.\n\nEdit: there are hybrid A/C systems available. They run directly off PV panels when the sun is shining, and switch to AC when the sun goes down. You'd need a decent-size PV+battery system to run A/C or heat pumps without a grid connection.",

If we stop selling petroleum powered vehicles in 2035, that would imply that we’d have petro cars around until 2075, though obviously a diminishing number of them.\n\nAlso, I live near a large oil refinery, which supplies most of the gasoline for two states, plus all of the aviation fuel for a major airport. It has gone offline for various reasons. And it’s in both a tsunami zone and an earthquake zone.\n\nPost apocalypse, I’d bet on electricity. From my own solar panels, for one.",

"comment": "The world remains a dangerous place: Dictatorial regimes are asserting themselves in numerous ways that will increasingly threaten the economy and security of the United States and what remains of its alliances.\n\nCompounding this growing security threat to the U.S. are the climate change policies of the Biden administration. Policies to combat the non-problem of historically cyclical global temperature are weakening the nation not only as an economic power, but as a diplomatic and military power.\n\nAmerica’s adversaries are on the march and threatening our allies around the world. The Middle East remains an ongoing powder keg with Iran pursuing nuclear weaponry and ever threatening to Israel. The army of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is perched on the border of Ukraine, poised to invade. Communist China’s dictator, Xi Jinping, and his cohorts forever believe that Taiwan is their own and could (and will) strike when the moment is ripe.\n\nRussia and China are tag-teaming against the United States and building alliances with African and South American nations, including investing in resource development that will expand their economic and military power.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Canada’s now-dictator Justin Trudeau, and leaders in other western nations preen about climate change.\n\n…..\n\nRussia, China and Iran are not obsessing about climate change, and no longer pretending to care. They are producing more oil, gas and coal for themselves and their global customers, which increases their territorial and resource ambitions and negates any lower carbon emissions from the U.S.\n\n…..\n\nIn a further twist, as America refuses to develop more energy resources, the Biden administration’s climate goals become more unrealistic. The raw materials for electric car batteries and solar panels, for example, are increasingly dependent on China and nations in Africa with which it is building strategic alliances. Accordingly, the U.S. will be in no position economically or diplomatically to thwart China’s territorial ambitions for Taiwan and elsewhere.\n\nSurrendering America’s energy capacity to pursue climate fantasies of the Biden administration and its wealthy donor class will have not only a harmful economic impact but will make the world more dangerous for the U.S. and its allied nations.",

"comment": "I've been doing a lot of research on this exact topic lately and unfortunately, it seems like there are no shortcuts.\n\nIn theory, the easiest way is to get an off-the-shelf 240v inverter and hook it up to a battery (even your car) and pump that into the house. If it's a pure sine wave inverter, that may trick the solar system into coming online. \n\nHowever, grid-tied solar inverters by default put out as much power as possible, with no regard for whether anything actually needs that power (this is called a current source, as opposed to a voltage source). This means that unless you have enough running in your house to use up all the solar power all the time, bad things will start to happen.\n\nSpecifically, as the solar pushes power into your house but there's not enough running to use it all, the \"pressure\" (aka voltage) in your house wiring will start to rise. When this happens, either things will start catching on fire, or your 240v inverter or the solar inverters will shut down due to overvoltage safety measures.\n\nThat said, there are ways to monitor your house consumption and adjust the solar production based on that through something called frequency shifting. To do this, you need a fancy controller connected to your source inverter. It will monitor your consumption, and if the solar is putting out too much power, it'll start shifting the frequency of the power the source inverter is outputting until the solar inverters either shut off or modulate down (depending on the type of solar inverter). And while you're at it, you should upgrade that inverter to an inverter charger with a battery so it can dump power into a battery when there's extra, rather than just shutting off panels. And once you get to this point, you may as well just buy one of the standard packages from the major manufacturers to do all the above.",

Prices for batteries are still falling so it is a nice to have right now, but not a necessity unless you value one of the previously mentioned scenarios. \n\nI rely on electric for heat here in upstate NY so a small system is definitely worth it for me. If you really want battery backup and do not have the ability to DIY a system, shop around a bit.  15k probably isn't bad for your area, but other brand systems could cost less.",

Every year I get a true up bill, and I end up paying several thousand dollars for my years worth of usage. EV's are also astronomically priced for what you get, I don't think EV's are doing us any favors outside of burning fossil fuel, they still produce toxic chemicals like nickel and nitrogen coupled with invasive mining for lithium which is also extremely toxic. Right now, both are deprecating investments that aren't really designed to save you money.\n\nThe only reason to do either is climate, because the money savings just doesn't exist.",

He's look for a hybrid inverter at the least.  \n\nMore info in the link, here's some tidbits,  \nhttps://www.cleanenergyreviews.info/blog/bidirectional-ev-chargers-review  \n> In North America, UL9741 is a proposed standard applicable to bidirectional EV charging system equipment, built around the UL1741 (safety standard) and the IEEE1547 standard for interconnecting distributed energy resources (DER) with electrical power systems.\n> \n> The latest international standard for communication between an EV and a bidirectional charger is ISO 15118-20, which specifies a Vehicle-to-Grid Communication Interface. The purpose of this standard is to detail the communication between an EV (BEV or a PHEV) and the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment), more commonly known as an EV charger.\n> \n> Sigenergy Sigenstor and Ambibox work with the more common CCS (DC) vehicle charge port.\n> \n> However, two innovative EU companies, InterControl and Ambibox In Germany, successfully conducted a V2H test with a Tesla Model Y and Model 3 using a bidirectional charger without any vehicle modifications. This discovery transformed our understanding of Tesla's true V2H and V2G capabilities. It was rumoured that Tesla was holding back on enabling bidirectional functionality to ensure home battery sales were not impacted before official V2G regulations and standards were in place.\n> \n> Recent regulatory changes in Australia and New Zealand now allow bidirectional charging systems, like solar or hybrid inverters, to be installed and connected to the grid. The Australian standards AS4777.1 and AS4777.2 now govern the installation and performance of inverters, including bidirectional chargers. The updated AS4777.1 was published in Q3 2024, and the revised AS4777.2 is expected by the end of the year. The Australian energy regulator aims to approve bidirectional charging (vehicle-to-grid) by year-end. This will likely lead to updates in the AS/NZS3000 wiring rules to incorporate this technology as part of inverter systems.\n>",

Speaking of solar, with a different point entirely, plop a few solar power plants in somewhere like morocco or anywhere with a hot desert really and you'll make a lot of power, in the case of morocco, if you made enough or made it big enough it could theoretically power the world. Now how you would transport that power is another question (and frankly I have no idea) but hey.\n\n  \nthere are definitely other areas that have much more restricted limits than that, so I'm not saying you could make arguments similar to this everywhere in life for example, but I just wanted to point out we could make life a whole lot easier for ourselves without too many drawback beyond the initial price tag.",

"comment": "lol, this is what happens when you order your facts from temu.\n\n>The resources used creating renewable energy are just as unrenewable as nuclear or coal. Lest we forget that the physical creation of a solar panel isn’t exactly ecologically friendly and they still need to be replaced from time to time anyways.\n\nduh, ofc the resources used to BUILD a solar utility aren't renewable. the resources used to POWER them are. \n\nthe resources used to BUILD a fossil or nuclear utility aren't renewable either. differnece is the resources used to POWER renewables are renewable, while the ones used for fossil and nuclear are not. \n\nhence the name \"renewables\". it's kinda sad that you're not even familar with these most basic facts.\n\nalso, concerning ecological impact, the resources used for building are a VERY small factor compared to the resources used for powering a fossil utility. \n\nyour \"argument\" basically boils down to \"renewable energy generation has a bigger ecological impact than not generating any energy at all\". talking about an \"extremely poor counter argument\" :D\n\n>The cost is going down because it’s a sector that’s actively being invested in and expanded. People are buying solar panels, governments are investing in them, and companies are working to build them at scale. Meanwhile, nuclear has been left behind because a bunch of shrieking and misinformed fools have convinced themselves that nuclear is the worst thing ever even though they can only point to two major disasters. Both of which are agreed to be freak accidents that shouldn’t have happened. No one is investing in nuclear and so it remains expensive and will continue to get even more so while that happens.\n\nyeah lol the decision makers in economy and politics are \"a bunch of shrieking and misinformed fools\" for not investing in a technology that couldn't even compete with renewables if it was able to keep all the false promises the nuclear industry makes. sry, but you are delusional.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwqmhbbcjpyd1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=367b90ea9f866ab75d0b8ad48fffb37ffddfd9b7\n\n>As for the fuels, uranium and thorium are shockingly common resources in the Earth’s crust. There’s plenty there.\n\nwrong again. static raw material reserves are estimated to last about 70 years, with an increase in price of \\~ 200 %. (\"static\" means assuming the usage remains static, so every new nuclear power plant would shorten that timespan.) you know what really is abundant? wind and sunlight.\n\nyou really know very, very, very little about the topic. why do you feel the urge to utter an opion when you're clearly blatantly underinformed?",

"comment": "innovation is via competition. It's good, that China finally woke up the EU and US. But still - to keep competition going there are need to be more than one party. So EU and US still in the game for the future is good. \n\nas for why green tech left EU and US besides your objections. These are - environmental regulations (hurdle on rare earth mining, because of quite a low quality of minerals - a lot of waste), lack of sizeable lithium reserves. Now - there are both good rare earth deposits and lithium are found in either US or EU, there are policies to build strong industries. Why is it bad? China won't disappear from market - it has it's own huge market, East Asia market, Africa market. And to have three big players is really what will guarantee that the progress will go. Because batteries and solar panels will keep improving up, probably, to 2060s, it is a long game with much bigger market in 30s.\n\nwithout competition with US and EU China will keep moving - but at a much slower pace. And US has more in development - sulphur-lithium batteries at 900 Wh/kg and lithium air batteries at 800-1200 Wh/kg and honestly I'd like to see them to hit market rather that disappear like academic curiosity.\n\nAnd the China rise will continue. Current requests won't stop it. Besides currently - China still uses 'developing country' status, but in reality in tech sector it's already developed country.\n\nIt really strange to see to give all favors to China just to avoid future competition.\n\nAnd whatever pro china guys write - neither US nor EU will give up now. The stakes are much higher than losing influence. And again - insuring competition is what is needed for the world, and not domination of one player.",

However, there are certain gifts for which it can be cool to put the accent on the friend's veganism. There are areas other than food in which vegans are somewhat limited. If his friend is into fashion, he/she could get her a nice vegan purse, wallet or pair of shoes for example. I used to dance tango and never had real tango shoes because all the ones I came across were leather. I would have loved a pair of custom-made  fake leather tango shoes, whereas if I hadn't been a vegan any of my other hobbies and interests would have made for equally worthy gift-material.",

Not an allergy, I haven't eaten them in that way since I became vegan 3 years ago. So when I go to restaurants, am shopping or am at someone's house, vegan is the most accurate to my diet and to what I believe in. \n\nI agree what people think about vegetarianism is usually watered down, at least partly due to the fact that people think they are vegetarian while eating fish or even some types of other meat. I'm on your side when it comes to that, because a vegetarian who doesn't eat fish really has a totally different diet to a pescatarian.\n\nHowever, while there is a significant difference between me and someone who wouldn't/couldn't ever touch a smidgen of milk/egg and also chooses not to eat honey, in every day life term covers both of us quite well.",

So when, as you suggest, some bees are used as pollinators are the plants they are used to pollinate also not to be consumed (whether it is food or flowers for decoration/garden) by vegans? Seems like vegans must have a tough time ensuring that their lifestyle beliefs are catered to. One last question while I am here and too lazy to search, what is the vegan stance on vaccine's and medicines? Seeing as almost all vaccines and medications (or some of their ingredients) have been tested on rats or other animals. Just curious.",

I see the intuitive appeal of assuming that whatever our ancestors ate is best for us, but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny at all. See [this](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/07/23/human-ancestors-were-nearly-all-vegetarians/) article from scientific american. \n\n\n&gt;I find it very strange that you are always quoting this (more or less) bullshit articles and showing how inferior your diet is and how bad animal products are.\n\nI don't know what articles you're referring to so I can't really adress your argument there. What you described didn't describe the OP's post which was debunking the myth that animal protein is superior to plant protein.\n\n&gt;I, on the other hand, am a supporter of quality omni diet.\n\nthere goes your impartiality. by your own criteria, you just disqualified yourself from this conversation.\n\nedit, in response to your edit. You're clearly not reading the sources in the context they're provided. [Here](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/5/1576S.full.pdf+html) is a handy review from a peer reviewed scientific journal. see in table 11 in particular: *\"Quality depends on the source and dietary mixture of plant proteins: can be equivalent to high-quality animal protein.\"* [...] *\"The intakes and balance of intakes of indispensable amino acids and nitrogen are crucial and can be adequately met from plant or plant and animal sources\"* [...] \"*There is no evidence that amino acid imbalances per se are important: possible imbalances can be created by inappropriate amino acid supplementation, but this is not a practical problem*\"",

We were like, how the fuck are this soy hot dog links four times as expensive as the regular versions?\n\nWell for one, the \"meat\" that they put in hot dogs is so shitty I wouldn't be surprised if is actually cost less than soy... But the answer lies in the scale of the production... If they make 1000 times less vegan hot dogs, they're going to be more expensive per unit. But I think you're right, there's also this thinking that vegans/vegetarians are like... rich, spoiled fake-hippies? I guess if we don't want to milk cows, people want to milk us instead!",

"comment": "I found [this booklet](http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/gce.pdf) to be a great starter guide when I went vegan. It explains a lot of vegan products you may not have had before, goes over nutritional guidelines, and has a few recipes that show you how to make substitutions. [This](http://www.theveganrd.com/) and [this](http://jacknorrisrd.com/) are my favorite blogs about nutrition - both written by registered dieticians who are vegan and promote evidence-based nutrition. \n\nI just wanted to address your concerns about soy - you don't have to eat much of it at all. I buy maybe 1 package of tofu/week, and maybe a package of tempeh. I don't drink soy milk because I am allergic to it raw. *However*, there is no evidence that soy actually causes any harm. There is a really pervasive myth that soy has estrogenic effects, and I think this is what you are referring to in your post. [This article](http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/soy_wth) extensively debunks this - you would have to eat a ridiculously large amount of soy to even start to worry about negative effects. And soy has many positive effects.",

Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life-cycle including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence and for athletes.”\n\nand be done with it. Don't get dragged into a big debate or try to prove that a vegan diet is *healthier* (unless you're into that kind of thing). The point is, there is no need for a vegan diet to be healthier. As long as it is or can be equally healthy to a nonvegan diet, then eating animal products is *unnecessary* and doing so is creating *unnecessary harm* to animals.",

"comment": "It just makes sense, right? If we suddenly didn't have all this meat around, then most of the world would starve to death! ^**o.O**\n\nFrom the site:\n\n&gt; Food scarcity is an argument for veganism, not against it. As the world’s population grows and more people are able to afford meat, less food is available overall. This is because we filter protein and energy-rich crops like soy and grain through animals at a substantial loss before eating them. Depending on the numbers you want to trust and the type of animal it comes from, each pound of meat requires four to thirteen pounds of feed to produce. By switching to a plant-based diet, the farms that presently grow that feed are able to grow food for people instead.\n&gt;\n&gt; In all, roughly 40% of the world's arable land is used for food production, while only a quarter of that food is for human consumption. The rest, a staggering 30% of the world's arable land, is used to produce animal feed and commands a third of the world's fresh water. Worse, the meat resulting from this industrialized animal agriculture is not divided evenly. For instance, Americans eat 270 lbs. of meat a year on average, while Bangladeshis eat 4 lbs. Meanwhile, much of the world gets no food at all or raises livestock feed for export to countries with a high demand for meat, creating an unequal burden of production versus consumption between the poorest and richest people on the planet. This is why even conservative researchers are calling for a global decrease in the consumption of meat, while most are calling for the widespread adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet in order to create and sustain food security for the world's growing population. Widespread adoption of a plant-based diet would leave the Earth's arable land and fresh water for use in the production of food crops for people and not feed crops for livestock. \n\nOf note, this fallacy is also presently available in [German](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/de/menschen-wuerden-in-veganer-welt-verhungern/resourcen) and [Spanish](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/es/humanos-moririamos-dehambre-en-un-mundovegano/fuentes).",

They could have limitations that exclude them from having a 2000+ calorie diet, such as physical disabilities that limit them to a minimally active lifestyle, metabolic disorders, a small frame, or short stature. Blanket statements such as the ones you have presented can be dangerous if they have those limitations. \n\nAlso, OP specifically mentioned manic/psychotic episodes, NOT that they were having massive cravings for non-vegan foods. Their question would have been different if just hunger was the case. I am genuinely sorry that you had to go through what you did, but you cannot apply your experience to their's out of expectation that they are similar. I'm sure the medical professionals they are working with know what they are doing.",

But then they eat nothing but meat and cheese, dairy products and eggs all day. As long as they don't have to think about how that stuff got on their plate it's fine but if you confront them with it it's annoying to them. And the worst thing is it makes me feel different about people if they \"promote animal cruelty\". Like when they start to send me anti-vegan pictures I just lose every bit of respect for them. Just seems to show their real colors and i don't wanna surround myself with people like this anymore. Vegans are definately not the bad guys for pointing it out, only in our society they are. Everyone is scared to be left out and not fit in, so they adapt or stay silent.",

It's that vegans have a double standard and don't claim it's wrong that predators eat animals, because they have to.\n\nWhen you realize that the earth has existed for billions of years, and that organisms that exist in unbelievably large orders of magnitude have been eaten by predators for billions of years, the lives of animals now seems negligible compared to the suffering that's happened in the past. If we assume that any animal feeling pain or dying is bad, then being a vegan nowadays will help less than 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 percent of all the animals that ever lived.\n\nAnd when you also realize that the predators and prey evolved to be a few more cells than their predecessor every generation, there can't be any morally significant difference between an animal and a small multicellular organism.",

Unless you have allergies preventing you from eating nuts/beans/veg of some kind, let her introduce you to her world! \nI went on a trip and met up with some people from Texas USA who probably never saw a raw vegetable in their lives, and we went to a vegan restaurant (they were curious and prepared to declare it just as gross and tasteless as they expected) and they were gobsmacked over how delicious it was.  Vegan food isn’t just tofu and kale you know! ;)",

If the texture is too weird for you, I can recommend making oatmeal cookies instead! Depending on your dietary preferences (no oil or nuts or sugar or whatever), you usually can find some good recipes online. :) Alternatively and if you have a blender, make pancakes out of oatmeal flour + banana + your fave plant milk + flax egg. That's pretty much the favourite of all my (non-vegan) friends whenever they come over! And that despite the pancakes being gluten-free, refined sugar-free, and oil-free.",

In healthy young women, approximately 21% of dietary ALA was converted to EPA and 9% was converted to DHA (7). The better capacity to generate long-chain PUFA from ALA in young women compared to men is related to the effects of estrogen .](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids)",

Unless we discover sentience in them later on despite a current lack of evidence, they could be valuable as a source of food for pets that actually need meat to survive. That may be outside the scope of this discussion since the original post was about pearls, but I think they are used far more for food than for jewelry.\n\nI don’t eat them for the same reason as you, but I think due to the lack of evidence of sentience we shouldn’t judge people who consume them because no one has a very strong reason to believe doing so inflicts any harm.",

"comment": "You do realize humans are innate omnivores - we’re built to eat both meat and non-meat foods. Whether we choose too or not is another matter. In the same way that i said humans are innately societal, whether we choose to use that to harm or benefit others is again a choice. Laws don’t stop people from committing crimes against others as we well know. Before you say “why have them at all”, there are some important factors to consider such as structuring punishments and deterrence for low level offending.\n\nBut that’s getting a bit off topic. I think the issue at hand really revolves around your choice being at odds with mine, but where I’m not interested in trying to convert you, you’re apparently comparing my position to slavery? Clearly hugely insulting to those who suffered under times of slavery and really not relevant as a comparison.\n\nMy final point is this however. It seems that your position is less about trying to convince me to change mine and more about just looking for opportunity to grandstand and be oppositional. I rather think that the “fun” of this would disappear for you if I just said “cool, I’ll be a vegan from tomorrow” - for you and for a lot of vegans it seems being one is more about holding a (supposedly) moral high ground you can you to attack people who don’t agree with you.\n\nYou’ll never change the world by making the people you disagree with the enemy.",

The average beef cow herd is around 44 cattle. Ranches with herds over 100 only represent 10% of cow-calf producers. Now granted they do make up just over half (56%) of the total cattle but the point stands that almost half of all beef cattle are raised in this way. \n\nI am originally from Oklahoma and grew up in a family and community that was one of those smaller cow-calf producers. Oklahoma has the fifth most cattle of any state last I checked. I’ve also lived in Texas which has the most and is also where the largest of that 10 percent of larger producers are I believe. I’ve also witnessed their operations up close and still know people that work as actual cowboys down there. The herds are larger but also typically have a much more closer to appropriate size of acreage to roam on. \n\nNow none of this is me trying to say that it’s okay. I’m vegan, I don’t support domestic agriculture. But apparently people don’t want to know how it’s actually done lol since I got downvoted.",

I can see why that would seem out of place to some at a vegan fest where the focus is on reducing animal product consumption. That is a critical battle and mixing cannabis into that fight would potentially be distracting/offputting for some of the attendees.\n\nAs I see it the real problem is the drug war as it has prevented proper education about the whole subject. We have a vast endo-cannabinoid system in our bodies that regulates a lot of important functions and cannabis acts as a source of exogenous cannabinoids that are used by that same system. In this regard one could indeed call it a \"wonder drug\" but that looks kind of silly and will be written off as you suggest because nothing man made is nearly as effective or useful in the same way.\n\nHemp is a whole other thing as it is really healthy for us, also as you point out, and then the two things also get confused, cannabis and hemp.\n\nAs a side note and as far as the doctors can tell cannabis consumption saved my partners vision, she has a very rare degenerative retinal condition.  If she stops consuming entirely the problem begins to come back, so to us it's been a life changing/improving substance of great importance.\n\nSorry for the wall o' text. :-)",

It's actually cheaper most of the time and when it's more expensive it's because meat and animal products in general are heavily subsidized. Meat wouldn't be a viable option for most people if not for subsidies. The less meat you eat the less your tax money is used for those subsidies.",
