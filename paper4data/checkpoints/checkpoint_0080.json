"comment": "&gt;...but I think it's generally reasonable to assume that the cost of externalities is correlated with energy consumption...\n\nThis is where I disagree, though I will note that I can understand your reasoning there.  To illustrate why I think that assumption may be incorrect, consider where we get lithium, as opposed to where we get oil.  Still, I don't want to belabor the point.\n\n&gt;The \"cost effectiveness\" part of the study was a secondary goal to the energy consumption portion, and poorly done in comparison. \n\nIf you look at that statement from my point of view, you might understand that I am a little dubious when you say that your source does a good job on one part of a study and a poor job on another part of the same study.  How am I to know that you don't have it exactly backward?\n\n&gt;I don't mean to say that you believe there are no negative externalities to CV production, just that you haven't volunteered them, while you've quite freely volunteered your assessment of those associated with BEV production.\n\nYou have done a fine job of detailing the CV externalities, so I felt no need.  That's one of the great things about a debate: we are not obligated to provide evidence for our opponent's argument.\n\n&gt;so I'd be interested to know where you got that number.\n\nGoogling around, I found in in [this article](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/136894-will-high-mileage-nissan-leafs-need-costly-battery-replacements-soon).  It states, \"The issue is not minor: The manufacturing cost of the Leaf’s battery is around $15,000, so replacing the battery is half the cost of the car.\"\n\n&gt;...but battery cost is clearly the biggest driver of retail cost, and there's a pretty clear trend of lowering $/kwh.\n\nI am happy to note the reduction from the first models to today, but I don't think two or three data points should be extrapolated into a trend.  The price reductions going forward might be linear, or they might be logistic, or they might be logarithmic.\n\n&gt;...since Tesla sells advance battery replacement for $12k.\n\nThere's no guarantee that they aren't losing money on that, though.\n\n&gt;$12k for an 85kwh Tesla pack corresponds to $3400 for a 24kwh Leaf pack...\n\nIf they scale linearly.  I suspect there are some base costs for a battery pack, with a variable cost for the cells.",

"comment": "If you're willing to relocate, my recommendation would be Maine.\n\nWhy Maine you ask? Well, for one, its underappreciated. Portland, ME is an awesome \"small town\" city with Amtrak access all down the coast.\n\nSecond, I doubt its a saturated market. Sure, California has great sunlight + some incentives. But everybody and their mother is a solar installer in California. Very difficult to break into the market. You'll find the same in other states.\n\nNorth Carolina or Louisiana would be nice. They have robust state tax credits for solar which make projects very easy to justify. NC is better for small commercial. Louisiana is better for residential.  But you have to ask yourself, do you really want to relocate to another market that could evaporate the minute the incentives get tossed out the window?\n\nMaine has a very high fuel cost. 10 cents per kwh before getting into any distribution or transmission fees! That market is gonna stick around. Plus you won't have much competition, meaning you can charge closer to $4/W vs. $3/W. Higher margins, fewer projects, no incentive plan to deal with... it all sounds pretty nice huh?\n\nPlus you got the high margin off grid market to exploit. Vermont + New Hampshire are good markets too.\n\nI'd say the winters are dreary, but you're from Ohio.",

"comment": "As much as it'd be great to just stop using gas entirely right now, that's completely untenable. A battery-powered trailer like this has limited appeal until there's a mature infrastructure in place, but a gas-powered trailer can get more EVs out on the roads *right now*. The real point is to drive as many miles as possible on electricity rather than gas, and technologies like a gas-powered range extender trailer would enable that, even if they have to use a little bit of gas to do so.\n\nThink about it: If an EV driver wants to take a long trip now, with let's say 1000 miles to get there and back and 200 miles of driving while he's there, 99% of the time he'll just take his other (ICE) car, or perhaps rent one, so we have 0 electric miles and 1200 gas miles. But if he could rent a gas-powered trailer and could charge at his destination, then there would be at least 2 full charges worth of electric miles going there and back plus all the driving at the destination. And he might even find some charging along the way. So at least ~400 of those 1200 miles become electric miles, which is a big improvement over 0.\n\nCase in point: [The Volt has achieved more electric miles than the Leaf, despite having 1/2 the battery capacity, because the gas-powered generator allows people to use the car more.](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1088628_chevy-volt-owners-drive-more-electric-miles-than-nissan-leaf-drivers-why)",

When I bought my 2014 a month ago I had to go to three different dealers just to find one charged for me to drive- and in all three places they  kept trying to steer me into a \"fuel efficient\" truck or suv. In addition, they didn't know shit about the car, all the questions I had, I had to look up on my phone-- and, finally they filled out the registration wrong which prevented me from getting the HOV exemption--that was a huge pain in the ass to fix.\n\nI love this car, but fucking GM hasn't learned-- they still do not want want EVs to succeed. They want to sell you gas run cars that require a shit ton of maintenance.  Its amazing they cant see that if they took their incredible resources and infrastructure and decided to make EVs for real, they could do it, probably become the leading force for the next 20-30 years in these and create an entire new industry... But, I guess fuck that, that requires actual work.  They'd rather keep getting their cocks stroked by the oil companies and keep pretending to make progress while holding back the real technological advances.\n\nI can not wait till 2017, when my lease is up, and I get my Tesla Model 3.",

Built hydrogen powered airplanes.\n\n4.  Buy energy efficient windows.\n\n5.  Talk about climate change.\n\nI really thought the guy would have something better.  Transportation is ~1/4th of our energy consumption.  Energy efficient windows would return very little energy savings overall.  Hydrogen isn't dense enough to be realistic for air travel, which he could have figured out with five minutes' time and a pencil.  Again, very disappointing.",

But I think at the same time electric cars should be put into a different category for the time being until they make up the majority of the market. Right now full electric is a niche and dealers rarely have them on the floor or any of the option packages for them because they don't want to sell them because they cant get service packages for them for repairs and stuff. The electric car kills the market of the car dealer / repair cycle and make it actually less consumer centric as well with the fact the computers on Tesla's, Leafs, ect all lock out third party repair shops.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; The upcoming all-electric Chevy Bolt, perhaps the most important car GM has ever released, will sport an electric range of 238 miles according to estimates by the EPA.

"comment": "&gt;Applying this brilliant engineering to the problem yields this result: A natural gas electric generating turbine gets 40% efficiency. A high voltage transformer gets 90% efficiency. A household level transformer gets 50% efficiency. A short transmission line gets 20% loss, which is 80% efficiency. The total is 40% x 90% x 50% x 80% = 14.4% of the energy recovered before the electrical system does something similar to the gasoline engine in the vehicle. Some say the electricity performs a little better in the vehicle, but it's not much.\n\nNo, google those figures again, they're ridiculous. \n\nBTW, can someone explain what kind of math he used to calculate 40% x 90% x 50% x 80% = 14.4%? (40% x 90% x 50% x 80%)/4 = 3600000%?\n\nLet me make it simple, assume 10 PWh of energy is contained by the world's annual consumption of oil based fuels. After being burned by ICE cars, 20%, exaggerating, of that energy will be turned into useful work, which means 2 PWh would be needed to move the 1.2 billion cars fleet and whatever trains, planes and cargo ships there are in a year. Now, if electric drive trains are 90% efficient, to produce an equal amount of work they'd need around 2.2 PWh of energy. Assume also 20% losses will exist for the grid transmission, then a total 2.64 PWh will be needed. That's a 3.7 times reduction from 10 PWh without counting the energy needed to extract, transport, store, refine and distribute the oil based fuels. \n\n&gt;Electricity appears to be easy to handle sending it through wires. \n\nBecause it's been done for over 100 years.\n\n&gt;But it is the small scale that makes it look cheap. Scaling it up takes a pound of metal for so many electron-miles. \n\nExcept it's cheaper for large scale solar on account on getting cheaper prices per W for large scale orders. I'm not even going to entertain the stupidity of the claims for imagined gargantuan costs for wires when TODAY we already have cathedral like centralized power plants in the GW scale.\n\n&gt;Twice as much distance means twice as much metal. Twice as many amps means twice as much metal. Converting the transportation system into an electrical based system would require scaling up the amount of metal and electrical infrastructure by factors of hundreds or thousands.\n\nAssuming it's centralized, it will require more or less the same amount of transmission. With decentralized systems, it will be less.\n\n&gt;Where are all those lines going to go? They destroy environments. \n\nNot even joking, this guy says transmission lines are affecting the environment as if they even compare to what fossil fuels are doing. \nRidiculous.\n\n\n&gt;Where is that much natural gas going to come from for the electrical generators? \n\nNews flash, EV proponents want zero emission energy sources like solar and energy storage not more natural gas.\n\n&gt;There is very little natural gas in existence when using it for a large scale purpose.\n\nGood, better let it in the ground.\n\n&gt;Natural gas has to be used with solar and wind energy, because only it can be turned on and off easily for backup.\n\nNo it hasn't, energy storage does need to be paired with renewables. In fact, utilities are already saying that natural gas peakers are going out of fashion as the price of solar and battery energy storage is becoming cheaper for load balancing.\n\n&gt;One of the overwhelming facts about electric transportation is the chicken and egg phenomenon. Supposedly, a lot of electric vehicles will create an incentive to create a lot of expensive infrastructure. There are a lot of reasons why none of the goals can be met for such an infrastructure. The basic problem is that electricity will never be appropriate for such demanding use as general transportation, which means there will never be enough chickens or eggs to balance the demand.\n\nWhat are all those charging stations then? An illusion?\n\n&gt;It's like trying to improve a backpack to such an extent that it will replace a pickup truck. The limitations of muscle metabolism are like the limitations of electrical energy.\n\nMore like getting a pickup truck so light that it takes about as much energy to carry as a backpack.",

"comment": "As you have already guessed, software engineering in the automotive(electric vehicle) industry goes way beyond the self driving software. Almost every aspect of any modern car is controlled by software. There are at least 100 microcontrollers in any modern car and even more in an electric luxury car like Tesla. The automotive software environment is a lot different from consumer electronics in that, automotive software are written to be extremely safe and robust. You cannot simply have a failure while the car is being driven at 70mph. There are a number of safety protocols to be followed and it makes the job of the software developer really challenging and interesting as well. \n\nAs a software engineer, you could either go down the embedded system route. This would involve setting up the software architecture of how the different ECUs in the car communicate with each other. That would involve quiet a bit of experience in the embedded systems area. \nOr you could be an applications engineer (or controls engineers). These guys write the code for all of the features in the car. This could range anywhere between a complicated Anti lock braking system or track mode in a Tesla to perhaps dog mode or camp mode. These positions are often classified based on the area of expertise they tend to focus on. If you search for a controls engineer position in any of the auto industry you’ll often find keyword such as controls engineer- vehicle dynamics or power train or battery systems or thermal systems. So a vehicle dynamics controls engineer would write the code for how the vehicle should perform when the driver floors the car around a corner while a thermal controls engineer would write the algorithm on how the battery should be heated efficiently at -30 degree Celsius. To go down this route, you would need to have a very strong fundamentals and expertise in physics and maths (control theory). \n\nOr if you want to continue with your experience as a front end developer, you could be a part of the infotainment team. Every car nowadays comes with multiple big screens to convey important vehicle information and at the same time as an input device replacing all analog knobs and buttons. The way the driver interacts with the touchscreen plays a huge impact on his/her decision to buy the car. \n\nThere are just a few ways you could start exploring your options in the automotive industry, but by no means this is an exhaustive list. All of what I have described falls in the vehicle engineering side of the industry and that’s because I work there. There is a whole another side involving manufacturing, production planning, logistics, supply chain where software development plays an equally important role. You might have heard about the recent lawsuit involving Tesla and Zoox where Tesla accused former employees stealing their logistics software and using them in Zoox. Tesla claimed that those would enable Zoox to leapfrog ‘years’ of development in the logistics side. \n\nAnyway, all the best! And dm me if you have any additional questions.",

Similarly, if you do frequent looong roadtrips an electric car (that's not a Tesla) may not be the best choice right now (depending on the infrastructure availability in your route, and your willingness to stop for extended periods of time to wait to charge). At that point, you may be better served with either a PHEV, or springing for a Tesla (new or used; they unfortunately don't depreciate too quickly).",

"comment": "For under 30k, your choices are a Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq, or a used Chevy Bolt EV. If you're worried about Telsa fires, boy wait until you hear about the Bolts! So then your option is Nissan Leaf or Hyundai Ioniq.\n\nIf you like the Nissan Leaf (2022 will be about $20k after $7500 tax credit) or the Ioniq (about $26k after tax credit) buy that. If you don't, you'll have to get a hybrid or a fully gas engine car.\n\nThere are some other options, but nothing to get excited about. I'm also slightly confused, you say you won't be buying one for another 3 years? The entire landscape of affordable electric cars will probably be different by then, so going on advice from right now in 3 years would be a very bad idea. In 3 years there may be even more EV incentives from the government, or maybe none. Maybe by then there will be the Tesla Model 2, VW ID2, EV's from Europe and Japan and China coming to America. Who knows? If I were you, I would ask this question much closer to when you are planning to actually purchase the car.",

Having said that, your math is off (I made the same mistake).   Purchase price in USD is 39,990 (select that price not 'potential savings').  Then I punch that into [xe.com](https://xe.com):\n\n39,990.00 US Dollars = 50,133.73 Canadian Dollars\n\nPrice on the Canadian Tesla site is \\~2800 more.  \n\nThanks for the tip on Ram, I saw that announcement as well and posted an updated link in the comments here.

My wife got stuck once trying to go up an ice covered incline *20 years ago* in a rear-wheel drive Toyota when we first moved to Denver, and now absolutely refuses to look at a non-AWD car ever again. I swear if we moved to Hawaii, she'd insist on AWD in case it ever snows because of climate change!\n\nCar buying is absolutely irrational. I bought my first EV (a Nissan Leaf) because I wanted to \"vote with my wallet\" and help support an EV future, even though I'm still on the fence about the direction EVs are going (until batteries/battery modules are cheaper to replace and *standardized* between models and even brands, we're going to be filling junkyards and landfills with otherwise mechanically sound 10-15 year old EVs that aren't worth enough to invest in a battery replacement.)",

"comment": "Right. The electric Fiat still breaks the side view mirror switch if you sneeze on it. The glovebox door latch is gonna break after the 5th use. The convertible top on my smart is a wear item that will need to be replaced (and probably in the next 2-3 years given the wear spots I'm noticing). It will likely go to an independant shop, unless they're going to cost more than Mercedes (which, I'm told, it's about $2200 at Mercedes for a new factory top - most manufacturers don't do convertible repairs in house, they subcontract it out to a local specialist). \n\nYou keep something long enough, you replace some expensive parts. That's how it goes. EVs just have very little routine maintenance costs. A few filters, that's it.\n\nIt's not the battery or the drive motor that I'd be worried about. What happens when someone's dog sees a squirrel and yanks the owner in a way that they break the J-plug off into the socket of the car (this has happened with a door mirror, so this isn't far fetched)? Can MIDAS replace that part? Will they even offer or tell you \"we can't do electrics?\"\n\nHow long will the AC charger last (one of those died on a Smart...that car is in bits in my back yard). The local indie Mercedes shop couldn't fix it, only Mercedes could (for many thousands more than the car was worth).\n\nWhat about the switches and knobs? Most people don't know how to tear apart their door panel to replace these things. They will take it to a shop -- be it the authorized service center or another one -- and they will pay someone to fix it.\n\nService centers ain't going no where. Dealers are manufactured trained and certified service centers. End of story.\n\nTesla's big issue is a LACK of physical repair facilities. Rivian's lack of repair facilities also concerns me. Lordstown's partnership with RV World was reassuring to me, as RV World dealers are a pretty common thing across most of the US. Polestar's leveraging the Volvo dealers for service, focusing on showroom/delivery centers to promote the brand.\n\nA good product needs support because eventually, it all fails.",

We’re seeing through the slipped timelines and broken promises from Musk time and time again. \n\nIt was cute and fun when Tesla was the only EV on the market. We have options now. Plenty. From companies that won’t bullshit us or ask for interest free loans for indefinite times, then ask for more money when they underestimated the cost.\n\nThe fact that there’s still vigilant defenders of Musk and Tesla is hilarious. You owe them nothing, but here you all are making it your life mission to defend their honors. \n\nIf you care about something, I’ve learned it’s better to be critical of it than praise everything that comes from it no matter how ugly.",

"comment": "FWIW the base AAOS implementation in Polestar rivals Tesla's infotainment too. Might not have fart sound apps but for navigation, different forms of media playing, voice control etc it's great and the rendering of the navigation in the driver's display is basically something I never want to do without. It has its quirks but the infotainment is one thing keeping me in a Polestar instead of considering other cars with at least nominally better range, charging rates, etc\n\nAnd if those default apps are insufficient an Apple user can now use CarPlay.",

Your comment about SK was spot on, and when I read it I thought \"right!\" and that is what then led me to join you in revisiting the question of \"which company manufactures which battery pack?\" I agree the SK Innovation folx worked hard to replicate the LG Chem cell design, but I guess there may be some(?) comfort that the cells inside the F-150 battery pack are literally not the same ones, from the same factory line, as those in the Mach-e. The rare tiny factory errors (by what are required to be insanely precise robots) in production of LG battery cells at both the South Korea and Holland MI LG battery plants were what created fires in about 20(?) of the 140k Chevy Bolt EVs. And I believe maybe 30% of them have successfully had their entire battery replaced as of today, with 2+ more years until they get all 100% done.",

"comment": "> Mercedes is talking about 750 km WLTP and \"~120\" Wh/km. That would mean 90 kWh usable energy. It's not about a bigger battery, it's about efficiency. The Q6 is at 95 kWh and 625 km WLTP max, which is a consumption of 152 Wh/km. Efficiency also means driving further with the same charged energy. So if both charge at 270 kW the Mercedes gets 26% more range per minute! We will see how close the values are for the SUV version of the Mercedes, the communicated values probably are for the small and low CLA.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head with your last statement. You can't compare numbers for a compact luxury sedan and a midsize crossover. The crossover is heavier, larger in every dimension, and has much worse aerodynamics. For example, the i4 gets something like 30% better efficiency than the iX here, and there's a similar difference in dimensions. Plus, this is a concept and likely the actual specs won't be quite as good. \n\n> For a better comparison: the current (and not quite new) BMW iX3 has a WLTP range of 471 km max and 74 kWh usable, which is 157 Wh/km. Already close to the Q6. The latest press releases from BMW announce up to 25% better \"overall vehicle efficency\" for the Neue Klasse and 20% lower drag than the current comparable model of their lineup. The Q6 etron officially recharges up to 255 km in 10 minutes. BMW talks about 300. You don't communicate such values if you don't know you will meet them.\n\nYes, it's a slightly better comparison, but not great. Having a larger in every dimension car get 3% better efficiency is pretty good, it implies the architecture is a lot more efficient. The real problem here is that we have super unclear numbers for Mercedes and BMW because...they haven't actually given detailed specs, or even a name for the actual cars they are launching with these architectures. For example, the 300 km in 10 minutes claim, I can't even figure out if that is referring to the sedan or the suv. The sedan would make sense since as established before, sedans are much more efficient. \n\n> The Q6 will just not be efficient enough as soon as the competition is there\n\nI guess I just don't buy this. Maybe BMW and mercedes both blow it out of the water and their comparable products have 10% higher total efficiency. And yet, do customers actually care about that? Most customers won't really care about a 25 vs 28 mpg car if the price is better for one or the other,  or one has a feature they care about more. Right now there's a lot of incredibly inefficient EVs on sale and yet people buy them anyways. I personally think the actual efficiency will be within 5% when the actual cars are released, simply because we're running up against the limits of physics here. There's only so many fractions of a percent better efficiency you can get out of the motors, wiring, and controllers, and they will likely be using very similar batteries. And there's no magic bullet for aerodynamics either. \n\n> Why do you think that charging will be limited at 270 kW for the competition?\n\nOne of the articles on the mercedes mentioned it. But even the peak charging speed doesn't matter too much here, the actual curve matters. And since again, the other cars haven't even been *announced* yet, we have no idea what their curve will look like. On the other hand, audi has said exactly what the charging curve of the Q6 will be:\n> Audi says it doesn't have to throttle back from 270 kW until the state of charge increases past 40 percent, at which point it declines at a constant rate to 150 kW at 80 percent SoC.\n\nThat's an *excellent* charging curve for road trips.",

"comment": "That the quality of life of workers has anything to do with this is bs and your arguments are an oversimplification. These differences don't explain the price disparity.\n\nWhile it's true that U.S. labor costs are higher, the gap with China has been narrowing. China is no longer considered a low-cost labor market, as wages have risen significantly in recent years. Also labor costs make up only about 7% of the total cost of a vehicle. The difference in wages impacts only a fraction of the final price. Raw materials and components often have global pricing, these are similarly priced worldwide but U.S. automakers are locked into higher supply chain costs due to domestic policies. Companies like BYD are producing competitive, high-quality cars at lower prices not purely because of lower costs or wages but due to streamlined manufacturing processes, government subsidies for EVs, and a focus on cost-effective innovation. The US doesn't because of Lack of willingness to Reduce prices and lack of policies, attributing this to worker quality of life is misleading. The real issue lies in structural inefficiencies, corporate decisions, and protectionist policies.\n\nThe solution isn't simply to block imports or do just another tariff. Instead, the US should focus on innovation, improving supply chains, and rethinking how to compete globally",

I went with the 4th because they were the least pushy and they werent perfect, but seemed to be most intent on actually figuring out what i wanted.  they had an 'ev specialist' who was a young man who had borrowed the EVs for several weeks to live with them and really get to know them - he was very fun to chat with about the car I was test driving.  Still, the used EV place near me seems to be doing well - i think a lot of dealers still dont want to deal with used ones.",

Even the Republican controlled Supreme Court has challenged Republican backed policies in the past, and I believe they will follow the wording of the law when it comes to electric vehicle requirements since they are explicitly stated.\n\nLegacy automakers will definitely challenge any IRS actions backed by Trump that support preventing the usage of the EV tax credit because they won't survive without them unlike Tesla. Therefore, any of Trump's illegal actions like what you say he will do, will not be guaranteed to occur. I feel like people are being way too much gloom and doom with the electric car agenda now that Trump is president",

"comment": "It's NABCEP for roofers instead of (mostly wannabe) electricians. Which makes a world of sense. Looking at their photography, do you know what I see? \n\nElevated racking structures without concrete ballast.\n\nNABCEP guys often recommend solar arrays weighed down with concrete right atop the roof deck. This is a terrible idea in terms of safety and maintenance. All you need to know is how to competently perform roof penetrations to eliminate dead load from the roof, drastically improve fire safety, and distribute the live load exactly where it needs to go.\n\nBut NABCEP is (largely) an organization for solar guys who have just recently become electricians. This means they aren't roofers. This means they're scared to death of poking holes in roofs. This means they go for cheaper racking solutions which avoid poking holes in the roof. This means  they often glaze over structural and roofing issues.\n\nNot one question on the NABCEP test involves structural or roofing considerations, and yet it is used by many utilities as a pre-requisite to participate in subsidy programs. Shame on those utilities for promoting unsafe solar work practices!\n\nSolar is roof work. Solar is electrical work. Roof work should be performed by roofers. Electrical work should be performed by electricians. It's that simple.",

"comment": "SunPower employee here.  Because we fund the lease ourselves and manufacture the panels, the finance rate in our lease gets the cost per kWh close to our competitors price.  \n\nOn a pure cash purchase, we have the highest installed cost, and the $ gap widens between our competitors. Still, our financial stability, superior warranty (we pay your installer to replace anything and everything under warranty, absolutely no cost to you), low production degradation rate, 40 year limited life and customer service make us an awesome choice for a purchase where you are responsible for maintaining the systems production.  \n\nGood luck!",

We've done installations primarily in Los Angeles, CA and Salt Lake City, UT. Feel free to PM me with any questions you have, thanks.",

"comment": "Agreed.  People don't understand the difference between energy storage mechanisms.  Toyota engineers are *not stupid*.  GM also has a very active fuel cell program, as do many other major auto manufacturers.  Toyota is betting that the average consumer will not be willing to deal with the long charging times when their battery runs out.  Fuel cell vehicles will \"charge\" in about as much time as it takes to fill a gas tank, which is much more appealing to the average consumer.  The only problem, and it's a big one right now, is that there are so few hydrogen fueling stations.  That of course will change when fuel cell stacks actually become affordable.  There's a pilot program in Taiwan right now using refillable hydrogen canisters for lightweight motorcycle/scooter vehicles.  They're sold at convenience stores and gas stations, and just plug right in to the scooter.  The store refills the old canisters and the cycle repeats.  Use solar panels or wind energy to split water to make the hydrogen, and you have a very nice, perfectly green economy.",

And not near a customer base to support all those employees at sunrun.\n\nAnd yes never is a long time, but at current rates for batteries and solar compared to a grid tied system would always be upside down and wouldn't pay for itself.\n\n\n\nThere will be a time when solar and batteries drop to a price lower than grid but were a long way off from that right now especially in lop sided electricity use states like Nevada and Arizona.",

"comment": "I didnt claim only in the Bay area, I simply used that as an example of a place where housing values are very high, so the majority of properties are more apt to use premium materials. As I stated in my example, if your house is worth $500k, its not a huge problem to spend $50k on a roof. If your house is worth $200k, you might be thinking twice about spending $50k on a premium roof vs spending $20k on a metal roof or $10k on shingles. If you live in an even lower average area (average in my area is right around $100k) this isnt something you would see on pretty much any house. \n\nI think it is important to point that out. Saying that this might be the same price as a new roof even before considering the electricity is great for creating hype, but it isnt the type of roof that most people put on their house. If you read /r/Futurology and similar subs, people are *extremely* excited for this tech, and it is great! But, there is a huge caveat. This isnt going to be affordable for most people for many, many years (if ever). I live in a modest house, and solar breaks even for me. The Tesla Solar Roof probably wont ever make sense for me.",

Pickup a half dozen of these:\n\n[Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SO46KQ2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\nThis is more geared towards Android, it allegedly has a lightning interface but you are better off getting a strictly iPhone compatible set of Power Banks.  Don't go for max mAh, go for maximum portability.  If using solar is still your goal, you can get an efficient (not as portable solution) to charge a battery that in turn can be used to charge your army of Power Banks.  \n\nThe reason I bring this up is it seems much more logical to charge your phone at the maximum rate which seems to be a priority to you without having to carry bulky solar panels (in comparison to very portable power banks) AND without having to depend on your weather.  When your phone is dead, and your only way of recharging it is solar and it is raining out, you are S.O.L.  Much better to trickle charge your main battery, use said battery to then charge your power banks, and finally use your power banks to fast charge your phone whenever you need it.  By stocking a bevy of power banks you will never be without power.\n\nHere's my 10 minute drawing for you:\n[diagram](http://i.imgur.com/BXUUxHR.png)",

My bill is too low to reasonably consider going solar. \nI think the moment when you'll see mass adoption of solar roofs in Florida is when the system+installation costs bring the cost recovery to 10 years or less (as it is in California and especially Hawaii).\nThe only way I could have a payback of less than 10 years is if I bought a DIY solar kit.",

"comment": "I have noticed that the attitude surrounding the debate has taken on a counter-productive religious fervor. It's very frustrating to see the debate turn from inquiry into the facts to slinging insults and claiming that the debate is settled.\n\nAs far as feeling an urge to help people: We all share the same planet. We share a common interest in the planet neither cooking nor freezing. I don't have to care about you and you don't have to care about me for us to both care about the climate together.\n\nYour opinion is that greenhouse gas emissions won't spell disaster, and the planet might be a little bit nicer for it. Other people's opinions are that it's the end of the world.\n\nWell. Let's say I take it as 50/50.\n\nIf global warming is a good thing, then, for example, there's not much point in producing a bunch of CO2 scrubbers to take it out of the atmosphere. While a useful tech for space stations and the like, it would be a waste of money and resources to deploy worldwide. Why would I want to pay taxes for an unneeded boondoggle?\n\nIf global warming is the end of the world, then maybe we need to take more steps than expanding solar power and the like. Would bumping up cars' average MPG by 10 be enough, or would we have to radically transform society, living inside tents in our houses with the heat turned off because we can't afford the environmental price of burning fuel? I mean, if things were that bad, I'd want to know about it. In that case, while you might still decide to use your heater, it would be in your interest not to stop people from turning off their own.\n\nIf you're right, it's in your interest to convince people of that fact. If the people who think global warming is the end of the world are right, it's in your interest for them to convince people of that fact.\n\nIt's not really a moral question, like say abortion is. It's about finding and spreading the truth with the realization that, whatever the truth is, the more people who know it, the more people are going to act in their best interest on this topic, which will indirectly benefit oneself.\n\nI don't know what the truth is.",

Mentioned above.\n\n&gt;  If you respect the front-end design process, and use licensed contractors with long-standing relationships with the inspector, you can find more design flexibility than what most solar installers are used to experiencing.\n\nMost solar installers definitely do (and have to) use licensed contractors.   \n\nGetting an exception is one thing and can be done.  But it is done at the permit time not trying to get an inspector to ok something that is not to code and doesn't match the permit, and certainly not after the inspection.    The fact is it would have take little time or money to move these to vents in the attic closer to the ridge.  But now it is a code violation (plumbing code) and any future permits are at risk of finding it.",

"comment": "We eventually want to build a more efficient straw bale house on a different part of the property, but since that is more of a long-term goal, we’re thinking of renovating this place. I’m not sure what the R value of the insulation used in the exterior walls was, but it is only about 3 inches thick. We’re moving some interior walls around replacing wallboard anyway, so are going to upgrade that to R-21 or so. New, more efficient windows are also on the list. That should help. \n\nI purchased a house in the ‘90s that had an active solar water heater and I loved that thing. We’d bypass the traditional electric heater with an archaic series of valves that looked like it came right out of a 1950s WWII submarine movie. From April until November, we’d be on 100% solar heated water. I don’t have room for anything like it in this house, sadly. I thought of building a batch water heater for summertime use that could just be drained in the winter. \n\nI’m going to build solar thermal (air) heaters onto the south-facing windows this fall, which will help with heating costs in the daytime this winter.  I’ve only just started looking at solar ovens. Can’t decide if I want to try to build one, or buy one of the excellent models that are on the market. They’d be a lot easier to store and transport. \n\nSolar panels have come down in price, but yeah – still expensive. I’m planning on replacing my 220v appliances with propane. That will significantly reduce our reliance on electricity and make the solar power system much more affordable. I'd love to eventually play around with building a biodigester. \n\nAs to the transition to Vegan; day three - so far, so good. I may even manage to convince my wife to join me in this lifestyle change.",

If you don't have any of that, then the time to payback will by greater then the life of the device. Right now, I believe that only HI has the ROI to justify the purchase if ROI is something you care about.  \n\nThen again, life is not all about ROI.

But anyway...\n\nA south facing array, as is typically installed, with pure grid tied inverters, is a large gamble on nothing changing.  That's not one I'm willing to take, which is why I'm designing something rather substantially different for my home - a ground mounted array (partly because I don't have the roof area for the panels I want), facing east and west, with \"virtual tracking\" leading to dramatically increased morning/evening production, at the cost of mid-day production.  And grid down operating ability.  It will be less useful in terms of a net metering setup, but will be far more useful if net metering changes to a heavily dynamic time of use based metering, which I expect will happen, at least in some places.",

You need guile, duplicity the ability to be a bald faced liar and sociopath.  If you think you have these traits, then go for it. That's NOT a reflection on politicans, that's just what you need to succeed politically, that is however a reflection on VOTERS.  \n\n&gt;Iv'e just finished year 12 in Australia, a country with one of the highest CO2 emissions per capita in the world.\n\nThe Greens want to move Australia in the right direction (they don't have all the answers but they are a small step in the right direction), hell 1/2 their candidates are often PHD's ... yet their voter numbers are dropping, you essentially want to sell the same message to a completely unreceptive audience.  \n\nMy suggestion ? enrol to vote, encourage your friends to enrol, encourage them to Vote Green and live a low consumption, low emissions life.  That is after all what you need to transition to to make this work.  It's not just bullshit like solar panels on roofs, no plastic bags and banning straws.  So, when all your mates head off to Bali to help fuck the biosphere over, tell them why you can't go.\n\nWe can't come back from this, you can however try and minimise the impact on yourself and like minded friends by adding resilience to your life (do you know how to grow food or just order it at a Cafe and Afterpay it ?), not putting yourself in harms way geographically and being a role models for others your age.\n\nAll of that said, you will complety ignore what I said and 'go for it anyway'.  Politicians are part of the problem, not part of the answer.  They are their to protect the property rights of the well to do.\n\n*Everyone seeks to change the world, no one seeks to change themselves* -- Leo Tolstoy.",

The last full solar plus battery project I vetted had a wholesale price seven to ten times that of other grid-scale wholesale prices. This is with new tech as well.\n\n- Even at those prices, the system still required a full dormant fossil fuel backup system for periods of time with low insolation.\n\n- The required space to deploy enough intermittent renewables to be the primary energy source is vast. We are talking about thousands and thousands of square miles of land.\n\n- Not all areas have similar renewable resources. The American Southwest is great for solar, but solar panels deployed in parts of the American Northeast are cloudy enough that solar panels barely pay back their embodied carbon in their lifetimes, if at all. Similarly, a lot of the best wind sites are already built out.",

"comment": "Let's compare what we're talking about, shall we?\n\nI'm directly comparing Ioniq to Leaf, and in those models - yes, the Ioniq has more soft-touch plastics in places where the driver/passengers make contact. Alas, for whatever reason, Nissan doesn't (although the new Leaf is much better than the original series). Plus, if you want to compare centre consoles, especially displays, there's a huge difference there (at least the Leaf uses CarPlay), and don't get me started with the telescoping steering wheel...\n\nDon't get me wrong - I'm a fan and I prefer the design of the Leaf to the Ioniq (I HATE that split rear window and anyone over 5'10\" is going to get a headache in the back seats), but I'm not going to go all fanboy and ignore it's problems. I love the Leaf and I was ready to grab one this year, but 40kWh won't cut it for my driving. \n\n&gt; I suspect the new battery to add 5k - 8k to the price for 2019. So €33-37 k depending on trim level. It might be higher if they feel there is no real competition.\n\nThe Kona is supposedly shipping now and I expect VW to turn on the marketing machine full-blower in 2019 with the launch of the ID. They're suddenly going to have a lot of competition directly in their market segment. \n\nMy only last worry for Nissan is if they don't adopt CCS, which has been the long established European plug standard. That new Ionity consortium putting out high-speed chargers? CCS stations only. That's going to continue, and ultimately Chademo and Type 2 are going to be the new \"regular leaded\" gas pumps one day soon. I'd prefer both - I think they should replace the Type 2 with a CCS and keep the Chademo as the \"powerwall plug\" for home, and then it's compliant and the most compatible charging system in any car. Whether their engineers can pull that off is the big question in my mind.",

If they just do solar, you'll probably have a tough time convincing them. If they're a general electrical contractor, I'd imagine they will do it but you'll have to pay for it. \n\nWorst-case, you could line side tap for now and have Tesla reconfigure whe n you're ready for PWs, although they may charge more than a contractor.",

"comment": "The less optimal your installation space is and the more space-constrained it is, the more valuable panel efficiency becomes. So, it's certainly possible that a few % in efficiency is more valuable to you than it is to someone else with different installation conditions.\n\nBut in most cases, there are lots of panels that are almost as good as Sunpower at a fraction of the cost and the premium you pay for Sunpower's tech does not pencil out for the minimal bump in production gain. You're usually better off just installing a smaller system.\n\nAgain, that's from a purely financial ROI perspective. There are lots of other reasons you might want something suboptimal financially.",

"comment": "I'm very confused about the information out there for solar, so I have questions and any help is appreciated:\n\nI am usually pretty good about looking things up and researching. However, Solar has my head spinning for a few reasons.\nFirst, there is Net Metering and whether it will still be a thing which takes me to...\nSecond, battery back-up. IS it worth it, does it fully negate Net Metering benefits and what do you realistically need to ride out a storm-caused outage that might last days (hurricanes)? Basically keeping Fridge, AC and basic things running. (we have natural gas for water-heating and cooking)\nFinally, how do these things work best together? My idea was that I get a Battery like a PowerWall from Tesla, get Solar Panels on the roof and use it to power the house during the day, battery at night if possible and battery for outages. ROI is good, but paying less and generating clean energy is the goal along with all that above.\n*Note: Would be a loan for Panels and Battery.\n\n\nI have seen different answers, and also 2016 posts saying \"Net Metering won't be a thing next year...\" while 2019 posts say the same thing. That's what has me confused.\n\n\nApologies if I somehow missed this info, but I got good information and conflicting information across different posts/sources/etc. Half the \"Solar\" websites out there appear to be run by Solar outfits just looking to get you to buy from them, so I don't know if I can trust their information.",

There's a lot of thermal energy on roofs, so I don't know what you're referring to.\n\nI'm not worried about installers. An integrated whole-roof system of the sort I outlined wouldn't be installed by installers – it would be built into the roof at the factory. I'd put PV panels over it. I'm also interested in designing some snap-in panel interfaces that would almost eliminate the average PV install cost, so I could prototype that too.",

"comment": "Thanks for the link.  It looks like the concept is that a smaller inverter may ramp-up faster in the morning and last longer into the evening, but it's not very specific as to how much quicker it will ramp up or why.  \n\nI find this fascinating and also frustrating.  When I look at the SolarEdge inverters, I notice that the smaller ones have a nominal input voltage of 380 volts vs 400 volts for the larger ones.  The break seems to be between 6 kW and 7.6 kW.  [https://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/se-hd-wave-single-phase-inverter-with-setapp-datasheet-na.pdf](https://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/se-hd-wave-single-phase-inverter-with-setapp-datasheet-na.pdf)\n\nIt would seem to make sense that the solar panels would produce 380 volts before they start producing 400 volts in the morning, right?  But is that how this really works?  I thought each solar panel only puts out around 12-17 volts and then that voltage gets stepped up.  \n\nAlso, the inverters between 7.6 kW and 11.4 kW all have the same nominal voltage so does that mean there is no advantage to stepping down to a smaller one.  \n\nAt the end of the day, I don't understand this very well and have more questions than answers.",

"comment": "I had a Sunrun salesman try to pull that crap on me, too. I already have panels covering all of my south-facing roof area. He wanted me to add more on the north side.\n\nHe tried to ply me with some bullshit about the panels coming from Canada, so they can magically run off of the sky. I told him the sky is only 0.07 of a Sun, no matter whose modules you use, and that he was making no sense. (*Any* module can run off of the sky. But you'll only get about 7% of rated power.)\n\nI found out later how the scam works. It costs Sunrun exactly zero dollars to install solar. They take installation subsidies and tax credits based not on how much the installation actually produces, but on its *theoretical* production if sited properly. They can literally mount an array *anywhere,* facing any direction, and the subsidies are the same. Any electrical production is gravy.\n\nNever trust salesmen. They will say *anything.*",

"comment": "Honestly my company is certified installers for both sunpower and REC. They are pretty much the only two brands we sell (some LGs from time to time). We only really do the 325 and 380 split cell RECs where sunpower I think we do E series. Honestly I love both but sunpower by far has some of the best hardware in the industry in terms of the panel frames and cells. However their software sucks. Recs paired with IQ7s is our sweet spot right now. I've probably done around 30+ installs of just that since last summer. Price point is great for us since we buy bulk and the new enphase equipment is a godsend for speed and ease of install. People rarely ever opt for the sunpower systems anymore unless they want the \"premium\" tier in which case it's as you said. Similar stats for more money. Honestly if sunpower would splurge and make a split cell panel with their cell technology it would be amazing.",

Meaning the voltage of all the solar panels you want to connect to the CC. Wiring PV panels in series will increase the voltage output of the array. Your supposed to use the Voc output of the PV panels, and adjust it up for the coldest temperature they'll be exposed to. \n\n3) Can the CC accept the current output of your PV array?

"comment": "[Source on wind power being more than forecast ](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/texas-power-grid-crumples-under-the-cold/)\n\n&gt; a chart at ERCOT indicates that wind is producing significantly more than forecast.\n\n&gt; So while having Texas' full wind-generating capacity online would help, the problems with meeting demand appear to lie elsewhere. An ERCOT director told Bloomberg that problems were widespread across generating sources, including coal, natural gas, and even nuclear plants.\n\nand it has a picture of the chart. Wind turbines (and to a lesser extent solar panels) are used in countries where similar levels of cold are typical, and they work just fine. If they are designed/maintained to handle this sort of weather they are good choices.\n\nThe first article I linked clearly said that the primary cause of power outages was a reduction in gas power production. That’s a clear unambiguous statement, and what do you mean how much of the state lost power due to gas and how much to wind? The whole state is on a unified grid, you don’t only consume power generated locally to you. Clearly the vast majority of the problem is insufficient winterisation of fossil fuel and nuclear power generation.",

"comment": "Some TIL takeaways.  Carribean islands all have crazy high, highest in world by large margin, energy per capital rates.  Caymen Islands consume almost 11mwh/capita in electricity.  As one of the highest, it surprises me that there aren't regions that spend more than 35kwh/day including commerce and industry, and hvac.  Sourcing for compiling these stats has to be either completely baseless due to every country's standards/PR goals being uncomparable, or is based on exhaustive/herculian research and corrections that need bother with any editorial/compiling slants that had to be applied.\n\nWhether or not Caymen Islands data is accurate as one of the highest electricity/capita consumers, it gets nearly all its electricity from oil.  By far the most expensive electricity source.  The opportunites for solar there/rest of carribean who also have super high consumption and oil generation dependence, make for the best \"organic solar opportunties\".  Massive energy cost savings, and high employment of locals, would make someone in the country see political fortune from adopting policies/partnerships.\n\nWind is used to make up a significant portion of \"base electricity needs\" in several countries.  Solar is not, anywhere.  Maybe rooftop solar is too difficult or not counted.",

"comment": "Isn't hydrogen extremely inefficient? A ratio of 5:1 input to output is not particularly eco-friendly. On top comes the huge infrastructure costs. An electric grid would only cost once and it's not that expensive (perhaps 5 million per km), while the number of ships is fairly low compared to the volume transported by them.\n\nIf you think of the Suez Canal, it could be equipped with solar panels left and right with the electricity going directly into the drive trains for the tugs (or trains pulling the ships from land). Meanwhile the solar panels would provide protection against side winds which caused this huge accident last year.\n\nIt's the same with other waterways: During the day or when there's a lot of wind, the electricity could be directly used for propulsion. There would be no need for storage, while excess electricity would be used in a meaningful way, which stabilizes the net.\n\nIn case there's no wind or sun, the normal engines could be used. But that would likely be more expensive, than just waiting for a few hours.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nMy approach wouldn't need batteries, just overhead electric lines like it is done with trains.",

"comment": "I don’t but here’s my opinion.\n\nA Honda Eu2200 generator costs less, has triple the power, requires an oil change once a year or two and my older unit is still going strong after 25 years. At room temperature it starts on the first pull, it can produce power day or night, it sips fuel and is relatively quiet (though louder than solar).\n\nI personally don’t have a use for a solar generator since I have plenty of solar power at my offgrid cabin. The Honda is for long periods of bad solar conditions.",

This is why the solar purchase agreement with the power company is so important for residential solar - that 200 that you sent out should give you some credit that will reduce what you pay for power sent to you by the power company in the future. Check your bill - you imported 500kWh, but how much did you pay for? What happened to that 200kWh that you exported? The details of your net metering agreement governs how your exported power is valued.\n\nWith residential solar, you benefit from the internal solar power consumption, and from the value of the exported power sent to the power company.",

The article doesn't mention Sunnova but you just decided that they own 99% of the market with SunRun(you made up that 99%, that's just not true) and just decided to add Sunnova in the title of your post even though they are not at all mentioned.and again, the article isn't saying the feds are investigating either of these companies in the article (they probably are, but it's just not what the article says).\n\nI think it's cool you're attacking SunRun and Sunnova, I don't love these companies museld, but you gotta do it in a way that isn't manipulative or dishonest. There's plenty of verifiably crappy practices that you can pin on them, you don't have to make inaccurate or click bait reddit posts.",

It wouldn't surprise me if you were more likely to trigger an audit if the cost per watt was higher, or for very large system sizes. \n\nIf I am audited, I'm not really concerned. I took standard deduction plus EV Credit and Solar Credit.  EV credit is easy to prove (as they should already have a matching report from the dealer I bought from), and the solar installer left me with a small binder of documentation on my system, including contract, paid invoice, materials list, warranties, and other useful documentation.  And the invoice price exactly matches what I claimed on my taxes, no trying to sneak in reroof costs or anything...",

The only thing that ever changed anything was getting a couple tubular skylights added and that's only during hard rain that's also hitting windows anyway.  I have two systems, one is SolarEdge which I've never heard make a sound and the other is a Fronius which has fans going and the occasional relay click as its power capacity scales up and down based upon need, but it's in the garage anyway.\n\nThe \"noisiest\" things are the Powerwalls.  I can kinda hear them if they're doing something, but they're also bolted to the exterior of my bedroom.  If they're on pure backup standby then they're perfectly silent.  If not then the air conditioners are absolutely far, far more noticeable, even then one that's an inverter-driven variable speed.",

"comment": "Is there any battery included? It's good to understand if you want this to be a backup in case of a power outage you can only do that if you have a battery backup. If you don't have a battery and the grid goes out, the solar panels stop producing power to avoid sending power back to the grid and hurt the line workers working on restoring power.\nAlso, I would recommend you check on solar buy back with local power providers. Here in Texas there are various options for selling excess solar production to the grid, usually for Texas selling back as a credit is the best for me. \nYou mentioned Maine has incentives so in addition to the federal credits you may want to ask on any state or city incentives as well.\nWhen looking at 103% of your current usage don't forget to think about future things you may to need to include, electric vehicle, induction stove, etc... I wish I had included that in my consider when getting my solar system.",

I maintain still that it is absolutely fine to judge actions and that who performs them does not make them any better or worse. I am absolutely not exempt from that and I appreciate your honesty in all of this, as well as the fact that you have been, imho, very respectful in what is obviously a very sensitive subject that we disagree on.  \n\nI'm not sure that it is inconsistency, per se. Most people I've found have a \"survival\" clause when it comes to rights. Perhaps that is inconsistent, but if it is then it is very common and I do think understandable and moreover excusable. It is certainly consistent with veganism itself which does ask for only as much as \"possible and practicable\" -- though I guess we can argue \"practicable\". \n\nI really do hope that I can find a way to safely feed my cats a vegan diet. I've been looking into it over the past few months, and though I approach it with a hopeful heart I am just not convinced that for these specific animals it wouldn't be a risk too great for me to take given my current knowledge and resources. Things would certainly be easier in some ways if I did not have the cats, and I honestly don't know whether I would adopt more cats now that I'm vegan. But knowing them like I do, and being so emotionally attached, I simply cannot say that I would rather that they had been killed.",

"comment": "The deaths of these defenseless children of Norway saddens me beyond belief, and the death of defenseless animals saddens me as well. I hate to say this because I never wanted to be that vegan, but in a way he is right. Its a cultural thing, as in it is sacrilegious to kill a cow in India. People who don't agree with him don't see how a dog, cat, cow, chicken, or pig are defenseless animals who do not deserve what happens to them. Different cultures hold different standards of what animals they are allowed to kill for their pleasure. Once people stop this cognitive dissonance on what animals are acceptable to kill and realize there's hardly a difference between these animals, they will hopefully become more compassionate to our furry friends. \n\nTldr, In no way do I see him as being disrespectful to the deaths of the people in Norway. He realizes how animals are being killed and are not able to defend themselves just like the tragedy in Norway.",

There are some others but their names escape me.\n\nFor mayonaise there is Veganese. I hear Just Mayo is good too.\n\nFor eggs you can use tofu, like this: http://tryveg.com/breakfast#scramble\n\nAlso, there is a newish product called The Vegg which mimics egg yolk: http://thevegg.com/\n\nIf you're thinking about eggs as a binding agent (for cooking) you can use things like apple sauce or banana.

"comment": "Well it is expensive and capitalism only partly comes into play as animal agriculture is [very subsidized](http://www.care2.com/causes/the-true-cost-of-meat-demystifying-agricultural-subsidies.html). The real cost would be much higher.  And it isn't simply the economics of it that is impractical it's the resource inefficiency. Check out this [map](http://i.imgur.com/BEXgTZR.png) from National Geographic showing how land is used overwhelming to produce feed and fuel rather than food.Take a look at this [cool graphic](http://www.angelamorelli.com/water/) that goes through the amount of water it consumes. And here's a useful [infographic](https://arbtech.co.uk/can-vegetarianism-save-planet-infographic/) that also discusses the green house gas emissions and land use.\n\nBut as far as plant based diet it can be crazy cheap. Look around the world to the poorest places and you'll find them eating mostly plants. Of course you can buy all kinds of gourmet vegan things and spend a fortune but you can do that with any diet. For me personally, I spend less now than before I went vegan.\n\nI suppose it might sound like I'm overselling the simple ease but it isn't like celiac disease at all. With that, as I understand, you've got to absolutely avoid any trace of wheat. But that's not like eating plants. To be vegan you just have to avoid that hamburger and get a veggie burger. That's all. I go to the store and buy food easily, skip the ones with animals and get the next. I don't have to worry if it accidentally touched an animal product because I'm not allergic and unlike wheat there is a ton of foods without animals in it.\n\nBut really if you don't think it's that simple I can't really prove it is other than state that it is for me. Perhaps if you slipped in a few vegetarian or vegan meals the next time you go shopping you'd see for yourself.\n\n There are tons of great recipes. I really like these two sites. The [Post Punk Kitchen](http://www.theppk.com/) and [Oh She Glows](http://ohsheglows.com/categories/recipes-2/). T[hug Kitchen](http://www.thugkitchen.com/recipes) also has some handy recipes.  Or just type in any type of food you like into google and add vegan, it really is that easy.\n\nI am a very practical person and when I realized I could impact the world by reducing my environmental impact and help to end unnecessary cruelty simply by shifting my diet, I did. I don't know of many other things that can have such an positive result for that amount of effort.",

"comment": "Hey! I just wanted to throw in my piece because I see it from both sides very clearly: I am about a month away from earning my license to be a Registered Dietitian, and I am also a strict vegan. I just want you to know that I totally understand it is frustrating to hear someone telling you that they want you to give up your beliefs, BUT dietitians at ED clinics are specifically trained to watch out for manipulative tactics. Although your motives for veganism are unrelated to your ED, they are going to THINK your strict diet is a gateway to your ED and assume you're trying to manipulate them into staying vegan so that you can hold onto your ED. And it is going to be very hard for them to believe you when you say otherwise, because I'm sure the majority of people they see with strict diets do so as a form of an ED. Have you talked to the psychologist at the clinic about why you are vegan? The dietitians work very closely with the psychologists, so that might be helpful. \n\nAll of that being said, if I were your dietitian I might have more of an open mind to you keeping your vegan lifestyle if you presented it differently. Their main goal is going to try and break the view that fat and carbs are the enemy, which is probably why they said you will need the animal protein for brain power. It's such a touchy subject for people with EDs -- they wouldn't want to come out and say, \"We want you to eat animal protein because it's higher in fat than plant proteins.\" They have to find a way around that until they can work with the patient to be less afraid of food. So, if I were you, I might tell the dietitian that although you want to keep your vegan lifestyle, you are very open to eating unhealthy vegan foods (oreos, cookies, chips, etc.) Only if that's true, of course. They're going to want to break your phobia of fat, so let them know you're willing to do that while also keeping your beliefs inline. I hope this helps you a little bit, and I hope nothing that I said was insensitive. Good luck to you xx",

We have a few vegan restaurants close by and a handful more within 30 min. Most other restaurants do not offer anything that a vegan would want to have as a meal. We have a few supermarkets that offer a variety of vegan groceries.\n\nI've had a tough experience being vegan. I feel like an outcast. While I still socialize, I avoid eating with people. I avoid discussions about my veganism because it always runs a risk of the conversation turning uncomfortable for someone. Initially I spoke out for veganism but quickly learned that it is exhausting, rarely rewarding, and brings feelings of resentment towards me (and I in turn start feeling resentful). Now I just donate money to Mercy For Animals and support their efforts in changing the world.",

"comment": "Okay, so things will be much easier for you than if you didn't! That's great news. I am not even observant anymore but doing it another way just doesn't feel right. \n\nOne thing that is really easy are different dips with matzah or matzah crackers. For us, pesach is the holiday of dips. Guacamole, muhamara with matzah meal instead of bread crumbs, olive dip (a can of olives blended with mayo- which I guess wouldn't work if you eat only things with a KLP hechsher, but if not, id go crazy with the vegan mayo), salsa, [nacho cheese dip ](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/02/gooey-vegan-nacho-cheese-sauce-recipe-food-lab.html) (I always add a can of black beans and rotel), salsa verde, charoset for a sweet dip or spread all week long. \n\nFor something to replace bread instead of matzah, you could do corn tortillas, grits, polenta, or the like. Do you eat rice during pesach? You could do a lot of things with that. I don't, so I do lots of mashed potatoes. \n\nFor more traditional things: Matzah ball soup. I've never tried any of the recipes out there so I can't recommend one. I did make a really nice gefilte fish made with potato and parsnip. It was great with a little horseradish sauce. I never made it again because the family didn't eat it, but I loved it. Let me know if you want the recipe. Tzimmes, latkes with apple sauce , French fries, mock liver pate, borsch, cholent. \n\nLess traditional: chili like the two vegan ones from serious eats. Indian food would work, and serve with rice or matzah. \n\nLots of wine for the Seder. The goal, for me, is to be drunker than eliyahu. \n\nLet me know if you want recipes.",

You've already done that with the ranking but I'd use colors. Graphs. Big pointy arrows.\n\nAlso I'd contrast it a little with the deficiencies omnivores have to deal with (e.g. vitamin C, fiber) just to show that an optimal diet isn't trivially easy with meat-based diets as well.",

"comment": "\"Eating a plant based diet doesn't automatically make one a vegan, but eating a plant based diet is a direct consequence of adopting the philosophy of veganism\" -- I like that! There is definitely a difference depending on people's reasons for eating plant based. You might then actually not call someone a vegan who eats plant based solely for their health -- as in if meat was better for their health that is what they would be eating, so they would not really be part of the vegan philosophy. \n\nAnd yes the core philosophy doesn't rely on those points that affect humans, but in other approaches they can be more than just \"I want to be healthy\" -- I think there's a Kantian argument for veganism out there in a similar style, with the argument that we have a certain duty to our own well being and the future / well being of all humans, where then those points would be relevant philosophically too.",

I'm sorry that you haven't found once you love yet, but I promise that there are great once out there. \nOne thing to think about though is this; what do you value more, taste or life?\nIs the 10 minutes of pleasure really worth taking the life of an animal for? For me, the answer is no. I'd rather have a burger that I give a 8/10 that involves no animal being killed than a burger that's 10/10 that a cow had to die for.\n\nI understand that it's not the same, but there is a lot of harm in the milk industry. https://youtu.be/UcN7SGGoCNI in this video it is in 5 minutes explained, if you'd be willing to know why I personally choose plant milks instead.\n\nAlso, barely anyone goes vegan overnight. I first was a pescatarian, then vegetarian, and then slowly more and more vegan. This way, you'll see how easy it actually is.\nAnd we can find all of the nutrients we need in plant based foods. The #1 killer in the world is heart disease, caused by a diet rich in animal based products which are full of cholesterol and saturated fat. Research has shown that a (whole foods) plant based diet is an extremely healthy diet. So no need to worry about that, you'll only do good to your body.",

"comment": "I think it should be pointed out that subjects like pet food, carnivores (in or \"outside\" of nature), and pet ownership are some of the most contentious within all of veganism, and there are a lot of different opinions.  Some vegans think that pet ownership isn't vegan (it encourages commodification of animals, it makes opportunities for animal abuse more likely, etc.) but many do (people can provide better lives overall for them than they would've had otherwise and the \"pros\" outweigh the \"cons\", animals can be adopted rather than bought in ways that don't create incentive for breeding, etc).  Personally I believe that having pets (if well cared for and adopted, rather than bought) is generally better for animals than it is worse.  It might be one of the few ways in which humans are positively interacting with animals that begins to recognize their individuality (so many other kinds of interactions don't), and I also think it's possible that pets could be a starting point for getting us to shift our thinking towards one of responsibility and stewardship for animals rather than ownership of them.  Some believe that having carnivorous pets isn't ethical (are not \"more superior than all the animals killed in order for them to survive\") and some believe they are (carnivores have different biological needs, don't face the same choices many humans do).  Etc. \n\nCarnivores technically do not require meat specifically, what they require (like any other organism) is complete nutrition in a way that is digestible to them (in this example, it would be the nutrition found within meat, but that does not have to be the same thing as meat itself).  If you would like to learn more about the risks or benefits of vegan pet food for cats, see https://www.reddit.com/r/veganpets/wiki/faq.",

Doing street activism teaches you techniques to turn people vegan.\n\nThirdly: I have the same struggles with my meat eater GF. Things got better after i talked straight to her. I told her that it breaks my heart constantly seeing the person i love abuse animals and that i am not sure if i can be happy this way. Hold her accountable and watch dominion 😉 You may not have a gf if she doesn't really love you though.\n\nEdit: People will only change if they understand that they're part of the problem.",

These are all conflicts for vegans who decide to have children with non-vegans.\n\nAlso, you need to make sure he'll be supportive if your child trends low for growth. There was recently a post about a woman whose husband withdrew his permission for the child to be vegan because their child was lower weight. Big risk with an unsupportive parent, that he'll be looking for any excuse (weight gain, convenience, tradition, etc) to get you to change your mind.",

Just as most vegans would never tel someone living in a developing country to stop drinking milk, as they don’t have the luxury of being able to survive on a vegan diet. They aren’t harming animals unnecessarily, they are harming animals because they need to do so to survive.  \n  \nThe difference is that non vegans in developed countries absolutely have the resources to consume animal products.",

Build that foundation and hopefully they will be respectful of your choices and start to adapt. Meanwhile keep presence with an online vegan community esp in your general area or greater , even countrywide. Romance develops online too via those friendships and connections and you never know who you will meet and where life will take you. \n\nI’m excited for you. Really. xx",

I am one of \"those vegans\" and by the way, your title is pretty rude, and actually your whole passage, but I'll chat with out about this. \n\n1. Natural appetite - we don't see an animal and salivate or have hunting instincts as carnivorous animals do. You don't have a prey drive or see an animal as food until it's all cut and prepared. \n\n2. Our digestive tracts are long, like an herbivore. Carnivores have short ones, so that they can digest raw or rotting meat without getting sick. \n\n3. We don't have appropriate claws or teeth for hunting and ripping apart prey. Our teeth are for grinding. Our hands are for complex tasks. \n\n4. Flat faces - our flat faces would keep us from being able to bite into an animal. Think of going up to a cow and trying to bite it. Nope. Then you'll have the problem of not being able to rip through skin or crunch bone because our teeth are, again, not ideal for this sort of thing. \n\n5. All the many reasons meat is bad for human bodies. Carnivores have bodies that thrive on an all meat or mostly meat diet. We however, get heart disease and high cholesterol and cancer etc etc \n\nI'm sure there are more, that's all I can think of off the top of my head. \n\n\nI think we evolved to be able to eat meat as a means of survival, but without tools or fire we wouldn't be able to do that. Our bodies though, are not ideally suited to hunting or eating meat. I'm not a scientist but just common sense looking at a human, no I do not believe we are suited to eat meat.",

I try to moderate fairly on both sides and remind people against personal abuse and just generally being mean, but us mods don't catch everything. Some issues are especially touchy and we do get a lot of trolls so sometimes people are a bit short, but overall I think our community here enjoys a sincere discussion/debate when it is sincere and civil. So, you know, no \"I'll probably get downvotes for this, but hey dumbass vegans, why are you trying to kill your babies by not feeding them healthy?\" That...doesn't go over so well. But considering the thoughtfulness of your post here, I don't think that will be an issue ;)   \n\nAnd please consider using the flairs feature. If you're not vegan yourself, then \"Curious Omni\" is usually a good one because then people are reminded that there is a place for what some of us might see as \"dumb\" questions (we quickly forget how many of them we asked at one point ourselves). There's also \"Discussion\", or other flairs based on topics. I wish we could use multiple flairs, but just pick whichever is closest.",

"comment": "I don't know where you're getting any of your information. Bananas have a lot more than JUST histidine. Sure eating only bananas puts you short on a few aminos but not to the extent you're talking. Eating only bananas you'd hit histidine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, valine and almost isoleucine. No animal eats only one food. \n\nI'm vegan, but bias aside, you can eat small amounts of meat or fish during the week and be healthy. The amount people eat today is outrageous and unhealthy, not to mention terrible for the environment and cruel.",
