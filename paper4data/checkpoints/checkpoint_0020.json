Some Leaf owners have seen much greater than expected loss, but the number of people that have lost a large amount is small, less than 1% I think.\n\nAnyway I think the Leaf is the only EV that might be worth avoiding if you live somewhere that sees more than 25c for more than 2-3 months a year. Battery wear for the Leaf in the UK (where I live) seems virtually non existent. For example there are multiple people with about 40,000 miles that have only lost about 1% capacity. I'm leasing my LEAF for 3 years and expect virtually no loss by the time my lease expires, I would say 3% at the most since I do drive it quite hard :-D\n\nObviously there are many variables involved but I guess most EVs out there are still going to be working well after about 100,000 miles and that represents a large saving in fuel, even more if you expect the price of oil based fuels to keep increasing (as I do).\n\nI think the main benefit of leasing, one I didn't even think about at the time, is nothing to do with the batteries but general maintenance costs. Electric cars are very reliable BUT at the moment since they are low volume when they do go wrong the repair can be very expensive if you are out of warranty. Obviously most are still in warranty now but it could be very expensive to replace the charger for instance, I forget the exact amount but a four figure amount in £ for the Leaf I think.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.17904301713655477,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22460117624098075,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19248721524763795,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26092524646663673,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1300117973413255,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3748446424470056,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26215152069916314,"ev_1":-0.17416916218513556,"ev_2":-0.016028495940796954,"ev_3":-0.01938894084014464,"ev_4":-0.005493209833124031,"ev_5":-0.0067469054338289425,"ev_6":-0.11796798825501256},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

And they want at least that same range in a cold winter after 8 years of use,  then, assuming 30% capacity loss and 30% range loss in a cold winter, an EV would need an initial range of 60/(1-.30)/(1-.30) =  122 miles.

It appears I was wrong at least about the Federal tax credits.\n\nThe federal government allows you to deduct 30% of your solar power system costs off your federal taxes through an investment tax credit (ITC). If you do not expect to owe taxes this year, you can roll over your federal solar tax credit to the following year.\n\nSo you're right if you don't have enough income to have to pay any taxes then the credits wouldn't do you any good.  I would be surprised if someone with that low of income would be able to afford the cost of buying such a system.  For 2015 taxes that would be anything over $9,225/yr.\n\nApologize for getting that wrong.  It is a tax credit which means it reduces actual tax owed as opposed to tax deduction which means reduces income earned.  I believe tax rebates are the ones that will refund you regardless.\n\nYou can carry the tax credits over to the next year though so if don't use all of it in one year you can carry it over to the next.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.007845536960909763,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1818382719571855,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.0584053233181612,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2473325362091227,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23210473553340957,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19467182625046608,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1451545589855717,"ev_1":-0.23707613323028354,"ev_2":-0.23477034564976407,"ev_3":-0.03388246215763502,"ev_4":-0.003608626987746296,"ev_5":-0.0004507518218209346,"ev_6":-0.00040270829291936633},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

There are a ton of different solar technologies, each have different manufacturing processes, different logistics, different efficiency (i.e. differences in unit volume you need to get the same output). And that's after deciding PV, which is just one of various solar techs. And then these have to be looked at within a context. Where do you place it, what's the maintenance like, what's the solar capacity like at the installation site etc.\n\nAnd then you have a sense of how much electricity solar generates and what kind of manufacturing process was involved. But you still don't know how that compares to the US energy mix, and in what areas solar will be replacing parts of the energy mix. Are you using solar to replace coal for electricity, or natural gas? Or will you also replace oil use in transportation because cheap electricity makes electric vehicles extremely attractive? And if so, in what quantities, in what timeframe? Without knowing all of that you can't really say what your emissions savings are.\n\nIt's a bit like saying 'what if I take today's dinner, and replace one vegetable with a form of legumes, and exchange a form of meat with a form of fish, and exchange a pasta with a form of beans... what are the consequences to calories, vitamins etc'. It's totally impossible to say without narrowing that down to very specific ingredients and quantities and preparation methods. \n\nMore importantly, why are you asking if a vague answer is okay? If I said it's 5 tons per capita, or 15 tons, or 5 tons per xyz dollars invested, would that answer your question? I mean it feels like a meaningless answer where the only reaction is 'oh okay, that's a big number', unless you had a very specific reason to want to know the number. If you're wondering if it's 'worth it' with all the emissions in manufacturing panels and shipping them around the world, the answer is resoundingly yes.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0068132357361416025,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06183972205876671,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.13989016406491525,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.4024821894019147,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.42670928851571766,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18663564524041398,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13562600668228697,"ev_1":-0.17211577952326038,"ev_2":-0.21411436382428897,"ev_3":-0.011688114202115685,"ev_4":-0.2691149075787204,"ev_5":-0.11966452947429691,"ev_6":-0.07677081888496304},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Two questions:\n\n* Do you have a garage or parking space?\n* Are you allowed to install a 240V charger in that garage or parking space?\n\nIf the answer to both questions is yes, you should absolutely look into an EV. You should consider leasing rather than buying, since there are many excellent lease deals that allow you to take advantage of the $7500 tax credit discounted over the course of the lease rather than having to claim it on your taxes the year after you buy the EV. The lease will also allow you to ditch the car around the time we should start seeing those 200+ mile next gen EVs.\n \nIf you can't install a 240V charger, it may be possible to install a 120V wall plug and use that. However, you'll need to make sure that it's on a dedicated (or mostly dedicated) circuit, since you don't want to breaker to flip and keep you from charging in the middle of the night. Also, you'll only get around 5 miles of charge per hour of 120V charging, meaning it's going to need to be there for 12 hours to fully recover 60 miles. This isn't fatal, but it's much less convenient to own an electric car without a 240V charger.\n\nIf you don't have access at home to a 240V charger, two more questions:\n\n* Do you have a dedicated parking spot at work?\n* Will your work guarantee charging or ensure you're able to charge every day?\n\nIf the answer to both of those questions is yes, an EV may still be good option - although at-home charging is by far the most convenient way to own an EV, some people are able to fully charge at work at 240V and that does the trick. If you can charge both at home and at work with 120V, that might work too. But just 120V charging at work? I probably wouldn't do it.\n\nUltimately, if you can't charge at home, and charging at work is uncertain, I would recommend you stick with an ICE for now. Even in areas with the best public charging infrastructures, and even if your car supports fast level-3 charging, it is still awkward at best to coordinate charging on standard-range EVs.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010739605252941449,"1.1.1_stance":-0.33159982700713286,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11114037407823907,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14347103991775478,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06878882375394824,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2693690436171405,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22559355431648334,"ev_1":-0.022224597504343063,"ev_2":-0.054634214994924456,"ev_3":-0.011275858870552232,"ev_4":-0.270204540165478,"ev_5":-0.0025826623799124113,"ev_6":-0.11737814354758787},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

The app shows the stations as either supporting 10\\-20 mi/hr, or 20 mi/hr to differentiate them.\n\nEven hotels might consider time limiting L2 chargers for their guests if demand warrants. After all, 4 hours will give PHEVs a full charge, and most BEVs nearly a 50&amp;#37; boost.\n\nOne thing I have rarely seen is smart placement of L2 chargers. It seems they are typically installed in a place where 1\\-2 parking spaces are within range of the plug, making it necessary for the owner whose charge is complete to move before the next can use it. With a dual outlet tower, placing it on a island between 4 parking spaces would seem to be a better approach, enabling the waiting driver to begin as soon as the current one is complete.\n\nAnyways, your point about L2 EVSEs is spot on, but I would argue that the EVSE owner is either unaware of the tools that can make this work better, lacks modern equipment, uses the wrong network, or is not interested in being helpful.  Feedback is the key, if the owner poorly manages the EVSE, poor reviews will mold behavior.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16136535008748373,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2415325393722469,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3153454505140189,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20474992828738897,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26516639726300767,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24937194233579696,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10059848598514994,"ev_1":-0.12756029308796898,"ev_2":-0.11692263595371817,"ev_3":-0.14508224748780008,"ev_4":-0.1183706381976215,"ev_5":-0.045278403820702806,"ev_6":-0.08262803220212282},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

So another 7 years and double the mileage, I think it'll happen.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006727059711314117,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19334581768566475,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2325429134971509,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2922722225387891,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24511918252872392,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15430282798963427,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16349214162134254,"ev_1":-0.03575842300779186,"ev_2":-0.07672863247601133,"ev_3":-0.0035917891897649192,"ev_4":-0.00118202535668388,"ev_5":-0.002156315022148192,"ev_6":-0.2108104214697575},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

It has more room front to back by a few inches compared to the Fit and about 5 inches more back seat shoulder room. I've got a 7 year old in a front facing high back booster and a 10 year old. They fit comfortably with no problems. \n\nIf you'll have 3 kids back there and/or you'll be using public chargers to travel long distances the ID.4 or Mach-E are probably a better fit. They've got slightly more room, but probably not enough to make a difference. It's the faster DCFC charging on road trips that would be the biggest plus. \n\nThat said, traveling long distances with 3 kids in any of those cars sounds difficult. 3 kids across around town is do-able but for longer distances I'd really want a 3rd row seat if the kids are older. If you won't be driving long distances or won't still be driving this car when your kids are older/bigger the big advantage of the Bolt is price.  There are more discounts or incentives off MSRP compared to the others, especially on the leftover '21 models. \n\nIf you plan on having three kids eventually I'd test drive the vehicles people have been recommending, but consider leasing. There have been some good leases available and in 3 years you'll have a lot more EV options available.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007514577979842821,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3737901342033844,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18438679292200372,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2882966809009745,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29059819359319433,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1750402173046953,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1412754802343746,"ev_1":-0.1041277771825359,"ev_2":-0.29717487288033817,"ev_3":-0.006232122701476328,"ev_4":-0.005335272008475537,"ev_5":-0.012661530752666295,"ev_6":-0.07352526382116291},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

It's simply not how technology advancement + product design works anymore.\n\nIMO the biggest philosophic change in \"expandable\" solar array design is to decouple the battery bank from the solar array, by putting the battery bank on it's own inverter. This gives you a bit more flexibility in coupling a gas generator to the home + sizing the array for backfeeding. You are buying multiple inverters, but you can make up the cost difference with a smaller battery bank + lifecycle costs.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003792325927255054,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1813945876728269,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2456940168723658,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14080935468276343,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30116565680377505,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13922410431267107,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1414578250454118,"solar_1":-0.01395503620733507,"solar_2":-0.008763479820724266,"solar_3":-0.0473785694387819,"solar_4":-0.004541745722235646,"solar_5":-0.001021043826767709,"solar_6":-0.0004450221870987055,"solar_7":-0.00029605049348901957,"solar_8":-0.0010040217396939017,"solar_9":-0.0355972891508524,"solar_10":-0.014154159107420128},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

You can see my generation and consumption on this graph: http://pvoutput.org/intraday.jsp?id=31117&amp;sid=28507\nThere is one meter and power from the solar is used first in the home and extra is sent to the grid.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0022550206437396505,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18866874846438414,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.08563480153549108,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09268613408009212,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3080215503739762,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23057639189941218,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0482053165032994,"solar_1":-0.1454252759964826,"solar_2":-0.13201632399197538,"solar_3":-0.00036486374816983397,"solar_4":-0.010037476775930068,"solar_5":-0.0027990889369296688,"solar_6":-0.0007527685399206044,"solar_7":-0.0006460590775532182,"solar_8":-0.0008808083748590434,"solar_9":-0.08892052107967545,"solar_10":-0.0021281213048496284},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

In areas that are deregulated, energy generators cannot own transmission lines, and transmission entities cannot generate electricity.\n\nDeregulation was supposed to save consumers money, [but it did not.](http://www.texastribune.org/2015/08/12/report-deregulated-electric-utilities-narrowing-pr/)  \n\nBut back to the point, if I'm paying, say, 11 cents per kWh, some portion of that 11 cents goes to Oncor (the transmission line company) and the rest goes to the energy provider (Green Mountain or Reliant, or TXU, or Bounce, or whomever you choose to buy electricity from.)\n\nTexas does not have net metering, but there are a handful of companies that will buy back excess electricity.  They don't pay full retail rates.\n\nSo in TX, this problem is already eliminated in deregulated areas because there's two separate entities, and Oncor always gets their money to manage the grid, regardless of how much money I'm paying to the retail energy provider -- even when my bill is -$7.\n\nIn other words, if I get a bill for say, -$7 like my last bill was, that credit would have been larger than -$7 if I'd gotten the full value for the energy we provided to the grid.  The reason why it wasn't larger, is because Oncor is still getting their transmission and distribution money.\n\nI hope that part is clear?  Okay, now, let's think about what happens with net metering:\n\nInstead of two companies, only one company (in this case So Cal Edison) charges the 11 cents (or whatever) per kWh. I imagine So Cal Edison rates are probably closer to 15 cents?  I don't know because I always had LADWP.  I'm pretty sure it was about 15 cents.  \n\nSo, part of that 15 cents per kilowatt hour a consumer is charged goes to pay for the electricity generation.  Part of it goes to make sure the board of directors can maintain their summer homes in Aspen and their fleet of high-end luxury cars.  Part of it goes to maintaining the transmission lines.  And part of it goes to shareholder distributions, as in the case of investor-owned utilities like So Cal Edison.   \n\nWhile what happens in TX is more stark because there are two companies in the deregulation scheme, what happens with So Cal Edison is less stark, but still exists.  \n\nLet's say that a home in a So Cal Edison service area produces as much as it uses, and so truly has a $0 bill at the end of the year.  Is this a free loader effect?  Or is there a value to the energy that it produced that it provided to the grid that is greater than the nominal amount of money So Cal Edison paid for it?\n\nI keep hearing people whine about how there's going to be no one left to pay to maintain the grid.  Do you know what the dividend is on SoCalEdison stock?  **4.86%.**  They are making a ton of money, and they're not entitled to profits \"just because.\" \n\nI have no problem with paying consumer solar customers a wholesale price for electricity vs. retail -- but that's exactly where the free loader problem should end.  And that's probably the most equitable solution.\n\nUnless you can point to energy providers who are paying So Cal Edison to maintain transmission lines separately from what they're getting paid?\n\nAnd this is the more important point.  If So Cal Edision buys energy from a windfarm out near Palm Springs, at 5 cents a kWh, that's great.  But what are the line losses as its transmitted to Newport Beach where it gets used, compared to the line losses of the energy I generate when it goes next door into my neighbor's house?  And that's something that gets missed all the time in these discussions.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.08739429762742172,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10533789948233192,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21428571002643312,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3581890353307372,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18621722755220005,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20292650138219395,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.250600770313838,"solar_1":-0.24680726087116353,"solar_2":-0.20227135311660366,"solar_3":-0.10831933803551894,"solar_4":-0.03712012220821701,"solar_5":-0.189589538325284,"solar_6":-0.13973057237672037,"solar_7":-0.04183378817920769,"solar_8":-0.19017404292268716,"solar_9":-0.015426141687548522,"solar_10":-0.12280909099568174},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

We all know that a larger BMI is unhealthy.  Science and observations over time show us the facts.  \n\n\nBut the fact we are at 400 ppm with co2 right now (the highest in recorded history) and we see no ill effects from it does not warrant the alarm we are getting.  \n\nBut at 400 ppm, we are showing benefits right now.  Like other post on this sub, we are having bumper crops.  So using what facts we have, 400 ppm is doing good things to the earth.  Areas in the desert are greening, crops are overproducing, and the only bad thing (an not one study can prove it, but lets say they do some day) is the fact that over the past 100+ years we have heated up 1 degree.  Yep... 1 degree over a 100 year spread.. which science says was going to happen anyway as we were warming up at that rate before MAN MADE co2 was introduced.\n\n\nSo again, do you want to hamper plant growth, and tree foliage and back our co2 ppm to say 300 or even the deadly 200 ppm range?  Or are you ok with 400 ppm today?  Have you studied the effects of increased co2 on the human body say up to 800 ppm?  Do you know or would you consider that science says our bodies would welcome that range?\n\nMy point is this, we are spending trillions on an unproven science to correct something that we have very little effect on.  co2 is so small in the overall air that it's like pulling grass at the 1 yard line so that the rest of the football field isn't too green.  It's crazy, and it's all about profit.  You can't sell solar panels and wind mills to people that can get gas and oil cheaper.  \n\nGoogle any of the above if you care or review my past post for links and facts that back it all up.\n\n\nHawaii already produces less co2 per capita then Switzerland.  Is it because they are green?? Nope, it's because they have less co2 producing products.  They didn't cut anything back, they just live in a different area and live a different life style.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00024220546038122848,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2205384035342449,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18844234637174928,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22343826192046518,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20714685496751828,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.04109121238191923,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.020431323736071743,"solar_1":-0.3566686656655899,"solar_2":-0.18214106394753357,"solar_3":-0.014106945068003066,"solar_4":-0.00862433874378136,"solar_5":-0.00500415235486192,"solar_6":-0.0035273751952142143,"solar_7":-0.004138668499460134,"solar_8":-0.0021995021033944795,"solar_9":-0.056261846691389415,"solar_10":-0.012505351759803792},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

It probably would be better to just utilize pre-owned, unused government property and plop some panels down, and if that's not available then purchase new land. The benifet to a solar farm is it doesn't need to be on prime real estate, it just has to have direct line of sight to sunlight, so the property value would/could be low.  \n  \nThe cost of purchasing both land and installing the panels would probably be cheaper in itself, let alone the fact that repairs/ware and tare would be cheaper and substantially less respectively as well. Not to mention an issue with one of the infrastructures, either road or the solar panels, would require work that could potentially put the other temporarily out of commission in the same area.

We did the original 8kW and sized the conduit / breaker panel / interconnecting wiring to accomodate the expanded 4kW system. Corrogated metal roof is surprisingly easy to mount to (no flashing, no shingles). Material came from one single vendor, whom only sold to us because I am NABCEP and we had a material list in hand. Otherwise it would have been too small for this vendor to consider (According to their own policy). This was actually a very good thing, because we were able to purchase the panels out of \"obsolete\" inventory. Otherwise matching the solar panels would have been very expensive.\n\nOne thing I would do differently is also pull the cable up to the combiner box during the original install. Another would have been to plan the m215 micro-purchase way in advance. We bought at $98 each, but I have seen them at half-that in the past. \n\n\n\nI charged the client $0.25/W for ~10 hours of work. Essentially picking out 95% of the material, coordinating the design/material order, and traveling to site during inspection. He paid for everything upfront and self-installed, estimating about $0.15/W for subcontracted day labor. Other than one internal cable pull of ROMEX, this was as easy of an installation surface as possible.\n\nNo lift equipment on this one.\n\nI've done this model before using a mainstream general electrical contractor for the labor and permit and had it come between $0.35-$45/W depending on project size.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00011784323093403752,"1.1.1_stance":-0.30173196857822404,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23575438559055328,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09253300974766414,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.0695745183544278,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2275015031468636,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06800159842775126,"solar_1":-0.13239231186162215,"solar_2":-0.04135931242853985,"solar_3":-0.0027968739062392465,"solar_4":-0.005999263340830415,"solar_5":-0.001855060335098339,"solar_6":-0.0030334695911733434,"solar_7":-0.0017650064570868078,"solar_8":-0.004101546792905235,"solar_9":-0.20538574422122716,"solar_10":-0.00202301777608227},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Especially if the prices are the same. Sunpower should realistically be 3.70-4.10 per watt, Tesla should be about 3.20 maybe 3.30. With sunpower you are getting ac modules which have micro inverters and a full 25 year warranty. You won’t get that with Tesla. As I mentioned in a previous post, most likely Tesla solar isn’t around all that much longer. Sunpower has been solid for 32 years. Which Sunpower installer did you meet with? The aesthetics of a Sunpower system vs Tesla is night and day as well. You can choose between string inverters with optimizers and a bunch of conduit running across your roof and racking sticking out from the ends,  but you get a pretty skirt that will fade in two years (Tesla) or you can get a Sunpower equinox system with invisible racking, micro inverters, and wiring that is hidden in your attic and run down a chase if you have in your wall, not to mention a bumper to bumper 25 year warranty with full replacement even in year 24/25 vs a prorated warranty and only a 10-15 yr warranty on the inverter.  It to be harsh but you’d be a fool to go with Tesla in this instance.  Normally you’d be paying a .50/watt premium for sunpower, I’m not sure how you managed to get them down to that price. If you are paying 3.50 for sunpower I wouldn’t pay more than 3/watt for Tesla and even then I still wouldn’t go with them. A simple web search will show you that sunpower panels are incomparable to any other panel, even lg or Panasonic, so why would you pay an equivalent price? Does that price include a power wall?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1836344059986459,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18311537940740485,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23670980354077395,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22205069349661477,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38807421826329247,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.049180601607076824,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.016619022644590586,"solar_1":-0.22312080857118466,"solar_2":-0.1476231645579141,"solar_3":-0.25447018786379105,"solar_4":-0.189066691506159,"solar_5":-0.2558496249257587,"solar_6":-0.21656220703384452,"solar_7":-0.2888305187225342,"solar_8":-0.15316077088937163,"solar_9":-0.0802207172086957,"solar_10":-0.21213916818671819},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

During cloudy days, you will need charging in every season, as the maximum cloudy day range you can self-charge is 11km in June.\n\nA d even under best-case sunny conditions, you'll need to charge extra from October to February to make that daily 20km journey.\n\nBased on their solar range chart and a very crude approximation, throughout the year the car will solar-charge between some ~2600km to ~8300km (average ~5800km), which at their given ~14kWh/100km should be something like 370-1160kWh (average 800kWh). The car has to be fully exposed to sunlight - no carports or garages.\n\nLet's consider the cost savings from this solar electricity. As a best-case scenario, let's consider Germany, where home energy prices can currently reach 0.29€/kWh. Let's also consider that to charge up the same range from an external source, you'll need to compensate charge losses of &gt;10%. Thus, let's say you displace on average 900kWh of external energy required.\n\nWith German energy pricing, this saves some 260€ per year. Over a 5-year period, this is 1300€.\n\nIf you live in a location with less sunshine than Munich, or have to park your car in a carport, garage, or near a tall enough structure to throw shadows on the side or even top solar panels, you'll lose a significant part of these savings.\n\nEven at the \"cloudy weather\" example of Munich, saving 370kWh at German prices - less than 110€ per year - sounds like a much different proposition. If you live in a different country with lower energy cost: further reduced savings. E.g. in the UK you're paying the equivalent of ~0.20€/kWh or less, thus the above savings are reduced by a third.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nSure, it's a neat trick, but at a cost of ~25k€ with the battery it's questionable whether a solar system with costly integration, which likely costs upward of 1000€ to incorporate in the car, is worth it compared to just reducing the cost of the car by that amount.\n\nFor house owners with own PV - which can produce solar electricity at less than 0.10€ per kWh - or PV+battery storage - which can produce electricity at up to ~0.20€ per kWh (but provide this electricity even if the car only returns after dusk) this special feature of the Sion is likely not worth it.\n\nThere may be some value for city dwellers who almost exclusively have to use roadside parking, as it reduces their trips to a charging station. Nevertheless, under the utmost maximum ideal operating conditions throughout the year, the system will likely *not* cover the whole driven distance and outside of summer the Sion is almost guaranteed to need charge stops nearly as frequently as an EV without a fancy solar system.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00030835962388664484,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0822647377348801,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21180757425224783,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16645976093908152,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2518339486126826,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18346075465281805,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.052651990205049515,"solar_1":-0.17759181222083498,"solar_2":-0.23760488301523405,"solar_3":-0.21248870555582317,"solar_4":-0.24858728408232902,"solar_5":-0.1608423689166898,"solar_6":-0.03757561465196583,"solar_7":-0.009968766187739675,"solar_8":-0.017592888253905887,"solar_9":-0.16454180559099088,"solar_10":-0.23209480007078048},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The basic conclusion is that li-ion batteries will be the most interesting storage technology for grid purposes in the future, whereas hydrogen only plays a role in long-term storage.\n\nThe paper projects cost estimates for energy storage technologies up to 2050, over a comprehensive list of 12 stationary applications like power system balancing, buy low/sell high, storage to compensate variable supply renewables (e.g. solar+storage) and seasonal/long-term storage.\n\nIt estimates that from 2025 li-ion battery storage will be them most cost competitive for applications requiring &lt;4 hour of storage (4 of 12 applications),\npumped hydro for 4-30 hours (4 of 12 applications), vanadium redux flow batteries for &lt;4 hour applications with higher discharge frequency (2 of 12), and hydrogen only for applications requiring &gt;10 days of storage (1 of 12, seasonal storage).\n\nThe trend only continues in favor of li-ion batteries, pushing pumped hydro and vanadium flux out of the picture. By 2030 li-ion batteries is the most cost competitive technology for almost all stationary applications (9 of 12), and by 2040 for &gt;14 hours storage (covering 10 of 12 applications). Once again, hydrogen is only interesting for the single application of seasonal storage.\n\nSome quotes:\n\n&gt; We find that LCOS will reduce by one-third to one-half by 2030 and 2050, respectively, across the modeled applications, with lithium ion likely to become most cost efficient for nearly all stationary applications from 2030. Investments in alternative technologies may prove futile unless significant performance improvements can retain competitiveness with lithium ion.\n\n&gt; Projected cost reductions for battery technologies limit the competitiveness of pumped hydro and compressed air. Battery technologies exhibit the highest probability of lowest LCOS in most applications beyond 2025. By 2030, lithium ion appears to be most cost efficient in most applications, in particular with &lt;4 h discharge and &lt;300 annual cycles such as power quality and black start.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0028182909275831967,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2635148803839171,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15212051033330454,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25084931512827374,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3011796223766266,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18619249112607905,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1856708721073422,"solar_1":-0.09512393959494148,"solar_2":-0.08621297387348419,"solar_3":-0.14932961204181083,"solar_4":-0.092852353984199,"solar_5":-0.008366724952793447,"solar_6":-0.002610795386014312,"solar_7":-0.003517431659323241,"solar_8":-0.010643226335863195,"solar_9":-0.13575274664132544,"solar_10":-0.07271724427603961},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed (The author's stance toward solar is not explicitly mentioned in the text.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

If you don't know this I would suggest getting a kill-a-watt or similar and to start measuring.  \n\nWill the shed have grid power available?  Will it be totally off grid?  Obviously solar would be the preferred way to power things but there's a big difference between sizing a system to keep a load powered 365 days a year and one to power a load on sunny days and use grid power on crappy days. If this is off grid 365 days a year, you'll need extra solar panels and battery capacity.  If you have power still you can have a battery charger or something kick in if the voltage gets low enough to keep things going.  \n\nHow well insulated is the shed?  Can you add more insulation to keep it warmer overnight so you don't need to run heat lamps?  Is it possible it's going to get too hot during the day? Will it also need AC? \n\nOnce you understand how much power you will need to have available, you can start to size a system, but without some more information it's too early to guess how big of a system you need.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00044344902562443167,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05971731424028803,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2347163051798576,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17697949754063855,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27939882225737417,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21978274918746077,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08520803759650637,"solar_1":-0.00595134111790685,"solar_2":-0.007445962760054196,"solar_3":-0.0029563075659098104,"solar_4":-0.009735429442419749,"solar_5":-0.003699667358887382,"solar_6":-0.004944726640436177,"solar_7":-0.00420631032223658,"solar_8":-0.003928311053944829,"solar_9":-0.03927076806576224,"solar_10":-0.09174203866859898},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

A 37% jump in residential solar projects to 5.8 GW was not enough to make up for this decline.\n\n&gt;The fall comes amid tougher U.S. trade measures taken against China in response to allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang, which by some estimates produces nearly half the world's supply of the polysilicon used in solar panels.\n\n&gt;Soon after issuing guidance in June on its implementation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began seizing imports of solar equipment from China.\n\n&gt;Importers are required to provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the components are not linked to forced labor in Xinjiang -- a complicated process that has held up many shipments.\n\n&gt;These barriers threaten to slow the transition to renewable energy that the Biden administration is trying to promote, industry leaders say.\n\n&gt;\"America's clean energy economy is being hindered by its own trade actions,\" Abigail Hopper, SEIA's chief executive, said in a statement. \"The solar and storage industry is acting decisively to build an ethical supply chain, but unnecessary supply bottlenecks and trade restrictions are preventing manufacturers from getting the equipment they need to invest in U.S. facilities.\n\n&gt;\"We cannot afford to waste time tinkering with trade laws as the climate threat looms,\" Hopper said.\n\n&gt;The problem could be compounded if Washington expands anti-dumping duties. The Commerce Department says that Chinese-made components are being assembled in Southeast Asia to circumvent these levies. Imposing higher tariffs on the Southeast Asian-assembled products could further discourage new installations.\n\n&gt;As part of an effort to promote renewable energy and reduce the American solar industry's reliance on China, the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August includes expanded tax breaks for companies that build solar manufacturing facilities in the U.S.\n\n&gt;Multiple European and American companies have announced plans since then to make solar modules in the country.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.03613265262295803,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14997025366444205,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26143352208274706,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19759539204339185,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20878580102437946,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16883242158054787,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19382536907990774,"solar_1":-0.16895615836256184,"solar_2":-0.17427381376077986,"solar_3":-0.20493933902561004,"solar_4":-0.07150280463611125,"solar_5":-0.008573177947255317,"solar_6":-0.005315941262476069,"solar_7":-0.003801563890495648,"solar_8":-0.002787662946502678,"solar_9":-0.06116283405208378,"solar_10":-0.06449038728169398},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

In some remote areas far from the utility grid, or where you're away from the eyes of inspectors, or in situations where you are very persuasive, you may be able to just do a fully off-grid solar project, but if you are asking permission, getting permits, etc, expect some concern and push-back because it's not the \"normal\" way and municipalities have some interest in homes meeting basic standard for plumbing and electrical services. \n\nThat said, if you have an existing home with a connection to the utility grid, there is no reason you can't add solar and battery storage program the software running the batteries to avoid any import / export to and from the grid, so you'd essentially disconnect without ever actually disconnecting anything. The think to understand it you probably need a lot more battery capacity than you'd think if you want to keep running your home like you do on grid power. That said, if you work to find the right balance between limiting energy use, and adding enough generation (PV) and storage (battery) capacity, you should be able to do it.\n\nThe question I have is, once you have that dialed in, if you could actually cancel your utility service and stop paying a bill. My guess is that you're not \"supposed\" to do this, but if, after some time of running the system and making sure you have it dialed in, you either just stopped paying your bill, or called to cancel service (maybe just tell them you are moving?) you could probably pull it off. \n\nAt a top level, I think I'd want to hear more about what your actual goals are here. If you are focused on eliminating most of the costs on your PG+E bill, you can probably do that without cancelling service, and can build a fairly robust system that can support your basic needs (again, probably with some changes in energy use) without drawing power from or exporting power to the utility grid. And, from the standpoint of costs alone, you probably don't even need or want to fully eliminate the use of grid power. You could allow the system to export and earn you credits at times when the batteries are full and you are making more power than you need on site, and could allow the system to pull in grid power, paid for with those credits, at times when you need the extra energy - e.g. to recharge batteries at night after a few rainy days with low generation. You'd still have a bill, and probably some customer charges, etc - I'm not 100% up to speed on the latest CA Net Metering regulations - but this would be one of those \"meet 90% of your goal\" approaches, with the remaining 10% being the most complicated and costly to attain.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23891131105605723,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19749167408128726,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19323999160068817,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17656488754992639,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2299000959426523,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23674137651333993,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08192782538632552,"solar_1":-0.2905701045786805,"solar_2":-0.12779627162656323,"solar_3":-0.2237649714514963,"solar_4":-0.04965242327879631,"solar_5":-0.02703580736973284,"solar_6":-0.032917302917970424,"solar_7":-0.03637418576060251,"solar_8":-0.037707376204346714,"solar_9":-0.02102457201635133,"solar_10":-0.13455551014481454},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Combine dry ingredients first, then add wet. Mix until it's all good and batter-like. Oil your favorite 9x13 dish (i use a pyrex one), pour your batter in and bake for 20-30 minutes or until a toothpick/fork comes out clean. \n\nThis recipe rocks, and has fooled many of my omnivore friends. It's also an excellent base to expand upon. You can add chocolate or carob chips if that's your preference. You can mix in nuts, but I prefer to put a layer of walnuts on top after pouring the batter but before baking. It's also fun to replace the vanilla extract with peppermint. \n\nThe other day, I replaced the \"1 cup oil\" with 2 mashed bananas. The resulting batter was a bit more dry than usual, so I splashed on some almond milk to help it along.

It helps to keep that in mind whenever you start to waver. Make sure you have heaps of vegan food on hand at any time, because you are most likely to \"give in\" when you are hungry and there is nothing vegan available where you are.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.09544907758633059,"1.1.1_stance":-0.059096017852425575,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2506075820494849,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0872773736094435,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20188984263565998,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.12741524539887905,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09049653634428978,"diet_1":-0.159871898843201,"diet_2":-0.008817802477892656,"diet_3":-0.2370607327276652,"diet_4":-0.150584051258615,"diet_5":-0.14131797526291387,"diet_6":-0.17637735496535437,"diet_8":-0.0008692279006936587,"diet_9":-0.0034957497070233026,"diet_10":-0.010525696124886963,"diet_11":-0.0038490380199315646,"diet_13":-0.1744567517901004,"diet_14":-0.17741718838384293,"diet_17":-0.005523092268655698},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

But now I'm repeating myself.\n\nThe reason I'm spending time pointing out fallacies is because they're so *common* amongst carnists. At some point I want vegans to be able to argue offensively as opposed to defensively, and this is one important tool. There's a reason atheists use it to argue against theistic positions, though I actually think it's not advisable. The best way to attack a theist position is to be very clear on the *definition of god*. I often say that theists' main issue is not an avoidance of the burden of proof but rather of the burden of *definition*. Then the argument becomes not whether there is a benevolent universal reason but whether said universal reason was responsible for freeing the Jews from Egypt.

The studies I've seen on the subject so far point to the omega-3:6 balance as a significant confounding factor (see [here](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/62/1/1.short)). Relative omega-3 shortages, which many vegans have, [are linked to depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19499625). Since a bad omega-3:6 ratio increases inflamation of the body this is thought to be the pathway by which too much omega-6 or too little omega-3 causes depression.

In some developed countries like the United States, 99% of this is \"factory farming\" which prioritizes money over animal welfare. This leads to untold cruelty that is common and legal including cutting off beaks, tails, teeth, horns, and testicles, ammonia burns &amp; sores from living in feces with concrete floors, cutting throats while conscious, and boiling alive. Most are artificially inseminated with catheters and rods. Some are confined to the point of claustrophobia and cannibalism. I view this as an atrocity.\n\nEnvironment. I view this as contributing towards a known apocalyptic phenomenon. Animals are among the top 3 causes of climate change. 15-20% of global emissions, 50%+ of annual deforestation, 50%+ of water use in some countries, and 70%+ of all usable land. It takes 10-25x the land to raise the same amount of calories of animals rather than plants. Responsible for oceans dead zones, loss of biodiversity, and over hunting of large predators. \n\nPublic health. I view this as contributing towards a known apocalyptic phenomenon. 75%+ of all antibiotics go to farmed animals. In crowded conditions this selects for the evolution of resistant pathogens, as seen in the 1918 flu and the 2009 swine flu. Packaged meat also regularly contains traces of feces which carry E. coli. Antibiotic resistance is regularly viewed as one of the greatest potential dangers to humankind.\n\nPersonal health. I view this as a nice thing to do for yourself. Vegan diets are naturally low in cholesterol, high in fiber, and reasonable in calories. A whole foods plant based (WFPB) diet is the only diet correlated with reversing heart disease. Large cross sectional studies also regularly show vegans as the healthiest sub-group, and multiple national nutrition organizations (UN, ADA, BDA, CDA) say a well planned vegan diet is healthy at any stage in life.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19028377284477452,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17744418757129357,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.08392235335545017,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24068051201447138,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32600835851894905,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.031515153241343796,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1541888571901192,"diet_1":-0.09944110688215346,"diet_2":-0.17930141570489333,"diet_3":-0.21599962002587883,"diet_4":-0.12773006585231306,"diet_5":-0.12682536994502888,"diet_6":-0.16412053788111938,"diet_8":-0.1737572547570243,"diet_9":-0.3264990218400878,"diet_10":-0.11035876747420162,"diet_11":-0.34446600921364734,"diet_13":-0.19068224358971575,"diet_14":-0.16396565046371006,"diet_17":-0.09742281766130872},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
