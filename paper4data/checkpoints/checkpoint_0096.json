"comment": "Yeah, the HOV lanes in Atlanta have become the Leaf lanes.  Usually see a handful of them in the Costco parking lot too, which may also be a sign of the demographics.\n\nI will probably get an EV before the end of the year.  I was waiting for more competition with the Leaf, but I can't afford a Tesla, don't really want a BMW i3, and the dang EV Soul is only launching in California.  Most of the other EV's are compliance cars only sold in California, which also sucks, considering Atlanta has become such a large EV market.\n\nAlso surprising is the number of Leafs I see in Atlanta without the Alternative Fuel Vehicle tags, which is a requirement to drive solo in the HOV lane legally.  I'm not sure if these folks just can't justify an extra $20 a year for the tag, or what the deal is.",

"comment": "Yeah, I do most of my Leaf charging off of 110. The cars will have their own chargers, so there's no hardware to deal with other than conduit, cable, and outlets. Just make sure you don't string them all up on one circuit. Mine draws about 11 amps so two cars on one 20a breaker would trip the circuit. The level 1 charging is maybe 15¢/hr which isn't really worth metering, but if you put in some Level 2 chargers, those you can get with cards and service that will recoup your expenses over time.",

"comment": "The European CCS connector is quite a bit smaller / more ergonomic than the US version. CHAdeMo is downright unwieldy, and doesn't have the same power capabilities that CCS does.\n\nI think CCS is the best and most adaptable standard overall. The reason why the Tesla connector is so small is because it only has to deal with DC; AC charging is accomplished with a converter in the cable. CCS is large because it has to accommodate both a 3-phase AC port with diagnostics and the two DC pins for fast charging. That means all cars can charge using the same AC connector, and those equipped with DC fast charging can additionally use connectors with the extra DC pins.",

Natural gas to electricity is listed as 39% efficient, where, in reality, a modern combined cycle power plant is around 60%.  \nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_cycle\n\nThis change brings EVs to a well-to-wheels of 51%.  That's way higher than everything else.  \n\nAdditionally, natural gas is not the entire grid.  Any renewable or nuclear power only tilts the argument further towards electric.\n\nAdditionally, browsing through the other links I see a lot of absurd numbers.  Things like a level 1 outlet costs $900.  Wtf?  Or comparing the current li-ion cost per kWhr to the cost of fuel cells under \"mass production\" (however many that is).  I have a very hard time believing that anyone can get a 100kW+ fuel cell for $3500. Things like this make me question the integrity of these sources really fast.\n\nHydrogen really only brings one advantage to the table, and that is fast (ish) refueling.  So, the question is: is this advantage worth the trade offs in cost, efficiency, fuel cost and infrastructure?",

It looks totally rad unfinished and not dyed, Puma is probably the most well known company on board with them. Im really crossing my fingers for some collaboration with Tesla on a car interior. If there's any brand that people will trust in regards to new concepts sustainability and eco-friendliness, its Tesla. If new Teslas had a standard Pinatex interior, i feel like more people would ooo and ahhh and be intrigued, as opposed to if like, hyundai or mazda started using Pinatex interiors, it kinda gives it a cheap and budgety connotation if initially associated with those kinds of brands. If vegan interiors became the new lux or norm, i'd be so freakin happy",

"comment": "&gt; Of course they don't. From the perspective of the solar homeowner, net metering is a great deal. \n\nI was talking of measuring the energy flow in two directions separately, with different price policies. I don't believe net metering is what I had in mind although it technically is a special (degraded) case of it.\n\n&gt; No, simply no. The problem with that approach is that it assumes that the cost of all electricity is equal, which, in a net metered situation, it isn't. \n\nThat doesn't really contradict what I said. Even as a utility, you don't *need* to assume that the cost of electricity of equal to opt for net metering, as I've noted, as long as there are sufficiently few solar installations using it, it may simply more convenient (e.g. less costly) for a large utility than adapting their antiquated accounting systems. It's fundamentally the same reason why Tesla made the superchargers free. Not because the electricity is free but because the opportunity cost was worse, *at least for the time being.* As the proportion of solar users rises, of course the balance between costs and benefits shifts and fuller accounting better capturing the actual expenses involved most likely becomes necessary. (But so will probably the issue of non-solar users paying their connection costs, so there you are.)",

We’ve already helped many folks get into new electric cars.\n\n&gt;You expressed interest in the all-new Chevrolet Bolt. Here’s an important and exciting update on how you can get a great all-electric car:\n\n&gt;The very first Bolts were sold last week in California. Because California has a zero-emission vehicle mandate, it gets most of the attention from EV carmakers. After California and Oregon, Massachusetts is one of the hottest markets for EVs, so the Bolt will be here soon. Dealers who sell lots of Chevy Volts will get the most Bolts; that is the case with the dealers in Drive Green with Mass Energy. We believe the dealers in our program will get more Bolts (and sooner) than other dealers in Massachusetts. We are now estimating mid-February for the arrival of Bolts in Massachusetts showrooms.\n\n&gt;Demand for the Bolt is going to exceed supply for a few months, so it will not be possible for everyone on our Bolt waiting list to get one for a while. We also do not expect big dealer discounts until supply catches up to demand. If you want to purchase a Bolt, the price will probably be very close the list price or MSRP of $37,500 for the LT trim and $41,780 for the Premier trim. Buyers of the Bolt will be able to receive a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 and a state rebate of $2,500. Leases will be available too, probably at about $300 per month.\n\nThere was more detail about how you might get into the queue. If anyone in MA is interested, I suggest you get on their mailing list for the updates and details.",

"comment": "ICE cars only manage to convert about 25% (and that's being generous) of the energy in gas to kinetic energy, and that doesn't even take into account the energy used to refine oil in the first place.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, large scale power plants are &gt;95% efficient, because utilities have to minimize waste and maximize production to maximize their profits. There are some losses in electric transmission, but usually &lt;5%. Electric motors/inverters within the car are usually ~90% depending on the design. So, an electric car is usually 80-90% efficient at converting power generated at a plant into kinetic energy. So, even if your home's energy is 100% coal, you still have a MUCH smaller carbon footprint than an ICE car.\n\n\nTo answer your question specifically, usually there isn't a limit in the amount of current sent to a home, so your car will be drawing more electricity, therefore you will see a slightly higher electricity bill depending on your miles driven and electricity rates. But I've heard that typical drivers don't see more than $20 extra dollars a month, and many don't even notice higher bills. Definitely much lower than your gas bill.\n\nSo in conclusion, compared to an ICE, an electric car uses less energy (because it is much much more efficient at converting energy to motion), has a lower operating cost (because it uses less energy), and has a lower carbon footprint.",

Expect the number of used EV’s for sale in Norway to increase over time. At the moment we’re experiencing about 24% new sales of EV’s compared to other fuel types. \n\nRemember to keep in mind that range drops in winter, many cars experience around 50% drop in range when temperatures go down to -5 to -10. \n\nAlso, the NEDC range is not realistic at all, if the car has been sold in the US you should look at the EPA range as that is much closer to reality. \n\nI did read that a lot of BMW i3’s have been sold with range extenders over here. That’s basically a small petrol engine that runs as a generator if it’s needed. Most have never used them according to BMW. I’d say it’s a different kind of hybrid, and still allows you to drive electric.",

"comment": "&gt;....but new tech is coming in every day. Making them more efficient and convenient to use.\n\nDoesn't matter. If you don't have *lots* of storage, even free solar panels won't meet your energy needs in the winter months. Solar is a great component for power generation for high insolation areas, but is insufficient on its own.\n\n&gt;Nuclear now...but what about down the line? Do you think in 10-20 years that will be the case?\n\nAbsolutely. I've done a good deal of research on energy and the R&amp;D into advanced nuclear is tremendous. Most of it is outside the U.S., though, which is a shame. In encourage you to read up on the development of molten salt reactors, especially thorium reactors, etc. China alone has 400 PhDs working on this tech. \n\nThe two big challenges with nuclear to date are:\n\n- Initial capital expenditure.\n\n- Nuclear waste. \n\nThe new designs for nuclear power plants are generally geared toward small, modular reactors. This allows construction of reactors on an assembly line and results in modules that can easily be shipped to the power plant site. This solves the first problem because of economies of scale.\n\nMany of the new designs are also breeder reactors, meaning that consume for less fissile fuel and can actually consume what we are currently calling \"waste\". \n\n&gt;It sucks that 30 years ago we had the start of it all. \n\nWe had EVs much earlier than that: http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/223/electric-car-timeline.html\n\n&gt;I completely agree with the Maglev trains. \n\nSkyTran is well beyond a typical maglev train. A train of any sort must stop to load, unload passengers, so it essentially requires another leg of transportation beyond the train itself. Maglev can really be thought of as competing against regional airlines more than cars. SkyTran, on the other hand, not only has the speed, energy, and cleanliness of a maglev train, but also gets you within a block or two of any destination, including your home. It could, in my opinion, make car ownership obsolete for millions of households.",

One author or scientist that I heard on the radio said that he's giving up flying. I like Europe and South America.

ICE cars look just like EVs from the outside, but they are so different on the inside that it's no wonder why ICE car makers have never made electric cars in earnest.  They're totally different.  Look at the product portfolio of companies like Honda and Toyota:  ICE cars, energy generators, dirt bikes, jet skis, snowmobiles, etc.... the common factor is the combustion engine.  That's what they have invested in for their whole histories.  GM, Honda, Toyota - these are internal combustion engine companies, not car companies.  That's why they won't budge on EVs and require so much government help.",

It's just getting caught up in a journalist's headline and ignoring the details.\n\n&gt;A house ten years ago covering 100% of their usage with conventional rooftop/ground based system in conjunction with batteries is literally the same as this, sans the sleek look.\n\nExcept for the literally the same part. \n\n&gt;I am not trying to rain on the parade here, I like the idea of solar shingles. What bugs me, is that people see this and think \"WOW solar is finally here!\"\n\nThat's a strawman argument. Who is saying this? No one is denying solar has been here for a long time. I myself have 7kw on my roof, but an inhibitor for many people has been the aesthetics. Like it or lump it but people who spend lots of money on terracotta tiles or slate roofs don't want them covered by PV panels. \n\n&gt;Additionally it is essentially entirely unproven. And no offense to musk/tesla, but they have yet to REALLY deliver with this product yet.\n\nThe longevity of long range EVs are also unproven doesn't stop \npeople advancing an area.\n\n&gt;Installing this on a few demo homes of your CEO's in california is great.\n\nThis was one of the first installed on a private individual's home.\n\n&gt;But I want to see more if they are claiming that this is \"Tesla house of the future\".\n\nWho? Journalists trying to sell clicks?\n\n&gt;Its totally sensationalized, which is classic their style.\n\nIf you are getting stuck on a headline and can't read past it, maybe it's time to give up.\n\n&gt;t is being used to draw people into the company (free advertising) and then shift them over to conventional offerings and long term leasing.\n\nThis makes it sound like you have a financial interest in people not going with an integrated roof.",

Tesla in the US is not a growth story anymore. The numbers are either showing a massive drop in demand - or a massive drop of demand at current prices. Both of which aren't good and will cost billions if true. Demand in Europe's biggest markets has been slowing down as well. China has seen massive decline of EV sales last month. The Outlook is far from good. Of course 0 is an obvious troll goal, but with no growth Tesla will start to be valuated like other car companies that have little to no growth. And that means a share price of $60 is absolutely a possibility. The current share price is solely based on the growth Tesla has shown until late last year.",

My fear would be that you buy the vehicle, it’s a lemon, or the company goes under and you are stuck with something. The way I understand it with Fisker Ocean is you pick the lease term and may even have the option to go month to month. If you don’t like the car, you can just give it back. If you like it for a couple of years, but they come out with something better, just return it and get something else.\n\nI know this wouldn’t be ideal for someone looking for long term ownership, but it’s a cool way to try before you buy.\n\nI love Rivians offerings (from what I have seen so far), and something like this would help me be more likely to take the plunge",

If we're talking all the way up to parent company and their sub-brands, I'd bet on Hyundai/Kia beating VW since VW sells in way more markets that will be slower to convert.\n\nBut just for the sake of discussion I'll make the case for Lincoln - their parent company has demonstrated that they're serious about EVs (Mach-E) and they've demonstrated they're willing to spend money to make the brand appealing. Their recent refresh was well-received but so far as I can tell hasn't set the world on fire like they hoped - it was clearly missing that extra something, and we know electric drivetrains are particularly well-suited to that particular American luxury style that used to do well for them (and Cadillac, for that matter). GM has indicated Cadillac will be making a similar push but I think they're too precious about the Escalade to switch over entirely for a while. I think Lincoln has a really strong incentive to make the switch before anyone else, and they have the technical and manufacturing ability to actually do it.",

"comment": "A company vehicle is a typical type of compensation in germany/europe, instead of a pay rise you get a company vehicle for example. I think this has also tax reason, a company can lease cheaper than a private person.\n\nThese articles about company car owners who don't charge ther PHEVs are often about companies who also provide \"tankkarten\" (Your employer pays your gasstation bills). This basically incentives people to only use gas, because their refueling bill gets paid. If they would charge at home, they would need to pay for electricity themselfs. BUT there are law/policy changes in the work which would change this. But this stuff moves slow, so there is a lot of time to make negative headlines about PHEVs in the meantime.",

"comment": "I'm a Japanese living in Tokyo. The number of charging stations in Japan was increasing steadily until 2018, but it reached a plateau there and has been decreasing since 2020. The main reason is the aging of the chargers. The service life of a commercial charger is 8 years. And since they are not profitable, many owners choose to close their businesses rather than renew their facilities. In Japan, 40% of chargers are installed at car dealerships. They are located at Nissan, Honda, Toyota, and other dealerships. The penetration rate of EVs and PHEVs in Japan is 1%. The Japanese government has decided to increase the number of charging stations to 150,000 by 2030. Japanese people are very allergic to nuclear power plants due to the atomic bombing and the Tohoku earthquake, so it is difficult to build new nuclear power plants or restart them. Furthermore, solar power generation is not cost-effective because of the mountains and lack of flat land. Well, we are doing our best, but there is nothing definitive. In the end, nuclear power plants will be restarted.",

Also around 2027 there will be a battery shortage and Tesla, making their own, could again sell them to competitors. I see all these as win-win situations.",

They're the whole game and Ford is failing at it. They're taking a step back while others are charging ahead. They aren't smartly waiting for some second mover advantage. They're *stumbling* and hoping they can still survive.\n\nI hope for Ford's sake they aren't taking the challenge lightly as you seem to be.

"comment": "To answer your question directly, yes it is feasible to go 100% off-grid, BUT that would be a waste of money.\n\nOff grid means putting the solar panels on your roof, installing your batteries in your basement, installing all sorts of other wiring and hardware between, and disconnecting from the grid.  \n\nInstead of going off-grid, I would recommend installing a grid tied system.  In other words, put the solar panels on your roof, install the hardware between the panels and your electrical system, and pay the $15 a month minimum charge to be connected to the grid. Do not install a battery.  \n\nWhat will happen (if I understand Utah electricity rules correctly) is that during the summer months, your panels will produce more electricity than you'll use.  This will go to the grid and you'll get a credit.  During the winter months, your panels will not produce as much and you'll pull electricity from the grid and you'll spend those credits you produced in the summer.  Essentially, the grid is your battery storage system of unlimited size.  Again, this will cost you only $15 a month (you should double check this number).  This is also why 65 panels seems a bit high. \n\nThere is no current battery that will only cost you $15 a month.  If perhaps battery prices drop or the minimum charge increases, then you can rerun the costs for having a  battery, but until then, going off grid is not worth the money.",

"comment": "we could REALLY be ahead now if not Merkel had fucked it up completely.\n\nStarting in 1998 there was a massive investment in solar energy and subsidies from the government which lead to a growing solar industry here and a huge grow in the installment of panels.\n\nWhen Merkel was in power she stopped the subsidies, and most of the companies that had planned with them couldn't adapt to the new situation and went bankrupt.\n\nThis is really stupid as China continues to subsidy the panels (to up to 80%), and now, when the world market is growing and countries like China, the USA and other big nations make huge investments into the solar industry, Germany has one single company left that produces solar panels.\n\nAll those billions that had helped the industry to start going just lost with many jobs and chances in the future because of a fucked up ideology that favourizes the atomic industry. \n\nSo no, we are not going to be far ahead unfortunately",

"comment": "This is a very strong misconception with solar. Unlike cellphones, solar panels do not become obsolete. \n\nSay you install 20 panels that cover 100% of your electricity consumption and recover the investment in 7 years. \n\nIf super new efficient panels come around in 7 years, you'll still be producing 100% of your needs but will have already recovered your investment instead of having to pay out let's say half of what you did 7 years ago. The only reason to switch to new technology would be if you need the extra space allowed by more efficient panels, which is unlikely. \n\nSolar panels do not become obsolete because their function does not change, only their price and space occupied. \n\nThe only reason to wait would be if you get less return than what prices are diminishing. Prices are going down around 5% and you are getting a 10% return, so solar makes sense today.",

"comment": "I live in NJ and am seriously considering buying solar panels. \nOther than the fact that people think that Solar City rips people off via their PPA or leases, is there a reason not to buy solar panels through them, if they're the least expensive option?\n\nI don't have official estimates from anyone yet, so I can't go into specifics about power output, total cost, etc. yet. \n\nMy thinking is this:\nAs long as the panels produce 100% of my electricity usage, that's all I need since my local utility doesn't pay me back for additional power I produce.  \nI've heard that Solar City uses cheaper panels. Whether the panels are \"worse than\" others panels or not, since SC warranties them for 30 years, they're responsible for fixing them if anything goes wrong. Plus they insure my roof for $2 for the 39 years as well. It just seems too good to pass up, as long as they end up being the least expensive option. \n\nI'd love to hear from some Devils advocates as to why I shouldn't do business with Solar City.",

"comment": "I think you're right that solar contractors are making a lot of money right now and don't have to provide competitive pricing.  That will all change in 2017 and I see there being a big shakeup in the market once the tax credit ends.  Figure everyone that is thinking about getting solar is going to have it by end of 2016. There will be a lot of installers that won't survive 2017 and it will probably take 5-10 years for market to recover to the point where prices will start decreasing again based on today's price.  Also, utilities are fighting back and starting to win some victories against solar.  For example, in 2017, the net metering contracts will change in California to more favor the utilities.\n\nIf I was a solar contractor, I'd have a backup plan to find a new career in 2017.  I wouldn't be surprised to see SolarCity go bankrupt and have their assets go up for sale at $0.50 on the dollar.",

Then they will bundle it with a service which will install a new 60kWh battery in your 10 year old Leaf, then take your old Leaf battery and package it into a home battery system.",

"comment": "Some of permitting is a money grab, for sure. Some of it isn't about inspecting your home per se, but record-keeping and making sure the contractor has insurance / safety training.\n\nStructural Engineering is a bit different than permitting. The way I look at it, the solar array is going to put load on your roof every day. Every storm it's going to flex your roof, for more than thirty years. With the cost of structural engineering being around 1-2% of total project cost, I think its something that is more important than, say, what brand of solar modules you're using.\n\nLook, most residential solar installers are skipping the engineering portion of project development. I'm guilty of it too. But I've learned that skipping over structural engineering is not a best practice, learned a few things from non-solar structural engineers, and now get my projects stamped.",

That is to say, I'd rather have 28 x 260W panels over 22 x 327W panels. Sunpower makes a fine product, but I don't think the added expense is worth it. \n\nI'm not a fan of micro inverters. With 22 components (one for each module) instead of one string inverter, you have 21 more pieces of the puzzle that could fail over the life of the system and need replacement. \n\nI'd look for at least a few more quotes, and see if anyone can provide you with 100% energy offset using \"standard\" components (normal Tier 1 PV modules and a string inverter).\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions if you have any.",

Despite gas prices being low at the moment, coal is cheaper still.\n\n&gt;Coal is so unpopular in the US that they can’t even give it away. The governor of mining heartland West Virginia is petitioning President Donald Trump for a $15 per tonne subsidy for burning his coal. But remarkably in the Middle East, a region with almost no coal of its own, the demand for the black fuel is on the up.",

Then I could order the car to find a charger at my destination and plug itself in.

"comment": "&gt;Industrial process heat. I couldnt find information on what this is?\n\nThink of anything in heavy industry that needs a lot of heat. Big, giant stuff. Do you want concrete? You need huge heat inputs to create portland cement. Do you want steel? Massive quantities of heat. Recycling? Heat. \n\nHere's one of my favorite graphics that demonstrates the energy challenge:\nhttps://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/charts/Energy/Energy_2017_United-States.png\n\nLook at the industrial sector. It's bigger than residential and commercial combined. (BTW, the feel-good options people push that center around residential consumer use are laid bare by this chart.) Notice how much energy is consumed by industry that isn't electricity. \n\n&gt;Wouldnt that just fall under electricity use to generate heat?\n\nNo, that's pretty inefficient. There's huge heat loss when generating electricity. The hotter the source the more efficient the process, but there's still 40-70% energy loss when using heat to make electricity. If you then use electricity to create heat, you are looking at ridiculous energy loss. Better to use the heat itself for these processes. \n\n&gt;Where do the fatalities come from renewables?\n\nAll sort of places. IIRC, 89 wind farm workers have been killed in the last decade. With solar, it's people falling off their roofs. That's just install/postinstall kinds of death. For both of these there are deaths that occur during the whole course of the supply chain. Lots of different metals go into making magnets and solar panels. Do you get solar panels from China? If so, their environmental record is horrendous. They have a toxic lake from industry that kids have fallen into and died. They use coal power, unscrubbed, to power production, so Chinese die everyday from respiratory disease related in part to the production of solar panels and windmills. \n\n&gt;Desalination capabilities. Is this listed because it requires a lot of power itself to be functional?\n\nReverse osmosis is a common desalination method, but requires electricity. More efficient still is using industrial heat to desalinate water. Decent video on current efforts for Jordan in this regard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-wI1_QH-m4\n\n&gt;Power for synthetic hydrocarbon. Which is an alternate fuel source?\n\nSure. Jet fuel, diesel, bunker fuel (which is nasty stuff), even gasoline substitutes. EVs are great, but they aren't yet affordable. Even when they are, that's just light passenger vehicles. Heavy trucking, aviation, and ocean transport all will require hydrocarbons for decades to come. (Ocean transport could actually use nuclear power.)\n\n&gt;Thanks for your time. Hope im not being irrelevant\n\nHappy to answer. You aren't being irrelevant at all.",

I would use an SE7600H and SE3800H both with EV chargers.   \n\nUsing the RESU10H which is DC and connects directly to the SE7600H StoreEdge was what I was talking about.  but doing it with powerwalls and the SolarEdge EV solution it can still easily be done with 200A MSP with a 225A bus (these are pretty common).  \n\nit can still be done with 200A service using two inverters as I suggest as well.   Skips the whole need for separate EV charging panel.  \n\nYou really want the second inverter or you are not going to be happy with all that clipping and lost production.",

"comment": "Here is an arstechnica article with more information:\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/after-seven-roof-fires-walmart-sues-tesla-over-solar-panel-flaws/](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/after-seven-roof-fires-walmart-sues-tesla-over-solar-panel-flaws/)\n\nA couple of bullet points in Walmart's complaint are telling:\n\n* \"Many of the Tesla solar panels inspected by Walmart were suffering  from hotspots, resulting in cracking of the back sheets on solar modules  and compromising electrical insulation.\"\n* \"Making matters worse, Tesla had flagged or identified hotspots by  placing pieces of tape over the affected areas. Because this tape  prevented sunlight from reaching the solar panel, it exacerbated the  problem by further concentrating heat.\"\n\nHotspots occur when a cell is bypassed because it can't produce as much current as the rest of the array. This may be due to any number of things, from a cracked cell to a bird turd, but they happen all the time. When a cell is bypassed, it is forced to \"eat\" electrical power from neighboring cells. In a 300W panel, that can amount to nearly 100W of electrical energy in addition to the 24W from the Sun. That is enough to heat the cell past the rated temperature of the back sheet (107°C), which causes it to turn brown and brittle, and crack or even split open. The exposed metal backing on the cells can have several hundred volts on them, which is likely to arc to the grounded frame. Once an arc starts, it doesn't go out until the power source is removed. In this case the power source is however many panels are connected in series in that string: up to 20 to 30 panels. The arc is plasma, and burns through everything: glass, plastic, silicon all get destroyed. And that's exactly what happened in the picture at the front of that article. It looks like the aftermath of pretty much any solar system fire. To see more, just do a Google image search for \"solar panel fire.\"\n\nFlagging hot spots with tape is the last thing anyone should do. I can't imagine anyone in the industry doing something that stupid.",

"comment": "Thanks for the input. The two $22k bids are the local installers.  The other ones are all from national companies.  The bid with the Panasonic panels are from the installer two of my co-workers used. They were happy with the process and have no complaints but they are also the least price sensitive people (if you know what mean). The Sunpower panels are also local and from an installer I found recommended here on r/solar on several different occasions.  \n\nGoing through the threads - these bids look expensive relative to what I've read here.  That got me second guessing myself.\n\nI'll give that company you recommended a call.",

"comment": "Im in California and am on a grandfathered electric TOU plan and Net Metering plan, set to expire in about 2 decades. Peak/part peak pricing is anywhere from 1.5-2.5 times more expensive than night time so I end up getting a 2 for 1 on my day to night basis. \n\n\nMy NEM true up is annual however my city, San Jose, is rolling out a clean energy non profit municipality to source our 75% of the electricity for the entire city from renewables and profits will be used to roll out additional infrastructure to reach 100% renewable energy. San Jose sources the energy however PGE maintains the infrastructure and billing. \n\n\nWith that said, if i were to go with my City owned municipality I have been told true up would be monthly and any excess energy produced will be reimbursed at full retail rate ~$0.44-0.33. Currently i get reimbursed ~$0.06 for excess energy generated annually however we essentially have a net zero energy consumption at true up every year. 6.8kW system. \n\n\nIf I wanted to add batteries i would have to install a brand new electric meter and get on the new NEM 2.0 and other new changes, its a mess.",

"comment": "&gt; You would expect the AHJ (county/city permit inspections) would have been able to catch some of this.\n\nI am at the final stages of having my rooftop solar finished. We're just waiting for the utility to process the interconnect paperwork. The install was completed last Thursday. The county came and inspected on Friday. They did not go on the roof, in my attic, or in my garage (where my breaker panel is). I have no idea what they actually inspected. There is no REC meter yet. All that is on the [side of the house](https://i.imgur.com/c357pCQ.jpg) is the current meter, the inverter, and the shutoff switch. Maybe they just checked to make sure it was attached to the side of the house properly? I have no idea.\n\nAnyway, my point is, those inspections seem like a joke to me.",

So, this is probably part of the problem.\n\n\nI don't know about the real output of those solar panels but I guess that it is a lot lower than 80w in canadian springtime. And as I understand it, he was lowering the output even more by charging two device at the same time.\n\nNow he is just charging one at a time. We'll see tomorrow how that works out.",

Also, they’re eventually making their own batteries, so I don’t think they’d want to buy from a third party, but I guess it will depend on if they can scale up production enough to meet demand. Tesla isn’t the only company making solar panels or home batteries either. First Solar is the market leader for solar panels I believe. If Tesla had a monopoly on all of the industries they’re in, that could justify their valuation, but they don’t, and more competitors will arise as these industries continue to grow.",

Are they uninterruptible? \n  \nI don’t want to run my house all night off it, but would it prevent brown-outs from affecting my HVAC and laundry?  \n  \nWe’ve lived all over Tampa and have had brown-outs in each location; usually less than 5 minutes long, most of the time under a minute. I’m pretty sure it destroyed one A/C unit when there were a few in a row. I’ve always wanted something like a UPS for the whole house, but it maybe doesn’t reasonably exist. Thanks!",

So if you have to replace the batteries every 10 years it’ll be costly. They also probably didn’t calculate the loss of output on the solar panels after long time frame. Personally I’d rather have solar power, but I don’t think most people understand how much power nuclear puts out with very little fuel and very little waste over such a long time period. We really need better energy storage technologies that will sustain daily use for 20-30 years. We are getting closer, but just aren’t there yet.",

"comment": "Dang you have a massive roof for solar.  But I can see why they want the 2 panels on the W side, front of the house, better production.  For me, I wouldn't care if the panels are on the front like that, but if you don't like it, that's fine.  You have plenty of space on the E side, back of the house to add whatever production you need.  I would suggest you at least go to 100% offset, even if they are putting panels on the E side.  Makes no sense to get solar and then still have to pay your utility too.  I would also recommend not only going 100%, but over that as a buffer since usage is never the same.  110% or maybe even 115% is good assuming you don't have any other big future energy usage like an EV.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming your utility has 1:1 net metering?  Probably should check that too before you do anything since it'll be a big impact if it's not.\n\nAnd yes, energy is never getting cheaper, so might as well save yourself money now and help the environment out a ton also.",

The meter keeps track of time when energy is drawn from the grid or pushed back to the grid and the bill matches up accordingly.  I’m on the “cash out” option but I may opt for the credits instead, just wasn’t sure how to gauge which is the better “deal” since your credits can’t move with you to a new place (not that I’m planning to move anytime soon.)\n\nFor my household (south-facing roof, west side of town near Golden) the majority of my excess energy is pushed back to the grid during the “Mid Peak” time of day.

"comment": "Yep, couldn't agree more. I just had a pallet of minisplits show up that I'm installing myself this fall, and in the spring I'm buying 15kW of lightly-used panels and installing them myself. No permits required for rooftop in my area and I'm allowed up to a 500kW rooftop system (lol) with net metering.\n\nPayback period on this system should be right around 3 years, before considering that I'll be able to heat my house for the up-front cost of around $10k, instead of being forced to pay almost $350/year just for the privilege of being connected to the gas line...\n\nThen I hear numbers of $30k for a system half this size and a payback period that's 15 years... No way. That's a scam. Makes me embarrassed for telling people to get solar if that's the quotes they're getting.",

They showed up with 395 kw Canadian Solar panels and installed 28 of them, for 11.06 kw. I looked through other permits they’ve filed in my area and this seems to happen often.\n\nInstallation was fine. Conduit lines are clean and panel placement looks good.  Roof penetrations are good.  There were some issues with dangling wires and it failed the first inspection. They fixed it and we’re awaiting a follow up inspection. Unfortunately, while they filed for and scheduled the first inspection pretty quickly, we’ve been stuck waiting for them to schedule the follow up. It seems that once you get in the queue for service work things slow down considerably. \n\nThey did file interconnection with PG&amp;E very quickly and it was accepted as substantially compliant.",

"comment": "Exactly! The last big boondoggle SDGE pulled was with San Diego County and the Regional Decarbonization Framework (RDF). They paid for a professor to write a report saying Solar Farms are great and residential solar is not effective. Must be hard to say that considering they are complaining about how effective residential solar has been.  San Diego government swallowed this hook, line and sinker. \n\nThe plan was guided and co-authored by an academic consultant, political science Professor David Victor. Dr. Victor has well-known ties to SDG&E and the utility industry:\r  \n•\tHe sits on the Advisory Council of the utility industry’s national research association, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).\r  \n•\tSDG&E contributed almost $850,000 to EPRI in 2021. In that same year, EPRI pledged $900,000 to the UCSD institute that Prof. Victor runs in 2021, with the pledge specifically stating the money is to be controlled by Dr. Victor.\r  \n•\tDr. Victor co-authored SDG&E’s 2022 decarbonization plan, which like the RDF, calls for more solar farms and power lines.\r  \n•\tIt makes sense that SDG&E wants to build more solar farms and reduce rooftop solar. After all, they make a 10-12% guaranteed profit for every dollar they spend on long distance power lines to transport electricity from solar farms.\r  \nIt seems to me that if Dr.Victor, SDGE, and UCSD had any integrity they would recuse themselves from ever having any involvement in energy policy. Once money has exchanged hands there is no longer any possibility of independent analysis.",

"comment": "Thank you, that’s a good option too. \n\nIt was landlord occupied property before. That’s why it has the solar panels. We have told the tenants many times before and explained about how the powering works for the house before they moved in and even before they signed the lease. Tenants didn’t need the panels, but they are the ones consuming the power. We have added that in the lease too with the specific amount under utilities - “Solar: $40 flat fee will be added monthly to the rent. Now after moving in they are coming up saying that they don’t think they should be paying for the solar. $40 is not a big deal, landlord can pay it. But with this tenant being always arguing and making things challenging for us for each and every small issue, landlord decided to disconnect the solar from powering the unit. He’s still going to pay the $40. \n\nI’m managing this property. I’m also managing few other property where the landlord wants to install the solar for their houses. If I can get the numbers good, and how much benefit it’s going to bring, i can explain it to them as well as any future tenants upfront without any ambiguity.",

They hated the urban sprawl that cut into nature and knew cars gave people the freedom to live outside of cities.\n\nIf CO2 was classified as a pollutant they could get rid of cars. Early environmental groups HATED cars with intensity. Sierra Club. Greenpeace.\n\nThis all morphed into the Green grift in the 2000s with tax rebates and subsidies for tesla and solar panels. Driven by money only, rich people could practically guarantee their investments from the start. Wall Street got rich creating, funding, selling, and most importantly lobbying these projects. \n\nBut as the kids grew up in fear they saw communism as the answer…to everything lol",

"comment": "You are totally correct that climate change blew past all **scientific** projections. But it hasn't yet blown past all the mathematical projections. Because most of the mathematicians who've studied this, understand that non-linear systems, in chaotic states will behave more unpredictably than systems in stable States. So when looking at projections, mathematicians keep in mind this concept called the Lyapunov exponent. It is basically an exponential measure of the error if projections versus what actually happens. A metric that gives a bound by which exist system is within non-linear, but stable bounds, or chaotic unpredictable bounds.\n\nEven the most advanced science teams take the view that this stuff is secondary to the data, because you can't calculate it unless you have data. And that is technically correct, but forgets that the process to analyze the data build a model analyze the next set of data and build another model etc is recurrent. You have to always keep refining as in chaotic states, the ecosystem will not be returning to normal, so the value of having a control to compare against, which is what science relies on come on is precisely zero. Because we will never get there again. It's like comparing you as a 15 year old to you as a four-year-old come on with respect to buying shoes. And calling the 4-year old shoe size you had, the normal one. You are never going back in time to become four years old so you'll never have that shoe size ever again. So what is the using going shopping for shoe sizes like that?\n\nSo scientists don't have the mathematical skills to do any of the other work surrounding that to give them a better predictive model. They rely on statistical methods to try and gain the projection but almost all mathematicians would regard that as far too simplistic. Especially in the context of a non-linear systems. There are entire subjects within applied mathematics dedicated to this. But by the nature of the analysis they do, everything they do is basically linear and regressional. That in itself ties the behavior of a system to linear past behavior. \n\nBut once the system is chaotic that ceases to be the case. So the models scientists use are based on a prerequisite that does not exist in chaotic States. This is why it's often studied as two separate types of system. One in stable States the other in unstable or transitional States. That causes a problem for scientists in general and climate scientists in particular and as a result the reporting that goes on around climate change is itself based on flawed baselines.\n\nCertainly 80% or more of the mathematicians working in climate science, are of the view that the system is in a chaotic state, which is beyond the understanding of science but not be on the understanding of maths. Almost all of the hot models you might have heard of have the behavior of the climate exactly within those models bounds. There is one model in particular (which is not mine), that has the climate tracking pretty much exactly as expected and to boot, it even predicts historical information, which is an elegant, ideal solution because you can tell what the past has done and how it links to the current state, including across what other models would regard as a discontinuity. It's actually beautiful, even though it's not mine. I'm more than mildly jealous in fact 🤣\n\nAnyway, all of the linkages that we have from hot model projections to the way society is at the moment tell us that there is no situation in which climate change isn't going to hit you ultimately. Here on you it's getting worse, it can be intense heatwaves as it was a year and a half ago through to extreme flooding and cold as it has been this year and then it will go back again come up because that's what nonlinear system is usually exhibit as. Extremes of hot extensions of cold lots of flooding, and generally more energy in the system. \n\nSo the second part of this though is not the probability or chance of it happening, because even though complete disruption is very likely to happen, and is already happening in many parts of the world and even the United States, that's a certainty. It's how you mitigate against the damage caused by that.\n\nFor example, one of the reasons why you might have washers come with those little rubber loop things, around screws in plumbing or things like that come on is this because it's cheaper to fix that two cents washer than to fix the whole plumbing system if something goes wrong with a joint. Simply unscrew it, change the two cents washer come as good back in, tighten it with a wrench call myjob done. 3 minutes of work. Most calm mechanics will tell you why they are frustrated at modern cars with their computer controlled electronic control units come with that manage everything, which needs specialist tools and training, which can also take longer to fix sometimes, especially with the way the engines are so compact and distorted to fit everything else in. What they hope is the car is more reliable and as a result doesn't need to be serviced as often come up but when it is service it costs a fortune! There are plenty of cases where the servicing costs more than the car. Which is itself unsustainable because some people just find it easier to scrap it and get another one.\n\nAnyway, what this means is that you need to find ways of mitigating the effect of climate change for you. It's not that you necessarily have to take despair in the fact that the world as we know it is collapsing, because the Earth Will Find Another stability point. It's guaranteed. It's happened before in terms of the extremely hot, volcanic lands that it was at the time we can then stabilized into something resembling our world today come up but it did that via swamps have come a via snowball Earth's etc. We call it saving the planet called but the planet is perfectly capable of saving itself. What we are actually trying to do is save humanity and ecology. \n\nThat's where your boat will come in.\n\nFlat bottom boats work perfectly well on land as houses. So build one, flat floor, no foundations. Solar panels on the roof. Air conditioning. Then when sufficient flooding builds up, you just ride it. \n\nAnd because you have to save ecology, you have to gather as many species of flora and fauna to create a viable, self-sustaining ecosystem. See that guy who basically nurtured a self-sufficient ecosystem in a jar for something like 70 years. He only ever opened it once after sealing it. \n\nTo be honest with you two of each word would be enough because sometimes you have to have a minimum of 1,500 in the population of a particular species for it be able to take successfully. But you get the idea. \n\nSo maybe that Noah guy was on to something.",

I'm full-time vegan and cook for friends with gluten intolerance.\n\nThe Conscious Cook by Tal Ronnen is amazing - it does require stopping at several grocery stores and some planning ahead, however. The best thing I learned from it is to make cashew cream. It replaces the \"heaviness\" I miss in soups, sauces, and dressings. Here is a video where he shows you how easy it is: http://www.talronnen.com/video/?video=4\n\nvegguide.org and happycow.net are useful when you want to go out to eat. they will help you find vegan restaurants and I have never found a completely vegan restaurant that didn't offer at least one gluten-free meal and one raw meal... most of them have several.\n\nI would like to help you more but I'm not really sure what direction to go in. If there is anything more specific you have questions about I'd love to share what I know.",

However, I think it's important not to send the message that animals are ours to use. By wearing vegan alternatives you model vegan behavior to others. You show others that vegan alternatives do exist and can be just as good if not better. If you wear leather (etc.), it sends the message that leather is so superior that you will find loopholes to keep wearing it. Personally, I've gotten a lot of compliments on my vegan clothes and I am happy to point out that they are vegan -- which surprises a lot of people.

Perhaps you honestly misunderstood what was being said and Saucerbrab's point, but I didn't get the impression at all that Saucercrab was \"musing\" about those things or saying those things would be nice to do. He was comparing you musing about hurting and killing animals (through using animal products) with musing about hurting and killing humans. He was trying to point out why your comments were inappropriate, especially here. For us vegans, talk about needlessly killing animals is quite upsetting. While it is normal and good that you love your children and value them higher than other animals and even other humans, we vegans recognize that other animals feel pain and suffering, too. And they don't deserve to be harmed and killed, either. \n\nWhat is this sub-reddit about? It's about veganism. And I think The Vegan Society, the founders of veganism, explain it best: \n\n&gt;Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.\n\nThat is what this sub-reddit is about. \n\nYou are welcome to stay if you are curious about veganism or want to get some recipes (though /r/vegrecipes and /r/veganrecipes might be better for that). However, if you're going to brag about hurting animals or using animal products (which results in the same), then it might be best for you to move on as that is considered trolling here.",

I felt some kind of lonely since I have no vegan friends, and  went to reddit/vegan for friendship and support. I don't care to much what my friends eat eather, as long as they are comfortable with their choice. I still would like it though to have someone to shear my frustration and beliefs with. Reading threw the forum I found that even vegans was mean to other vegans, for not be &lt;vegans enough&gt;. That was really frustrating!",

Some slices of deli luncheon for lunch with a bean salad and some mushrooms and asparagus.\nSeitan duck for dinner with some lentils and broccoli and a snack of a tbs of peanut butter and 10 almonds throughout the day.\n\n1480 cal - 150 g protein.\n\nIf I had started going to the gym around 5 times per week and jogging 30 minutes/day the days I am not at the gym I would up the calorie intake to closer to 2000 cal and would easily reach a higher amount of protein. The RDI of protein for me is around 63 g. On a low calorie vegan diet I am already getting 84 g more than my RDI. You don't have to eat 2kg of lentils or 4kg of broccoli. Nor do you have to eat constantly. Also, your link doesn't work.\n\nSo, I am not worried, my friend. I am not worried. How much protein do you think we need, not being body builders? Even without the protein powder I reach 118 g of protein, but then I am down on 1300 cal per day and need to find something else to eat. So... do I need more protein? Is 150g of protein on a 1480 cal diet per day enough for someone not currently going to a gym?",

I can assure you though, there is no compulsion required at meal time.\n\n&gt; Their bodies and digestive tracts are designed to eat a largely meat based diet.\n\nThat's irrelevant in this modern context where we can synthesize whatever nutrients we need. I'm feeding my dogs a commercial food that is nutritionally complete: I also supplement with digestive enzymes, taurine (probably not required) and L-carnitine (the food is already fortified, but just to be sure).\n\nThere is really no scientific evidence out there to suggest that feeding a vegetable based food is detrimental to a dog's health as long as it is formulated to meet canine nutrition standards. There have been a few studies. There is also substantial anecdotal evidence showing positive results.\n\nIt is even possible with cats which are considerably further toward the carnivorous side, although there is somewhat more risk - generally due to urine pH issues especially in males. \n\n&gt;  If you want a pet to be vegan, go get a rabbit or a goat...\n\nMy dogs would still exist, they just wouldn't have a home.",

"comment": "I don't think there's a correct way...whatever works for you is what you should do. I know a lot of people will choose to bring a vegan dish or two to share when dining at a friend's house. It doesn't even have to be something you cook--plenty of things are vegan-ready at the grocery store (chips and salsa/hummus, maybe?) \n\nEating out is much trickier. I try to pick the restaurant, when possible, because I know which ones have decent vegan options. When I can't, I make a point to eat beforehand at home and then have a snack at the restaurant (salad, or again with the chips and salsa).\n\nIt sounds like you have limited options having to eat at the college's dorm. I actually work at a school and eat in the cafeteria at lunch. I usually end up eating either a vegan soup (which they have once or twice a week) or rice \"cereal\" (rice, cinnamon/sugar, and coconut milk from my mini fridge). I have to admit, if I lived there and ate 3 meals per day there, I'd probably be coming up with more creative solutions, and maybe bringing lots of stuff with me (my own dairy-free milk, bread, cheese, etc.)\n\nI've never been vegetarian, just went straight to vegan, but I imagine it would be way easier to eat anywhere because you don't have to avoid milk, eggs, and cheese, just the meat.",

I'm not blaming veganism for these pains, I was wondering if I'm missing something from my diet that could be common among newbie vegans.\n\nI was told that the pills were to make my stomach from producing \"so much acid\". After a few days of no changes, it was clear to me that it wasn't acid reflux. I didn't want to continue to take the pills if there were no changes, cause that's kind of scary to force my body to stop producing something, especially it might not be the problem (in my opinion). I told my family doctor I was on those pills for 3 days with no changes and he basically told me yeah if they're weren't any changes it was okay to stop.",

There is not that empathy for the animals because the general population views them as inconveniently alive food tubes instead of living beings.\n\nIf a vegan group goes in and smashes up a lab or a slaughterhouse, that does not provide the message to the general public \"these animals are in need of help and deserve our basic compassion\", it provides the message of \"these people are crazy extremists who cannot be trusted\". That does not help a cause.\n\nThe problem is one of education. People assume that 1) animal nutrients are essential to human life and 2) The alternatives are extreme. That's where vegan activism can change minds. Not through dramatic displays when people don't understand the underlying reason why these people did this violent thing.",

Of also moderation. \n\nYes, eating beef doesn't kill you ... right away. It does however impact the system, especially the vascular system. \n\n1 cigarette doesn't kill either. But smoking over a prolonged period of time certainly does increase the chances and risk of chronic disease. \n\nNo one is saying you'll die by eating a little. But eating a little (i.e. In moderation) frequently does add to the risk.  This in and of itself should categorize it as unhealthy.  Same with potato chips, bacon, and vegan donuts. \n\nSame with eggs as well. Dr. Garth Davis also says that having 6 eggs or less per week doesn't kill you...right away. But it does contribute to a whole host of negative factors. \n\nLastly, on the topic of beef being a carcinogen:  the WHO has labeled all processed meats as carcinogens. This is a fact. The fact that we debate whether it's a class 1 or class 2b is almost comical.  It's a carcinogen. Period.  And one that need not be consumed for sustenance reasons.",

It's a hard adjustment for a lot of people. It's hard when going out, it's hard to pass up half of the convenience meals at the grocery store, and it's hard to get the nutrients optimized enough to not have meat cravings. \n\nAs an aside, I used to have *terrible* steak cravings, even though I was trying to eat lots of protein. I realized it was an iron thing, so I started using the Lucky Iron Fish regularly and lo and behold my steak cravings left. I don't miss meat when I'm getting enough healthy food. Also, many people find that getting all your optimal nutrients and feeling satisfied is easier as vegan rather than vegetarian, because dairy is so much of an antinutrient (by sucking the protein and calcium out of you). It should also help him with the weight gain.\n\nI'm sure that as you help him and support him with his load then he'll end up being super glad and grateful that you got him through it, and he'll afterwards likely also get to the point that he 'can't believe I almost went back to meat.' It's been a long hard pandemic, things are rough, I say don't give up on him yet.",

"comment": ">Moral consideration exists on a Spectrum which is why i feel terrible for stepping on a dogs paw and step on wasps because they annoy me.\n\n>I acknowledge the differences in cognitive abilities among different beings. Humans exhibit a unique level of self-awareness and conciousness \n\n>Our prefrontal cortex, which enables advanced \"Stuff\" , and the ability to contemplate moral principles. In contrast, cows have a smaller prefrontal cortex and a different form of consciousness. While they may display basic forms of awareness and cognitive abilities, it is not on the same level as human cognition.\n\nAll this just explains that we have a higher degree of conciousness, not how consciousness has moral relevance. I want to know how it has moral relevance. \n\nFor example, if I had to choose, temporarily be a being who cant feel and get hit, or be a being who can feel and get hit, and I had to choose one, obviously I will choose to not be able to feel so I can avoid the negative experience. So being able to feel has direct relevance when choosing what to hit. \n\n>In the natural world animals eat animals so if we hold them to the same standards since were all equal we would have to murder alot of Wild animals or put them in Prison.\n\nOnly moral agents can be held morally accountable. A lion for example has no concept of right and wrong. So we cannot hold them accountable for their actions. They are also doing what is necessary for them to survive, they have no other option. You could argue that if we hold animal suffering as a moral negative then we are obligated to prevent wild animal suffering. This argument, while similar to yours is actually a pretty well known argument known as the predation problem. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation_problem\n\nBut this still doesn't work as even if we did remove all predators we would actually increase total suffering as entire ecosystems would be destroyed. Maybe one day there will be a solution with improved technology, think when a lion gets hungry we run a robot buck with lab grown meat past the lion, lion gets its fill, no buck gets ripped a part. And then to prevent overpopulation of puck we reduce the rate they breed at by altering their hormones. To control an etmntire ecosystem like this seems unrealistic at the moment though. But you never know how far our technology and understandings will improve in the coming centuries.",

Also, for example, in Italy there is only one word to describe « ball-shaped food » and that’s « polpette ». Those have been part of our Mediterranean diet with several ingredients blended into it, from full on vegetable ones, to eggs and cheese, to meat or fish ones. Yet, people still complain and blurt out « if it’s vegan it can’t be called meatball! ». \n\nIn Italian we don’t even have an Italian equivalent to the word « hamburger ». That describes any « disc-shaped » meat/ fish or other kind of ingredient. Yet, you don’t see people screaming at « fish hamburgers » for not containing ham?!\n\nIt’s such a ridiculous fight, fuelled, on the one side by the agricultural industries (dairy in the frontlines), and on the other side, people who probably suffer from some kind of inferiority/ persecution syndrome - who need to criticise and point fingers to feel better themselves.",

There are lots of versions of it online, so I recommend trying different ones 'til you find your favourite one, but my favourite versions of it are the ones that include oil in the recipe. You just peel potatoes, peel and chop carrots(I like to buy them frozen because I'm always tired), boil them(I like to steam because of more nutrients), then blend with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, nutritional yeast flakes, lemon juice(I buy it bottled bc of price), oil, and some of the water used for steaming/boiling.\n\nSo much cheaper than buying vegan cheese or using cashews to make it. And healthier.",

You could always use variations of the cashew recipes you see but sub tofu or almonds. Also you can blend some blander veggies with nutritional yeast and seasonings for a sauce (potato, carrot, sauteed onions and roasted garlic).\n\nFor \"cheesy\" flavor use salt or braggs/soy, miso for a sharp tang, some lemon juice, maybe a little mustard, and nutritional yeast. Those basics blended with nuts/seeds, tofu, roux thickened cream/milk sauce, veggies, or whatever make for tasty cheesiness. taste and adjust as you go.\n\nPlant based creams/milks, margarine, store bought vegan cheeses or nutritional yeast and garlic salt...roux or cornstarch if you need to thicken it.\n\nadd in peas, broccoli, chik'n tenders, \n\nor top with extra cheese shreds and breadcrumbs, dot with margarine and broil to perfection. baked or stove top, no wrong way to try.\n\nhope something here helped. Good luck, keep looking, and you'll find something you and your sweetheart love, i'm sure!",
