I've done some hypermiling at times, something I have little patience for, and have been able to bump it up from maybe 3.1 miles/kWh to 3.3, or so it seemed. But no, I don't think you could get 4.3 miles/kWh over time. I'd be skeptical that anyone could *ever* do it, unless serious hypermiling was involved, and (maybe I'm wrong) but I think you wrote that you weren't hypermiling.\n\nSo, no, I think the year-round fuel economy of a Nissan LEAF, driven normally, is going to center on 3 miles/kWh. Better without climate control, worse with climate control and/or if you live high on a hill. I don't believe either the 5 mi./kWh number, or the 4.3 mi/kWh number. Again, I don't think anyone's lying. I think what's most likely is that electricity input has been somehow missed with whatever measurement device has been used.\n\nI think I'll ask my neighbor if he'd like a two or three free re-charges at my house. Then we can compare my meter to what his online data says. I expect that to tell the story.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00010422005531533311,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11274012132857933,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22806137458142944,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2294409175713857,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.02029374777339399,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20578642211477607,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.012129444745369256,"ev_1":-0.21552194852847606,"ev_2":-0.007981554430443794,"ev_3":-0.17103094417446604,"ev_4":-0.00025118068636705476,"ev_5":-0.0014318707520336222,"ev_6":-0.051704183172356956},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

And every once in a while allow a 100% charge for cell balancing (using the car soon after).\n\nIs cell balancing what you're thinking of when you say Li batts like to be charged completely? I'm not aware of that assertion being true otherwise. And of course it should be said that \"Li battery\" can in practice mean any of several different chemistries, each with its own peculiarities - so what's true for the Leaf might not be true for laptops or phones or other EVs, etc.\n\nAnyway, the main takeaway is that we really don't have enough good data yet on how long these batteries will last and which factors most influence this. If you read through discussion forums like mynissanleaf.com, as I have extensively, you'll see that there's all kinds of speculation and no definitive answers as yet. And it's also well-known that just because Nissan might say something in the manual or elsewhere that doesn't really make it true - but at least if we follow it they can't pull anything like trying to void our warranties.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001587696703306089,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09907043944363067,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2540988873657951,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12622338036696115,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.09633044771721977,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06463410702023016,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.017825325844266143,"ev_1":-0.06681219214442535,"ev_2":-0.0010211303015239537,"ev_3":-0.0006745555522987464,"ev_4":-0.00026534387264594744,"ev_5":-0.0005461909640871454,"ev_6":-0.046647883243470765},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Get the VIN of the car you want to buy, call up the internet sales manager at the dealer that has the car, and go from there. \n\nIt will feel a little scary buying something as large as a car via the internet, but remember - while this might be the first car *you've* bought online, it almost certainly isn't the first car *they've* sold online. They do this a lot more than you think, and already know how to make the process smooth.\n\nRemember to confirm that you can get local servicing of your new EV. Generally if the dealer can't sell the car, they can't service it. I actually wanted to get an e-Golf, but VW was completely obstinate about servicing and I didn't want to have to ship it down to Portland for services.

But I do like the practicality of a car, if it takes planning or long charging stops etc. it's starting to feel like public transport pretty fast IMO, and certainly less practical than an ICE.\n\n&gt; your viewpoint is one many people hold before they actually try living with an EV\n\nI'm living with an EV, it's been my only car for more than a year. The impression I get on both r/electricvehicles and r/teslamotors is that there is plenty of range, and there is very little hassle with EV's, which I think is a little bit optimistic.\n\nThe rated range assumes that all people have access to a home charger (or even have a garage), which excludes a large number of people, in some countries having that possibility is the exception (in Netherlands on 25% can charge at home). I.e. not every owner wakes up to a fully charged battery, in which case their range with an e-up!/e-golf/i3/Leaf/Zoe etc. is *really* limited.\n\nEvery Leaf owner I know have stories about running out of power, or having to slow down and barely getting to their destination etc.\n\n&gt; Do you live in the sticks?\n\nFor Norway it's a big city :-)\n\n&gt; the EV has replaced their daily driver for 95% of trips\n\nMost trips are short\n\n&gt; then I do seriously question the length of your average round-trip\n\nIt's more an issue of going places, or just going for a drive (without having to go anywhere), I just like to drive. I also want avoid having multiple cars, it does seems like a waste to me, my old ICE could do anything my Tesla can do, I would not switch to an EV if I did not feel they where *better*\n\nTo me the short range EV's on the market today speaks volumes as to how seriously the car companies are about alternatives to ICE vehicles. That Croation guy (Mate Rimac) who built an EV from an old BMW 318, with very little money and old cellphone batteries in his parents garage *should not beat BMW* in every category (**range**, **acceleration**,**looks**).

It means the grid is less than perfectly stable, but Hawaii's frequency is not terribly stable anyway because of scale and inertia; each island has it's own small grid.  Huge amounts of solar was a threat to grid stability, but with the inverters now preventing severe over-frequency events, it all works much better.\n\nThe problem isn't one of engineering; it's one of money.  A lot of folks fit solar based on they'll make a bucketload of money when the sun shines, and today, basically, the inverter runs as a high an output as it can manage all of the time, so more power generated when its bright and sunny, less when it's cloudy.   In the future, on a bright sunny day, with a lot of solar, lot of wind, everyone's  inverters may need to maintain 70%, or 50% of output to keep the frequency nominal.  Sometimes, this will mean that despite there being a load of sun, and a load of panels on the roof, with sufficient capability to cover the house load, the house is not exporting but importing, and folks will scowl at this.  There are ways around this, but it'll mean a bit more technology and smarts in the house.\n\nThe trick to grid stability, known since Westinghouse and Tesla's day, is to over-provision, but to run at exactly the right output to match the load, with a bit of capability to ramp up and down as necessary.

Martial arts style, trying to use the opponents force against them. The focus on production line advancements was to reduce cost on a luxury item trying to go down in price. Had they not tried, the Model 3 would be the second generation Model S with similar price. Going from a 100 kWh pack that costs $200 per kWh to one that costs $120 per kWh means a reduction of $8000. That's not enough to make it affordable.\n\n2. I agree they should wait 1 year more whenever they launch something to do troubleshooting and tuning. The fit and finish complaints is one of their largest problems. However, nobody offers products that have better specs and better fit and finish and so far it hasn't affected their bottom line as much, the cars remain desirable.\n\n3. This is another martial arts move. Nobody else is building the batteries they need in the quantities they need and the parts they do choose to make in house is done so because 3rd parties do it for higher costs, take more time between iteration or fail to deliver at all. I mean, if they don't make the products like they promise, the buyers loyal to the brand will go elsewhere, they are fans of Tesla, not just EV supporters because they do things differently and always exceed expectations. Let me list a few, the first roadster launched with 50 something kWh, the last upgrade offered iirc around 70 kWh battery pack. The Model S launched with 85 kWh and no dual motors, it's now at 100 kWh, all wheel drive and the fastest accelerating car on the planet. The Model 3 was promised to have over 200 miles range at the reveal, the production one goes to 310 miles and it's actually lower than what EPA estimated, around 334 miles. The truck was speculated to have 300 miles of range and cost over $200k, turns out it has 500 miles and the costs less than what industry experts predicted a lower range one would have just days before the reveal. The second generation Tesla Roadster beats expectations in every category. You can't make these products without tight control over manufacturing, otherwise somebody else would make equal or better vehicles but they don't, they stand alone.\n\n4. No argument there, just want to point out they never delivered a water down product from what they promised.\n\n5. It's been the same since the start, they're in a far better place now than 10 years ago and have huge losses mostly due to continued investments on expansion for production and charging infrastructure. Had they just stopped and collect money for luxury cars, their mission would not advance and critics would say they're a boutique manufacturer making cars for a niche market that will never go mainstream.\n\n\nTesla will die when there is a better flag bearer for the dream of EVs, a company that makes better electric cars in far higher numbers with even better infrastructure and a more ambitious expansion plan. For a time Faraday Future seemed to be that company but then lost funding, now we're back to square one. Lots of Chinese companies are trying to expand rapidly but if Tesla quality seemed dodgy, you ain't seen shit. Very few will try to maintain quality while expanding but we'll find out I guess.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00013528869506747773,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06672719027542229,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24860306390344838,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2709527882724953,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21018935698631225,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2745103582333099,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23273032205179334,"ev_1":-0.150370183043271,"ev_2":-0.2572434495523339,"ev_3":-0.06030657866237258,"ev_4":-0.150353312195269,"ev_5":-0.02148652303488537,"ev_6":-0.13480471522348317},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

In the top right corner of your it shows that you exported 387 Kwh, which means you self consumed about 213 Kwh based on the assumption that you generated about 600. So between the self consumption and your imports of 1418 Kwh (also in the top right of your bill), I would guess you used about 1631 Kwh for the month. I would agree with another comment that says this would indicate you are using a lot of electricity. \n\nDoes it sound reasonable that you might be using 50 Kwh/day? For comparison sake, we use about 60 Kwh/day on a hot summer day in SoCal when the A/C is running all day long for our 2000 sqft house. Do you have any appliances that are using a lot of electricity like an A/C, electric heaters, electric stove, oven, electric car charging, hot tub heater etc.? \n\nDepending on your electricity usage this may be normal. Perhaps your solar system is just a little undersized for your usage? We have a 9.6 Kw system and usually see 60 Kwh daily generation on a good day, so I’m going to guess yours is closer to 4 or 5 Kw? If your system is significantly larger than 4 or 5 Kw, say something like 10-15 Kw, I would say you may have an issue with part of your system being offline.\n\nAre you under NEM 2.0? How long have you had the system? If you’ve had the stem for over a year, how does it compare to last October? What is the size of your system? Do you have a home battery as a part of your system? How does your daily generation for October compare to when the system was new?\n\nAny additional info can help us identify normal operation or a malfunctioning system.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00014231602350870767,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08290025026904005,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21272490395453805,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08077737068136533,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.33873311409758267,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27309841140527574,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.252714699304003,"ev_1":-0.04514448644962007,"ev_2":-0.004764127217640635,"ev_3":-0.0170914998355632,"ev_4":-0.002279211961043378,"ev_5":-0.0019256488424919855,"ev_6":-0.015575847355648875},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Or ask about financing options where the credit isn’t applied to the principal.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0029610375446888306,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13402452739496623,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3102720969070301,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28372705766620737,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2695181317541434,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2671779330403581,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08914308777699868,"ev_1":-0.0018759419860240694,"ev_2":-0.23058014995573708,"ev_3":-0.0025626611022744328,"ev_4":-0.00030221139604691416,"ev_5":-0.0003623925246453534,"ev_6":-0.006102426622722608},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I never want to hear a motor at all again. That part doesn't go away with hybrids. You only get a taste of the EV experiences. \n\n> Altho let's not forget the huge problems with EVs. Some of the hybrids have a 500 mile range and of course they refuel in 5 minutes, which just puts EVs to complete shame. \n\nThat's not a general problem. That's a problem for a very specific use case.  I drive more than average (14k miles/yr) and very rarely exceed the modest 240 mile range of my truck in a day. I live rural, even. That's not even city driving. In fact, I would say a full EV is even better (for me) in this regard because almost never have to use public chargers or gas stations. I wake up every morning to a full charge. Maybe use a public charger once a month a most. \n\nHome charging is a game changes. \n\n> I still firmly believe that hydrogen-electric is the superior zero-emission technology but we're still seeing what the market will settle on.\n\nHydrogen?

I live in a rather large house with my family, and we use a pretty large amount of electricity (~11,000 kWh/year). I've been discussing it with a company called Next Step Living, and yesterday they got back to me with a quote for the system they would install. They figure that they can fit 24 panels on my southern facing roofs, generating a bit more than 8,000 kWh/year, and that system would cost me $54,000. Then they went over the state and federal tax credits, the SRECs, the 2.99% loan for the system, and after factoring in all of that I *should* be saving money compared to what I'm paying now. I've got two questions:\n\n1. Does anyone have experience with Next Step Living? Is this a reasonable quote for a system like this, installed?\n\n2. Would I be able to just buy the panels myself and install them? I've looked around a bit at panel prices, and I've found that the panels would cost me somewhere around $12,000. I've done electrical work before, I pulled a permit and did all of the electrical in the second story of my house when I rebuilt it, so I'm pretty comfortable doing the work myself.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.08474800984064738,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27328718507127664,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19828743212866706,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24592251179256813,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23002175238647518,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21583060294476106,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2667759083482508,"solar_1":-0.09879106012633311,"solar_2":-0.14031431261256863,"solar_3":-0.13842977759638653,"solar_4":-0.09142783158296824,"solar_5":-0.10943952020392707,"solar_6":-0.13894168432614432,"solar_7":-0.04506118040067383,"solar_8":-0.02988179087678249,"solar_9":-0.20701631747575358,"solar_10":-0.2699816691997906},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

It looks like  you (/u/sarcasmismysuperpowr ) have been quoted systems that are within about 3% or less in size. Is the Q Cells system a greater panel count to achieve the output? Count matters mostly in how efficiently the rooftop area will be used. If all of the three will fit with a lot of room to spare or without using multiple surfaces, it may not be a concern. You may have a preference on appearance of the panels, too.\n\nI would also ask Company 1 to distinguish the two systems quoted in detail with data and facts since they offer both.\n\nWarranties may matter to you in two ways: If you plan on living in the house long enough to test the warranties (10+ years?)  or if you want to maximize the added/marginal value of your house at a future sale and don't want to worry about a discriminating buyer. So it may be worthwhile to secure the better warranties if so.  Beware of being sold that panels are \"awesome.\" There are sound business practices in place when a manufacturer chooses to offer a 10 year or a 25 year warranty.

The short version the efficiency of wind turbines is measured by the Betz limit and the very very large horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT) are the most efficient thing we have measured. \n\nMostly everything else is smoke and mirrors. Furthermore in order to achieve efficiency they must be built to very large scale. \n\nThe power output does not decrease linearly as you make them smaller. Some small turbines have minimum startup speeds where they make essentially nothing below 8 MPH.\n\nHere is another article by a professior on engineering.com with the conclusion with turbines it's [go big or don't bother](https://www.engineering.com/ElectronicsDesign/ElectronicsDesignArticles/ArticleID/9556/Rooftop-Wind-Turbines-Are-They-Worthwhile.aspx). \n\nThere are some useful comments in response to Intel deciding to deploy rooftop turbines in [this article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/energy/renewables/intel-ups-its-green-game-with-a-rooftop-wind-farm). \n\nOne of the comments mentions a field trial by [treehugger](https://www.treehugger.com/wind-technology/silent-wind-turbines-could-generate-half-household-energy.html) of many small turbines and the results were abysmal.\n\nMany small turbines in the study simply broke and produced nothing. Quoting the comment that quotes that article:\n\n&gt;Residential wind turbines are simply a debacle, failure and sham. They do not generate a fraction of their claimed output, even in perfect sites with steady winds. This has been thoroughly proven with 3rd party testing - namely the cities of Reno, NV and Ellensburg, WA, who both installed, tested and documented both output and reliability of small wind turbines. The city of Ellensburg published a detailed report on November 1st, 2013 - titled \"Smart Grid Demonstration Project Completion Report.\" Here's some basic results of their testing of 9 small turbines:\n\n&gt;1KW \"Wingpower\" turbine = 109 kWh generated over the year. 2 units suffered wing failures, 3 units failed, each almost immediately after replacement.\n\n&gt;1.2KW \"Windspire\" VAWT = zero kWh output, generator &amp; inverter failure - manufacturer out of business.\n\n&gt;1.5KW \"WindTronix\" turbine = zero kWh output, wings torn off, non-operational\n\n&gt;2.5KW \"Energy Ball\" turbine = device consumes more power than it generates, currently operational\n\n&gt;10KW \"Tangarie\" VAWT = zero kWh output, turbine inoperable.\n\n&gt;4KW \"Urban Green\" VAWT = zero kWh ouput, generator failure, non-operable\n\n&gt;2.4KW \"Skystream\" = 111kWh a month, tower and turbine replaced once, company out of business\n\n&gt;Only the larger, conventional designed 12KW Ventura &amp; 10KW Bergey turbines performed well and didn't fail horribly within *THE FIRST YEAR* like every other small/micro turbine at the site. Micro turbine makers are simply selling snake oil.\n\n&gt;What's a shame is that Treehugger has showcased almost every turbine listed above when the manufacturer sent out press releases &amp; photos, but they have done almost zero follow-up to show that the turbines didn't work in testing and/or the manufacturers have since gone out of business.\n\n\nScale turbines work but small turbines are such a load of toxic junk science bullshit this fact should be added to the FAQ and people need to retaliate suggestions of using them more aggressively like homeopathy recommendations to treat cancer would be laughed out of medical circles.

For the design I was planning to use the PV LIB matlab code, but since it seems more focused on North America I am not sure this is the right choice. If someone has any suggestions for software focused on Africa that would be of great help. For the data I no longer have access to Meteonorm sadly, so I have been using PVGis data, but it lacks data for the altitude and azimuth of the sun, which I need for the code I wrote in Matlab to optimize the panel tilt. I realise this can be calculated easily but the code i wrote for this doesn't seem to work with changing land height. So if anyone knows of good sources for TMY data that would also help me out a lot!\n\nI am sorry if my request is a bit unclear, but I get very little guidance from my university and i would like to present a good project that can be actually useful. So in general I am looking for a bit of a nudge in the right direction to design a PV system for this factory, and any tools or sources that can be of help.\n\nThank you, and please ask me if anything needs to be clarified!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005186547544629624,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25462860122011294,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11972778343768703,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3191153012936146,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2677964651190968,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23800630054562893,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07425220361862254,"solar_1":-0.06346837755215044,"solar_2":-0.07873508577723044,"solar_3":-0.16039527761187364,"solar_4":-0.0657002674852265,"solar_5":-0.18155954618909959,"solar_6":-0.03347910312246919,"solar_7":-0.08002596910228021,"solar_8":-0.01564998056952997,"solar_9":-0.15913665727328993,"solar_10":-0.2220846527723579},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Most places in the US get about 5 hours of effective solar power per day, you milage might vary.\n2. Solar panels are a very unstable source of power and power output varies by external factors (clouds).\n\nWithout a battery you are basically limited to 5 hours use per day but even during those hours your output can vary.\n\nIt might be fine to have no battery if the device you want to run have its own battery, such as laptop and mobile phone. Even a fridge could be fine as it will keep the cold during temporary power loss although I suspect it might negatively reduce the lifetime of the compressor in the fridge if it randomly gets turned off and on.\n\nBut if you want to run a TV for example it will be pretty annoying to have it turn off every time a cloud passes by.\n\nAFAIK $3000 is actually a fairly high budget for such a small system. I would definitely recommend at least a 100 Ah lithium battery. It should easily fall into your budget with 500 W solar panels and charge controller.\n\nMyself I started with a 40 A MPPT EPEVER charge controller with 2x100 W panels and 35 Ah SLA battery. In retrospect I should probably have bought a 100 Ah lithium battery instead (now I got 2 x 35 Ah SLA). This change controller can support more panels.

You've got a 1.14 roof.   Very nice.   Here's your math:. You only need 8.27kw of solar to produce 9.438kwh of electricity.  Divide 9438/8270 = 1.14.  \n\nThat's a very efficient roof, very little shading.   The more efficient the roof is, the less solar we need to produce more electricity.  Common sense so far right?  This is how some solar companies leverage that (against) you.\n\nWe're going deep here now lol.   The underlying fundamental economic principle of financing a solar project is that it MUST provide 1st years savings to the customer.   If it doesn't, it will not be approved to be built.   Ironically, the reason for this is to prevent overpricing by dealers.    \n\nSo what happens is that some companies will max out the price of the system right to the point where the customer will realize some savings.   They especially prey on those with southern exposure and little shading.   \n\nAverage customer is satisfied because they're saving money on a monthly basis.   Solar rep/co is ecstatic because they are earning up to 3x they would on a lightly shaded east/west project.  \n\nI could write a book on this subject but will finish with this.    Because you have a very efficient 1.14 roof, you should get the very best price.   It doesn't cost the solar company more to put an 8.27kw system on a southern roof than it does an east/west.   That idea is laughable.   The costs are exactly the same.   They can't charge the east/west customer with a roof that's .92 efficient $4.43 a watt because the system won't provide 1st years savings, so they get it from you.   \n\nI won't approve a system past $3.65 a watt unless there are what we call \"adders\".  An adder is what it sounds like - something that adds to the cost of the basic system.   Steel roof, snow/critter guards, panel upgrades etc.    Everyone knows this from day one so if they're in solar to make a killing they can keep looking.     BTW, that's your Sunpower number.   I used to be up the food chain a bit with them.   Good company.  But not the only good one.   Tell them up to $3.65 a watt.  Solar is math.  They showed you theirs.

I live in the Austin suburbs and I'm super happy with being connected to civilization in general, LOL.  I like ordering from DoorDash and am perfectly happy with being connected to a multitude of services like natural gas, city water, etc.  The difference to me is only one of these services is incredibly unreliable: the electrical grid.\n\nIt is the electrical grid in particular which has been an ongoing frustration to me for years.  Before living in Austin I lived in the San Francisco area, and due to wildfire risk the utilities (PG&E) would proactively shut off the power several times a year.  Also, if a tree fell over on the electrical power lines going to our town power would go out for an indeterminate amount of time.  Might be 10 minutes, might be 10 hours, PG&E would never tell us an accurate estimate or explain the reason.  And maybe PG&E didn't even know.  But this \"unreliable\" part of electricity and the lack of clear, true communication from PG&E caused me a lot of stress and annoyance.   \n\nHere is an example: I had a small gasoline generator when I lived in California, so when the grid electrical power went out to our rental house, I would go fetch the generator out of the garage, fill it with gasoline from a jerry can, fire it up, then start stringing long extension cords all over our house to a few floor standing lamps.  Just about the time everything was setup, the electrical grid would come back alive making all that work useless.  So then I had to put away all the extension cords and the generator.  \n\nThere were two things that the electrical grid power companies could have done and I would have never considered house batteries.  **EITHER** of these things would have prevented me from ever wanting house batteries:  the electrical grid companies could have been higher reliability (fewer outages), or simply tell me honest and accurate estimates of when electrical power would be restored.  Either one alone would have been enough.\n\nNow that my house (in Austin) is setup better and has batteries, it is glorious and makes me so happy.  When the electrical grid goes dark, everything is completely automatic and my house stays up and running and I don't have to rewire ANYTHING with extension cords.  The internet stays up, the lights work, everything.  But for multiple day outages, I needed some way to recharge the batteries, and solar is quiet and has few moving parts.\n\nSo that brings me to the final stage of my emotional journey.  I'm getting these gigantic bills from the electrical power company, yet they do a terrible job, and I am not using almost any of their product.  So the question comes up: can I disconnect from them entirely in protest?  I am very unusual for a \"solar panel\" person in that I think 99% of people installing solar panels want to save money as their primary reason for doing it.  \n\nThat isn't me, I don't care at all about the money.  My motivation is I no longer wish to do business with the electrical grid companies.  I feel \"abused\" by them.  I wish to sever our business relationship entirely.  And I am willing to spend extra money to make that occur if I can figure it out.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3059840435680524,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3428748364327475,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19139728202552275,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21280644045816913,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19411125476551572,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23121402653691803,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1824791861904855,"solar_1":-0.23652867997929305,"solar_2":-0.1900909553764769,"solar_3":-0.15289405361651956,"solar_4":-0.061812934008558196,"solar_5":-0.079894795125429,"solar_6":-0.031839718728169035,"solar_7":-0.044384592916494034,"solar_8":-0.15450383793040773,"solar_9":-0.016523948401498956,"solar_10":-0.39344569458339584},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

And the company itself likes to brag that pretty much everyone has an EV (of some kind; for example one does have a truck for actual work, but otherwise rides a Zero Electric).\n\nIf you want to see if the \"range is there\", go to https://abetterrouteplanner.com and punch in some routes, see what it looks like to drive electric. Also visit https://www.plugshare.com/ to see what the charging infrastructure looks like. Most people are surprised by how extensive it is. I joke that my ancient phone gags when I pull up chargers in places like the greater LA area or Silicon Valley, there are so many options.\n\n2-3 year average battery life is utter BS, even if you're talking about the 12V. Even the 3-4 year comment is a little conservative for the 12V, let alone the traction battery. The 12V is like any car's battery though or close enough. Mine's the original and cranking along fine at going on five years, if with me keeping an eye on it like any 12V.\n\nI've had my 2019 Bolt since late 2018, and the only reason I have a new traction battery is that there was that recall. That happened in 2021 so what, did I get the swap \"just in time\"? I know of at least one person who did his swap on a 2017 Bolt he bought in late 2016 with more than 150k miles on it, I think in the early 2022 timeframe. Another outlier? Doubtful and see federal & state requirements on battery warranties.\n\nBatteries aren't cheap in a \"yes, and?\" kind of way. I've seen numbers between $4k and $20, depending on what kind, but it just isn't happening in the amount talked about. Even a car like the Leaf, which the older models were famous for degradation... IIRC Nissan wanted to turn these old degraded batteries into powerwall like devices, but not enough people swapped their batteries out. If a \"bad car\" (not really, just older generation) doesn't fit that mold, what does it say about newer generations?\n\nI have heard some horror stories on Tesla maintenance, but they're anecdotal and I've also heard good stories. I've had generally good for the limited needs I've had, very commensurate with my ICE experience.\n\nYou can always wait 2-3 years and see better tech; that's been the case for the last ten plus years. It will likely always be the case. If you need something now it might not be the *best* time to buy, but I've seen headlines about less of a backlog of orders, so maybe good? This more from avoiding dealer add-ons for non-Tesla, but also as I keep seeing headlines about prices finally not being totally ludicrous.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.021524785707394283,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2061913431788085,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.31982606865611274,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06224524943778912,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.03403132629182437,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2240181385811032,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1565038910290847,"solar_1":-0.2080494545904609,"solar_2":-0.08367183693917468,"solar_3":-0.04563560077015912,"solar_4":-0.07995240387178153,"solar_5":-0.003200441729859449,"solar_6":-0.05563769724115749,"solar_7":-0.009728554878771925,"solar_8":-0.015777551815820818,"solar_9":-0.05147747274028802,"solar_10":-0.08631611832242925},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Like the point that solar and wind do not have to meet the ridiculously high standards required for new nuclear facilities. I have ignored, at least in this particular post, that solar and wind have been killing birds, possibly linked to beachings of whales and other whale deaths (offshore wind farms), shading out thousands of acres of desert thereby reducing plant growth, creating non-porous surfaces so when rain does fall in these locations it increases the risk of flooding and washout. Solar and wind are just like hydropower was, the supposed savior technology that is eventually shown to cause their own ecological devastation. \n\nWhat's the cost of replacement of solar arrays/panels every 10-15 years? How about the cost of disposing of worn-out solar arrays/panels? How about the costs of disposal of windturbine components and replacements? Everything has costs. We know exactly what nuclear can do and what it's waste can do. We, as of right now, have little to no idea what the long-term costs of solar and wind power will be. The real irony is that of the three, only nuclear can do away with fossil fuels in their entirety. Why do you think fossil fuel companies support \"renewables\"? Oh right, for the forseeable future (i.e. the next century or so) fossil fuels will be required to offset the low production periods of solar and wind. Funny how Germany decided to phase out all nuclear and ended up being more reliant on coal and natural gas than they were before their big push to switch to \"renewables\". And what are the Germans and French and a few other European countries doing now? Oh yeah, investing in new nuclear plants. \n\nFace it.

Actually, my grandparents are a bit ignorant of modern dieting, but we tend to not blame them.\n\nI've subscribed to this subreddit, and I intend on dropping in daily.  I'm trying to fix up, and I definitely hear what you're saying.  This year, I have access to the dining hall, next year, it's going to be the dining hall again, but after that I hope to have access to a car and be able to purchase food at the grocery store.  I'm certain that I will have plenty of fresh, decent food available, I live in Lancaster, so local farming/farmers markets are readily available in walking distance (especially on Saturday).\n\nLike I said, I'm pushing back slowly towards vegetarianism.  I must admit, I have a poor habit of falling for quality bacon or beef if it appears before me.  Dining hall meat doesn't really appeal too much to me, but the Grill nearby is enticing.  Surprisingly, I don't have much trouble with personal fitness.  Since I've arrived at college, I intentionally put on a freshman fifteen of what appears to be mostly muscle (I used to be somewhat underweight, although after some discussion with my parents and doctor, it was concluded that it was plenty healthy --&gt; I'm 5'7.75'' and 123.5 lbs).  Our campus gym resources are phenomenal, my main goal right now is building cardiovascular endurance and maintaining leanness, not bulking up.\n\nTotal non-sequitor: I know the medical opinion on it, but how practically easy do you find it to eat breakfast?  I'm a huge fan of oats/granola/nuts and yoghurt, along with fruit.  Is there a good blend for breakfast, and if so, how would I pack it to bring to class (my professors don't care if you eat in their class... I can't stress how underrated this is).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.21589510994309766,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11632600396530636,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18111177581763255,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2242190415471698,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08135369629599154,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25111440059898277,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16075496859654473,"diet_1":-0.1940444336575363,"diet_2":-0.028915600693532422,"diet_3":-0.10823430508753518,"diet_4":-0.1228054546807698,"diet_5":-0.22977244714202333,"diet_6":-0.2848731228612742,"diet_8":-0.06484451854339568,"diet_9":-0.1624292788716654,"diet_10":-0.14351126537975703,"diet_11":-0.1368146231082695,"diet_13":-0.08965902228374034,"diet_14":-0.287152343672157,"diet_17":-0.13191010404504291},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I was raised Mormon and people would even quote scriptures at me telling me that what I was doing was wrong. Guess what? It only strengthened my resolve.

Feminism is a movement where the most privileged voices tend to be the loudest, there's large groups of feminists who still reject and harm transgender women, the most celebrated figures tend to be very \"women's studies 101.\" And yet, despite those problems, we agree that feminism as an ideal is still worth supporting.

Instead of following advice from a particular pop diet, there are better sources of information you might be able to use.  \n\n--------\n\nFor example, here are some [simple recipes and guides to vegan nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/b974w6/good_resources_for_vegan_recipes/ek2qi1z/) (the first guide is basic, the second much more detailed for deeper questions, and both are written by Registered Dietitians).  \n\nIf you want to actually collect information as to what kind of nutrition you are getting through diet, one way to do that would be to track what you eat (keep a small notebook or on your phone write down everything you eat, and the amounts) for a few days, then put it into a free nutrient tracking app or website like https://cronometer.com/.  Once you find out what is missing, you can correct it.  Although protein deficiency is [practically never](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/fbfv14/reintroducing_eggs_to_my_plantbased_diet/fj419h9/) a primary nutritional problem, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/9q6lt9/protein_without_so_many_carbs/e87zxur/) is a list of higher protein foods, and you can look up specific foods high in any other particular nutrient to add using a food database search tool like https://nutritiondata.self.com/tools/nutrient-search.  This does take a little time and effort, but it is otherwise free to do.  \n\n-------\n\nEven if you [can't use them](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/75xoy5/im_allergic_to_nuts_and_legumes_what_are_some/do9urgp/), there are many sources of the protein and nutrition found in beans.  There are also some unusual sources in extreme cases, like direct lysine supplements (lysine is usually the limiting amino acid in plant-based diets) even if you couldn't find suitable whole foods which provided it at all.  \n\nWhy don't you try tracking your diet for a little while, to see what you may or may not actually be getting, rather than assuming it's a protein issue?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005367032329862317,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11808930860847652,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1886577451821827,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11363322970767815,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24880404767958453,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2552548857067194,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12102583846232544,"diet_1":-0.021591279209436227,"diet_2":-0.0005752386108094735,"diet_3":-0.009536649859605006,"diet_4":-0.003514026700334701,"diet_5":-0.0010165652201976627,"diet_6":-0.0017971620327443816,"diet_8":-0.00013869230982284839,"diet_9":-0.0007084027777940113,"diet_10":-0.006971972286310783,"diet_11":-0.0013482721017984052,"diet_13":-0.0034775202463279697,"diet_14":-0.05646561136624465,"diet_17":-0.00012129453959156915},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I was veggie for several years before going vegan, granted it was harder back then but we should also remember that not every town has the availability that a big city does and so perhaps it's still quite hard for many. Also as you say they are much closer to vegan, likely far more open to veganism and on their way there. I can't say that I was vegan when I went to the animal rights march but I made my own leaflets that listed cruelty free and non CF cosmetic brands and handed them out to the crowds en route, so I was still doing the best I could at that time.

I’ll be reviewing the following: \n\n1. Follow your heart smoked Gouda \n2. Follow your heart mozzarella \n3. Follow your hear cheddar\n4. Violife smoked provolone \n5. Myokos pepper jack \n\n1. The follow your heart smoked gouda is absolutely delicious and is on the more affordable end of the spectrum at 6.99, I gave some to my non vegan roomate and she was amazed and surprised to know that it is vegan. This cheese has a strong but not pungent smoked flavour and goes well with a grilled cheese or crackers and I even like to eat it by itself that’s how good it is 10/10 would recommend. \n\n2 the follow your heart mozzarella is a lot milder than the smoked gouda, I would even go as far as calling it a little plain it melts nicely and is good in sandwiches the best way I would describe the flavour is mild butter with a slits but of a very mild acidity. It’s good but nothing spectacular. \n\n3. The follow your hear cheddar is very comparable to the mozzarella but I would say it has a slight edge because it is slightly sharper therefore it has a bit more flavour, I prefer it to the  mozzarella for that reason but there taste is very similar in my opinion. \n\n4. The violife smoked provolone is another extremely tasty cheese which is comparable to the follow your hear smoked gouda. I think the major difference between the violife and the follow your heart is that the follow your heart has a stronger smoky flavour while the violife is more subtle but it’s very good regardless like all the follow your hear cheeses it melts beautifully and can be eaten by itself which is important to me because I snack on cheese regularly. \n\n5. Myokos pepper jack is interesting, in the sense that it contains the most protein. I won’t lie I’m not the biggest fan of it when it’s by itself, but when it’s nice and melted it tastes really close to pepper jack but out of all the cheeses mentione it is slightly more expensive and personally if I was paying more I would expect for the cheese to be formidable which this one was not. \n\nSo my ranking would go 1. Follow your heart smoked gouda 2. Violife smoked provolone 3. Follow your heart cheddar 4. Follow your heart mozzarella 5. Myokos pepper jack.\n\nYou can’t go wrong with buying any of the cheeses because they are all delicious but some do have a better flavour than others.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"yes","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0017623620636489552,"1.1.1_stance":-0.184462571433437,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19262208904348854,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20758424176193885,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17607939537644637,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20863787879720463,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18262643621779265,"diet_1":-0.15359493033611216,"diet_2":-0.1719683007807665,"diet_3":-0.14059858121736396,"diet_4":-0.10128081347191492,"diet_5":-0.052975296894146595,"diet_6":-0.17043273146469304,"diet_8":-0.03613346793645178,"diet_9":-0.20805436329217838,"diet_10":-0.1052728652261084,"diet_11":-0.15482741818169388,"diet_13":-0.05203618853314159,"diet_14":-0.08763096566447832,"diet_17":-0.020252258585969685},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.
