So for this case, then yes, storage works well.\n\nRooftop solar energy never appears as energy independently of other generation, as what it actually does is to reduce the load in the locality of where the rooftop PV is, and thus that generated energy isn't separately available to be stored once it gets past the export meter.  What it does is (ELI5 version) to reduce the demand on some specific parts of the generation system, and in New Zealand, these parts are mostly hydro anyway.  Thus if one attempted to capture this \"saved\" energy one would be using hydro energy to pump water up a hill, which (all things being equal) is not a smart thing to do, because there are round trip losses involved, so one may as well not burn the water in the first place and thus not suffer the round trip losses.\n\nNote that parts of this answer is New Zealand specific, other counties may arrange their distribution of generation tasks differently to how we do it here.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.10697795838738482,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11553065703760694,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2641185481374253,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16094060566405724,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23816892377666135,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1467740169139944,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.35311516648046865,"ev_1":-0.08370900732638525,"ev_2":-0.060230850978162685,"ev_3":-0.18522723474598024,"ev_4":-0.0525650875242718,"ev_5":-0.0424757248001697,"ev_6":-0.14281637979909237},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

An electric vehicle has a higher purchase price than a comparable ICE car, due to the cost of the battery and the lack of economies of scale in production (most EVs only sell at most a few thousand per year). Additionally, EVs are getting significantly better every year, while current models are in some cases considered poor compliance cars. The combination of those two things means that an EV that is new now is likely going to be fairly worthless in just a few years.

I disagree with the article on the idea that auto-manufacturers will be affected. If the market in Colorado is not ready for widespread EV adoption, then dealerships will be forced to sell at a loss to move EVs as well as piling expenses from maintenance costs. Most manufacturers' already have their own line of EVs so meeting their sales quota won't be hard, when it's smaller dealerships that are usually on the line for financial losses. I'm all in favor for more EV adoption, but not at the cost of bankrupting dealerships and losing jobs.\n\nI'm definitely hoping this will all turn out okay, or at least, manageable. A problem I see right away with the California Air Resources Board's implementation of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Credits system (which is what Colorado's commission voted for) is that there's biases toward long-range EVs such that this obviously favors Toyota Prius', which is clear market manipulation.\n\n&gt;Auto manufacturers are required to produce a number of ZEVs and plug-in hybrids each year, based on the total number of cars sold in California by the manufacturer. Manufacturers with higher overall sales of all vehicles are required to make more ZEVs. **Requirements are in terms of percent credits, ranging from 4.5 percent in 2018 to 22 percent by 2025. Auto manufacturers are to produce vehicles and each vehicle receives credits based on its electric driving range.

There are a lot of dirty diesels around. It's nice that they have plans, but they're definitely lagging on this one.* Poor metric. It's not about what was. Way more important is what they are encouraging moving forward. In lots of way they are pushing EVs way better than in the states. In particular, EU incentives are much better for consumers, driving significantly higher per capita adoption.\n2. *\"Batteries finally becoming feasible in a car.\" Yup. Tesla pioneered that, and was laughed at for using \"laptop batteries\" in their original Roadster. Now every automaker is going in that direction, and following the \"Giga factory\" battery production model as well. Tesla proved it was a good idea.* There is nothing specifically \"Tesla\" about this. Tesla did usher a sea change into the industry, but it's not about batteries. It has always been about manufacturing. Giga is an important part of this, but it's not about making batteries \"feasible in a car\" and all about ensuring that they are not supply constrained.\n3. *The aftermarket of \"Dieselgate\" is that many folks no longer trust German car makers. I don't. I had an Audi A6 Diesel in the USA. It would have been a great car if they weren't willfully lying about emissions.* If you don't trust a country because of past mistakes, you should have probably have stopped buying German in 1945...and probably stop buying US in 2020. All automakers lie about all sorts of stuff to improve their position. Do I wish it didn't happen? Absolutely. Does it mean that these companies can do good things after the fact? Absolutely not.\n4. *It's not like they couldn't see this coming. Hell, they didn't do anything until Tesla started eating their lunch in the high end export market and they lost significant share. Pointing out it takes time is pointing out how stupid they are.* Sigh. Not even going to respond to this one except to say that legacy automakers are in a very different position than start-ups. It puts them at a disadvantage in a lot of ways in the transition to EVs, but it doesn't make them stupid.\n5. *Tesla built the first desirable EV, long before any of the other manufactures got off of their asses. And they've mastered the software game in a way that the traditional manufacturers may \\*never\\* catch up to. It's built into everything they do. Assuming the traditional manufacturers can pivot to this -- and the EU manufacturers have never been known for software innovation -- it will take years for them to align their process to catch up with where Tesla is today. Good luck with that.* This is clearly fanboyism. There are lots of places in the world where Tesla is in the market, but isn't the #1 EV manufacture. That is, the consumer disagrees with what you are stating and they are voting with their hard earned cash. There are places where Telsa is clearly ahead (software, range), but also places where they are clearly behind (fit and finish, customer service).

I will look at the Chevys and the Nissan Ariya.  I have a (possibly unfounded) knee-jerk reaction that mid-level American brands are generally not as reliable as the Asian cars.  I think that was the case 20-30 yrs ago.  Not sure it is any more.\n\nI heard something about the Hyundai (and Kia I would expect) charging faster than other platforms. I wonder why?  And I assume the level 3 charing issue that you mentioned is related to that.  So charging in general...   Do all of these cars have multiple charging levels?  When you are 100 mi from home in the PNW - will they all be chargeable at the same chain stations?  I also read that one car in particular - I think it was the new all-e Toyota RAV4 - had a range of 250 mi, that dropped to 200 when you run AC.  Is that common?  I wonder much you can change these various cars in 10 or 12 hrs at night on 110V house current?\n\nSeems you are saying that in the PNW, the  Ioniq5 is a popular option for mass market semi-luxury.  I must say, kinda like that car.  The sales dealer experience is not as important to me as the dealer follow-up & maintenance experience.  The language around  \"...a new part gets out in circulation.\" makes it sound more like a phone or computer update than a car.  (Which may be the new reality).  Aside from tires and maybe brakes, I would guess these cars are not going into a local independent auto repair - hence concern about ongoing maintenance and repair - or maybe it is now termed 'support'.\n\nI am pretty ok with technology, but at 69 yrs old not a 'digital native' I grew up pretty analog...  But I like cool toys and good design as much as the next guy.  I originally liked the Tesla, but not so sure anymore...  \n\nWhat would you get or suggest?  Retired, no young kids, I would put a tow hitch on for a bike rack.  I regularly do errands and see friends around town (20-40 mi days, and 60-100 mi out and 60-100 mi back to a good hiking spot would not be that unusual.  Other than that - sporty, stylish, fun-to-drive, but able to carry lumber or camping stuff on occasion.

It could cause weird issues that make the car inoperable. I know even tapping the low-voltage DC on a Tesla can cause issues since the system carefully monitors power flows, I imagine Rivian is similar.\n\nTapping the motors also doesn't sound like a great idea. Backfeeding power into the system as \"regen\" might cause some system errors. You could have the generator only feed the motor and never backfeed the HV battery directly, basically now you have a hybrid vehicle where pressing the pedal up to ~9kW uses gas power. But this is all complicated and requires a bunch of components, and doesn't sound super safe to me...if built improperly, your system could feed the motors power at the wrong moment and cause a traction loss, etc.\n\nWhat if you just settle for an auto-charging system? You could get a 5 - 10kWh LFP battery and toss that in the frunk as well, and the generator can charge that while in motion (and it'll act as a buffer into the car.) Then connect the battery through an inverter into the AC input pins in the car (this is going to be easier than stepping up to 480V DC, anyways.) There are then lots of options to rig up manual or automatic systems to start charging whenever you are stopped. You could even charge while at long stoplights, depending on how long a Rivian takes to start and stop charging and shift into drive...partly solves the driving use case for stop and go traffic, at least.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00017710795509628952,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22687863956517212,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.28414287853266085,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28224211563883694,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06846675533303462,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17006470434600096,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13537965373446545,"ev_1":-0.008265266318630893,"ev_2":-0.002602912015087592,"ev_3":-0.008818589073295394,"ev_4":-0.01753791004011873,"ev_5":-0.0012944507931630749,"ev_6":-0.23501632500884118},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I know master electrician with megawatt level experience, who gets paid $25 an hour, because he has no clue how much things cost or any desire to learn.\n\nIf you learn how to design rooftop solar arrays, even if it's preliminary design, your skills would be useful to a commercial construction company, which has no clue where to buy solar material from. I am not a structural engineer nor in electrical engineer, but my designs get passed to those individuals for signoff.  During construction I travel to site to instruct the work crew on how to put the thing together.\n\nBy enabling a building contractor to use his engineering team, accounting team, procurement team, and labor resources, I basically create a sewer department which I am in charge of. This company is much more qualified to bid on large projects than myself, and that's how I've climbed my way into being the project lead on megawatt level projects. \n\nBut you could apply this to the residential market to. Selling solar kits that include a balance of system material and installation instructions, would allow homeowners to use their preferred electrician and roofer to install the solar array, usually for under $2.50/w. If you appropriately explain how it's better for them to use their preferred craft labor, versus a solar contractor, substantial cost savings can be justified. \n\nFurthermore, the cause is noble as we need to get costs down to stand on our own 2 feet without subsidy. As far as the solar guy goes, he should be the guy on site getting paid $100 an hour to show the electrician and roofer what to do. \n\nIn my opinion the current solar contractor business model is a subsidy driven business model that should go away when the subsidies phase out.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.014424954541027546,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3579409924025337,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21575358772439956,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2263811578476894,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10773523052748372,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24641439976005103,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24675073741946227,"solar_1":-0.13973119729856465,"solar_2":-0.09946461494588481,"solar_3":-0.06788665546143118,"solar_4":-0.04128326969142412,"solar_5":-0.0034694632583220177,"solar_6":-0.2886418184498325,"solar_7":-0.018719922156985074,"solar_8":-0.054009035088408076,"solar_9":-0.2207490600036787,"solar_10":-0.1624099131088921},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (for the solar guy in the text)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

This kind of process takes a long time but when green energy becomes cheap to produce in a developed country it also becomes cheaper for an under developed country.

Depends on your building inspector I suppose. \n\nI think fireman roof access is one of the more important (and visually obvious) code issues a home could face, and will just get increasingly important in the future. It can be very difficult to rejigger the solar array to make it code compliant. Removing one module on a typical residential string inverter system often means remove two or three more modules, such that the circuits remain uniform in volts + amps. But this could also result in not providing the inverter enough power to turn on, such that your system \"sleeps in\" in the morning and \"clocks out early\". The end result is the solar array might be ~15% less powerful, and the cost of the modification work might push the system payback out maybe 1-2 years as well. But that's really not all that bad in the grand scheme of things. Even with the modification cost, the array will take more off the electric bill than it will add to the mortgage. It's just a hassle to find someone competent and willing to do it.\n\nI'm not sure if the setback would apply to a detached garage.

Remember, we're not at that point where we're making solar panels through manufacturing facilities which are powered by renewable energy... but China's policy does inhibit the growth of industries which adhere to stricter environmental standards as well as the development of technologies which use significantly less energy in manufacturing (i.e. CIGS). Letting much dirtier Chinese industries dominate the process might be good for the solar industry, but it comes at the expense of the environment.\n\nBefore other redditors jump in to make the energy payback argument, do you really want to claim that any solar, no matter how it is produced, is a good thing? At a very high level, anti-environmentalists will argue that burning fossil fuels is a good thing, as the benefits brought by raising the standard of living outweigh the detriments of carbon pollution. That sounds awfully similar to the argument that solar modules made by the dirtiest of processes are great for the environment than any alternatives... because we get more solar that way!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm against the import tariffs, especially at their current levels. I don't buy into the fact that China is primarily responsible for Solyndra + Unisolar's downfall. But there is no free lunch - part of the environmental benefits realized from cheap solar power generation in the United States come at the environmental detriment of China. \n\nWhat I am saying is Will should stick to the economic arguments. Did the Department of Treasury clearly prove that China was dumping modules below cost? If the same standards were applied to today's market vs. 2007-2009, would China still be considered as a dumper? Is the department of Treasury verdict politically motivated, given that the US government as a creditor of Solyndra/Unisolar might use the dumping verdit to sue Trina/Yingli/SunTech for compensation? Can the US government in good faith argue that their manufacturer loans are dissimilar to China's, given that the DOE loans went towards scaling up manufacturing rather than purely R&amp;D?\n\nThere is an abundance economically-based anti-tariff counterarguments that deserve exploration. But stating that the import tariff is \"likely to do a lot more harm than good\" reveals an ignorance to the upstream side of solar, which few installers are willing to explore while chasing the bottom dollar in the race toward grid-parity...","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.10194373646906267,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18495003117852044,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.06875648659964402,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2383895625213781,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19740898341296287,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30619781832844883,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.007741717039607465,"solar_1":-0.22626234902175688,"solar_2":-0.19092483970917443,"solar_3":-0.09799849245852481,"solar_4":-0.033305975156205626,"solar_5":-0.016427118418505415,"solar_6":-0.055477426498934314,"solar_7":-0.002530326989168922,"solar_8":-0.007510046103561763,"solar_9":-0.08706018270822824,"solar_10":-0.16019506896554958},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

It took public 4 years to finally learn these were rip-offs.  Also, the numbers the solar sales people show potential customers during their sales pitches may be inaccurate, if not fraudulent.\n\nFor example, a lot of homes will see a significant rate decrease later this year from their utility company.  This could be over $50 savings per month for many homes, which is effectively the same as $50/month increase in cost of solar.  Also, significant changes are coming to solar rate plans in the next few years that will likely cost solar owners an extra $50-$100/month. These changes are just now starting to be implemented by the utility companies and good bet that we will see more changes in the future that will further increase cost of solar. \n\nAdd it all up and solar in CA will soon cost about $100 to 150/month more than it did a few years ago.

OP asked a generic question and I gave him a generic answer. You don't know me or how I operate.  You'll also note that I asked him to get in touch if he wanted a quote. \n\nSo let's put the cards on the table.  The company I work with is called Supergreen Solutions.  It is Townsville based and started 19 years ago.  We now have over 40 stores in 9 countries and are Australia's biggest Powerwall 2 account.  We have already over 50 installs behind us and are in the process of putting in 800 in one residential development alone. \n\nIn the past 12 months Supergreen solutions has started it's Queensland expansion. We now have a store in Cairns as well as sales presences in Brisbane, Gold Coast, Maryborough and are now servicing Mount Isa and Western Queensland. We are members of the HIA and the QMBA and are involved in significant projects up to an industrial scale in Australia and in PNG.  We continue to expand based on a successful business model focused on customer satisfaction. \n\nOur Australian website is www.supergreensolutions.com.au and a simple Google search will validate everything I say.  In addition we're not just a solar company but provide a whole range of solutions including hot water, insulation, LED and ventilation to name a few. Our goal is to provide the best solution, not just the best solar system.  \n\nThrough my association with this company I have over a hundred satisfied customers this year alone and have three teams of installers fully booked until Christmas. I'm not saying that to brag about our success, but you don't get that volume of referrals unless you put your customers first and give them exactly what they want. \n\nMy point being that we fully aware of \"those salesmen\" operating in the industry, but I am not one of them.  You will note that I asked OP to get in touch if he wanted a quote.  What would happen next is I would find out his contact details and arrange for either myself or one of our other operators to go and see him, find out exactly what his loads were (including his power setup) and ensure he got exactly what he wanted for a fair price backed by full after sales service. \n\nI still maintain that micro inverters are not the way to go particularly in a place as sun rich as Australia (there is a reason enphase are losing money hand over fist). Though by all means explain why a customer would pay for micros over a standard string?\n\nOptimizers are only required if you have a shading problem.  Why would you use them if you can get 32kwh out of a standard 6.4kw system? Out west some of our 6.4kw systems are producing over 40kwh. Why would I even pretend it's in the best interests of my clients to pay an extra $3k for an optimized system in those circumstances?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-8.431339059219074e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3093115935722987,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11466331872941282,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18011344925245254,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10137113315968488,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3379152865602963,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0648966906495237,"solar_1":-0.1708470057502405,"solar_2":-0.1312023514620849,"solar_3":-0.003668499124008425,"solar_4":-0.019562311435947777,"solar_5":-0.004553690142832541,"solar_6":-0.025260362987561773,"solar_7":-0.02144501292301963,"solar_8":-0.03352292104439888,"solar_9":-0.04976072894040584,"solar_10":-0.11385095061268657},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

Let's also assume there are 32 teams per league, and 8 leagues for 256 total teams, but only half of them are in season at a given time.  That means 512 flights per week, or an average of about 73 flights per day.\n\n[The FAA says there are an average of 45,000 flights per day](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers/) (pre-pandemic), so sports teams account for roughly 0.2% of U.S. air travel.  And globally airplanes make up around 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  So yes, professional athletes have high individual carbon footprints.  But ending sports charter jets isn't the climate change solution I'd put a lot of effort into right now.\n\n(This isn't to say that sports teams shouldn't try to reduce their overall emissions.  Everyone should do their part!  That could be by changing league schedules to require less travel.  Or maybe there would be an even bigger impact by changing something else about the game, like tweaking concessions at their stadium: does the visiting team's charter flight or ten thousand hot dogs have a bigger carbon footprint?

Here is how it was explained to me:  the SREC’s are in increments of 1k kwh produced. So 1k kWh = 1 SREC. The system is calculated over 15 years of production, and it’s paid to you, up front, about 12 months after your system install. A percentage, approx 10%, is paid to a monitoring company. This is the contract you received. Obvious the utility is paying for 15 years of production and wants to make sure you produce as you said. Then 5% is charged to a credit card, etc by the utility. If your system is equal or greater than estimated/sold production, nothing happens. If it under produces, then part of the 5% is used to repay some of the SREC’s. I’m not sure how often that calculates.  Often 15 years you should get the 5% or whatever is left back from the utility.  Ultimately I don’t think it is a predatory contract. The only issue is if your installer over estimates your production, but I think most of them go conservative on the number. \n\nIn the end, its a funky execution, but combined with Fed credits your out of pocket is 40-50% of the total system cost. Plus we can still get into the 1:1 net metering if you are on a local utility.

I made a pretty good living selling engine electrics, lots and lots of wiring harness for everything from classic cars to mining equipment...\n\nTime, moisture &amp; dissimilar metals were 99% the killers of origional wiring harnesses. \n\nI covered the major things, like PV panel wire...

Since welding cables get dragged around industral sites, get UV from sun, and concentrated UV from welding, and it has a minimum of 600 volt rating at high amperage, pretty much a no brainer.\n\nIF... you have much experience with weather, chemical or job site wiring, then you know that dissimilar metals thing is real, and is only aggravated when moisture is introduced.\n\nSilver bearing electrical solder to 'Tin' the bare copper wire, to create a sealed, low resistance electrical connection, then heavy, self sealing heat shrink for environmental protection.\n\nNo sense in introducing what's usually highly corrosive base metals into the joint. No sense in using that resistive base metal butt connector to make a connection, and no sense in using a short piece of low grade heat shrink that has a high probability of being punctured during the crimp process, or leaking, degrading/splitting, etc.\n\nWrong application for those things in something exposed to cold, high heat, moisture, UV, and expecting it to live 20 to 30 years without fail. \n\nI guess I could go into the chemical properties/metallurgy of silver in electrical solder, but if you haven't grasped these basics then that would be wasted time.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00030802665908898536,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18248549404383851,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2391672604079229,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.34270713433512645,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08621184021399579,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.07785408928369482,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.008191516700511178,"solar_1":-0.0590283417138077,"solar_2":-0.021830273028172087,"solar_3":-0.1425382998076603,"solar_4":-0.09353715177712729,"solar_5":-0.18261214039254506,"solar_6":-0.2844469153418109,"solar_7":-0.03999129303944452,"solar_8":-0.00708032828940001,"solar_9":-0.17411231969163055,"solar_10":-0.32608160465168257},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

What was your cost with delivery fees and consumption for the year in the form of kw rate compared to your new solar rate.

My system is 15kw system producing 18.5kw I am over producing bc upgrading hvac and eliminating a pond with 3 large pumps. My rate is .16kw. \nFinance fees have gone up and so have dealer fees with inflation. If anyone thinks power will get cheaper here out is cray. Power will continue to rise especially as we close more coal plants as we have been bc they are considered “dirty”. Anyone who does not get gov kick back for solar will kick them selves later down the road as energy costs rise.

And we can show them that by providing them with vegan food and other vegan products (as well as nutritional information for those concerned about that). \n\n&gt;But, given my experiences with people, mass conversion is not an option. The vast majority of people don't care.\n\nI believe you will find the same problem with either lab meat or veganism. \n\n&gt;Some people can be made vegan, but as long as that involves the minor hardships currently associated with veganism, the number will be very small.\n\nFortunately, it is getting easier and easier. But people need to know *why* they should go vegan. The answer to that is that exploiting animals is wrong. That's the only explanation that makes sense when it comes to people becoming actual vegans (versus just reducing consumption of certain animal products). And it's undercut when we say, \"Oh, well, exploitation isn't *really* wrong\" -- and that's what we're saying if we promote animal exploitation, such as lab meat, that some exploitation is o.k. \n\nSpreading the consistent message that animal exploitation is wrong, period, does get people to change. I've seen it happen personally. It's truly powerful. Telling people that this form of exploitation is better than this form and that they should just \"reduce\" consumption doesn't have as big an effect because it doesn't get them to realize that animal exploitation is wrong and therefore gives them no incentive to become vegan.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.160747821505471,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27390334755182266,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15889817943294055,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14093356417688063,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2989495455529752,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.310225534669228,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07228191858545567,"diet_1":-0.14328750229712264,"diet_2":-0.1854743513508153,"diet_3":-0.10815286748869823,"diet_4":-0.2285829311585985,"diet_5":-0.2650122606185579,"diet_6":-0.14123147538581785,"diet_8":-0.04593145840529663,"diet_9":-0.010778703515825327,"diet_10":-0.09868738760026947,"diet_11":-0.013566014803169915,"diet_13":-0.21343343901246137,"diet_14":-0.07567246705837584,"diet_17":-0.037364182295277715},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

As far as our policy, this was all told to me when I was offered the job, so if I really disagreed, I had every opportunity to not accept the position.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0833089422452835,"1.1.1_stance":-0.5288591533899307,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16204439593497103,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.231884703235407,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.023708748567514704,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1500979751122183,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.009173450370629629,"diet_1":-0.03630244461722517,"diet_2":-0.25576682615758684,"diet_3":-0.21830379762832308,"diet_4":-0.18649404265458422,"diet_5":-0.2133108043334539,"diet_6":-0.06765609369960092,"diet_8":-0.0615297760906887,"diet_9":-0.003988869362122689,"diet_10":-0.0028121560244471766,"diet_11":-0.002083926612006811,"diet_13":-0.00418900977820158,"diet_14":-0.03609819283398489,"diet_17":-0.0009012511206189325},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (injunctive norm: \"every true vegan's mission is not idealism, but effectiveness\").","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present (describing the speaker's behavior of tasting something to save animal lives)","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

The cause is that you are now eating far more fiber than before, and the majority of bacteria in your gut are not fiber-digesters.\n\nThe only solution is time.  Over time the population profile of the bacteria in your gut will change so that it is predominantly fiber-digesters and your flatulence will gradually decrease until it ends altogether.\n\nThis happened to me to some extent.  However, I gradually adopted a vegan diet over a couple of years, so the flatulence I experienced was mild.  I now can eat large servings of beans without any flatulence at all.\n\nIn the meantime there are some steps you can take to lessen the flatulence.  You can take over-the-counter supplements like Beano (or its generic counterparts).  These contain enzymes which break down some of the offending compounds.  However, there is a trade-off in taking these:  it will slow down the transition to a more favorable bacterial profile in your gut.\n\nThe discomfort is worth it, however.  With each passing year science is learning more about why a diet high in fiber is good for us.  Research has shown that people consuming a large amount of fiber (and remember, only plants contain fiber) develop a thick layer of mucous around the lining of their large intestine.  This mucous layer is inhabited by beneficial bacteria which break down the fiber in the diet and produce a number of metabolites, the most important of which are the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA): acetate, butyrate, and propionate.  These flow into the body of the human host, where they attach to receptors in messaging molecules of the immune system and help to regulate the immune system, keeping it from going into “overdrive”.  Here are a couple of great articles describing this research and the importance of fiber [1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fiber-famished-gut-microbes-linked-to-poor-health1/) and[2](https://www.scientificamerican.com/report/innovations-in-the-microbiome/).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23608683367357966,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21075350299064935,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19486633554152438,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21547752618789673,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.0827262338198617,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.5161105456839626,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.4737292127683759,"diet_1":-0.1117804149719935,"diet_2":-0.009093681255760563,"diet_3":-0.07812283110751436,"diet_4":-0.2251426336200287,"diet_5":-0.05711220490047708,"diet_6":-0.11835719394730404,"diet_8":-0.0047303734845603644,"diet_9":-0.16870542781543918,"diet_10":-0.22676787658027844,"diet_11":-0.037440456061934434,"diet_13":-0.027420026667336117,"diet_14":-0.27205757796553554,"diet_17":-0.01299144240329042},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I'm a vegan bot.  \n\n\n-------------\n\n**Your Fallacy:**\n\n&gt;Even vegans kill animals **(ie: Vegans kill animals too)**\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\nCrop fields do indeed disrupt the habitats of wild animals, and wild animals are also killed when harvesting plants. However, this point makes the case for a plant-based diet and not against it, since many more plants are required to produce a measure of animal flesh for food (often as high as 12:1) than are required to produce an equal measure of plants for food (which is obviously 1:1). Because of this, a plant-based diet causes less suffering and death than one that includes animals.\nIt is pertinent to note that the idea of perfect veganism is a non-vegan one. Such demands for perfection are imposed by critics of veganism, often as a precursor to lambasting vegans for not measuring up to an externally-imposed standard. That said, the actual and applied ethics of veganism are focused on causing the least possible harm to the fewest number of others. It is also noteworthy that the accidental deaths caused by growing and harvesting plants for food are ethically distinct from the intentional deaths caused by breeding and slaughtering animals for food. This is not to say that vegans are not responsible for the deaths they cause, but rather to point out that these deaths do not violate the vegan ethics stated above.)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06955071189440787,"1.1.1_stance":-0.9804940223693848,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12264353864673325,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.047202717823286854,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.41989237272015695,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2765031799693234,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.027263340482022613,"diet_1":-0.04064254629580688,"diet_2":-0.4663500033008532,"diet_3":-0.33826085621675184,"diet_4":-0.01538888952927664,"diet_5":-0.0015931778859036665,"diet_6":-0.003291455243015662,"diet_8":-0.0015324136693379842,"diet_9":-0.003448450889341833,"diet_10":-0.008032182668093432,"diet_11":-0.0058474908000765895,"diet_13":-0.0017746576195255177,"diet_14":-0.007167936870246194,"diet_17":-0.0019356561824679375},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present (the first-person statement \"I'm a vegan bot\" describes the bot's behavior).","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

None of us should because we can’t change it we can only do better and I feel like part of doing better is discouraging others from doing abusive things to animals . You are obviously a good and compassionate person because you care about animals and other human beings as well. I’m not saying to treat people bad but we should all be discouraging the use of animal products. You can’t stop people but you can let them know you don’t support it.

I just worry it's naive to think that associating environmentlism with veganism doesn't do the movement a disservice, when you take into account society and how meat consumption is so emotional and subjective to people, it's such a radical change for a lot of people that they would actually consider sacrificing the earth to eat meat for another 50 years, unironically. But if we tell them \"hey, you can eat some meat, sure. Just less, please, and it might cost more\" people are a lot more agreeable to that. \n\nNot to say that we shouldn't try to convince people of things, just gotta have faith that people come around eventually if you don't overload them with too much change too fast.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-9.536058253919084e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15580353636093952,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.298246110479037,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1520303264260292,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2912506409245907,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.07000526283930242,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03467271509725833,"diet_1":-0.005573176526619743,"diet_2":-0.0032852809114653305,"diet_3":-0.005286816449370235,"diet_4":-0.0011047559322226637,"diet_5":-0.0007933377176717235,"diet_6":-0.0019482386560412124,"diet_8":-0.0005073115353297908,"diet_9":-0.00111063186826262,"diet_10":-0.0026727950801917664,"diet_11":-0.002608942537335679,"diet_13":-0.0011706519314126733,"diet_14":-0.04094474952823172,"diet_17":-0.0018754920529318042},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Lab grown meat as well as Precision fermentation animal free dairy products would eliminate these types of pathogens that are commonly found in traditional animal products.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.10520429078346935,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06140164888292474,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18318463554746636,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18190430316069375,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1741699928805853,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1143771121874918,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07614021996657054,"diet_1":-0.22343506186351358,"diet_2":-0.2511143355604118,"diet_3":-0.1371010925208359,"diet_4":-0.18816359865627502,"diet_5":-0.21215000561765443,"diet_6":-0.21693000373753965,"diet_8":-0.14256295844118563,"diet_9":-0.02124611985224571,"diet_10":-0.1468883864816803,"diet_11":-0.09268214251521083,"diet_13":-0.04698854513117112,"diet_14":-0.18308740004464535,"diet_17":-0.0010998863575271873},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Food not Bombs has chapters in most cities and feeds the homeless, the Food Empowerment Project provides plant based groceries to low income families in need.  \n\nAnd not trying to be rude, because you seem to be asking in good faith. But we post about that stuff on here all of the time. It's never going to go viral because it paints vegans in a good light, and our philosophy of not hurting animals when we don't need to (including for food), is not a popular one. Same reason why the vegan teacher goes viral on reddit all the time, but not earthling ed. The few times I have seen articles on here about those organizations, the comments were saying we shouldn't be pushing our beliefs on the hungry by serving them vegan food.
