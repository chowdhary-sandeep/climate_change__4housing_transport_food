"comment": "While the article makes some good points, I disagree with the point about abandoning the pursuit of long-range electrics for several reasons.\n\nFirst, in the current setup, even though an electric is good for 95% of the driving for 95% percent of the people 95% of the time, it's not good enough.  People don't make the choice of their primary car based solely on rationality, its an emotional choice.  This is why there are so many pickup trucks and SUV's with AWD or 4WD lying around.  They aren't used more than a few days a year, but they want to be able to use it when they need it.  It's same thing with a gun.  It's better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.\n\nSecond, there are variances in battery range based on weather.  I live in Pittsburgh, where this past winter it went down to -15F (-27C) BEFORE the windchill brought it down to -40F (-40C).  Running the heater enough to get the cabin to slightly above freezing to death cuts into your range significantly, almost in half.  That 85 mile range of the Leaf is now about 45-50.  That makes a huge difference for people.  According to the Tesla home page, the 85kWh range goes from 285 to less than 170 in those conditions (the simulator only went down to 0F).  If I have to worry about range simply because climate change is a pain in the butt, I have to rethink my strategy.\n\nThird, the two dreaded words that everyone here hears ad nauseum, Range Anxiety.  There are two easy ways to conquer this.  First, we place fast charging stations everywhere so that you never have to worry about being more than 30 miles from a plethora of chargers.  Second, we make a battery big enough so that the argument about \"What if I need...\" becomes ridiculous.  Most cars can travel about 300 miles on a tank of gas, though it is very rare that they do.  If you make an EV car with a range of 300 miles in bad conditions, people won't worry as much about running out of juice, and those \"insurance cars\" will start going by the wayside.\n\nFinally, the best reason to pursue the long range batteries will be the eventual electrification of other vehicles.  One of the reasons that EV's are currently mostly small commuter cars is that the batteries are not powerful enough for real-world use in larger vehicles.  That 500 mile range in a Chevy Spark could mean 250 miles in a Silverado.  I want an electric pickup truck.  I want to be able to have that large, obscene, waste of space that only gets used properly 4 times a year with the zero emissions, decreased costs, low maintenance, and guilt-free driving that an EV offers.",

It's NOT okay. It does harm to the EV community by making headlines about problems with EVs.\n\nCompare and contrast with your LEAF's buying and maintenance experience. If you move to Colorado, the Nissan dealership isn't going to tell you they won't service it. Hell, I see reports about Toyota dealerships in California saying they're not going to touch the RAV4-EV! The LEAF doesn't have competing computer systems that sometimes crap out and prevent you from driving your car just because they don't want to talk. The LEAF doesn't have problems with the charge timer that require writing an app just to fix.

Based on the Tesla specs, it appears that the 7 and 10 kwh batteries are the same size and weight, I'm speculating that the 7kwh battery actually has 10kwh capacity and is only utilizing 70% to get the number of cycles up.\n\nWill AGM batteries last 10 years with daily use?  Wouldn't I have to double the number of AGM batteries to get a usable 12kwh so I don't go below 50% Depth of Discharge?",

They do partnerships through third parties like working with battery suppliers or in this case charging tech but that's it. Some speculated they would share composite body tech but that is BMWs golden goose they have spent billions and decades working on, that will never get shared ever for any reason.",

"comment": "A good rule of thumb for a \"professional install\" is that one panel will make about 35kWh of energy in one day, and it takes 3-4 panels for 1kW of power. You can look at your electric bill to compare the 35 number against your monthly energy usage, or look for the sticker on a piece of equipment to understand how much power it uses.\n\nUsing this math, 20 panels would make about 700kWh of energy per month, and generate upwards of 6kW of power at full sun. A typical solar panel is about 3ft by 5ft, and can easily cost up to $1000 per panel, fully installed - or $700 after tax credits.\n\nBeyond that, Google \"net metering _______\" and insert the name of your power provider to understand if you are allowed to connect to the grid, how much any fees will be, and the maximum size you should consider (net metering cap).\n\nEdit: 35kWh a month! Not per day, m'bad.",

Most maintenance has been stuff that even the Tesla would need, tires, joints, brakes, etc. Only engine related part was my radiator, a $100 repair. You could count my AC compressor if you want, but the Tesla probably has one too, which will wear out eventually too. \n\nSorry. I love the future that is electric cars. One day they probably all will be electric. But unfortunately, at this point they can't easily compete long term. The battery is a major expense right now and it won't last 15 years with any real range - obviously your environment will affect the life, but still. When the car is a hefty chunk of change to begin with, it becomes more difficult to justify as you have to invest a very large sum every decade or so for new batteries. \n\nAs batteries and the cars themselves become cheaper. This argument will become less and less effective. I look forward to that day. Hell, if there was a real cheap electric car now. I'd buy it.",

Of course a Spark is based on the gas Spark, so I'd expect similar life for things like body and interior and chassis. But the whole radiator, smog pumps and plumbing, O2 sensor, exhaust system, transmission, water pump, timing belt, engine wear thing won't ever happen to the EV. So I'd expect the EV to be longer than the gas Spark.",

People doing sketchy things anyway but in other cars, seemingly ignoring that Tesla's features are inadvertently encouraging that behavior.\n\nAutopilot sounds fantastic and better than most other systems but trusting it 100% is dumb. Pretty much every crash I've seen on autopilot could have been prevented if the driver was paying attention. You can talk about personal responsibility all you want but if the car didn't have autopilot some drivers wouldn't be as likely to trust it while drunk or texting or sleeping. Their \"personal responsibility\" is endangering people other than themselves. Again, I'm not critical of Autopilot itself but the way it's marketed and fanboys push it even with all the disclaimers when you use it will make people do dumb things.\n\nDog mode is similar. Before, people (with cruel exceptions) wouldn't dream of leaving their pets in a locked car. Now Tesla is encouraging it. If you can't take your dog, leave it somewhere safe.",

I cannot afford a $30K-$40K vehicle and after owning a used Leaf, there is likely no way I will ever buy a used EV again. Until I can go buy a new EV for the price of a base Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla or something similar (which as been promised for over ten years now and we're still not there), I'm pretty much done with EVs. I'm actively trying to swap the Leaf out as I write this to go back to an ICE and I honestly hate to say that. It hasn't been an outright horrible experience, but for me they are just too expensive. My Leaf has actually cost me more money to operate than the ICE it replaced. Between the increase in insurance and increase in electricity costs at home, any money I have saved in gas and maintenance has been negated.",

"comment": "Actually... all of the above are working on solid state:\n\n* Ford and BMW have partnered with Solid Power.\n* VW is working with Quantumscape and I think they just partnered or bought another solid state company.\n* GM's working with SES.\n* Hyundai / Kia are working with Factorial Energy.\n\nDaimler's using a solid state battery in their busses.\n\nToyota's shown minimal information on their solid state tech outside of their prototype vehicle, but they're certainly working on it.\n\nOne of the few OEMs not working with a solid state company is Tesla, who seems to be putting most of their resources into LFP and 4680 cells right now.  I wouldn't be surprised if they backed away from 4680 cells in Germany because they either don't have the resources to build them, and/or because Chinese made LFP cells have higher margins.   I also wouldn't be surprised if they artificially throttle their production out of Germany because the higher manufacturing costs make Chinese made vehicles far more lucrative, and Europe refuses to apply any additional tariffs to Chinese made vehicles.\n\nIt's also possible their 4680 success rate isn't high enough yet to be pushing forward on two separate 4680 plants, Texas and Germany.  If those lines don't live up to their potential, it'll be a major problem for Tesla.\n\nThe 4680 also has another significant problem in that it's using a tailor made production process.  If the 4680 falls behind in energy density / cost versus other tech like SSBs, Tesla may be hard pressed to transition their 4680 line to a SSB chemistry.  Other OEMs are working on SSBs that can run on standard pouch cell assembly lines with minimal re-tooling.  Meaning as soon as they confirm the cells work as expected, they can transition every pouch cell line they have over to SSBs in short order.  No new factories or manufacturing processes necessary.\n\nAll of this talk about Tesla's 4680 production speed is a bit of a joke.  If other OEMs need to produce cells faster, they'll simply add more cell assembly lines.   Up front cost is a thing, but with the volumes these lines put out, the new lines will still pay for themselves.   Tesla and their investor seem to think \"square footage\" of the facility is a big deal.  Uhhh, no.  lol.  Like... what?\n\nThe only things I was impressed by with Tesla's 4680 cell was its heat mitigation through the tabless design (kind of a common sense invention) and its cheaper / faster charging silicone anode.  SSBs don't have an anode at all, and they aren't as impacted by heat.  Their dry electrode coating process is certainly a big deal, but I imagine dry electrodes are something other OEMs are working on as well.  \n\nThe holy grail will likely be a LFP solid state cell with solid sodium electrolyte and a dry cathode coating process.  A solid state LFP cell that gets rid of the anode is a huge deal since it would improve their volumetric and gravimetric energy density while further reducing costs.",

"comment": "I'm not aware of the RAV4 Prime getting better range in future models.  Sounds like the Outlander PHEV is supposed to get 54 miles.\n\nYeah, you definitely don't need to get the same number of oil changes as an ICEV.  My Volt doesn't recommend oil changes at mileage intervals.  It shows an oil life percentage.  Which I can't remember if it actually has a sensor to measure the oil quality, or if it's just counting down based on miles on the engine and life of the oil.  Even if you never used oil at all, you should change it out after 2 years.  At the current rate the percentage is falling on the meter, it'll likely last 2 years before hitting 0%, but I'll probably change it at around 15-20%, or about 1.5 years.\n\nA large benefit is not having to change the brake pads / rotors as often.  I imagine most PHEVs can get around 80k miles before changing the pads, so long as they're properly cared for and heated up every once in awhile so the glue doesn't go bad and they don't become brittle.  Plus, less pollution from brake pad manufacturing, and less brake dust pollution.\n\nAll cars, EVs and ICEVs, are supposed to have the brake fluid replaced every 2 years due to potential moisture getting into the lines.\n\nI never understood the \"stop gap\" argument.  PHEVs are a viable technology that gets the job done while using minimal battery resources.  Batteries aren't clean.  They require loads of mining and processing.  The larger the battery, the worse their impact.   Certainly PHEVs will become pointless in the future as cell density improves, charging speeds improve, and cell costs decrease, allowing for smaller batteries per car and making combustion a pointless venture.  In the meantime, I imagine we have 7-10+ years before that happens.\n\nLike is always claimed about BEVs and their lifecycle emissions, PHEV lifecycle emissions also get cleaner with more renewable grid energy.  However, what's rarely mentions is that their liquid fuel can also get greener with lower emissions e-fuels and biofuels.  Since PHEVs can reduce liquid fuel use by so much, biofuels and e-fuels can actually come into play in a more realistic fashion, even if they cost more.",

You're comparing a startup company that will have over time compete with Tesla with a shell company who's sole business would be to expand and work with what was the only fast charging network in NA. You see how ridiculous that comparison is?\n\nAnd Tesla had already opened up their patent and as you can see with what's happening in Europe and will happen over here, other EVs can charge on Tesla's network so that point is also invalid.\n\nThis article from 2014 is proof of that\n\n&gt; Musk: That was already said. Actually we've already said that. The intent of the Supercharger network is not to create a walled garden. Any other manufacturer that's interested in using them, we'd be happy to accommodate.\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2014-06-09-tesla-to-share-supercharger-patents.html",

There's so many fine details that become apparent to the naked eye and really tie together the design language.\n\nTo me the EV6 looks more mundane. More conventional. It's not a bad looking car, but it doesn't wow me.\n\nTeslas are Teslas. They all kind of look samey, and have looked that way for a solid decade.",

If I've challenged JD Power before, it's from the point of view that they seem to weigh issues in ways that don't mirror their actual importance to owners. As suggested in Tesla's case by the fact that owner satisfaction is consistently highest or among the highest.\n\nIt really shouldn't be that hard for people to accept the basic point, though, which is that we've been comparing Tesla (purely BEV) to traditional OEMs (vast majority ICE). When we compare BEV to BEV, the quality gap disappears. Not in every particular, and we can nitpick, but on the whole Tesla appears to be average or better than average for EVs. This sub really is not ready to accept that, and so we'll just have to wait for more data, I guess.",

I want an electric minivan but as of today you can't buy one in the US (ID buzz isn't available yet). The Pacifica is barely better than a traditional gas vehicle. It gets 30 miles max from the battery and you don't get to select when it is running on electric versus gas. 99% of my trips are under 25 miles, so why should I have to enable the gas system? \n I know it needs to consume the fuel periodically to avoid bad gas in the system but it takes months for gasoline to begin to degree. So why does it go through 15+ gallons per month if I'm only going 20 miles per day? Add to that Chrysler's reliability issues and the Pacifica is a tough buy for me.",

Your argument can be used to say every mainstream lithium-based battery chemistry is \"dated\" because there are replacements in development.\n\nLook, I use the \"ICEV crammed with batteries\" argument to shit on legacy manufacturers who have been slow to develop BEVs, so I get where you're coming from.  But \"dated\" and \"inefficient\" are different things.  The Bolt isn't dated, it's simply an inefficient and therefore expensive design. At best, the slow DCFC is its biggest issue and that was a matter of cost, not technology.  You can't use failure to include higher-end hardware to save money as a reason something is \"dated\".",

"comment": "At 50 miles longer range, there are trips for which the Model 3 doesn't need to charge at all where the Ioniq 6 will need to charge.\n\nFurthermore, there is no reason to charge 20%-80% and compare that directly. Instead, each vehicle has their strengths and weaknesses of their charge curves. 20% in this Model 3 is 77 miles of range. Why charge that early? From 8% to 30%, this Model 3 charges faster than an Ioniq 6. Choosing 20% to 80% means 77 miles to 307 miles of range in this Model 3, versus 67 miles to 267 miles of range. Why would you choose to charge the Model 3 to 307 miles of range and only charge the Ioniq 6 to 267 miles of range?\n\nInstead, we are more likely to charge for a certain range. So to charge for 150 miles of range, that's 39% of that Model 3, and 45% of that Ioniq 6. The Model 3 likely wins the race to charge from 30 miles of range to 180 miles of range, which is 8% to 47% versus 9% to 54% of the Ioniq 6 because of so much time spent at 245+ kW on the Model 3.",

I expect it’ll be difficult for big developers with large pipelines given the financing uncertainty.\n\nA more positive spin is that solar and other renewable technologies are creating manufacturing and construction jobs in red states. Solar can certainly survive with support from these states and we’ve historically seen some of that but I’m very nervously watching and have little hope for progress under Trump",

Theirs alot of layers to that, and it is partially corruption and greed from the US auto industry\n\n\n\nThat part wouldn't magically change if Chinese EVs came here. They would probably be a good value but the reality would be much more boring.  They would probably would be very slightly cheaper than everything else at best.  Which i mean cool for more options, but some its not some magic utopia were being gatekept from.\n\n\n\n Some people on here are so fucking delusional about this stuff like ICE brands haven't ran into this problem for decades where cost increases from regulations have stopped them from selling their cheaper non-us car models here because the prices don't work out reasonably.",

"comment": "Good to hear, however here is some additional perspective from Dunedin New Zealand...  Money is tight here and people live check to check.  Winters can be cold, more so because NZ houses in this region are old and have no insulation.  Therefore, just about everyone has wood burners and relies on solid fuel.  They have just enough money to buy wood, and those who can't afford wood buy cheap ass coal and burn coal all day!  The neighborhoods can be left in a blue haze.  Personally I make a decent living so we have heatpump based electric heat, and I am about to have 3KW solar array installed.  But this is very rare here.  I'm not sure how we would ever get these people off of their wood burners or coal fires.  We have a looooong way to go.  In my region it would take a company like solar city saying \"we will put heat pumps in your home, and solar power for free.. then you pay us which will be far less than buying wood or coal\".",

"comment": "I also produce more than I use during the day, and draw at night. I don't have batteries yet. But in Ohio, Net Metering is based on total usage, so I'm simply billed (or credited) based on net resulting draw/push for the month.\n\nEven if I had a month where I pushed more than I used, overall. The \"sale\" would just be credit for the next month.\n\nFor me, right now, this works great because I only generate about 1/3 of my total demand. But when I add more capacity next, I will end up with summer months where I produce more than I use. Again, I'll probably still be okay because come winter I'll draw more than I produce.\n\nI need the grid. I want the grid. And it makes sense that I pay something for grid access. I just hope the situation is equitable for all involved.",

Fake solar installs cost only 5% of what a real solar system costs (mount it on the roof so you can't closely inspect them!), yet the increases in marginal revenue gained exceed the power cost savings and tax incentives of real panels.

You still pay for power, they just sell it to you at a cheaper, locked in rate. It's called Net-metering, and if it just became available you're going to see an influx of companies to GA very quickly. Most commercial companies are local or regional, being from MA I don't have any specific recommendations.",

"comment": "Dang that's cheap! I'm in Los Angeles County and we just had our house re-roofed.~2,000sq ft, and quotes ranged from $10-$15k for some GAF Timberline HD  shingles (i think these are mid-tier right). When we asked about tile/terra cotta, no one wanted to even quote it lol. The cheapest was no removal and just adding a second layer of singles while the most expensive was from Home Depot. Ending up paying around $12k and had quite a few fascias and inner boards replaced.\n\nEven with our more expensive roof prices, the Tesla estimator is giving me an estimate of $67k roof+ $7k Powerwall. Subtract the $16.5k tax credit, that's 20 years before it pays for itself. Not to mention I don't even think it can produced enough power for me as I have a significant amount on a reverse tilt.\n\nWith my current system, I'm looking at only a 8 year payback period. Adding the cost of my roof (which needed to be replaced either way) it's still only 13 years even with our expensive roofs here.",

"comment": "A couple of things:  You might look for a second or third wholesale source. That gives you a few things - a likely wider range of panel manufacturers to compare and a more than one source to get input or opinions about some of your design choices (like advantages for the different string inverters). You may get some useful tactical feedback here. But like having additional sources for supply, it can't hurt to have more experienced input from the masses either. You might try places like [this other forum](https://www.solarpaneltalk.com/) if you haven't already. Many threads there will get into deep detail. \n\nMy input on panels is that if your primary goal is to keep costs minimized, you probably want to contrast price/watt with warranties. Both the workmanship and the performance warranties vary. That is where SunPower is typically a leader, but I'm pretty sure others are trying to catch up (Trina? not sure).\n\nJust a comment - ground mounting panels in New England is a good way to not only optimally position your panels (orientation and tilt), but it gives you the best access for dealing with snow. Is the location you are considering truly unobstructed? Tree lines can be a big factor in the morning and later in the afternoon, for example.",

"comment": "I run a 32\" LCD TV off my battery bank, doesn't draw much. I think around 150w or so.\n\nI've read before warnings about oversizing the inverter, like running a 2500w inverter with a 200w load is wasteful, but I haven't confirmed that either way.\n\nSo let's pretend it's a 250w LCD TV. Now let's say you want to use it for 4 hours per day because you are a couch potato (just pretend): that works out to 1000wh/day for the TV.\n\nLet's pretend you watch only at night, and each day your panels charge your battery bank back up, and let's say it's a 12v deep cycle battery that you're comfortable discharging to 50%: 1000÷12=83.4ah/day, so you'd need a ~165ah battery bank to do this.\n\nThat's like, one big one or two little ones.\n\nNow when you consider voltage drop over wires and losses on the inverter and battery side, this would be a pretty decent setup for a 175w TV.\n\nFiguring out the solar part is a bit easier. We know we want 1000wh each day, and let's assume the battery only actually absorbs 50% of whatever the panels put out between the charge controller losses, wire voltage drop, and electrochemical conversion efficiencies in the battery itself..\n\n.. and let's also assume you can squeeze 4 hours of decent sun each day ...\n\nYou'd need a 500w solar array.\n\nThe math there wasn't even really necessary with the numbers I picked.. but 1000wh x 2 (50% efficiency) = 2kw. 2000w ÷ 4 (hours of full sun) = 500w array. That's four off the shelf renogy panels.\n\nNow.. all the numbers above are pretty cynical, and I'd probably just run 400w worth of panels, but.. meh. \n\nTo answer your question though, I'd get a 300w inverter from a gas station for all the difference it'll make.",

Ignore this guy's comments on LGs, Panasonics, and Sunpower - you don't need to worry about that at all since you're already getting ~100% offset with standard panels. However, you can go to Sunpower's website and find \"Sunpower-certified\" solar installers near you. Sunpower's standards are quite stringent so even if you don't need a super high end panel, if the installer is certified by that company, it is a sign of legitimacy.",

"comment": "It's not gone.  Brace yourself for a stream of consciousness to bowl you over:\n\nYou're confusing expected life with actual life.  There's plenty of panels over 30 years old that still produce electricity.  The idea you're going to have to \"pay to take them down\" and that should matter for the calculation is ridiculous.  But if you're a person that wouldn't be able to remove your panels (for whatever reason you'd want to) I... can't really help you there.\n\nHere's my math:  I paid -- after the ITC tax credit and rebates -- about @$14k for a 9kw system in 2014.\n\nI was paying about $2,000 a year in electricity, and about $2,000 a year in gasoline.\n\nBecause I have two electric cars, and produce more electricity than the home and cars use, I paid @$14k to save @$4k a year.\n\nThat makes my break-even point less than 5 years.  So taking your \"25 year\" pay-back period, I'm electricity bill and gasoline bill free for @20 years.\n\nNow, compare those numbers to the S&amp;P ETF.\n\nMoreover, think of it as a hedge.  Why are you comparing it as if it's an either or situation?\n\nWhat good is that money going to do you in 25 years if you're under water breathing Scott Pruitt's air quality?\n\nYou're assuming a 3% raise in electricity rates, but because of global warming, maybe that number will be closer to 6% amortized over 25 years.\n\nAs for laws against solar-- that's not impossible.  But if you're in a situation where you get screwed on your solar investment, it might be a good idea to sue the shit out of whoever tries to screw you (be it the local provider, or even the State).\n\n[Tesla has already shown this litigation strategy is viable in the Salt River Project lawsuit.](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/energy/2018/03/05/srp-settlement-tesla-could-make-solar-batteries-more-affordable/396385002/)\n\nI know I'm a bit of an outlier, because I got a remarkably good deal on my install.  But I also achieved that by ruthlessly negotiating a good deal, the way I would have with buying a car, or a house, or any other major purchase.\n\nIn my case, the solar array was a good investment that I stand by on a purely economic basis, as well as something that people should do because money isn't going to be worth jack shit if the environment won't support human life in 25 years anyway.",

"comment": "For off grid?  Yeah, 5kW is quite small.\n\nOff grid inverters tend to have a massive peak overcapacity, because motors (and, worse, compressors) are typically hell to start.\n\nThe Powerwall 2 specs claim 5.8kVA sustained, 7.2kVA peak - which is very close together.\n\nThe Outback Radian GS4048A is a smaller, 4kVA inverter (sustained).  However, it can sustain 4.5kVA for 30m, 6kVA for 5s, and a whopping 8.5kVA for 100ms (over 200% sustained load).  That's the sort of thing you need to see on an off grid inverter to start compressors.\n\nMy 2kW Aims Power unit is rated for a peak of 6kW (presumably kVA) for starting loads, and I regularly abuse it with my spot welder, which is a nearly pure inductive load.  In terms of what this realistically means, my 2kW inverter will reliably start my window AC unit.  That pulls about 700W running, but around 2kW briefly while starting.  My generator, which is an inverter unit, is a 1.6kW unit with really no overload capability.  That cannot start my wall AC unit at all - it shuts down as soon as I try, even though it could run it.\n\nGenerator support is nice for a DC coupled system (you'd just need a charger), but definitely critical to have properly integrated for any sort of AC coupled system.  I expect the Tesla packs will refuse to charge from a standard generator, though they may charge from an inverter generator.  That sort of stuff isn't the kind of thing you can wait for winter to find out, though - you have to know how it works.\n\nI still think the Outback Radian series is an awesome inverter/charger for pretty much any use. :)",

"comment": "You don't need to cover solar panels, it doesn't hurt the panels to not use electricity they have available. ~~They have shunt resistors to dissipate excess energy~~ however connecting or disconnecting while they are generating may be dangerous to you.\n\nThey suggest not leaving the \"generator\" charging because of overcharging of the batteries. Depending on the chemistry the batteries will need to be topped off every few months or they may need to be left in a partial state of charge for storage with partial recharges only required yearly or less. The charging requirements may be much more frequent if your \"generator\" uses energy when it's not in use.\n\nDisconnect your generator from the power source unless you need to re-charge, top off, or partial charge for storage.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the correction /u/Syonyk.",

"comment": "~4000 sq ft here (including basement). The most we used in a single month over the summer, before solar was installed, was around 1400kWh.\n\nWe only have one large A/C unit outside (5-ton). Gas heating, Smart thermostat, lots of attic insulation, LED lights in all fixtures, dimmers where it makes sense, ceiling fans, energy star appliances, and plenty of electronics plugged in and used regularly.  We have a 7.245kWp array on the roof and it covers our needs - with net metering.\n\nYou've got some energy consumption problems, as you regularly almost double our usage and beyond. You would be much better served by figuring out where your energy is being used so excessively and fixing that before you try to buy like 20kW worth of solar panels to cover your usage.",

The markets for gas-guzzlers, private jets and recreational boating would be gone in a second if individuals took responsibility for the carbon pollution their activities generate.\n\nYes. We needed governments to act but they have been negligent and are embarking on some other agenda.  Therefore, the onus is forced upon the individual to do unto others as they would have done to them.\n\nI once believed that technology could be a solution.  Energy saved results in cost-savings.

So, if I not use the air con to reduce emissions or if I install solar power to reduce emissions I will save money which I then spend on other goods and services which have their own energy inputs.\n\nAnother way individual change is paramount is with the decision to bear children.  Few countries have adopted any policies to control population that way.\n\nDuring a crisis there will be some winners and some losers.

"comment": "## Is this right time for the  industrial and commercial units to invest on Rooftop Solar power units?\n\nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE ) has set a target to install 227 Gigawatt by 31 March 2022.  \nGovernment of India offered tax incentives of accelerated depreciation of fixed assets equated with the solar power plant to promote green energy generation.\n\nAs per the 2018–19 union budget, Industrial and commercial establishments can avail 40% accelerated depreciation benefits. comparing to 80% in the previous year.\n\nCorporates can claim these tax benefits in 3 consecutive years. First-year 40 %, second year 40% and balance 20% in the third year. For eg, If any commercial or industrial user, falls under an income tax bracket of 30%, install a [on-grid solar](https://www.genwatt.in/on-grid-solar-power-generation/) plant valued at Rs. 10 Lakh in a given financial year, under accelerated depreciation, the user will be able to claim an annual depreciation of 40% for the Rs. 10 Lakh investment.\n\n1st year company will save Rs.1,20,000 (10,00,000 x 40% x 30%)  \n2nd year company year will save Rs.1,20,000 (10,00,000 x 40% x 30%)  \n3rd year company year will save Rs.60,000 (10,00,000 x 20% x 30%)\n\nIn effect Company can save Rs.300,000 from tax and the money saved from the electricity bill, the company can get the return on investment in 3 years.\n\nCurrently, PV cells are producing their maximum efficiency and price at the optimum level, this is the right time for the corporate to invest in solar power generation.\n\nTalk to our Solar Power Architects today to get [more information](https://www.genwatt.in/contact-us)",

"comment": "The value proposition for PV is based on the ROI of a productive asset, (and increased value to the property should you sell it).  Tinkering with a functioning system, especially switching out equipment, eats in to your ROI.  If you're considering battery storage, then perhaps ROI is not your priority, in which case, have a blast doing whatever you want to do. \n\nTypically, if someone wants to add on to an existing system, I'd advise installing a parallel system on a separate circuit.  IMO, residential battery storage is grossly over sold: it adds very little value, reduces total system ROI, and really is only appropriate and useful in circumstances where uninterruptible power supply is a requirement for life or business. Otherwise, I like [SMA's Secure Power Supply](http://www.smainverted.com/how-to-explain-secure-power-supply-to-homeowners/) for a system that can provide power in an off grid circumstance, at a fraction of the cost of a storage system.  It wouldn't give you power over night, but you would have a functional power supply during daylight hours.",

"comment": "BS. The sources who do these \"fact checks\" are just left-wing fear mongrels who want to weaken the West and undermine freedom. It's been proven time and time again- they only go especially hard on right-wing sources. Besides, you have absolutely no idea how much deforestation results from the use of the top 2 \"green energy sources\" deemed safe and reliable by your sources, nor do you seem to realize how expensive most of the alternate energy sources are. Do I deny that coal and oil are dirty energy sources? Of course not. The air pollution caused by them is a problem. However, giving up on them cold turkey just to use an alternate energy source on nothing outside of the basis of its \"safety\" is a problem. Aside from nuclear energy, no other alternate energy source can hope to stand up to fossil fuels in terms of efficiency and market price. Solar and wind energy especially are somewhat of a menace to the environment- both of them have been repeatedly proven to be a hazard to birds flying by and accumulate a lot of waste- both solar panels and wind turbines are expensive to fix, and the mending process involves discarding the broken parts, as those parts cannot be reused. Worse still is that solar panels are made of toxic materials, so the waste accumulated by them is especially bad for the environment.",

All the electricity there runs on diesel because it doesn’t make sense to build a power plant and/or power lines for such a small population. This could easily be replaced with some solar panels and a powerwall\n\nEdit: more info here\n\nhttps://thedriven.io/2018/12/14/diesel-charge-evs-remote-locations-greener-than-you-think/",

Scooters like the Boosted REV operate well and are IP67 rated but the decking is so unsealed you can see through it from the joins. Their basis of approach is to use sealed joints on the wires. Now look at a solar PV system, where you'll note that all the connections are just out there and plugged together. Why don't they corrode and short out? Well sealed connectors (wires are normally waterproof especially the modern silicone ones).\n\nThen look at how water proof a car engine bay is and yet they work in the rain too? How? Well sealed connection joints.",

Do you have side by side comparisons of every possible performance metric between the two technologies?\n\n&gt; No, it matters because it's a litteral fact. And stop acting like hybrids are even on your side. They're gas engines with an electric drivetrain.\n\nAgain, moving the goalpost because you’re wrong. Hybrid vehicles have better range than your car and likely any gas car on the road, not to mention that a Tesla, an EV, will literally pass your Jetta like it was standing still. Does it have a 1000 mile range? No, not yet, but 620miles on a single charge is damn good, and better than many pure gas engines would perform. Don’t try to act like EVs and hybrids AREN’T on my side -  it’s been been my argument THIS ENTIRE THREAD. Matter of fact, I don’t even know what you’re trying to prove - this is a pissing contest because you’re in love with your car. Take your ball and go home bud. I can provide plenty more examples to your incorrect blanket statements. \n\nAnd if making a hybrid car is so easy, why not actually invest in that tech for your own car? https://www.wired.com/2012/08/hybrid-conversion/\n\n&gt; I literally pointed out Apple Car play in my last post. The fact you want to derail this with a fucking phone war is typical though. You have no argument and throw shit at the wall.\n\nYou’re the one going on continuous tangents about nothing that have to do with this post.\n\n&gt; There's no winning here bud.\n\nRight because you’re ignoring (or deliberately not addressing) that you also said this:\n\n&gt; No one has ever been saved due to the fact they had an EV.\n\nAnd since you either didn’t read the article or won’t admit you’re WRONG, people in Texas used their hybrid trucks to act as generators after their power grid failed....because they didn’t winterize their equipment because they never thought Texas would get hit with a snowstorm like that (I’m sure places that rely on fossil fuels and coal to power their homes never lose power, EVER...) \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.motortrend.com/news/2021-ford-f-150-powerboost-hybrid-powering-texas-homes-winter-weather/amp/\n\n&gt; only gas powered cars were left\n\nWhat a desperate grasp at straws, and it’s not even true lol Did the electric and hybrid vehicles suddenly disappear and only reappear when the power grid went back on? Were gas cars the only ones left when that family used their hybrid truck as a generator? Oh right hybrids suddenly don’t meet your criteria. \n\nGive me a break, you can’t even admit when you’re wrong. \n\nWhether consumers like it or not, electrification is where the auto industry is heading. Pressure from environmental enthusiasts, as well as evolving consumer issues, are altering future projections of the automobile industry. This is not just an eco-friendly goal or ambition that would help fight climate change, it’s a business reality: https://www.npr.org/2019/02/16/694303169/as-more-electric-cars-arrive-whats-the-future-for-gas-powered-engines\n\nAnd if I’m just throwing shit at the wall, why are major car companies like Volvo, Audi, and GM all phasing out the manufacture of gas combustion engine vehicles and moving to EVs, some planning on doing so within the next 5 years? \n\nThe differences between a combustion engine and an electric car motor are vast. Owners of electric cars can use solar panels on their homes to charge their cars with clean energy; the national average may be that about 2/3rd’s of all electricity comes from fossil fuels, but that doesn’t mean that what’s most commonly used is always efficient. You also pay far less in utilities in the aforementioned case, and reduce emissions from both your home and your car, not that you give a shit about that last part. \n\nElectric cars could replace the gas-powered car quite quickly, but gas engine cars could also trudge on slowly. Only time will tell, but the fact is that the number of vehicles with electric car motors sold will only increase as time goes by, while the future of the gas-powered car is uncertain - there’s a big chance that the combustion engine won’t phase completely out for a long time, but consumers might make the switch because they appreciate the usefulness and understand that EVs are better machines than the ones they’re replacing. They’re smooth and quiet, and offer a torque-rich acceleration that’s unique to the electric car motor. Your car might have more range than a Tesla (under the right conditions), but it can outperform your car in nearly every other way (under any conditions).\n\nMaybe the infrastructure for mass electrification just isn’t in place just yet, but it’s already begun in many parts of the world, and you’re already seeing gas stations with charging stations as well. And while gas engines might be cheaper for now, the parts for those cars won’t stay that way forever, especially if they become less commonly available to the average consumer. \n\nSo you can rail against EVs and hybrids all you like, but there’s more than enough evidence to show that they are on the rise and the future of vehicles like yours is quite uncertain. Good for you if you can keep it in shape for years to come, but the world around you isn’t going to stop changing in the meantime. We’ll see how far your car and your attitude will get you then.",

"comment": "I think that would be the practical effect, though.  If you ban solar panels from China, you are essentially banning mono because they're the only ones making mono at scale.  The rationale behind the push for a ban (not just high tariffs) is in the pv article:\n\n&gt;\tLongi’s Xie notes that quality is an issue when buying polysilicon for monoingot and wafer production, and that imported polysilicon can be superior in this regard. “Concerning the quality of OCI’s polysilicon, it is good and better than some other players in China,” Xie tells pv magazine. However, he says that this is changing over time. “For the future we can see a lot of improvement in Chinese makers,” Xie notes. “They are doing a lot of activities to improve the quality of their production, and the quality gap between OCI and these poly makers will become smaller and smaller in the future.” Zhonghuan did not respond to pv magazine’s requests for an interview, however our sources indicate that the company is also sourcing polysilicon from OCI, Wacker, and GCL Poly. The company has entered into a joint development agreement with GCL for the supply of polysilicon from a plant under construction in the Xinjiang Region.\n\nSo, with domestically sourced polysilicon, with the mono process equipment manufacturers (who hold the real IP and tech necessary) all in China (I think so, but they're not saying), it's kind of a lock on the mono production industry.  It's hard to see how this wouldn't eliminate mono from the American solar PV market,  or am I missing something?",

Taking that into consideration, here in Canada, I can get a PHEV and a decent solar panels system for the cost of a BEV and get more money back in grants. I can drive my PHEV essentially for free in EV mode and in the process I am extremely motivated to use the least amount of gas possible. Maybe PHEVs aren’t so bad after all.",

"comment": "If I have solar on my car I expect the car to be bi-directional (V2X). I wish I could plug-in my car and use it's electricity for the grid or at home, right now, there aren't many cars that can do that.\nSolar on the roof of a car doesn't help anyone when the battery is at a target SoC and the car cannot take more charge. And we need to make these cars affordable, but with the added complexity it won't be easy with currently available tech. I'm sure in a few years more cars will come up that will be able to do that.\nBetter solar panels will be able to make such cars even more appealing.",

What are all of your electricity consuming devices and systems? \n\nI can tell you, most people have no idea how much electricity they use. You can’t assume your usage is just the same as the old owner. Consumption is a function of the systems in the house and how they are used. It’s totally possible you used up to 2OOO kWh in a month. That isn’t that crazy.\n\nDue diligence- make sure the system is performing as it should… ask the solar installer if they can tell you how actual production compares to predicted production monthly. Also make sure you don’t have any optimizers out (seems like you are on top of the app though and would’ve noticed). \n\nMy guess is that you use more electricity than you think tho.",

You'd need to run the coffee pot at full tilt for one hour to drain 76 of the 100ah.\n\nIf you run 76a for 15min, you're taking \\~19ah (15min is 25% of an hour. 19 is 25% of 76) out of your 100ah battery. Effectively running that coffee maker for 15min will take \\~20% of your total battery capacity.\n\nCaveat: in reality it'd probably drain more than that and if you're not running lithiums you probably shouldnt let your batteries get below 50%.

I used sun solar and had a really good experience with them. I have a good roof and lots of sun. I looked at it like as an investment for my future possible retirement. I do have net metering and sell back at wholesale rates. My monthly cost is around the same. In a sense I switch my light bill for a solar loan. Think buy instead of rent. It is true the rates can sometime double your total cost but at 35k that’s a nice car cost right? Don’t take 25 years to pay it off and absolutely use the 30 % for your loan.  The company you use and the rep you have can make all the difference. Not every house/customer is a good fit for solar.  I’m a little south of stl but would be happy to answer any questions!",

"comment": "As an open-minded Non Vegan I can give my answer.  I find the vegan community is very open minded, except when it comes to criticisms (criticism is different from defamation) about vegan lifestyles.  Hopefully you will read and think about what I'm saying before down voting me into oblivion... First of all, many \"new\" vegans who I meet in college ARE nutrient deficient because they don't follow a nutritious vegan diet. They simply don't eat meat or animal products without supplementing more plant based protein into their diets.  Unfortunately these \"new\" vegans tend to become the stereotype for non vegans and hurt the entire communities image.  This brings me to my second point: all human bodies are different.  Some people's bodies are *fully* capable of drawing all the nutrients they need from a vegan diet, unfortunately others are not.  Due to biological differences (differences in metabolism/allergies/ body composition etc.) some people can *not* get all the nutrients they need without supplementing their diet a little bit with some form of meat or animal products.  Don't condemn or demonize these otherwise vegans, their body is simply different from yours and they follow a (almost) vegan lifestyle for the same reasons you do.  I'm not a vegan but know a few who I respect very much and am NOT hating on the vegan community. However, I would **highly** recommend all vegans read this blog (which is actually down for maintenance right now??, check again tomorrow) http://voraciouseats.com/2010/11/19/a-vegan-no-more/",

You'd have to be crazy to eat like this every day for any extended period of time, but it does have its place.\n\nWhen I first tried going raw, I tried doing it the \"right\" way, with lots of low fat green foods. In the end, this was too drastic a change for me, and I failed miserably. A few years later, and many pounds heavier, I tried again, and ate lots of these \"gourmet\" raw foods. This time, it stuck, and I eventually outgrew these foods. I now eat a fairly low fat raw vegan diet and am in the best shape I've ever been in. For special occasions, I give myself a bit of latitude, though. Also not seen in these photos is the big salad that should be be foundation of any big meal.\n\nMost importantly, if I were to show up to a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with sprouts and raw veggies in tow, the best I could hope for is ~~maid~~ mild ridicule and the further marginalization of my \"crazy\" eating habits. If I bring stuff as shown in these phtos, even meateaters sit up and take notice.",

I think it would be insulting to just throw away the product, specially things like leather. If some poor animal died to make my boots before I was \"enlightened\" as I am now, I feel I should honor it's life and give as much use and care to those boots as possible. I plan on resoling and trying to keep my motorcycle boots around for as long as possible. I didn't throw out any of my non-vegan food stuffs, I tried to use it all quickly and get it out of the house. I gave the meat to my neighbor when I went vegetarian years prior though.",

Or how suddenly it's very important whether or not I'm a vegan. \n  \n  \nIf I followed every odd tangent you've introduced here, my posts would be getting longer and longer and longer. Like yours. I don't have time for that.  So I've been selectively ignoring tangents and non-starters that are IMO too far off-base here to worry about.\n  \n\nRemember, it was you who engaged me, on the very specific point that I wouldn't feed a cat a vegan diet without good solid evidence from mainstream veterinary science.\n  \n  \nOn all your non-meta stuff below the line there - the person who's really trying to eliminate all suffering would solve this problem by putting their cats in a locked garage with the car running.\n  \n  \nI wouldn't do that. So I'm left with a choice. On one hand there's the drop-in-the-bucket suffering of animal-kind caused by the production of my cat's food. On the other hand, there's the suffering of my own individual pet, caused directly by my own hand when I decide to ignore veterinary science and feed my cat whatever my big vegan heart thinks best.\n  \n  \nOf the two, I feel the latter is worse. So I'd choose the former. \n  \n  \nIf the day comes where mainstream veterinary science recommends a non-animal cat food, then I'd try it.  If your point is that I should be experimenting on my cat in search of such a food, then I reject it completely.",

You should not look to animals for moral guidance.\n\n&gt;Humans as a species have been eating meat for millions of years so are we just doomed to be an insensitive cruel species?\n\nYou are not forced to eat meat, and something being natural is not automatically ethical, sustainable, or right.\n\n&gt;Do you believe we are superior to other animals and there fore should hold ourselves to a higher standard?\n\nIn the sense that we have superior abilities when it comes to controlling the environment and animals, sure. But I don't' believe any species is inherently more important than another.\n\n&gt;I have watched the extreme cruelty of animals videos and it doesn't make me NOT want to eat meat, however even though most of the things depicted in these videos are already illegal it does make me want to support tighter regulations on the treatment of animals. Does this make me a cruel person?\n\nI think it means you're lazy, since you're allowing the cruelty to happen instead of trying to actively stop it.\n\n&gt;If being vegan is the only moral way to live life, what are people in 3rd world countries who rely heavily on hunting and fishing supposed to do to survive?\n\nIf their survival depends on it, that's fine. Yours doesn't though, since you seem to have more than enough access to the internet and electricity so I can only assume you're capable of affording rice and beans.\n\n&gt;Why are animal product free alternatives so fucking expensive?\n\nThey don't have to be.",

Show them you can be even healthier and happier on a vegan diet and how easy it is. (Not sure if they really care about being healthy though, just a guess, but do it anyway).    \n    \n&gt; Right now I feel really alienated... I'm not seeing my family the same way, and not in a good way. Honestly I wasn't prepared for this.    \n     \nYeah, there's not much you can do except keep your distance and try to keep the peace. People with die-hard extreme family values and traditions make me kinda sick, to be honest. Obviously I'm going to love my family but if my dad decides to start beating my mother or become a nazi or a murderer/rapist/etc im sure as hell not going to be on his side or love him anymore just because of \"muh family values!!!111\".    \nThe comparison might seem a bit extreme but its not really. If we were in a world with 98% vegans/vegetarians then the omnis would seem barbaric and horrible. But eating meat is the norm so we have this fucked up meat-eating dystopia that skews views.    \n    \nAnyway, just some thoughts of mine that I let spill out. I hope it works out, and don't forget you're doing a wonderfully beautiful thing by being vegan, and at the very least, I love you for it.",

"comment": "Eggs need to be replaced by different things depending on the use. \n\nIn baking, for an easy substitute, use egg replacement powder that you can get at most supermarkets and health food stores. You can also use ground flax or chia seeds mixed with water.\n\nFor scrambled eggs and omelettes, tofu is the way to go. A good tofu scramble is wonderful, but it can take a little while to work it out. \n\nIf you want to fry something up and have it in a sandwich or a burger, you can use a piece of tofu or tempeh.\n\nKala namak or black salt (which is actually pink!) can be found at indian grocery shops and has a sulfuric 'eggy' flavour that is very helpful. \n\nSeriously, eggs are very easy to cut out. You can even make [vegan devilled eggs](http://likeavegan.com.au/2014/09/deviled-eggs/)! \n\nThis page looks pretty helpful in general: http://www.eatright.org/resource/food/nutrition/vegetarian-and-special-diets/egg-alternatives\n\nIf you have any particular dishes you eat with egg in them, feel free to mention them and I'll see if I can help you think of an alternative. Unfortunately they're hard to avoid in commercial baked goods, and at restaurants, without dramatically impacting on what you order but it should be no problem to keep more or less the same diet at home.",

You support factory farming, you're just too much of a coward to admit it.\n\n&gt;I also slaughter my own chickens and pigs. \n\nThen how do you support those magical farms which totally exist even though you can't actually name a single one?\n\n&gt; It's a beautiful relationship we have\n\nIf you wouldn't happily trade roles, then no, it's not a beautiful relationship.\n\n&gt;Do you know what would happen if we up and stopped eating meat? We'd have a serious population problem and I would fear for the future of the human race.\n\nI'd type out a response, but this comment is just too stupid to warrant it.  I mean really, this is weapons-grade stupid right here - we're well over carrying capacity of the planet due almost exclusively to our reliance on animal agriculture and you're feigning worry that we might have a problem if we reverse that?  That's just ignorant.\n\n&gt;Do yourself a favor and go visit a responsible farm. \n\nYou first.  I mean come on, you really think you're the first halfwit to stop by and tell us that you buy only responsible meat straight from the farmer?  I'm betting you're so ignorant on the topic that you don't even realize that practically no farmers slaughter on site, almost no one ever sells direct to retail customers, extremely few  give tours of their facilities (it ruins the make-believe image of caring about animal rights and really just isn't profitable),  and a whole bunch of other shit that makes your story completely impossible.  I mean ffs man, at least make your lie somewhat believable?\n\n&gt; Then visit a lab where the shit you eat is manufactured by humans.\n\nTIL apparently all vegetables come from a lab, and also apparently that's somehow a bad thing.",

You have to eat much more volume of food to compensate. \n\n If I were you I would gradually increase the size of my portions. If you were skinny beforehand and still lost 20+ pounds you probably need to increase your portion sizes a lot. So gradually doing it is probably the best way. You might feel bloated if you don't do it in steps, your body needs time to adapt.",

"comment": "So let's just continue to misuse the word rape then. You eat plants don't you? Stop raping our crops. Animals need them to survive. You're indirectly killing animals by creating an industry for their food source. That never clued in did it? Turns out you're also a rape enabler. So who are you to say raping animals is worse than raping plants?\n\n[Ever heard of grafting](https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-grafting-mean-4125565)? Branches are literally torn from the plant and forced onto another. Imagine ripping off a cows leg and growing it out of a pigs chest. Why don't you feel for that plant?\n\n&gt; Idk about people willingly killing insects without needing. They fall into psychopaths.\n\nSo every person that smacks a mosquito or squishes a spider are psychopaths to you? \n\n&gt;Virus and bacteria don't actually die, they are able to stay alive in extreme conditions. They actually need certain solutions to be wiped out. \n\nYour first and second sentence conflict each other. Your second sentence is right, in other words - they die, does your biology book not talk about lysis?\n\n&gt; Like did you seriously ever read biology in school? Skipped classes? Central nervous system and brain. Animal kingdom vs plant kingdom.\n\nYes I did. That's why I know that both plants and animals are eukaryotes. Did you not realize plants and animals have evolved together since the beginning? They are separated for the purpose of classification, but similar in survival and suffering. \n\n&gt; I have no comment on someone who can't differentiate between planned farming and accidental killing. \n\nSo are you saying if I accidentally hit a deer on the road, you'd be fine with me eating it? Because it's different, right? \n\n&gt; Cutting fruits is so agonizing we close our child's eyes. Because a detached part of plant used to spread it's seed- is being killed.\n\nI fail to see a point here. We also don't close our children's eyes when we go hunting, or butchering meat. \n\n&gt; Not caring is not something to brag about, that's a dehumanizing element.\n\nIt's not a brag, it's just a statement. The fact you think of it as a brag shows your over encompassing prejudice on the subject. Also what percent of humans are vegan again? How is it dehumanizing to do something that the majority of humans do, and have done for millenia? Being a vegan is dehumanizing, in the sense that it is to go against the norm.\n\n&gt; Though does one care about plants by using 16x more of what they could and killing animals along? A discount offer? \n\nSee this is the issue. I'm not killing animals, I'm eating them. For you to make the connection that I eat animals therefore I kill animals then you must agree with you [kill children](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5399491/tech-giants-sued-over-appalling-deaths-of-children-who-mine-their-cobalt-1.5399492) because you use a smartphone/the internet/any modern convenience. If you disagree, that's the definition of cognitive dissonance.\n\nSo to recap, following the same logic you have been using, you are a rape enabling child murderer. You're a rape enabler because you kill and eat eukaryotes, like me. And you're a child murderer because you use modern technology, like me. But hey, at least you only rape and eat one half of the eukaryote domain!",

Although acid reflux should (on paper) decrease with a vegan diet it’s perfectly possible to temporarily increase with any change in diet.\n\nI’ve had it severely (when eating meat) and the pain is very close to the heart even though it’s nothing to do with the heart.\n\nThe medicine you need for this is called “ranitidine” usually sold under the brand name “Zantec”. Any acid reflux medicine will do though, like Rennies. They’re all over the counter and extremely cheap.\n\nIf you don’t have immediate access to that then the solution is, surprisingly perhaps, to INCREASE the pressure in your stomach to force the gas out (it’s the gas which causes pain, not the acid itself). You can do this by drinking fizzy drinks, not water like youd think. Also, sitting on the toilet (with your pants down) and putting your head as close to your feet as possible increases the pressure in your stomach forcing you to fart the gas out.\n\n\nHowever if you think there’s even a 1% chance you’re having a heart attack you must call yourself ambulance immediately.",

People were really challenging their belief systems, and there were a few commitments to go vegan.”\n\nGood work. I support PETA and their bold, disruptive style of activism just as I support Earthling Ed and his Socratic debating style. Both forms of activism have their place within a liberation movement.\n\nIt's somewhat sad to see even other vegans expect activists to walk on eggshells and consider whether their activism might offend meat-eaters. I can't think of any other social justice movement of which this is expected.",

The original comment said people might not prioritise this cause or they might also have problems of their own so if one starts a conversation with a stranger by saying animal abuse is bad. The stranger has all the right to walk away. It doesn't mean they support animal abuse it just means you are being annoying by shoving uncomfortable topics on people when they are not prepared for it. \n\nSo I replied saying I don't understand why that comment is downvoted because it makes sense. Many vegans do make veganism their entire personality. So for those vegans I am trying to say, making the world a better place does not stop at being vegan.\n\nPlease let me know how I am wrong! 🙏",

The 100% vegan for the animal potlucks I go to are crazy. Everyone makes a homemade dish that took them hours to prepare. They are nitpicky about good hygiene and cleaning up after themselves and not bringing things that create a lot of garbage. Most people bring compostable plates, and also bring food for the surrounding wildlife (we usually have potlucks in outdoor parks or meadows.. yes it's as beautiful as you picture it). \n\nBut if it were a non-vegan potluck I wouldn't attend. Wouldn't even entertain the idea. 😂 Especially after attending the most calm and relaxing potlucks full of vegans. \n\nBut again, I love your answers so much. Esp the beans and lentils one, it hit home. \n\nI wish I could upvote your comment even harder. 💖",

"comment": "This really isn't the thread for this conversation, as your question has nothing to do with OP's post, but I'll bite. Killing even a single animal is a rights violation. Vegans believe that animals, like humans, should be granted the right to life. So, killing directly (when that killing isn't necessary) is a direct violation of that animal's right to life.\n\nFarming food does unfortunately have casualties, but it's something that (as of now) is out of our control. We do need to eat *something* in order to survive, and plants are the most sustainable option with no unnecessary rights violations (unlike hunting animals for food, where we purposely end their lives despite it being unnecessary).\n\nThink of it like this (in human terms). It's the difference between kidnapping a person, murdering them and then consuming their flesh vs. protecting your own food supply from thieves and doing what you can to keep it safe for your personal survival.\n\nAlso, ethics aside, hunting is not sustainable. If the entire population of humans relied on hunting animals for food, well...there simply aren't enough deer to sustain over 8 billion people.",

"comment": "&gt; Of course, the example family in question are not vegans.\n\nOk, so what was the question then? Are they acting ethically? No they are not. Their substitution of a personally-killed deer in place of a farmed cow makes so little difference to the total amount of unnecessary harm they are causing that it's not really even worth thinking about. And to be clear, I am not saying \"Farmed cow harmful, killed deer not harmful.\" It is just a different form of harm, and is arguably worse or better (though still being very, very, very bad), depending on what factors you consider. \n\n&gt;I was making the distinction between hunting and industrial scale meat supply. You didn't have to comment if you were not interested.\n\nSo, you just came here to tell us your thoughts about this \"distinction\" you see, and that's it? No, I am not interested in your point of view. I am, however, interested in what makes you and others like you feel the need to drop in and tell us your utterly unoriginal points of view though. \n\n&gt;The importance of the distinctions which you have identified is that one method for meat eaters to consume meat involves horrific practices where animals are pent up in cages and pens and do not have any semblance of a natural existence before being killed for food. The other method they do have a natural existence before being killed. Thus, the entire point of this back and forth is to simply highlight that hunting is, for the meat eater, and maybe for some vegetarians and vegans, more defensible than factory farming. You might not agree with that, and that's fine of course.\n\nNo, I don't agree with that, and therefore I don't think that this \"disctinction\" that you see is remotely interesting, nor is it relevant to veganism. \n\n&gt;That's fine. But I don't see the ethical problem in killing animals for food, only if it's done on a large scale, that's what I'm taking away from veganism at the moment.\n\nWell I think you must be engaging in some extreme mental gymnastics to arrive at that conclusion. I can tell you without a doubt that there is nothing vegan about hunting at all. So, if that's where you arrived after looking into veganism, I would say that you must have either a reading comprehension problem, or you just willingly interpret things you see/read/hear incorrectly in order to make them support the point of view that you already hold. I'm sorry that spending time in /r/vegan has failed you so badly that you've so completely missed the point.",
