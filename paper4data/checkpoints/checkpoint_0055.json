Also, although it does get subsidized (which I never said it wash't) it still is less than oil. \n\nOil received 3.7 billion in 2010; oil companies receive 1.7 billion in tax breaks every year; and, there are 1.25 billion in tax breaks for exploration. \nhttp://www.policymic.com/articles/73903/two-big-things-you-didn-t-know-about-oil-subsidies\n\nYou're really only proving that EVs receive tax breaks, not that they are more than oil.",

"comment": "Done. I lease a nissan leaf, so I have some experience as an EV driver. And I rarely use public chargers because they are mostly located in town and I live in town so nightly charging at home in my garage at low nightly rates gives me plenty of range for daily commuting.\n\nI prefer pay per charge or(even better!) pay per kWh. Many times with an electric car your battery may still have a decent amount of charge, but you need to top it up for the rest of your daily travel. \nYou didn't offer per kWh charging as a payment option.\n\nWhether the time it takes to charge matters is dependent on what you plan to be doing during that time. If charging is delaying you from getting on with your day then that is a problem. If you are sleeping or working or eating then the time it takes to charge is much less important. \n\nMy vehicle is not equipped for wireless charging so that doesn't currently interest me much now. It seems like it would be convenient if you had a wireless charger at home in the garage but because I don't do a lot of public charging and standards are still lacking I don't see public wireless charging as very popular in the near term. Wireless(induction) charging is at best 90% efficient so it will cost a little more because 10% of the electricity is wasted for convenience. I prefer wired charging because it is more efficient.\n\nThe only wireless charging systems currently on the market are low powered level 2 chargers(3.3kW). Because of the high levels of current involved and the transmission losses I doubt we will ever see fast DC charging systems that work wirelessly. So people may prefer wireless charging in 10-20 minutes but I don't think that will ever be possible.",

"comment": "&gt; L2 requires a dedicated 240V circuit at a minimum of 40A\n\nNo it doesn't! L2 just means 208-240V - you can charge on L2 at as low as 6A (I've done it!) You can also find existing 200-277V lighting circuits to tap off of (someone in my parking lot at work managed that) and you can combine two out-of-phase 120V circuits to make 240V (I have an adapter to do just that.)\n\nBut yes, it's true that you're more likely to find an existing 120V circuit somewhere if you're looking to jury-rig something. That said, doing so would be a terrible idea for a long-term charging solution - you'd be hard-pressed to know just how loaded the circuit is (and when it's loaded), so you run the risk of tripping some breaker you might not be able to reset yourself (at best), or starting a fire, and that's if you manage not to electrocute yourself in the process. The high, continuous load of electric vehicle charging should not be taken lightly, and that's why you should always have a dedicated circuit for charging, even if just L1.\n\nHence the discussion should be restricted to installing a new circuit for charging, and again I'll reiterate my point: the cost (both materials and labor) of installing a 240V circuit need not be any more than that of installing a 120V circuit.\n\nWhat does it take to install a new 20A 120V circuit? Two #12 conductors and a ground, a receptacle, and a breaker. What does it take to install a new 20A 240V circuit? **Two #12 conductors and a ground, a receptacle, and a breaker!** The only difference is it's a different type of receptacle and a different type of breaker, but the cost difference there is peanuts - probably less than $20. Also, if you're up for doing the installation yourself it's just as easy either way -  just attach two wires to the breaker instead of one to the breaker and the other to the neutral bar - but I'm assuming that's not a possibility in OP's case.\n\nNow, of course you *can* spend a little more to run thicker wire and install a higher-amperage receptacle and breaker. And you probably should - even if the cost of 50A-rated wire is double that of 20A-rated, the difference there will still pale in comparison to the cost of an electrician's labor for all but the simplest installs (and I'm guessing OP's install won't be easy.)",

"comment": "- New England electricity is expensive during the wintertime (I hear), so you may want to just make the wintertime trips with a gas vehicle anyways. Are the quick chargers near you CCS (VW eGolf) or CHAdeMO (Leaf, Kia Soul) or both?\n- Worries over quick charging degradation seem to have been somewhat premature. Real world testing shows a [few percent extra battery lost](http://insideevs.com/idaho-national-laboratory-dc-quick-charging-nissan-leaf-doesnt-kill-battery/) over 40k miles on a vehicle that was ONLY charged with CHAdeMO vs a vehicle ONLY charged with 3 kW AC. Charging every now and then shouldn't be concerning.\n- Gas prices are low today, due to overproduction (essentially economic war between shale oil producers and arab oil producers). Do you think it will stay low over the car's lifetime? Look at [historical data](http://www.gasbuddy.com/Charts) for your area. And cost of ownership is as much reduced due to reduced maintenance as it is due to cheaper \"fuel\".\n- Consider carefully your needs and whether current electric vehicles (including the just announced [2016 LEAF](http://www.autoblog.com/2015/09/10/2016-nissan-leaf-with-107-mile-range-will-start-at-37-640/), which has 25% more range on the higher trims) meet those needs. If they don't meet your needs then **don't buy**! If they meet most of your needs and your remaining gas vehicle can service the occasional outlier trips, then go ahead and start looking! You may also want to consider lease options, which would remove the obsolescence concern.",

That'd be like saying that Amazon.com loses $2 on every book it sells.  Or that Applebee's loses $0.95 on every riblet.  No one in the financial world analyzes revenue vs. expenses like that, but a lot of people don't make it past the headline and are being deliberately misled.  \n\nI know the hate isn't new. It's like when a couple of Teslas caught fire in a short period (about six weeks, IIRC). None of the reporting bothered to mention that something like 600 internal combustion vehicles catch fire every month.  The stock took a pretty big hit back then too.  I'm sure the company will be fine.  Maybe I should use the drop as an excuse to buy a few more shares!",

"comment": "&gt; Ah. Okay. Anything that costs more to buy, by definition costs more to operate. Got it.\n\nWell, unless the functionality or lifespan is significantly larger/longer.\n\nAnd in the case of BEV's, the functionality (range, etc) is dramatically lower, the lifespan (especially w/o replacing the battery) is dramatically shorter -- but the initial cost of manufacture is double (and arguably triple, because -- currently at least -- the things are being made and sold in such small numbers, and at MSRP price points {not even touching on the direct Government to consumer subsidy/incentives} that there is ZERO profit in them; whereas the ICE vehicles that are sold at &lt; 1/2 the MSRP price are extremely profitable {even in the most basic models}).\n\nNor is any of that likely to change. The cost and weight/performance factors around the batteries -- despite the dreams/claims of various \"fantasy\" articles positing some \"Moore's Law\" style order of magnitude innovations -- are, at best, going to be improved by a very minor incremental fraction, one that really won't impact the equation by much at all.\n\n&gt;I don't want to do all of that work. I'm just going to consider the \"cost to me.\"\n\nWhich is fine, except it doesn't (cannot) \"scale\" to a society wide extent -- so there is inherently a \"parasitic\" phenom going on here, and the *perceived* costs (via the prices) is being artificially distorted (significantly so) to create an illusion... one that simply ISN'T true in reality.\n\nIt's really not all that different than say \"subsidizing\" wind power by placing a surtax onto the power generated via traditional fuels (or any of a dozen other accounting book shenanigans to hide or obfuscate various costs) -- one may thereby *create an artificially distorted illusion that the \"cost per kWh\" of \"wind energy\" is* **lower** * than that from Coal or natural gas* -- but the **reality** doesn't actually change, just because someone has fraudulently monkeyed with the books; and no matter HOW it is fully figured, if one does so HONESTLY, then **in fact** the actual **cost** of wind generated energy per kWh is still several times more expensive.\n\n&gt;About half of the money you're thinking of as subsidies from the government are really just fiat money created on the spot, and it would be spent somewhere anyway, because it's not actually money - it's numbers in a spreadsheet somewhere that the lenders shuffle back and forth as they pretend we live in a world where money is an actual thing.\n\nThat also doesn't alter the actual **cost.**\n\nThe numbers and \"money\" may be created \"ex nihilo\", but the resources they are used to purchase then cannot be used for other things -- and the prices of those other things then will eventually rise (or alternately the \"gains of innovation\" which would otherwise *significantly reduce* those prices are \"eaten up\" by the inflation) for everyone using that currency.\n\nTANSTAAFL.\n\n&gt;So, yeah, there are subsidies. Fuck it, I don't care any more. I spend a smaller amount of my paycheck to drive, and THAT's what is motivating me today.\n\nAgain fine, just be aware that it IS a form of \"welfare\" -- government redistribution of value -- and moreover one that cannot/will not be implemented society wide, nor will it be around for long... and the TRUE cost \"chickens\" will eventually come home to roost, **so be prepared for that, and don't bitch and whine about it being \"unfair\" when (and in the many and various forms that it does) happens,** because you've CHOSEN to hop onto that bandwagon.",

"comment": "Good article. I'm excited for both cars, but people are a bit naive to think that Model 3 will simply be $35k. If it's anything like Model S, any extra options will balloon the price quick. NOT that that is a problem with Model 3.\n\nBolt on the other hand, if anything like Volt, will cost right about what it says it will. If Bolt delivers on its promises, then I think it will become the true \"economy\" EV with 200 miles that people think Model 3 will be. It certainly wont \"kill\" Model 3 because, as you stated, they aren't really competing.\n\nPeople that are talking about the \"Tesla killer\" right now are stuck in the late 2000's when everyone was looking for the \"iPhone killer.\"",

Customers still have the remainder of that manufacturer's fiscal quarter to receive the full tax break.  If Tesla works it right, they'll sell their 200,000th car at the very beginning of a quarter and their customers will enjoy three more months at the full tax credit.",

The Bolt may not be shit but they're shit at making it because they can't (and don't want to) meet demand because they're losing $7500 per vehicle and because they're electric they won't make that up in repair and maintenance costs. GM is schizo because they're driven by the need to keep their dealers happy so they'll keep making sure that EVs don't succeed. The Bolt is a compliance car. Nothing more. The Volt was a passable attempt but it has failed in all markets outside the US. They've just started to sell tiny numbers of the Bolt in Europe where it could be a winner but they've decided not to sell it in right hand drive so large parts of asia pacific and the UK will not be getting it. Meanwhile GM continues to sell giant trucks and utes. GM hasn't got a real clue and they're still lobbying to hold back EVs as much as they can. GM are not the good guys.",

Dyson wanted to launch a car with solid state batteries, Fisker wanted to do the same and so did others. If we had more optimistic release dates, what changed? Bosch also bought a company working on solid state batteries and recently announced they are selling it and scrapping plans for a 200 GWh worth of annual production capacity. \n\nAs a key to dominate the next decade of mobile devices and electric vehicles, seems rather odd everyone would choose to delay their adoption instead of doubling down on it and beat competitors. My guess is that they can't think of ways to mass produce the cells at a low enough price to beat current technology. This is still not sufficient however since it would still make sense for niche applications like aircrafts, high end mobile devices and cars.",

We didn't create the demand, but if people aren't buying it from us, they're buying shit quality oil from the middle-east which is kind of worse considering who holds alot of the oil in the ME. The government is working quite extensively to ramp down our oil industry as well, with our largest oil company looking to move into the renewable energy industry fully once the oil boom is gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo on a local level and for the individuals we do benefit from EVs and their massive adoption rate. Our air is already considerably better with nearly 20% of all cars being electric now. Our EV infrastructure is indeed pretty great with chargers being everywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBad news is that the government is now ramping down the benefits to EV, assuming that the industry is strong enough to sustain itself without government aid now. I partially agree but I worry that people sitting on the fence will use this as moral licensing to get another ice car.",

"comment": "Petrol is 8,30Dkk pr liter. And I have to say I have really not been able to figure out the newly changed pricing scheme for charging. Charging at home is def cheeper, but public chargers have varying prices depending on how you charge + a minute price, which sometimes makes it more expensive to charge than to use diesel. The minute price was added to dissuade people from just parking their cars at the chargers, and so hogging the spot, which is a fair point, but could def have been handled better.  \n\n\nThere are not that many who are overly happy about that arrangement.  \nI personally don't have any car.",

The two EVs I notice the most here in Australia are Kona Electric and Model 3, with a smattering of Nissan Leafs.\n\nMy two complaints with the '20 Kona were rear legroom (with indents in the front seats for the rear passengers' knees) and overall cargo capacity. How do you feel about the new model?\n\nThings I liked about the Kona were the extra storage up front (does it still have the top and bottom trays with no walls in the centre console?) and the HUD which presented turn-by-turn navigation directions, current speed limit, cruise control set speed and vehicle actual speed. The stuff I need, no fluff.\n\nI ended up getting the Model 3 SR+ because at the time the difference in price for us was about 10% (Kona slightly cheaper) but the Model 3 had more cargo space, and the rear seats were comfortable for two adults, or three adults could fit snugly (\"two in the back, three if you're friends\"). I miss having a stalk control for the windscreen wipers.",

Yes it is inefficient but that can be a lesser concern if storing it requires essentially no prep work and it can be stockpiled for a cloudy day essentially indefinitely.\n\nI think EVs are the way forward for most vehicles but ironically I think the grid will be best served by synfuels in a renewable energy future.",

Shame they sold so few, or what ever other reason caused the model to be discontinued.   In that 6 months, barely 5000 miles, I used under 2 gallons of gas.  Were not for my Model 3 pre-order coming up sooner than anticipated, I would have been happy continuing to drive the Volt.\n\nI'm also a fan of the RAV4 Prime from a PEV range, vehicle size and functionality perspective.... not so much a fan of Toyota these days and their anti EV lobbying.  Even were that not the case, I believe there is a very limited # of Primes available and crazy dealer markups.  Have heard of several acquaintances in the market recently, receive unreasonable quotes past few months for a RAV4 Prime.\n\nBig part of the reason I'd suggest Used Bolt or Volt is the chance for getting a more reasonable deal, although I don't know what the new market is doing for Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona, VW IDs, etc.  I'm mostly assuming new EV pricing and availability is as compacted as most new ICE vehicles currently.",

That you're bent outta shape about Tesla not getting a shout-out from the President is hilariously petty.\n\nThe infrastructure bill charger money does require coordination (&lt;50 mile spacing).\n\nWhat would any of those Tesla issues have to do with this conversation?

"comment": "I mean, you aren't necessarily wrong. Once you load a Bolt EUV up with Super Cruise and the panoramic sunroof, you definitely are in Model 3 territory in terms of pricing. $38,000 versus $40,000.\n\nBut the question then becomes, what are buyers willing to accept for that supposed $25,000 base price?\n\nFor example. Even an absolutely base spec $21,700 Toyota Corolla has full-speed radar adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and the usual proactive ADAS tech. If Tesla needs all the Autopilot hardware to achieve the same level of functionality as Toyota's TSS 3.0, does that mean that the supposed new \"cheap car\" won't be able to save any costs in that way?\n\nWith so many features just integrated into the car, it becomes tough to take things away. Sure, you could swap the vinyl seats for cloth, make them manually-adjusting, take away the power-tilt steering wheel... But a lot of the stuff that sets Tesla apart from every other car can't be taken away, can it?",

"comment": "It looks pretty good, a more traditional SUV shape to the EV6, although I wonder how big the dimensional differences will be between this and the EV6.\n\nI also wonder how this will fit in Kia’s lineup price-wise, especially in the US (I assume it’s coming to the US). The EV pricing structure of Kia EVs being sold currently in the US is quite confusing; the Niro EV starts at $39,550, the EV6 starts at just a tiny bit more at $42,600. I assume the EV5 is slotting between those two so what will the price of the EV5 be in such a narrow price range between the Niro EV and EV6? I can only assume Kia will drop the price of the Niro EV to $30k or so (what it should’ve been priced in the first place) and have the EV5 slot in at $35k-$37k and keep the EV6 base price. \n\nAlso, the boxy shape probably means less range than the EV6. Although there’s no battery specifications in this press release, I assume it’ll have similar battery sizes to the other E-GMP cars; that being 58kWh and 77.4kWh or possibly the updated 84kWh battery. I can only assume it charges well too, since it’s an E-GMP car.",

On a scooter just taking your hand off one side of the handlebars for a second can cause a crash, you can ride all day long with one hand on your bike and be fine. \n\nNow the biggest thing I don’t like about the bike is it’s only rear wheel drive, where most scooters are dual wheel drive. This is good if you’re trying to do wheelies, but not really practical. This means if you hit the throttle too hard you “Loop it” (the bike does a wild uncontrolled wheelie and you end up on your ass. \n\nThat being said the bike seems safer to ride and more versatile. I love the freedom of going down and even up some gentle stairs if I need to. I can go on trails but also on the road up to about 60mph.

To the constant leaking of other fluids on their property ranging from coolant to transmission fluid to bodily fluids. Meanwhile all those leaks from gas vehicles carry to the roadways. Then we get into emissions and all that not to mention the manufacturing and transportation before they hit the consumer and the products it takes to run them. Everyone seems to focus on emissions with gas and diesel vehicles but it's so much more than just emissions. Mining for things happens with gas vehicles to and on a far more rapid rate and scale some of which have been the leading cause of cancer/death/workplace accidents.

For Lucid or Tesla, they are made in the US so a good amount of that money is spent here itself. Even if something is not owned by China, what if most of the part comes from China so the money still goes to China. Ideally something that's made in a democratic country with parts from similar countries, and preferably supporting local workers. So, a mix of USMCA and inflation reduction act.",

They have a reason to stay a little longer.\n\n4) it's a perk to upscale employees/managers. Many sr staff are buying Teslas and if you don't have workplace charging they may not work there.\n\nCons\n\n1) The circuits are a little underprovisioned when you have block heaters you assume 25% duty cycle at 800-1000 watts, L-1 charging is 1000-1500 watts at 10)% duty cycle, so you may not have as many L-1 chargers depending on the actual details.\n\n2) The NEMA 5-15 outlets are going to see higher wear rates so they may need to be replaced with Commercial/industrial outlets.\n\n3) If the breakers pop, you need a protocol to reset them. It's a big hassle if the breaker box is in a basement or a locked cabinet.\n\n4) It will cost a dollar per day, more depending on local power rates. Less if you have incentive rates.\n\n5) if you don't have enough outlets sharing can become a problem. You may need to arrange restricted use\n\n6) The building may have engineering limits.\n\n7) Sometimes thieves target the chargers.",

"comment": "If they are claiming depreciation, than you are dealing with an operating lease, as opposed to a capital lease. Operating leases can only be for 80% of the asset life and something around 90% of the value of the asset. So your buyout at the end of 20 years should be at least 10% of the proposed install cost (perhaps 40 cents per watt).\n\nThe fact that they've claimed accelerated depreciation won't impact the buyout one bit - except for the tax treatment of the sale. The only value of accelerated depreciation is that you can fully deduct the asset over a quicker term than it's useful life. But, if you fully deduct the asset and then sell it for $X, you have made a profit on the asset and have to pay income tax on that $X. So the least company gets a modest tax break today, but they have to pay it back tomorrow. The net impact of accelerated depreciation is equivalent to a loan at .25% above prime for ~35% of the asset value over the life of the asset. It's fine and good, but not anything spectacular.\n\nIf they depreciate 100% and then sell the asset for 10%, they pay income tax on that 10%. If they depreciate to 90% and then sell for 10%, they make no profit = no income tax. If they depreciate to 80% and then sell for 10%, they lose 10% (deduction for loss).\n\nDepreciation is simply an accounting principle representing the loss of the asset value over the life of the asset.\n\nNow, there is property tax savings in fully depreciating the array. But since you are not the owner of the array, you shouldn't be paying a property tax increase.  There is an interesting debate over whether or not SolarCity should be paying property tax on their leases in states that have exempted residential solar arrays from property tax. At the end of the day, it is a debate for professors, because accelerated depreciation quickly gets SC out of that taxable liability anyway (but the answer is yes they should, its tax on equipment, not on real estate).\n\nSO I hope this answers your question. I could go on further... depreciation + solar is a very interesting subject.",

"comment": "Bob is right, you are wrong on several points.  \n\nThe incoming power is used (usually), and the times of peak generation for solar usually coincides well with peak demand (afternoons in July when the AC is running full blast everywhere).  And since the power is generated, and is used by the grid during a time of peak utilization, then it only seems fair to pay the solar generators for that power.\n\nYou are right, most of the localized power grid is not made for widescale solar power generation - the grid is like a tree, and adding too much solar to grid at the local level is like weighing down the twigs at the end of the branches on a tree.  But this can be solved by matching generation and production... which is what all the large utilities do.  The smart grid is a different but related issue which is primarily aimed at reducing brownouts and blackouts  - with or without solar, the concept of a \"smart grid\" is still a good one.\n\nThere can be no doubt that solar generation presents a challenge to the business models of power utilities - it's not easy.  And even the most excited of the solar generation enthusiasts could probably be persuaded to admit this.  But I have spoken to the head of our local public utility several times about solar generation and he sees it as a challenge but a net win-win for both the utility and the solar generator if we move slowly and thoughtfully and design the solar systems correctly.  SRP is moving the wrong direction with this - instead of moving slowly and thoughtfully, they are working to kill it off entirely, and continue with their prior business model because this is easy... but this will likely hurt them in the long term - even if it's not outright illegal as Solarcity is claiming.",

"comment": "They are no where near 75% more efficient, they do cost about that much more though.   But what is much more important is that solar efficiency is pretty much the ratio of area to output.   So the difference of 15-18% for most to 20% for sunpower really amounts to a small bit of space on the roof.   Solar PV systems are sold by the Watt, and they produce over time watt/ hours or kwh.  Basically any system of the same installed size in watts that fits on your roof will produce over time about the same kwh.   So what you want to look for is a decent $/watt price.   No Sunpower will push that their modules last longer and degrade slower.   They make the claim that in 30 years their modules will have degraded less than others.  This may or may not be true but their literature and sales pitch is comparing them to pretty much the worst competition from 5 years ago.\nI highly recommend getting 2 to 3 quotes.",

"comment": "Hi dr. Nick,\n\nThe solar tax credit can be used 20 years going forward for your federal tax liability, or one year going back.  So if it gets installed by the end of 2017 you can use it for 2016.  You are fine!\n\nEdit: an additional thing I will note is that the system doesn't need to be \"turned on\" to receive the credit.  All it needs to be is \"substantially complete\" so if they get out there and put the panels on before 2016 is up, you can likely even use it for 2015's taxes",

"comment": "Battery banks do more damage to demand charges than kwh charges. Utilities have been pushing residential solar users into demand charges (ex. Georgia Power) but this trend will do a sudden about face once batteries become cost-effective.\n\nActually, batteries represent a larger threat to utility revenue than solar power generation. 50% of rate payers are on demand charges, and demand charges reflect 50% of those bills. So the utility could see something like ~10% of its revenue do a sharp nose dive within five years time due to cheap batteries. Whereas, it's taken solar roughly 10 years to grow to ~1% of our energy supply.",

Mandatory TOU or residential demand-based billing structures are almost non-existant while digital meters are prevelant. Nobody is talking about how efficiency controls could drastically deplete utility revenue, akin to electric vehicles and the gas tax. Instead it's all about how solar isn't going to solve every problem with our electric grid and how  solar owners are moochers. \n\nSolar is only at 1% nationally. As it grows, expect fundamentally different approaches to design. For example, if net-metering were not an option, north-facing arrays are only ~15% less cost effective than South facing arrays. But you don't here solar installers even thinking about that because it's not the low hanging fruit. We're still in the low hanging fruit phase of industry growth.

"comment": "I would love to see more utility scale solar projects.  I think they're a much better option than home rooftop solar.\n\nThey will almost certainly be sited in better locations for power production based on solar.  A solar panel has a certain embodied energy involved in creating it, so the best return on energy is to put it in the best locations - typically sunny locations.  There are tons of small rooftop solar systems in Seattle pointed in different directions, whereas I'd rather see more utility scale systems east of the mountains - it's a hot, dry, sunny climate there most of the year, so you get more energy out of solar, and more than make up for fairly minor transmission losses.  Utilities are in a position to increase the capacity on interconnect lines to do things like that.\n\nIt also means utilities will be able to predict power generation, and set their systems up for what *they* need - not what happens to be convenient.  I'd expect to see utility scale solar systems have a signficant number of panels pointing southwest or west, to take advantage of the late afternoon &amp; evening sun that corresponds with peak cooling demand and cooking demand - \"anti-duck-curve\" systems.\n\nAnd, finally, I really, really do like the power grid.  I'd like to see the power grid remain, and homeowner rooftop solar poses a significant long term threat to the viability of the power grid.  Hawaii is likely to be the first state to lose it's power grid, as more and more homes go off grid.  Their power is hellishly expensive (around $0.33/kWh), and people are willing to put up with the inconveniences of an off grid system to save tons of money.\n\nGrid tied systems basically use the grid but don't pay for it.  Or don't pay as much for it.  And there are huge outcries when utilities say, \"Fine, you don't want to use power, you'll pay for the cost of grid maintenance in your base cost now.\"\n\nThe one downside to utility scale solar is that it won't save people who can afford to put panels on their roof quite as much money.  I'm fine with that.  It's more likely to have a real impact on emissions and fossil fuel use.\n\n//EDIT: If you're downvoting this, care to explain why?  With something other than \"BUT EVIL UTILITIES!!!\"?",

Over the past week it has generated about 12kwh per day, which is just a little less than what you would need to offset your electric costs, so if I were you, I'd be looking at a 8-9 kw system if you want to be 100% renewable.",

"comment": "A wood stove and an incredibly deep battery bank would do. But there are more ways to do solar power than just panels and batteries. Earthships are a good design that can be a very good source of solar power as heat. There is also another new technique which im very interested in called solar slabs which is done by placing cinder blocks sideways on the floor like you were making a wall horizontally across the floor only instead of staggering the bricks like a real brick wall you align the holes to act as air channels. It was in a book I read on passive solar power, what it does is two things; store heat from the sun during the day and circulate the air from the cold north wall through the slab and out the other side on the south as the warm air rises like water heating in a pot. With a few fans and in the case of Canada a heater you can apparently drop your fuel use very significantly.",

"comment": "If you weren't growing food for the animals, the you would be growing it for all of the humans that don't eat animals. So you end up with the same problem.  If humans didn't eat meat, we would need to be growing Just as many, or more, vegetables\n\nI was asked to give examples of ethical ways to eat meat.  I said that we have to do the research that we can and go from there. You are debating by exaggerating my points and using hyperbole, which is disingenuous. I didn't say anything about beautiful eco friendly farms, solar panels, rain water. I didn't say hunt half of your food. If you read it again, I also didn't say that I did any of it.  Those things are your attempt to make what I really said, seem worse, so shame on you. \n\nThere is a farm 20 minutes from my house. They have a freezer full of meat with a cash box next to it.  It works on the honor system.  I go there all the time. They also have raw milk that is delicious.  So far this spring, I have been trout fishing the streams at least every other day...this past week, it was every day.  One month I chose to eat nothing but food from farmers markets, just to see if I could do it.  I learned that there was a farmers market in a different town nearby, every day of the week.  I accomplished the goal and it wasn't that hard.  I live in a city..these things are closer to people than than they think sometimes.  My wife and I both have good jobs and no kids, so we can afford to buy from the farmers market every day if we want to. So really...I am very into getting food local, and experimenting with different things.  \n\nAre you going to tell me that you don't get any vegetables from the grocery store?  Because if you do, you are contributing to unethical business practices and you aren't a real vegan. /s",

Now it's spread to many states. 350,000 employees in the industry across all 50 states.\n\nElectricity is still expensive because we're still early in the solar griwth phase. Took us a hundred years to get this grid. Solar won't flip it to sunshine overnight.\n\nBut now that it's some of the world's cheapest in the largest or smallest installs, it's starting to grow significantly.

My calculation assumes 2%pa increase. \n\n&gt;\tYou also said yourself that you’re in a hurricane prone area, how many times over the next 14 years do you expect your grid to go down? Having power to your house during an outage has a value you’re probably not factoring into your returns. How much is being power outage proof worth? It’s not zero.\n\nI agree. I would estimate 3 times in 15 years, however I have been told solar panels don’t work on a power outage as they don’t want any energy feeding into wires that may be worked on by emergency crews. I would need battery backup for this and there are no arbitrage/peak pricing to get any ROI on the battery.",

"comment": "If you want to do interconnected with your house then I would suggest going with a full solar installer. if you want to get something that you can do yourself super easily with a battery then look into GoalZero solar and battery kits but without a few of those I don't know if you would get enough power and storage for the light. If you want to have something you do totally yourself then check out /r/solardiy for a lot of lower level technical questions and equipment recommendations. but if you do that you'll need the panels as well as connectors as well as an inverter/charger and then the battery as well if you want that.",

"comment": "Most people with an accessible grid choose grid-tie for economic reasons, especially if there's net metering or some other way to get credited for excess production. With such a setup and a little luck, savings will pay for the installed cost of the solar panel system in ten years or less. Adding batteries with current battery technologies and prices pushes that savings pay off out to infinity. That's why people who install batteries do so for reasons such as no/unreliable grid, critical power supply such as life support or expensive salt water fish tanks, etc. The reason for grid-tied inverters being required to shut down when the grid goes down is because of safety for line workers. One improperly-built solar power system can put enough power on the grid to kill lineworkers miles away.",

"comment": "A while back, a friend of mine that is in the solar PV business asked me if I had any ideas about what to do with excess solar energy.\n  \nIt turns out that when all solar farms are producing a lot of power, the feed in tariff for the electricity grid goes negative - so all modern farms have batteries to use when electricity is too cheap and they release it on to the grid when it's more profitable. \n\nSome people are just using their cheap/excess green electricity to mine Bitcoin, which is a bit of a waste in my opinion.\n\nSo, about using excess solar power to produce methane? Extract CO2 from the air by chilling, hydrolize water for H2, recombine to get CH4 and O2. This is not a new idea and lots of people are doing this. It's called Synthetic Natural Gas or SNG. The trouble is it can't really be used for excess power because it takes too long to ramp up SNG production; whereas batteries respond to changes in demand in under a second. Power to gas + batteries are probably a good combination.\n\n[This list](https://www.powermag.com/a-review-of-global-power-to-gas-projects-to-date-interactive/) shows there are 57 power to gas CH4 plants in existence today and 29 of them are \"injecting into the grid\". I would define injecting into the grid as not a demo plant.  \n\nThe largest non-demo plant (power to gas, CH4, with grid injection) is \"e-Gas-Anlage Werlte\" in Werlte, Germany: 6MW and SNG production = 300 m³ / h\n\n**The gas pipes are another grid, like the electricity grid but with delivery AND storage. And the UK has over 4 bcm, or 41.86 TWh storage capacity!**\n\n*IF* the government brings in a tax on Carbon at source (taxing methane sales) *PLUS* a rebate for sequestering carbon (so that SNG is ultimately tax-free) wouldn't a great many solar PV generators be tempted to power to make gas for our water heaters and kitchen hobs, which could allow consumers to switch to Green Gas instead of replacing their appliances? Also methane is a chemical feed stock to produce carbon-neutral petrol, diesel, naptha etc.\n\nGreen Gas = A term I just made up based on \"Green Electricity\".",

I am only familiar with 3 ways of properly grounding solar panels and racking. 1, drive a separate ground rod and run the equipment grounding conductor (may be called Equipment Grounding Electrode in this setup) directly from the solar to the rod/grounding electrode. 2, sometimes you can run your EGC to the existing ground rod. This would be a common AC/DC groundjng point. 3, most common in my experiences is to land your solar EGC on the ground bar in the MAIN distribution panel. \n\nSide note: it doesn't look like your meter is 'jumped'. Which is a no no. Need a grounding/bonding lug before and after the meter with #6 bare copper landed on each lug",

"comment": "I’m in Miami and I’ve had solar for a few years and now I have powerwall system. I have a new variable speed pool pump it uses about 450W an hour so 4-5KWh a day, I have a gas pool heater so I can’t help you on the heat pump but I can say the usage will vary greatly depending on what temperature you keep the pool.\n\nUnless you can really cut your consumption 2 powerwalls is really thin for an emergency backup system.  Does your house have closed zones so you could just run 1 unit?",

"comment": "This was planned from the beginning, though it's playing out a bit different from the original plan. China has been dumping solar panels on the international market for many years in an effort to put foreign competitors out of business. Chinese solar panel manufacturers were often selling at below cost, and they didn't go out of business because they are subsidized by the Chinese government.\n\nThe goal from the beginning was to kill not just the companies that produce the solar panels in other countries, but also the foundries that produce the wafers. This means foreign countries would not only be unable to open a solar panel assembly plant, they would be unable to produce the solar cells needed to assemble solar panels. That would put the Chinese companies in the position of being able to dictate prices, or even ration supplies, which is exactly what is happening. Western countries went all in on solar power generation because the prices were artificially low, and now they have no choice but to pay the higher prices because they are heavily dependent on the technology.\n\nHold on to your hats. The Chinese have been doing the same thing in other markets, especially building materials. This is only the beginning.\n\nWe will lose the cold war with China before most people realize there was a cold war with China.",

"comment": "It would need to be a purpose bulit device. It is possibe but not simple. Your proposal is 3ph AC? I think a DC fast charger with some 30kW would be cheaper if you have batteries at home, like multiple Tesla Powerwalls. Then just tap into battery pack, make sure to connect it to get proper voltage, mix with some protocol managment and charge. Easy peasy. You only need one decommissioned DC fast charger that got burned out rectifiery, throw it away, and have somebody to fix the rest.",

If solar panels are bifocal, then you may also want to make it 3 sided shed with 4th (highest side) open and solar panels and supporting beams the entire roof, so you get extra 10% to 30% more power from light hitting underside.\n\n...\n\nI did 14 foot by 5 foot 3 sided shed with 4 different 7 foot by 3.5 foot solar panels (450 watt bifocals), 2000+ watt total potential, thanks to 10% to 30% extra energy from underside.  I can make multiple similar sheds one behind the other, all facing south and then put connecting fence panels in between them to have small fenced (eg 20x14 feet) and sheltered enclosed area that I can let rabbits and/or tiny dog run around in it.\n\nIf required I can load it onto a car hauler.  I used a layer of rubber as part of mounting system so less risk of damage to glass if I move shed.\n\n(I live on acreage so room for lots of buildings/panels, under 100 foot buildings are unregulated as far as permits goes)",

"comment": "Here’s the single most important function of this blog: Saying the things that are patently obvious but that just can’t be said these days in polite society. Yes, it’s The Emperor’s New Clothes every day here at Manhattan Contrarian.\n\n…..\n\nWith war raging in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, there is a renewed concern in many quarters for “energy independence.” Until recently, the sophisticated countries of Europe had thought the whole idea to be passé.\n\nThey built large numbers of wind turbines and solar arrays, while simultaneously banning fracking for natural gas and shuttering electricity plants that used coal and even those that used no-carbon nuclear.\n\nSuddenly, at the very worst possible time, they found themselves completely dependent on Russian gas for heat and reliable electricity.\n\n …..\n\nSo what’s the answer? If you are a member in good standing in American media/academia/environmentalist/Democratic Party society, the answer is obvious: Just build more wind turbines and solar arrays until you have enough.\n\nThese facilities will count as “domestic” electricity generation, and therefore will quickly lead to “energy independence”. What could be easier?\n\nSo permit me to say the blindingly obvious: No amount of incremental wind and solar power can ever provide energy independence.\n\nElectricity gets consumed the instant it is generated. Electricity is consumed all the time, and therefore must be generated all the time.\n\nIndeed, some of the peak times for electricity consumption occur on winter evenings, when the sun has set, temperatures are very cold, the wind is often completely calm, and the need for energy for light, heat, cooking, and more are high.\n\nDuring such times, a combined wind-and-solar generation system produces zero power. It doesn’t matter if you build a thousand wind turbines and solar panels, or a million, or a billion or a trillion. The output will still be zero.\n\nAnd calm winter nights are just the most intense piece of the problem. A full wind/solar generation system, with seemingly plenty of “capacity” to meet peak electricity demand, will also regularly and dramatically underproduce at random critical times throughout a year: for example, on heavily overcast and cold winter days; or on calm and hot summer evenings, when the sun has just set and air conditioning demand is high.",

"comment": "&gt;***WattHub: first fast-charging plaza for trucks and heavy construction equipment arrives in Geldermalsen***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A unique and innovative fast-charging plaza for heavy equipment and trucks will soon be constructed on the AVRI site, located on the A15 motorway near the Geldermalsen exit. Dura Vermeer, Ploegam, Van Oord and Betuwewind are jointly developing this world first under the name WattHub. Preparations for the charging plaza will start in February; it will be operational by the end of April. The charging plaza is located under the wind turbines and between the solar panels and will of course be powered by sustainable electricity from Betuwewind.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reason for this charging square is the project Dijkversterking Tiel-Waardenburg, executed by Dura Vermeer, Ploegam and Van Oord, for this occasion working together in the consortium Mekante Diek. The ambition is to carry out the dyke reinforcement completely emission-free. Such fast-charging plazas for large equipment and trucks do not yet exist, so the companies have joined forces to develop this themselves.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**First fast charging plaza for heavy equipment**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The charging plaza will be the first public charging plaza developed specifically for trucks and heavy equipment. With 39 charging stations and a scheduling system, there will always be sufficient charging capacity and certainty to charge at the reserved time slot. In addition, the charging plaza will have a charging capacity of up to 600 kW per charging point; this charging speed has not yet been applied anywhere else in the Netherlands.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'The Mekante Diek project has the ambition to operate completely emission-free, this would not have been possible without the \"WattHub\" charging plaza. It is great to see that as a project we are not only leaving behind a safer dike, but also a rapid charging plaza for heavy equipment that is accessible to everyone, just like the dike\", says Tom Rensen, realization manager combination Mekante Diek.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**WattHub, a charging square for the entire region**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And not only the project, but the entire region can benefit from this initiative. In fact, the charging plaza has more capacity than the project requires. This extra capacity can be used for companies with similar charging needs from and for this region. Many business owners in the region do not receive a heavier connection from the grid operator, which makes electrifying their means of transportation and pieces of equipment difficult. The charging plaza thus offers a solution for entrepreneurs who can thus invest in sustainable equipment and realize their sustainable ambitions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'We are immensely proud that as partners we can accomplish this together, a unique achievement and innovation that also benefits the entire region. This is more likely to give local entrepreneurs the opportunity to invest in more sustainable equipment. This gives an enormously good feeling,' said Gerlach Velthoven, director Betuwewind.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The recent ruling in the Porthos case, which voided the construction exemption for nitrogen emissions, has further increased the urgency for emission-free construction. The development of the first public loading bay for heavy machinery and trucks is a big step toward building with renewable energy and without nitrogen emissions.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another special feature of this project is that citizens of West Betuwe who are members of Coöperatie Betuwewind can co-invest in the project. By taking out a loan with the cooperative, the surrounding area can also benefit from the initiative as is the case for Betuwewind's wind turbines.

My question is, how do other countries deal with that? Do you downsize on solar panels for lower generation or use batteries? Thanks for your repys",

Texas is also not as green energy friendly as elsewhere, so it’s only a matter of time before they start imposing taxes and fees on solar owners. Solar installs have damn near come to a standstill in Texas relative to what they were in previous years. Anecdotally, the majority of my customers this year when I was selling solar were either from California or Arizona.",

"comment": "We run 2 water heaters and this is what I think is causing this hickup. We don't use oven, we use dryer 2x month for about 45 mins and 2nd AC unit upstairs is not running unless it's 85F in the rooms upstairs. I keep my house around 78-80F during the summer and we run well pump. So I'm guessing: water heaters + well pump are the main culprit here. Fridge and freezer are energy efficient according to stickers. Regardless of all those facts, what pisses me off badly is the fact that even though youre pumping your excess of energy back to the grid, they'll find the way to charge you even more. I don't want to know what would be the bill if we didn't have solar panels on the roof. \n\nI'm not sure why you're quoting \"green energy scam\" :-). I'm all up for new way of getting energy and inovations but this is clearly greedy company tactics. County is pushing for huge solar field and people don't like it as it will have a terrible impact on their taxes and county in general. I'm guessing that this uptick in billing will have something to do with this project. But this is all my speculations ...",

I have solar and we’re getting two powerwalls next week. \n\nWe switched to free nights last month, and it cut our bill in half, although we were still spending about $5-10 a day on the day-time energy usage we were using aside from Solar, so powerwall should take care of that. \n\nIt looks like this should work out really well - both in the short term and long term, especially if energy prices go up in the future. \n\nI did a ton of research beforehand to find the best energy plan and I landed on DirectEnergy, because of how their time frame seemed the best: a full 12 hours of free nights from 9pm-9am. And, their $15 Amazon gift card each month would help take care of the base monthly fees. \n\nThey have a $75 referral bonus if you’re interested in using my code: [LP7KFVM](https://www.directenergy.com/texas/refer-a-friend/raf/LP7KFVM)",

(Weight loss is a combination of changing habits and counting calories in vs calories out. I lost about 20 lbs over the course of a year by counting calories using the Lose It iPhone app.) Then I wanted help getting myself to eat more healthy and eat more veggies so I joined the http://veganhope.com/vegan-hope-workshop/ without knowing much about it. Turned out the workshop was mostly about how and why to give up sugar and added oils, and made me realize I had a sugar and french-fry addiction that I had to give up.",

(Check out my rarely updated [blog](http://fatmalcontent.com) if you want additional info.)\n\n1. Vega is expensive as hell, and really makes it a giant pain in the ass to do low carb affordably. Check out [trueprotein.com's custom formula maker](http://www.trueprotein.com/custom_product.aspx) and you can do your own protein powder for less than $6/lb (which is a fraction of what Vega costs). I like 50% pea / 50% rice with chocolate or vanilla flavor and stevia for sweetener. (Ask for 1/2 the stevia, as that stuff is sweet.)\n\n2. Fruits are OK in moderation, but keep an eye on your total daily carb intake.\n\n3. Green veggies are your friend. A pound of broccoli has 125 calories, so you can eat it by the pound and not gain weight.\n\n4. Add some psyllium husk fiber to your protein shakes. In addition to keeping you regular, the extra bulk also fills you up.\n\n5. Low carb vegan WORKS! Since I started last August, I'm down over 100lbs, which is pretty nice.\n\n6. Check out /r/fitness and /r/loseit for useful info.\n\nHoller if you have questions.",

If it were unethical to eat chocolate, even if other human beings had to suffer in order for me to get chocolate, I would eat it. I suppose that makes me a bad person, but I must ask, am I the only person on reddit who doesn't like to put an effort into life? I like to smoke, eat, and drink whatever is pleasurable. I don't like to resist temptation. I don't like to control urges. I don't like to deny myself pleasure. I just can't be a vegan. I recognize the problems with this position, but as someone quoted earlier, \"I just love meat so much that I could never give it up\".

"comment": "We criticize because their diet revolves around consuming animals. \n\nAs far as i know, vegans only need to supplement vitamin B12 (easily done through lots of fortified foods if you don't want to take pills).\n\nSince becoming a vegan, I've had a wider variety of meals. As a child, meat with three vegetables was most dinners (a very popular meal in Australia). The only thing that varied was a sauce, or serving it in tortillas etc. When i started cooking for myself, I moved away from that, but found 95% of meals were based around meat, and vegetables were just a filler. Now I bet this isn't the case for everyone, but for me the choice now seems so simple.\n\nA Vegan diet is about doing what you can, and it may seem like we give up alot, but those few moments of pleasure from eating animals are replaced with a few moments of pleasure without animals , and alot of pleasure knowing you're not eating animals.",

Veganism is purely about avoiding causing harm to *other* individuals since they have their own mind and feelings. Many activists put their life on the line to protect non-human lives; should a vegan be against that too?",

"comment": "As an employee at Chipotle and a vegan, I must say that I try with all of my might to keep the cheese out of the guac, but it just happens. People get bowls piled with cheese and sometimes you cant really do much as it rolls right out of the bowl into the guac or even just rolls out of the pan while its on the line. It's the same reason why we moved the pinto beans away from the carnitas when we made the beans veg, because cross contamination just happens whether we like it or not, especially if the store is busy and we are moving at a very rapid pace. I'd say do what I do when i get my employee meal, and just let them know you're a vegan and you're worried about cheese in the guac, and they will most likely open up a new container of guac (we keep fresh pans right underneath the salsa line so it will only take a second). We really do try and be as accommodating with vegetarians and vegans as possible, but please try and understand that shit happens and please please don't be snappy with people working the line about it. We have to deal with some downright mean people, so when people ask nicely for things we are more than happy to go the extra mile to ensure they have a great dining experience.",

I think people can only accept that when they've let go of their fear/resistance, which can only happen on their own terms. I find books are a great way to spread this info, because they can get the info without pressure to respond/change (you can't give them this info, though-- then they'll feel pressure to respond to you). I think just making this info available from neutral, impersonal (as in no pressure bc of no immediate connection) is the best way to try to change others' minds. also supporting vegan institutions is a great way to create change (kickstarter has had a few great projects recently-- see 'drone on a farm').",

"comment": "Thank you! I'm so glad you have a supportive family - I'm sure you deserve it and, heck, veganism alone deserves the respect. I'm the same with my friends - they all went vegan with me - so I'm lucky in that sense. It's more the organisations and companies I face during my activism. I work at a university and so many people are supportive but refute veganism and they're sending such mixed messages. They like that I'm helping the planet, but don't want to help themselves - what? It's that that I will never understand. I'm not even allowed to say the word vegan at my university because apparently loving dogs is fine but loving pigs is a *political stance*. It's fucked up. Thanks for your comment and good luck with the journey!",

I understand the veg fest thing, but those could be plant-based, health diet people. so maybe not vegan.\n\n&gt;Women are much, much more likely than men to go vegetarian. There are two to three times as many female vegetarians as there are male vegetarians. In a representative sampling of studies, women made up the following percentages of vegetarians: 45, 50, 63, 63, 67, 67, 67, 67, 74, 75, 75, 78, 78, and 80\n\n&gt;One final note on gender: the gap narrows **when it comes to veganism. The number of male and female vegans seems to be fairly equal, both in the United States and in the European Union** (Phillips et al. 2011; How Many Adults Are Vegan).\n\nFrom: Cooney, Nick (2013-08-29).

"comment": "Re: the last paragraph, I'm talking about people who DO eat meat. I think its incredibly privileged bullshit to take only the breasts off of chickens and then pretend like the rest the carcass is inedible or unhealthy, is my point. Back when I did eat meat, I thought it was messed up that people would happily eat a chicken nugget but couldn't cook a whole turkey or wouldn't eat broth made from the bones, for instance. I thought it was privileged and hypocritical to be so divorced from food and to act like the \"gross\" bits somehow were deficient. I felt this way as an omnivore but it stays even as a vegan, I feel like if you eat meat you have a moral obligation to know where it comes from and that it produces a lot more than the sterile trays of white meat or steaks or whatever that people see at markets.\n\nYour other points do make sense... for me they were harmful and not helpful. If it was helpful for other people though that's a good thing. I revise my statement to addressing each person according to personality instead of blanket bans on tactics, haha :)",

It saddens me to see that a lot of fellow vegans here seem to count on people like McDougall or Esselstyn for nutritional advice, without them having a thorough education in nutritional sciences and with them clearly trying to prove 'their' point. Greger and Barnard also seem to be favorable of alternative medicine (e.g. touting certain plant foods as reliable ways to prevent certain diseases), undermining their scientific credibility.

"comment": "“They were migrants. And the hostility changed them, welded them, united them—hostility that made the little towns group and arm as though to repel an invader, squads with pick handles, clerks and storekeepers with shotguns, guarding the world against their own people.\n\nIn the West there was panic when the migrants multiplied on the highways. Men of property were terrified for their property. Men who had never been hungry saw the eyes of the hungry. Men who had never wanted anything very much saw the flare of want in the eyes of the migrants. And the men of the towns and of the soft suburban country gathered to defend themselves; and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad, as a man must do before he fights. They said, These goddamned Okies are dirty and ignorant. \nThey’re degenerate, sexual maniacs. Those goddamned Okies are thieves. They’ll steal anything. They’ve got no sense of property rights.\n\nAnd the latter was true, for how can a man without property know the ache of ownership? And the defending people said, They bring disease, they’re filthy. We can’t have them in the schools. They’re strangers. How’d you like to have your sister go out with one of ’em?\n\nThe local people whipped themselves into a mold of cruelty. Then they formed units, squads, and armed them—armed them with clubs, with gas, with guns. We own the country. We can’t let these Okies get out of hand. And the men who were armed did not own the land, but they thought they did. And the clerks who drilled at night owned nothing, and the little storekeepers possessed only a drawerful of debts. But even a debt is something, even a job is something. The clerk thought, I get fifteen dollars a week. S’pose a goddamn Okie would work for twelve? And the little storekeeper thought, How could I compete with a debtless man?\n\nAnd the migrants streamed in on the highways and their hunger was in their eyes, and their need was in their eyes. They had no argument, no system, nothing but their numbers and their needs. When there was work for a man, ten men fought for it— fought with a low wage. If that fella’ll work for thirty cents, I’ll work for twenty-five. If he’ll take twenty-five, I’ll do it for twenty. No, me, I’m hungry. I’ll work for fifteen. I’ll work for food. The kids. You ought to see them. Little boils, like, comin’ out, an’ they can’t run aroun’. Give ’em some windfall fruit, an’ they bloated up. Me, I’ll work for a little piece of meat.\n\nAnd this was good, for wages went down and prices stayed up. The great owners were glad and they sent out more handbills to bring more people in. And wages went down and prices stayed up. And pretty soon now we’ll have serfs again.”\n\nLol I dunno, as a vegan I kinda like the regular fistings.",

I know that sounded pretentious, I've made peace with it. But I acknowledge not everyone feels that way and that's fine.

However personally I wouldn't mind taking such life saving medicine. The suffering caused is far less than the suffering prevented. This is a general consensus in this sub when it comes to vaccines and pills with lactose coating, etc.\n\nI don't think it is vegan to steal organs from murdered animals to replace your own because then the suffering caused is far worse. Also people in need of organ transplants very likely got there because of bad lifestyle choices which makes it an even bigger no-no.",

Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world.\n\nLikely his daughter and/or his daughter's other parent will have objections to the daughter eating fully plant-based during his time with her and what then? Will he buy and cook non-vegan food for her and will you be ok with that?\n\nOf course, open communication can solve a lot of things.

"comment": "I imagine there is a range of reactions to animal products. I assume people who can’t or don’t disassociate the food from the animal are more likely to be vegetarian or vegan.\n\nMy family labelled me as a picky eater as a child.  I was always uncomfortable with meat or eggs. As I grew up I could express myself better and explain what was going on in my head. I have no idea why I feel that way and my siblings don’t. In a way I would never have that gross food prep since the moment I had control over my food it would be what I’m comfortable with.\n\nI’ve seen a few very young children (3 or 4) reject meat which made me wonder if there is an element of teaching young children to be comfortable with animal products.",

"comment": "My husband and I come from a theology where punishing or disciplining one's women is not only acceptable but encouraged, and I have to wonder what his wife's thoughts on her husband being sentenced to life in prison would be. I don't know if she lived with him out of fear or community obligation, but I feel their culture's women's perspective should be used in his defense. Certainly nobody wants to be killed especially by their own love partner, but from my personal perspective, if an accident such as this ever happened, I would not want my husband to rot in jail or be given the death penalty. Only if they can prove she was not a willing participant in the controlling relationship should he be charged.\n\n I understand this is a controversial view and certainly most vegan men I have met are appalled at our views. After a lifetime of obeying a man, one learns what happens when you disobey. But beating someone in the face with a cane is barbaric, the poor woman probably wanted to surprise him or forgot.",
