"comment": "Thanks! Notice the staggered rafter usage in the first video, an install done in Bossier Parish where they require a civil engineer's report on each roof mount-- In this case they were justified in their stringent requirement because even with the recommended staggered rafters the whole roof sagged after the install- we had to go back to lift and brace the entire roof (in August!). Ugh. This same parish (county) requires a 3' walkway in their fire code from the road facing roof and any roof with a chimney if I remember correctly.\n\nSide note, something very good (well, for the installers, maybe not the boss' wallet) came out of them starting to make us do engineering reports, I finally convinced my boss that mounts every 48\" (two rafters) was overkill and that 72\" (3 rafters) was the hot spot- the data points to 96\" (4 rafters) as typically acceptable but that sort've makes me cringe a little when I see it IRL.\n\nThe roof with the 45º pitch was in Caddo Parish where just about anything goes. Code requirements are spotty in Louisiana but are generally relaxed, which is surprising given our bustling industry due to the 80% residential tax credit. Though, were always ahead of our local code, NEC, good practice and then some. I did like that my boss (the owner) was happy to oblige with all my code-Nazi tendencies.\n\nWhen we used to run DC off the roof (central string inverter) it was all-metal conduit as required by code. \n\nRuns go inside the attic unless absolutely unavoidable.\n\nNow that we only install microinverters you can run whatever the heck you want up there. More specifically we generally splice the Engage cable with [one of these heat shrink splices](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Tyco-Electronics-Heat-Shrink-UF-Splice-Kit-1-Clam-CPGI-HS-SPLICE-KIT-UF/202204319) up on the roof into [10AWG/4 TC-ER tray cable](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JZSKdGFuL.jpg) (same cable as Engage but bigger, somewhat expensive but its the best. Buy it by the 500' spool from Elliot and you're actually spending less than you would 4 separate THHN 10AWG's from anywhere, which is how I sold my boss on the idea). We generally bring the strings (and bare copper) into the attic through a standard 4x4 Cantex box glued to a flashing with the Dap 3.0 roof caulk we use and [put it under an easy accessible (if possible) solar panel.](http://i.imgur.com/X31XneK.png)\n\nWe used to throw the tray cable into flexible or hard plastic conduit out of the habit we held from DC runs but reverted to staples every other rafter because it was vastly overkill. \n\nWe also label our cable runs with warning stickers in the attic every ~36\". \n\nTypically up in the attic we'll bring all of our strings into one sub-panel and run down to the AC disconnect with whatever size Romex fits the application and &lt;2% voltage drop (but minimum 8AWG). \n\nAt the fused AC disconnect we slap a lightning arrestor on it and from there into a line side tap at the load center with [buchanan B-taps](http://www.wirenuts.com/media/img/whatsnew/press_releases/b-tap_print.jpg).\n\n\n\nWe're small but [proud](http://i.imgur.com/3mc4Kby.png) of our honest [work](https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/installer_systems/895/One+Planet+Solar+%26+Wind%2C+Inc.). Let me know what criticism you have of our methods and I'll forward it to the boss who is all ears :) . I'm a full-time electrical engineering student now and live on the other side of Louisiana (New Orleans) but I still stay in touch with them.",

"comment": "Lol, my reply got so long reddit rejected it, so apologies in advance for having to break it into 2 parts:\n\nPart 1:\n\n&gt;The biggest impediment to more and better nuclear power is federal regulation\n\nMaybe. But nuclear power *is* inherently risky, and if the effect of that regulation is to  ensure that energy companies and not taxpayers bear the cost of that risk isn't that a good thing?\n\nI'm not against nuclear though, I just have a tough time imagining that it can outcompete solar if we're not socializing the cost of its risk. Solar is just so much simpler by comparison - throw a bunch of mirrors out in the desert and we're set. Sure it takes a lot of land ([maybe](http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/ViewpointsDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Viewpoints&amp;zid=8f5a46fd31a6d7ac197520aa5161f5d1&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010573243&amp;userGroupName=viva_jmu&amp;jsid=3e6c9b734c56146ac4850b5ed42fff78)), but we've got plenty of that, precisely where solar works best.\n\n&gt;Like electrified roads or SkyTran (or similar PRT systems)?\n\nElectrified roads would be great, but tremendously expensive, and we'll need EVs that can use them before they make sense. SkyTran or similar sounds great too, but convincing Americans to abandon their cars and use public transportation of any kind will always be a big challenge.\n\n&gt;use natural gas for cars?\n\nAs I said before I think CNG cars are great - they give access to a cheap, domestic energy source for transportation just as EVs do. I don't know why the Civic CNG remains the only production car out there available to go that route. And it's not that cheap either, with an MSRP just a tad lower than the Leaf (pre tax credit.)\n\nOf course CNG has its drawbacks though. It doesn't do anything about efficiency, and of course you're still using a fossil fuel, and are still beholden to an energy company for your supply. It's cheap and plentiful now, but eventually it'll have its supply problems too, so it can't be a long term solution like EVs can.\n\n&gt;Making access to that energy more expensive is highly regressive.\n\nWhoever said anything about doing that? EVs do the exact opposite - electricity is *much cheaper* than gasoline, and EVs allow for access to this cheaper form of transportation energy.\n\nIf I'm to assume you're talking about larger policy issues and not EVs here, well I'd say there's not really anything we can do to change the cost of energy, merely *who pays it.* I think we've established and agreed upon the idea that the true cost of gasoline is more than what the average consumer sees at the pump, he just doesn't realize that he's paying for it in other ways, including taxation and incurring debt (and other forms of borrowing against the future.) Or we're just dumping some of those costs off onto other peoples/nations, which ultimately leads (well, has already lead) to threats to our security (ergo more costs.)\n\n&gt;then offer no suggestion as to how much.\n\nDid you not look at those two links I posted way up near the top of this thread? They do precisely that. And if you simply google \"true cost of gas\" you'll find a couple pages of interesting results to peruse. With all that material out there I found it unnecessary to hazard my own guess.\n\n&gt;Is the same true for tax credits provided by states?\n\nI can't speak for all 50 states, but of course that information is readily available if you care to look for it. In my state, California, there is no tax credit. Instead there's a straight $2500 rebate. And the phasing out of that rebate has already begun - it was $5000 when I bought my first EV back in 2011.\n\n&gt;OK. We'll see if this happens.\n\nI hope it doesn't, at least not in the fashion that it's written. Of course a phasing out is needed, but the whole idea of phasing out *per manufacturer* is ridiculous. Some manufacturers, like Tesla, make nothing but EVs, and others, like Nissan, are heavily invested in EVs, while the rest have about 0 interest in EVs right now. Phasing out per manufacturer effectively puts those companies who assumed the risk to invest in EVs early on at a huge competitive disadvantage should another company decide to jump in later.\n\n&gt;EVs are simply not affordable for the majority of consumers. Natural gas vehicles, on the other hand, are similarly priced\n\nI pointed out above that the only CNG car out there isn't that cheap. EVs are currently cheaper to the average consumer, but of course that's distorted by the federal tax credit and other available incentives.",

"comment": "&gt; If you are going on vacation, for a weekend away, to visit family or friends, etc, there’s a very good chance you are going with your family and can take the longer-range vehicle if you are planning to drive a hundred miles or more and don’t have good charging options.\n\nThese kind of assumptions are going to put you at odds with Elon Musk's logic. He wants to create consumer EVs that can replace all functions of ICEs, and not some weak implementation that needs an ICE as backup for long trips or heavy loads.\n\nThat's the problem with designing an EV that has only 100 miles of range - it may be all that a lot of people need for their average use, but then it becomes something that can't be used for long trips.\n\nAnd then on average use, you're cycling the batteries more (or cycling them deeper) which is going to shorten the life of your batteries.\n\n&gt; I think there’s little debate that Tesla took the best approach to EVs, but Renault-Nissan certainly seems to have a legitimate interest in leading the way in this market, and by some standards it is doing so.\n\nYeah, and that's great, but it seems like they aren't really trying to engineer a great vehicle. The LEAF has a poor choice of battery chemistry, and no thermal control system - I mean, you must know about the class-action lawsuit related to this. I would hardly call putting out a half-assed EV with major design flaws to be \"leading the way\", more like threatening the viability of the industry by not doing your homework and rushing out a vehicle (or knowingly skimping on critical components) - either way, not good.",

It's incredibly zippy despite the 0-60 times. I've had a hard time sticking to the speed limits and it outruns 99% of cars at the light. I end up regenerating quite a few miles of power on my way to work. I love the tech in it. In car apps and navigation are great.  AC works very well. Remote start is handy on hot/cold days. I have it start up on schedule automatically on work days. Unfortunately the trunk space is mostly used by the battery and the speakers aren't the premium ones. I'll probably upgrade the speakers, and I don't use the trunk space since I have an ICE car for that.",

"comment": "Lead just has too many maintenance/efficiency issues. Actually living off grid means I am very aware of the demands. Being able to use high draw appliances. Getting every watt out of a cloudy day. I wouldn't care if lithium was more expensive. Its giving better performance. That it is cheaper just makes it better.\n\nRemember. When comparing to lead to lithium you need to divide by 3. Or even 4. On ah.\n\nI recently complete a lithium off grid install on an older system. We gave the home owner 12 sq ft of floor space back and took a vent (hole) out of the home. If you think about a build cost of 125/sq ft (low I know) that's, call it $1500. The homeowners were delighted to see all that storage space freed up. \n\nI look forward to more LG/Tesla/Nissan options for sure. Right now its a lot of diy. I look forward to the installer market starting to ask distributors for lithium as well. Insisting on lithium. \n\nFLA might have the lowest install cost if you ignore space/overhead costs. What's the cost of the system install (inverter, panels, racking, labour etc). Now your lithium battery makes that entire system 20% more efficient. Reduces costs on the system by 20%. Now which initial install is cheaper?\n\nDo one lithium install. Monitor the results. You'll join the bright side.",

We live on a planet with a considerable atmosphere, you pay with energy the faster you want to go. The loss of ~~efficiency~~ range is not due to the motor, it's due to the nature of reality, takes more energy to do more work and if there is blame to be had, it's the battery pack still being low capacity for most EVs whereas a tank of fuel holds enough energy for people to care less about the lower range.",

Go on, explain.\n\nSo in your opinion Tesla put 80 kWh in the floor and then used the trunk and central console for another 120 kWh? Wrong, they didn't it's all in the floor and the car still fits two adults in the seats and the trunk has space to fit the top and room to spare.

"comment": "&gt;And then you have reports that Tesla can't ramp up production any further because their factory with Panasonic isn't making enough batteries.\n\nUmm, first off they are currently making more kWh of battery packs than anyone else in the world right now (including anyone in China). That seems to be a pretty freaking awesome \"problem\" situation. ;) Of course right now it'd effectively impossible to be manufacturing enough \\[quality\\] battery packs, so nobody is going to have \"enough\". It's only a matter of how much the ones you do get are going to cost you, and Tesla seems to have that lined up with in that they have shared ownership, or at least running a company store for Panasonic, for the Model 3 so are something close to self-supplying thus partially insulating themselves from demand portion of it.\n\nAlso are you talking about Panasonic saying they have brought the extra 3 lines on to be less of a bottleneck? ((I actually read their statement about it was them holding back Model 3 production as being as much, or more, a Japanese culture artifact. It was actually the first I'd seen anyone suggest it was Panasonic's problem, although we did assume it cell production as to why Powerwall is bottlenecked.))\n\n&gt;That said the new CEO of VW has mentioned not wanting to be dependent on Asian suppliers long-term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It seems they're waiting if maybe solid state becomes a reality within a **next few years.** They invested in a start-up there and would likely try and produce those themselves.\n\nVW is saying they expect 7 years minimum to actual production. [https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/02/volkswagen-deepens-ties-to-quantumscape-with-new-100-million-investment/](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/02/volkswagen-deepens-ties-to-quantumscape-with-new-100-million-investment/)\n\nIt is possible they will want until then, as they don't appear to have much depth in the area (as their R&amp;D was focused on different drivetrain tech ;) ), so it could take them some time to get up to speed on it. However if VW's other statements about their EV plans are to be taken seriously they are going to need a LOT of batteries long before then.\n\nThey've signed a deal for some battery production to come online in 3 years in Europe but the numbers don't add up to that being enough for their stated plans (unless they're including an even higher % of very small pack hybrids in there than I suspect), so they've got a lot more to line up yet.",

It also shows the amount of power used in kWh since last full charge and range traveled. A number of functions like interior lights, screens, etc. are still handled by a 12V battery and don't come from the high voltage traction battery. \n\nSo, if you went **for example** 100 miles, consumed 25 kWh, and say cost 4 miles of range from climate settings, you could extrapolate from there that your climate settings cost you 1 kWh (my math might be slightly off, but you get the idea - it shows you miles traveled since last full charge, total energy consumed, and also shows your miles lost by metric). I don't know of any other manufacturers that break it down like this. Tesla might through their API.",

They didn't sell more than typical sedans (because they are much more expensive), so they created the segment of luxury sedans, which of course they dominate because most cars in that segment are more expensive than the Model 3.\n\nThe article is even worse, talking about the value loss of luxury cars - and then taking a Mercedes B class as an example. WTF? The B class is made from a luxury car manufacturer, but it's in no way a luxury car. Worse, it's not even a sport car or a sedan, it's a fucking van.\n\nAnd no, the value loss in the first years has increased long before Tesla entered the European market. So another failure there.",

"comment": "The Mercedes is an articulated bus. The Proterra, if I recall correctly, is not. In operation, an articulated bus is way less efficient than a non articulated bus but more efficient than two buses.\n\nThe Tesla Semi has a very optimized front profile which means its Cd will be far lower than the bus. There is an aerodynamic fairing to spill the air over the gap between the semi and its trailer. Yes there are way more parasitic losses and rolling resistance losses on the trailer than on the semi but I am not sure profile drag is that much worse and front end Cd is normally the dominant aero drag contributor. Finally, the sharp transition on the trailer is not always an aerodynamic deficit (see Kammback).  \n\nThe bus will be in heavy regen mode, which is more efficient in urban environments but in longer transition between areas is less efficient. Due to the stop start nature of the bus route the bus has to use all of its motor capacity to accelerate; this may or may not overcome the regen effect. The Semi will be coasting for large portions of its mission profiles, and may be able to disengage some motors while cruising.  \n\nFinally, the MTBF and duty cycles are different. Tesla may be able to use a lighter or more efficient drivetrain tech because it has an easier duty cycle.\n\nThere are just too many variable to speculate or say its weird.",

Though they might be influenced by the new regulations as car manufacturers have pushed the sales of ICE cars in December to avoid the new rules and postponed the sales of EVs to January to better comply with the new rules. In this way fewer ICE cars were sold in January lowering their market share and more EVs were sold in January covering also demand from December and pushing up EV market share.\n\nThus I expect the EV market share to be lower in the Feb than Jan, but higher than Feb 2019.\n\nI don't think e-208 is available yet, but I'm not sure. In the next few days we'll see the rankings by model.",

"comment": "Couldn’t agree more. I drove my friend’s XC40 Recharge this weekend and was really shocked at how much smoother and quieter it was without the gasoline engine. When you floor it you get acceleration normally only experienced in performance oriented versions of ICE vehicles. The handling was a lot better than I expected given the curb weight presumably because the weight is low and centered between the wheels. I will say the base RWD ID.4 I drove didn’t really impress me performance-wise when you floor it. It’s fine coming from a ICE vehicle but lacks the wow factor. I’m hoping the AWD version fixes that which the 0-60 time suggests should be the case. Tesla had a virtual monopoly in the M3/MY segment so you can understand the enthusiasm for those vehicles when there wasn’t really any competition.",

It makes 5% difference *at most* and probably more like 2 or 3% in reality. So unless you really need those 7 extra miles, skip the aeros. Just get the smallest wheels possible, they’re better for range and much better for ride quality.",

"comment": "This trip isn't a leisure trip, I highly value getting there and back as quickly as possible. I routinely drive both legs (700 mi+) in a day. Finally, the charging stations are near nothing interesting and the drive is mostly flat farmland outside of the few cities. There is nothing very scenic or enjoyable about it after the 500th time I have driven it. \n\nThat said, I am planning to test the trip in the EV next time when I make the drive by myself and don't have to drive both legs in a day. The highway is relatively heavily travelled until the last 100mi so having only a few EA charging stations to choose from on the way is less than ideal and doesn't give me warm fuzzies.",

"comment": "&gt; So how are CCS cars using Tesla chargers in Europe? Serious question\n\nTheir chargers us the CAN bus because it is already in every car on the planet, robust and very feature rich communication system.  It's basically USB for cars and CSS uses very simple low level communication protocol specific to CSS that is flaky and error prone.\n\nTesla supports the CSS communication in their cars in Europe for a while now and in the US as of some time in 2021 but they don't use it for Tesla chargers anywhere, just CSS chargers which Tesla cars tend to avoid for that very reason among others.  Chargers are better in Europe but it's not great anywhere and the US is pretty bad given that the major player seems to have no interest in running a well performing network.\n\n&gt; Otherwise they're just claiming to let other people use a design that they control, which isn't an open standard.\n\nHonest question, what part of the connector isn't allowed open and full usage rights in perpetuity?  I haven't read the release Tesla did but I've not heard anyone say there is a gotcha in it.  I agree they should submit to international standards bodies.  I think the patent sharing was the blocker there. There is no reason for them not to do it at this point.  We'll see if they do I guess.",

I've seen multiple sources suggesting that the truck's curb weight is over 2000 kg, or about 4400 lbs.\n\nOf course, the truck comes with 3 battery options, a 60 kWh LFP (which will be significantly heavier than the Chevy Bolt's Nickel based battery), an 86 kWh NMC battery which will likely be over 1100 lbs alone, and a 100 kWh NMC battery, which is likely over 1400 lbs alone.\n\nThrow on a full size 2 row cab, along with the truck bed, and you're certainly asking for some significant weight.\n\nThe dimensions of the Radar are:  207.1\" L x 74.8\" W x 72\" H\n\nThe dimensions of the Bolt sedan are:    163\"L x 70\"W  x 63\"H\n\nthe dimensions of the Bolt EUV are: 170\"L x 70\"W x 64\"H.\n\nThe Bolt sedan weighs 3600 lbs, and the EUV weighs 3700lbs.  The Radar is significantly larger in every dimension, and has a larger battery.  There's no way in hell it's as light as a Bolt.",

"comment": "Never heard Cybertruck mentioned as a concept vehicle. It did get a lot of flak because Tesla/Elon state things that don't pan out. As far as bullshitting goes, idk, I think their reasoning for the interior design of the 3/Y is BS, but people love it \\*shrugs\\*.\n\nIt's crazy how you're suggesting that Tesla's cost cutting measures are actually some type of \"elegant\" solution to vehicle controls lol. It's a screen, nothing elegant about it.   \niPhone is mostly successful because of the peripherals; App Store, iMessage, Face Time. Without those the iPhone would be a long past memory. The design is just icing on the cake. Maybe Tesla's future success is not in the cars, but in energy and FSD, the cars are just a way to sell them.",

Then there's all the rare earth materials needed for the high efficiency electric motors. Oh, and don't forget all the rare elements and nasty chemical processing to manufacture the batteries. About the time we solve these hurdles we'll need to start in on recycling/reuse, and rendering safe all these chemicals as batteries start going end of life in large numbers. \n\nBut sure, don't let engineering and practicality get in the way of feel-good reality-free policy making.

Do they think it's an eye-sore?  I try to be a good citizen and not leave it plugged in and hang up the charger--though I've left it on the lawn a couple of times if I was taking a quick trip to pick something up and planning to plug it in later.\n\nI don't doubt the surveys that various governments have done saying people don't plug in. I've seen so many \"will anything happen if I don't plug it in\" questions on Prime and PHEV groups.",

Because if they were, and have been for centuries, pray tell: why do still so many people there don't have access to it? It turns out that decentralized renewable energy is one way out of this energy poverty for third world countries, which is why places like India where a large part of the population haven't got access to the energy grid are now increasingly investing in solar power.",

None of them appear to be interested in selling to residential consumers yet, however (if you judge by the fact that none of my emails or voice mails to them have resulted in an offer to sell me an actual product)-- so that sucks.  But this should be coming soon for at least some of them.  I'm really, really hoping this space is about to heat up bigtime in the next couple years.\n\nAnyway, here they are:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.aquionenergy.com/energy-storage-technology\n\nhttp://www.eosenergystorage.com/technology-and-products/\n\nhttp://www.ambri.com/technology/\n\nhttp://www.ultrabattery.com/technology/\n\nhttp://www.axionpower.com/Technology\n\nhttp://www.lightsail.com/\n\nhttp://www.drexel.edu/now/archive/2014/November/MXene-clay/\n\nhttp://sakti3.com\n\nhttp://www.uetechnologies.com/science_vanadium_battery.htm\n\n------------\n\nThat's nine, and I guess the tenth would be whatever magic the Elon Musk Tesla madhouse comes up with for their home battery-- considering the gigafactory, the ambition, and the levels of genius involved, I think they have as good a shot as anyone of coming up with a significantly better overall price per kilowatt hour.  They'd almost have to in order to make a &lt;$40k electric vehicle worthy of the brand name.  \n\nI plan to wait a while and judge by the numbers as they become clearer, and I advise that anyone who doesn't have piles of money to burn do the same.  I've already made the mistake of thinking this would all come along faster than it did once.  *One* of these has gotta pan out, though, and it shouldn't be much longer.",

"comment": "Amen - Completely agree.  There was a lot of cell phones before Apple.  Apple just pushed them in the later adopters by adding a lot of great form and function.  less than a decade later smart phones are coming out from great producers almost every week.  Hopefully these RE (Renewable Energy) systems will be the same.  I don't think the Tesla system is a better function than what we can get for cheaper but the form and easy access to financing through solar city will help the adoption.  Imagine, when you install a solar power system the battery may just be an option that you select that may only add $15 a month.  That gets these storage systems in the door.  Then if the power companies do what I think they are going to do and charge about $50 a month Grid Tie In cost, people might just add a bank of these batteries and tell the power company to take their wires off their house.",

They will give you solid pricing, but you should not trust me on that or anyone else on the internet. \n\nI work on larger system so I know that it is possible to produce solar as low as 0.09$-0.10$/kwh on a 500kW array.  \n\nPersonally, they are probably sandbagging their numbers because you have shade. Have they given you a production guarantee? Also, The solar irradiance data they use can vary as much as 20% yoy. (that means 11.9ckWh +/-10% for any given year).\n\nIt is a 20yr investment, so don't rush, prices are steadily coming down.  In NJ, Get Trinity Solar, Vivint and Sungevity to give it a go. solar installer in NJ are dime/dozen, so you don't even need to go with one of the big guys. \n\nThey can do quotes using satellite photo without even going to your house.",

"comment": "Panels are somewhat expensive, and that's certainly part of it. Another part is that people are uninformed or misinformed - think they won't work, cost too much, etc. \n\nAs another user posted, payback times vary widely. For me, I'm looking at about 8 years at current rates. If the cost of electricity increases, that time goes down. Federal, state, and/or local incentives play a part too. I'm lucky in that NYS has a 25% tax credit, my power company have me a ~12% grant, and the feds have 30% tax credit. NYS is also net metering friendly, which is huge when it comes to making grid tied solar feasible.",

"comment": "These things are garbage! We had them installed on top of our building and they barely produce any power. The turbines don't even have a generator, it's just some magnets spinning around in a circle. The panel on top is the only thing that produces any power and it's no where close to the numbers they claim. We took them down entirely now because, in strong wind situations, they completely break themselves apart. The brakes went out on two of the VAWTs so we had to take them off(we had 4 mills altogether) and then one of the solar panels completely ripped off the frame and flew away and landed across the street. Do NOT invest in these, they suck at producing power and are terribly constructed, causing safety concerns.",

The fact of the matter is if 20 Trina modules have the same Wp rating as 13 sunpower, and the Trina have a cheaper cost per watt, which they do by the way... Then the slightly lower labor cost won't overcome that price premium for this 22 percent efficiency, both arrays will produce the same energy. It's cheaper energy, that's what matters.

Neither one is Plug and Play though, the inverter needs about $3k in upgrade parts and labor.   \nThe SE7600 can be upgraded to the StorEdge or the StorEdge can be configured to work without the battery.   But there is a difference in cost and parts from the SE7600 and the StorEdge, plus there are additional parts if you want to have backup capability (auto transformer and emergency panel).",

Most solar inverters only accept lead acid configurations of up to 70-80 volts, no where near an Ev's 300+. Currently there are only few available: Ideal inverters, Solaredge/powerwall 1.0 or powerwall 2.0. I'd love to know if I'm missing any.\n\n 2. Use ev on board inverters with a custom bypass plus install a aftermarket bidirectional charger. This option seems liable to run into difficulty, not to mention voiding your warranty.\n\nBoth of these options are not quite there yet, but are very close. Best option in my opinion would be to somehow hack the high voltage DC charging input to function as an output into an Ideal inverter. Problem is they are something like 15k.",

If you're on grid in a 600sqft house in az, the utility (srp and aps and others) will likely charge you way more than it's worth to let you install a small grid-tied solar array.\n\nEdit: clarification that utilities allow you to install a grid-tied system",

It's about being able to go solar without having to look at those ugly solar panels on your roof. This is clearly not a mainstream product, at least not not now.  But cost should come down over time.\n\nAlso, the financials will work out much better for new construction vs. replacement of an existing roof.  So I suspect their target market right now is luxury new home builders, and ultra-rich that don't care about the cost.",

Keep in mind the tracker has moving parts and need some maintenance. Over the 20 years, you will gain with degradation of the panels extra 50,000 kWh with the tracker. If you will spend $10,000 to generate the 50,000 kWh extra for the next 20 years the cost per kWh will be at $0.2, not including the maintenance cost. For an extra $10K you will get a larger solar array that will produce more energy over the years compared with the trackers.",

"comment": "We have several projects to install the Tesla PowerWall 2 coming up.   After we are finished with the first installations I will be able to speak on more aspects of this product, but I think that this new product line shows real promise.\n\nJust comparing the first version of the Powerwall to the new Powerwall 2, I have to say that the Powerwall 2 has made improvements to many of the areas where the original Powerwall was found lacking.  This new line provides a DC coupled version, and an AC coupled version with three interconnection layout options making the PowerWall 2 far more flexible to design than the original.  It should prove to be easier to install as well.\n\nWe have also been installing Sonnen.  Sonnen combines Outback Radian Inverter technology with Sony Lithium-ion Phosphate batteries, in a very streamlined, flexible, AC Coupled package that is a very attractive option with nearly a decade in the field throughout Europe.  Based on customer reaction, I'd say that Sonnen is a better product than the first version of the Powerwall in terms of customer satisfaction, flexibility, and user friendliness.  It is certainly an easier to product to install than the original Powerwall.  \n\nThere is also the Skyboss from Alpha, the parent company of Outback, to look forward to.  This is the best offering I've yet seen that links what the market desires from this technology with what the technology is capable of achieving.  It is supposed to come out sometime this year, and is said to be on the higher end of the pricing spectrum, but seems to be an amazing solution.",

"comment": "Good points, EV's are absolutely not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Electric cars still produce a negative impact on the environment through production, materials and transportation. Most of us still charge off of the power grid-- a grid powered by gas and coal as stated--  causing more pollution. We also still need parts, tires and brakes-- all of which cause more pollution. *However--* I live in one of the worst states for inversion and the simple truth is that even with the power being generated by at least 40&amp;#37; non renewables-- EV's will cut down on our choking pollution. Over achingly Gas and coal plants are going to be more efficient than a gas engine because they are bigger making things like carbon scrubbers and other pollution reducing tactics possible. Lastly renewable energies are becoming inevitable-- the amount of PV panels in my county have exponentially grown-- I got grants to install batteries and PV panels on my High school and other businesses and schools are installing them too-- the grid is becoming cleaner every day, making EV's cleaner as well.\n\nI have to add a personal note: I am also a broke High school student who cannot afford to be on a fluctuating market such as gas. And with the IB program and college preparation-- I have to have a reliable source of transportation-- and in my experience, gas cars break down too often, and cost too much money and time to maintain. With an EV, you plug it in at night and awake to a fully fueled car-- its a no frills, bullshit free source of transportation.",

"comment": "I have very superficial understanding of this but this is how it works. A community solar is made by local government. There are tax deductions for investing in these. However the government can not claim deductions as government does not pay them. So a private investor or group of investors spend say $100M on the solar project. The city then leases these from the private group. Private group makes money from income from the lease and they also get to claim tax deductions so they keep most of the profits. Once deductions are done, the lease is over as well (say 7 years). Now the private owner group sells the solar plant to the city. So the city gets its for cheaper then if they had just purchased it outright. Private investors get income from the lease plus the tax deductions for investing in the project. It’s a win win for both sides. From what I know this is usually done by large investors. I know just enough to know this is legit but I don’t know enough to explain exact mechanics.",

"comment": "Copied from another anxiety discussion about a week ago:\n\nAfter reading up on the scary reality of climate change I felt the same hopelessness as you describe. The haunting feeling that I would have to do everything right now to prepare for the worst in the future was more than enough to keep me awake at night. It is still the reason why I doubt to have any children as the future does appear grim.\n\nMy mental relief was to actively start working towards the climate solutions myself. I'm employed as an assistant professor in biotechnology and have been using my network (both academic and industrial) to start getting traction on idea's that could be both financially interesting and significantly help us reach our goals to keep the climate stable. I'm a firm believer that when sustainable technology becomes profitable the transition will go automatically. Looking at how competitive science can be, it comforts me to know that all over the world clever scientists are doing the same thing!\n\nAlso, try to keep a healthy focus on the news that shows positive signs. Just this week, 10 European countries backed the 0-emissions goal for 2050 ([http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/11/20/ten-eu-ministers-back-net-zero-emissions-2050/](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/11/20/ten-eu-ministers-back-net-zero-emissions-2050/)). In the UK, the \"Extinction rebellion\" managed to amass a huge number of climate protesters last weekend ([https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/extinction-rebellion-protest-civil-action-london-climate-change-a8638536.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/extinction-rebellion-protest-civil-action-london-climate-change-a8638536.html)). This week scientists published research demonstrating we can engineer \"biological solar panels\" by coupling yeast cells to nanoparticles, which has tremendous potential to directly transform CO2 and sunlight into fuels and chemicals ([https://www.osa-opn.org/home/newsroom/2018/november/nano\\_solar\\_panels%E2%80%9D\\_turn\\_yeast\\_cells\\_into\\_biofactor/](https://www.osa-opn.org/home/newsroom/2018/november/nano_solar_panels%E2%80%9D_turn_yeast_cells_into_biofactor/)). And that is just naming a few from this week.\n\nLast but definitely not least, keep in mind that the future challenges regarding climate seem impossible to solve from our current perspective. Advancements in science are accelerating almost exponentially as we keep building on acquired knowledge. Imagine telling people after the first flight by the wright brothers that we would have to land people on the moon within their lifetime. Or the people that built the first supercomputer that in 50 years, everyone needs a computer with over a million times the computing power in their pocket. Although I believe everyone should take whatever action they can right now, I do believe our advances in science will make our problems look much more manageable as time goes by.\n\n​\n\nWhen the situation does become dire you can always \"check out\". Until then, try to be part of the solution and keep enjoying the trip, use your sense of hopelessness to motivate yourself :-)!",

"comment": "In Germany all 4 major power utiltities only manage power. They have decentralized power generation with battery storage. Utilities manage the energy given to the grid by over 1000 cooperatives, taking care of supply and demand who needs power when and take a cut. This results in a highly redundant and strong grid that is extremely resilient to  outages. All new construction requires renewable energy. They started loosing profits when people started going solar, basically all centralized  systems will be decentralized and scale laterally with new users coming online. This is the model of the 21st century.",

"comment": "I completely agree. The EVs are only as green as the electricity generated to power them. We need to invest heavily in both green electricity and EVs, but both seem necessary. In many states you can also choose how to allocate the energy you consume. I use arcadia power and so theoretically I pay for green energy. Also, once we have a large fleet of EV's, they can be incorporated into a smarter grid in the same way that people use hot water heaters or large batteries to store electricity during periods of low demand, which will hopefully lead to cheaper electricity and less wasted electricity. Even better if we can provide subsidies for solar-powered charging stations or solar panels for buildings that could also supply energy to the grid.",

"comment": "Hi there! I became a vegetarian the day Trump was elected because I knew I needed to do something to help the environment (we've got solar panels and electric cars, too, but this felt more personal). Awesome job cutting out the beef, it is really terrible for global warming. Poultry and eggs aren't bad if you aren't ready to be vegetarian (or vegan), and some can even have a lower carbon footprint than fruits and vegetables. To figure out what's best can be pretty tricky when it comes to produce, but in general, try eating what's in season where you live. This will reduce food miles and helps significantly for reducing your food carbon footprint. \n\nWay to be taking action! The world needs more people like you :)\n\nP.S.- sorry if there are typos, I wrote this out on my phone",

"comment": "This is almost unbelievably good! Bravo! \n\n\"So BlocPower went to work. The company tore out the gas-burning boiler in the basement and installed a set of efficient electric-powered heat pumps instead. Heat pumps capture heat and move it from one space to another, in either direction: during winter they heat a home, and in summer they cool it. BlocPower put up the solar panels, elevated high enough that people still can gather for parties underneath them.\n\n\"The result is, they save tens of thousands of dollars a year on their energy costs,\" Baird says. Yet they're still paying enough that BlocPower can earn back its investment. The new equipment saves that much money.\"",

Cost : Lifespan of Tesla solar tile as Tile : similar with life of house. and as solar panel 25-40 years. If use a asphalt shingles is 20-30 years. If consider as solar panel it will twice life, if consider as tile, it is 5-10 times life.  even front cost high, it will be make even after 30-40 years. actually, new solar era will came after 20-30 years. so, really doubt about this advantage.\n\n2. Maintenance : it will makes higher cost to fix if there is any roof problem. and personal maintenance should be (almost) impossible. if living in dry/sandy zone, need a high cost cleaning service every year. and, Need to check Hot-zone every year to find a bad tile if there is a problem. \n\n3. String inverter : check about Micro Inverter/optimizer vs String inverter model. It will depend on the shading condition of your roof. \n\n\nSolar roof tile is a beautiful solution If really concern it.\nIt just looks good but not economical\n\ni have gave up, and installed a new shingles, and will replace whole panel to the newest one after 20 years (maybe with roof also)",

"comment": "My rationale was this: I bought a Nissan Leaf Plus to be our second car, handling the 5-150 daily miles required of that car (avg about 15-20). The car gets 240 miles on a full charge around town, and probably 180-200 on the highway depending on the usual factors. \n\nI want to keep it 10 years. In the worst case scenario of 3% degradation a year, that puts it at around 175 miles of range in year 10, which is still incredibly useful to me. It will always be the second car, because we’ll upgrade the other to a PHEV or a BEV with more range in that time.\n\nI charge L2 at home, usually to about 65%. In the rare cases I make a trip I charge it all the way just prior to driving. My climate is mid-Atlantic.\n\nI don’t think it’ll degrade that far the way I use it, so for me it’s a brilliant car that cost $13-14k less than a Model 3 and has more utility to me due to the hatchback design.\n\nPoint is, battery degradation is indeed a factor to consider when considering a switch to EV, but if you’re in a similar situation to me, it’s nothing to worry about too much no matter what car you end up with.\n\nI have solar on my roof and dream of using that battery as a powerwall one day.",

But maybe I’m missing something…ours only works because we have net metering.  Meaning we make more than we use but we use quite a bit in the evening when we are producing 0.  If we were off-grid we would need a sizable battery system too.  Especially when the days are short we use a lot of electricity in the evening.  I’m not an expert but that’s my experience.  Hope it helps!",

Paying someone else is going to drive up the cost. \n\nThe easiest way to cut cost is to get used solar panels. Santan solar is a common place to get them. I've made several purchases from them and everything has been working great for several years. Used panels will produce a little less because panels do degrade over time so I'd just derate them by 10% to get a more accurate representation of what they'll produce.",

Your house doesn't use that much electricity. \n\nBut what you have to do is think in: how much kWh will the project produce per year (you got that number above as 8,654), how much will I pay for that kWh that is produced for the solar (annual production divided by yearly loan payment). How does the price per kWh from your solar compare to the price per kWh from your utility? \n\nSince the solar will produce kWh largely between 10 am and 3pm, you will only use that solar directly during that time and the excess (most of the production) will go to the utility and the utility will give you net metering credits. You need to understand your utility's net metering credit program because most of the solar produced will go into that and only show up on your bill based on your utility's rules.",

I wanted to maximize system size for the simplicity of just the initial permit.  The initial reaction was that the estimator agreed with.  Ultimately, explaining the retirement and possibly future loads, aprehension was removed. \n\nHere's some interesting facts about my energy provider.   They serve 2 states, and one is Texas.   They are not part of ERCOT.  In Texas, they were just starting to limit applications to 120% of past yearly consumption.   They also implemented a specific,  higher meter cost for solar customers.\n\nIn New Mexico,(yes, we are part of the United States.  Arizona was admitted to statehood about a month after, yet they never have this problem.  🤣) our provider has to follow the guidelines by our state regulatory body.  At the time, there was no limit on sizing,  and the initial REC agreement period had expired for net metering, with a yearly schedule that has each month assigned a separate buyback amount.\n\nOur system is 4 years old, and we have seen 2 major changes implemented since then.  First, the base rate of electricity actually decreased a few cents.  The 120% size limitation was introduced in NM, and the tradeoffs for that was a significantly increased monthly buyback rate structure.   It used to average less than half the retail rate.  Now, it averages higher.  For some reason,  December's rate was about 4 times greater.\n\nAs far as experience,  I learned that everyone wanted to sell their favorite varieties of equipment,  especially panels.  That made absolute comparison difficult.   When I followed up by requesting a specific brand and model, prices were within 1.5% across the board.  \n\nWhile I could do general research for the market,  specific and local knowledge was literally a case of asking follow-up questions.  I noticed that, ultimately, one turn key company was extremely agreeable to respond to an email question about 3 times a week. \n\nThis company was ultimately the one that I chose,  as the owner ended up being related to a previous coworker.   That wasn't what convinced me.   It was the follow-up education of why he used a particular panel.   It made sense for our local environment.  \n\nI once had a friend who was a building inspector explain it to me this way.   You might have 2 companies give 2 identical estimates.   But something may align you towards a particular company.   A gut feeling,  or perhaps a feeling that everything will be taken care of to your personal satisfaction. \n\nSadly,  I don't think the current solar buying experience is the same.  I get the impression that it is rushed and trends towards high-pressure sales tactics. \n\nI was able to purchase at a time when the federal tax credit was a year away from ending.   We weren't part of the last year rush.  We didn't finance,  so I  can't speak to that part of the experience.\n\nOur experience was extremely positive.\n\nI don't mind answering questions here or direct messages. I am not comfortable discussing pricing specifics.\n\nYou might get more data by focusing on what you are specifically looking for. (Even if a single question is a separate post.)\n\nFor example,  in your experience purchasing solar, how important were specific panel specifications?\n\nAs a prospective customer,  how was communication between you and a prospective installer?\n\nWhen did you learn the difference between DC system size and AC system size?\n\nThe prospect of being interviewed by a phone call might reduce the data that could be captured with a focused, single question.",

But AC coupling (double conversion) is very common. \n\nThe Tesla PW2s are only AC coupled for example and they've worked great for years for many people. \n\nRemoving the SE inverter and all the SE optimizers, and rewiring all the PV panels on the roof is a LOT of work to gain a bit of efficiency. If you were re-roofing or redoing the PV arrays for any other reason then it might be worth it to rewire them to the PW3. Otherwise it's going to cost too much to do.",

"comment": "Nuclear sectors can’t spring out of nothing, particularly in countries that are not democratic or are at high risk of war. Manufacturing a new nuclear reactor to produce electricity is a huge and highly risky investment. You need the workforce and supporting infrastructure, regulatory oversight, expertise, etc. Most countries don’t have operating reactors, and it’s very hard to build one from scratch. Solar panels, windmills and batteries will be so much cheaper on a per unit basis in the long run, and as a result will ultimately be a far more accessible form of electricity for households in rich and poor countries.",

I mean, if I offered to buy a cat from the local humane society, kill it, fry it up, you probably wouldn't be down with that. Some people are. Further down that spectrum, some people are okay with eating people. It's rare, but cannibalism isn't entirely fantasy.\n\n\"On the other side of things, some people aren't cool with eating pig, but would eat cow. Keep going down that line and you'll find pescetarians, vegetarians, vegans, fruititarians, jainists and so forth. We all make a compromise between inflicting some amount of harm and our own comfort.\n\n\"Ultimately, what you might consider a tasty meal I don't even see as food, very much in the same way that you don't consider a human corpse a light snack.\"",

So probably just whole wheat rolls\n\n- Edit addition: Regular bread stuffing. With the no knead whole wheat bread that went awry.\n\n- Pumpkin cheesecake with my homemade Silk Nog yogurt cheese/Greek style yogurt\n\n- My families special \"holiday drink\", which will be sparkling black currant juice with sorbet on top.\n\nI'm super excited!",

"comment": "I'd have to wholeheartedly agree. The things that most compelled me to make the switch were the ideas that I could be eating myself into poor health and contributing to slowly killing our Earth, not the \"MEAT IS MURDER\" campaigns or the like.\n\nAs you said, nothing is worse for trying to get the message out there than trying to \"shove it down someone's throat\" by becoming the crazy people who force others to watch animal abuse. The old saying comes to mind \"You catch more flies with honey than vinegar\", as in you draw more people in with reasonable facts than forcing them to watch gore. \n\nI remember seeing how many people I've known, well and not, turn vegetarian or vegan from these sorts of things, but be able to switch right back soon after. Its much easier to turn a blind eye to something you don't see, such as animal slaughter for food, than it is to know that what you are doing could be harming yourself and those around you.",

"comment": "Bookmark some good vegan cooking blogs/sites like VegWeb, Vegan Dad, Vegan Stoner, etc. and think about exploring ethnic cooking, which is so very often vegan-friendly (think of Middle Eastern hummus, felafel, tabbouleh and mujadarra or of Indian food with its dal, rice, vegetables, for instance, or Asian stir-frys which are so easy to throw together).\n\nSome of my favourite meals these days? I tend to make a lot of salads (using things like lettuce, shredded kale, broccoli slaw or spinach as a base, then throwing on combinations of tomatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, carrots, avocado, etc. and topping them with chickpeas or other legumes, nuts, seeds, chia/flax/hemp and dressing). I like making wraps (they're a really good way to deal with leftover stir-fry or salad) and pizza (topped with red sauce and then anything and everything -- sometimes even dotted with hummus or drizzled with tahini rather than with non-dairy cheese like Daiya). Smoothies are also easy things to make (and they can be as healthy as you want, depending on what you throw in). \n\nSnacks? I keep a fruit bowl well-filled and eat a lot of fruit. I'll sometimes munch on a small handful of almonds or walnuts. I love making organic popcorn on the stuff and then crushing garlic into it and sprinkling it with nutritional yeast. Corn chips and homemade salsa (the store-bought stuff is so high in sodium) are another favourite.",

I find its raw flavour a bit funky, but then, I always found the flavour of butter a bit funky, so I guess my distaste for it means it's good.\n\nThe richness that butter adds to dishes mostly comes from adding a bit of flavourful fat. Most of the time, I skip the butterlike substances and just cook things with plenty of grease or finish my plate with a drizzle of a flavourful nut or seed oil (like walnut, unrefined coconut, or sesame).",

"comment": "&gt; and asking to state their motives at the start of a conversation sounds a little awkward.\n\nI don't think so at all. Whenever I have a discussion about veganism (off the internet) it is almost always initiated by the other person. I don't go around bringing it up. So if someone fids out that I'm vegan and wants to have a conversation, about half the time they start with a bunch of criticisms (protein, fad diet, plants tho, etc.) and I will say, \"Before I respond to your criticisms, and I will, can I ask what you hope to gain by having this conversation? What are you trying to achieve?\"\n\nThis isn't awkward, and it starts off by setting the tone of calm and rational thought. Their response is also very enlightening. They might say \"Well I'm just sick of you vegans always telling other people blah blah blah\" and you can remind them even before beginning that you haven't told them anything, that they brought it up. Maybe they say that they don't care about your lifestyle and they just want acceptance from you for theirs, at which point you can ask them why they need your acceptance in order to be happy. Or maybe they just say some variation of they are just curious about these different issues, at which point you can transition into a calm response focused on education. In any case, knowing where your opponent is at helps to keep the conversation in control, which is always a good thing in debate.",

"comment": "I became a vegan because of animals, however, the health benefits are a wonderful side effect for me. I have always strived to be healthy, and am definitely healthier since I've become a vegan so this is definitely a big part of it for me. Getting some nice recipe books/browsing blogs will help you when you're food shopping. Plan your week, make sure you have enough healthy snacks. Do meal plans. Get excited about food! Its not about eating less remember, its about more goodness! I follow various vegan bloggers on fb &amp; ig, so when I'm browsing in the morning after waking up they always inspire me to have a healthy day. Just remember how you feel when you eat shitty stuff and how you feel when you eat good stuff, how would you rather feel? Also if you exercise and/or trying to lose weight, check out r/progresspics for inspiration. It is amazing what these people have done, and it will be easier for you because you're not consuming fatty animal products! Ooh another thing, don't have tempting 'bad' stuff in the house. If you have a sweet tooth, make sure you have sweet treats like dark chocolate/dried fruit. Whatever you see to be your weakness area, have an alternative. And put your treats in a box in the cupboard so you don't see them all the time! Focus on what you want to achieve and keep going! You can do it! Also check out r/veganfitness :)",

I say: \"See, if you can assume it's so bad that you can't even stand to hear about it, you have to understand why I think it's wrong and don't want to support it.\" This works really well. As a matter of fact, she's grown a lot more accepting of my veganism and has significantly reduced her animal foods consumption as well (which I couldn't even dream about a couple of years ago). She keeps emailing me links to vegan recipes. Oh, and the wool conversations have become really rare, and she makes sure never to buy leather for me.\n\nHang in there! After a while she will see you are serious about it and will likely become more accepting.",

This leaves plenty of money for fresh greens, frozen veggies, fresh fruit and veggies and the occasional faux products. \n\nI suspect you purchased a lot of convenience foods which sure can be expensive. So focusing more on cooking from the basics and you can be amazed at how cheap a vegan diet can be.",

"comment": "&gt; Well, you already said that two consenting people can partake in human bodily fluids and have it be vegan. If you really believe veganism includes how humans interact, then you should logically think that eating another person is vegan so long as they've willingly given up their body. So eating a person would be vegan.\n\nThe definition of this subreddit says \"Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.\"\n\nSo, *if* such is consensual, then the person's body is NOT getting exploited, and if such cannibalism it is not cruel, then it is vegan according to the definition above, yes.\n\n&gt; Your beliefs are the reason why people think vegans don't approve of breastfeeding.\n\nNope.  Breastfeeding is consensual.  And I did mention consent.\n\n&gt; Do I think stealing milk from a human woman is ethical? No. Do I think it has anything to do with veganism? Also no. \n\nThere is no magical separation between humans and the rest of the animal world.  We only differ in degree, not kind.\n\nI haven't stretched the definition of veganism.  You've narrowed it to non-human animals, when the definition doesn't say anything about non-human animals.  And even if it did, that wouldn't matter, because there is no magical separation between humans and other animals.  Even before evolution got accepted by biologists, biologists regarded humans as animals.\n\n &gt; What's next, are you going to argue that abortions aren't vegan?\n\nIt is never absurd to follow your definitions and arguments to whatever consequences follow.  *If* fetuses are exploited for some gain by others, then abortions are not vegan.  *If* cruelty is inflicted to fetuses (such that such cruelty outweighs concerns of any adults involved with the fetus) via abortions, then abortions are not vegan.",

When going to restaurants google them ahead of time and make sure they have some thing she both can and would want to eat. A few places will say that their veggie friendly only to have a salad that can be made vegan if you order it with a specific dressing, not exactly a fun meal to enjoy while you're date is eating ribs. (Yes this is personal experience, thank you for considering this ahead of time.)\n\nReally it sounds like you're on the right track with the separate cutting board and the like, it would also be nice if you made sure to have some vegan snacks and breakfasts around for when she stays over, that way you both can spend more time together comfortably. \n\nGood job being a great boyfriend and good luck!",

Huge contrast.\n\nBtw, if you're an EA I would have expected you know about this stuff already.",

I'm sorry but that's not the belief that activists that campaign for actual change have. Rather it's the belief that middle/upper class people with comfortable lives have that don't have to lift a finger and get to feel good because \"hey... I'm a vegan and therefore have done my part\" (which yay.. good for you but it's not going to be enough). The same goes for other issues too. Activists that campaign for the environment, for social change etc. don't believe this narrative of human history. Instead, I would say that it's NOT in our DNA to solve problems. What's \"in our DNA\" (so to speak... the inaccurate application of scientific terminology is another problem but whatever it's a minor peeve) is to live as comfortably and selfishly as possible and wait only until the last minute, or until it affects enough people to give a damn to change.",

The website is still up even though admissions emailed us telling us everything is canceled indefinitely and the CEO is the one responsible. \n\nThe group of vegan food entrepreneurs seem to be involved in money scams frequently.

There are also plenty of overweight vegans. Just eat more. Carbs and protein have 4-5 kcal/gram while fats have 9kcal/gram. Stop making these excuses, veganism is about avoiding animal cruelty and exploitation and you can eat whatever amount of macros you'd like. And if somehow not; how could we help you, you didn't even tell us in what country you're living or in what part of what country! Buy some pea protein online for God's sake. Or buy 10 kg of red lentils for under €15/$15 equivalent if that's available to you (much cheaper anyway). If you just want to gain weight: why would we care how you do it? You could drink half a bottle of olive oil a day, fine with me and no doubt it works,  I used to drink two olive oil shots a day while doing strength training when I was still a carnist, because it's a very fast, easy and cheap way to get in extra calories and it's more healthy than consuming animal fat.",

Baking shows are my life but it's one of those things that's like \"oh. Whelp that's meat\" or \"I'll just pretend it isn't\". \n I get where you're coming from, though. I was more scared that they'd make the food look too good though and I'd want to stop being vegan lol But whenever they show the food, it feels no different than a food commercial except without the advertising so...yeah",

"comment": "Again   a lion kills the cubs and then has sex with the female. Even if thats   true and we leave the raping part out, we still have the killing kids   part.  \nAlso jeez why are you so insulting? You are acting like a   crybaby, I tried to be respectful. And now excuse me I go out and kill   some kids and if you have a problem with that you have a problem with   nature.  \nAnd now you say \"we have been doing this since a long time,   so its moral\" great we also have been killing each-other since a long   time, I am still against killing other humans.  \nNow we get into a problem because your arguments become so many and so stupid that I have to deal with them quickly:  \nSome   dogs need meat others dont, I gave you a scientific study to it and if   they do need meat that dosent change the fact that humans shouldn't  eat  it.  \nYou said that because it happends in nature we can do it, I  said  \"well lions do also this, if I did this to other humans would that  be  okay?\" a question you still didn't answer.  \nI really dont care  about  your culture if it hurts someone. I respect religion aslong as it  dosent  harm others and killing for meat harms others.  \nThen you say  that I  cant force you to be vegan, just like I cant force people to not  kill other  humans, however this dosen't make the choise less wrong.  You still  haven't made an arguement on why meat eating is moral.  \nI  am angry at  people who eat meat, because they hurt animals. I really  dont get why  this logic is so hard. Why do you hate people who kill  other humans?  Because they hurt others? But I thought its their  personal choise? See  how ridiculous this sounds.  \nLike my god killing a sentient life and dressing up aren't the same thing. Please have some respect for life.  \nNow you say that \"pregnancy as vegan diet won’t fit enough nutrients\" witch funny enough [this](https://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx)  paper says it is and again thats the biggest group of professionals on that stuff.  \nNow your argument goes into complete nonsense.  \nFirstly if the whole world went vegan we had more food. \" **If the world went vegan**, **we would have** an abundance **of food** crops to feed growing populations and **we could** reclaim pasture land for crop growth and cultivation. **If the world went vegan**, **we would have** an abundance **of** animal-destined **food** crops to feed the hungry and growing populations\"  \nsecondly yes its true their is a balance. A balance we destroy we eating meat.  \nWe   breed those animals, if the world went vegan we wouldn't have this   problem. Literally 80% from the soy that we get from destroying the   rainforest goes into livestock feed, killing more animals.  \nAnd again by 2048 the oceans will be empty, witch will kill everyone of us. But we ignore that I guess.  \nWe   had more plants, if the world went vegan, becuase 33% of the land on   earth gets used for livestock. We could use that land for more plants to   eat.  \nAlso 14% of the CO2 comes from livestock aswell, making the earth warmer.  \nAnd yes it is murder and yes I will criticize muslimes for it and I am glad that many muslimes already vegan.  \nThe quran also says that a womens opinion is half as much worth as the a males one and I dont respect that either.  \nDo what you want aslong as it dosent hurt anyone.\n\nIts   so weird that people are like \"its my believe to kill an animal. No  one  is getting hurt aside from the animal, whos throat I cut open\".  Like..  dude its right there.  \nThere is a victim therefor its not a personal choise.\n\nI   could go on and tell you how bad meat for the earth is or that its   really bad for your body or that a pig has the intelligence of a 3 year   old, but I wast my time here.  \nSo I leave it at that.",

Beans rice legumes etc. I'm not the one that decides if you're vegan or not, it's YOUR actions and decisions that do that. Don't go shifting your responsibility onto me because you found out your favourite animal abuse burger was made with animal abuse. \n\n&gt;You're actually making an argument that there are plants I can eat that make me not vegan. Plants.\n\nIf I made a burger and I had this new fancy pants oscillation stirring device that uses the power of sonic vibration to rip apart organic material and mush it together and decided that the high pitched squealing of a puppy in pain was the best frequency of sound waves to mix my ingredients with, would you buy my plant burger if it was the cheapest on your market and over the same time period the Impossible burger has been around I tortured the same amount of puppies as rats died for the other burger? Would you support my burger if the result was the perfectly combined ingredients into a patty that is almost so realistic you couldn't tell the difference?",

We could not find one willing to travel to us for any price. \n\nVegan is 100 times harder than just no meat. It wasn’t just not serving meat. It was pulling off half decent vegan catering.

If you had a pet before going vegan, feed it according to its natural needs. But don’t get a carnivore for pleasure.",
