Sure, you have to buy most of it, but there is substantial public money available as well. This is why tiny New Jersey is a close second behind big ol' California in solar power. \n\nEveryone hates the idea of more taxation. Even liberals. That's what made Cap and Trade somewhat unique-it harnessed the free market laissez-faire economics that you prefer in order to reduce a harmful byproduct without traditional command-and-control regulation that historically characterized environmental policy. Instead of seeing that as a centrist policy full of concessions, Republican's knee-jerk reaction/rejection means that instead of this laissez-faire policy, the next attempt will probably be more traditional, in the form of a tax. So in an effort to avoid a perceived tax, Republicans fought a free-market based policy, the results of which seems to be leading us to a more simple approach: the carbon tax.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002828510400528709,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2396805161535326,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.25510893711606286,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3180289864393486,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22763349500918492,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.261086082388465,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.259970027487725,"ev_1":-0.1872495862229433,"ev_2":-0.2614023501760309,"ev_3":-0.012532010829697052,"ev_4":-0.009367919303864861,"ev_5":-0.003490417506933833,"ev_6":-0.007204842404462397},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

I don't usually drive to there, I fly and rent a car. I mean that for daily/weekend driving. 100 miles in a day is easy to put on, and if you live in an apartment or condo, it's not easy to charge every single night. It's easy to put on a couple hundred miles in a weekend just going to the mall several times and visiting Aunt Annie a couple of towns over. That's where a bit of understandable range anxiety comes in. Plus it can be cold. So all of a sudden your 200 mile range EV becomes 120 miles. That's very, very easy to chew up on a weekend. Want to go skiing for the day? Nope, can't do it. 80+ miles one way, and what if there's no chargers available to juice you up when you get there? There might be, but there might not be. Plus you can't just leave it plugged in while you ski or go biking. There's no superchargers in those mountain towns, so you have to figure out when to come off the mountain and unplug your car. That causes anxiety, even when you're quite comfortable with EVs. I'm not 100% sure I'd have one if I lived in the midwest without having a gas car as a backup. Not everyone has the luxury of spending a lot on an EV and having a backup car. I'm not saying it isn't possible to have an EV there, but in a place like that, having an EV can limit you. Having a car is one of those things that should feel freeing and enabling, rather than restrictive and limiting. US culture, for better or worse, puts a lot of value on the car as a symbol of freedom to go wherever you want, any old time.

Is this still true, or has the &gt; manufacturing process become more energy efficient?\n\nIt takes roughly 9 months to a year for all the energy used in the manufacturing, construction and shipping of solar panels to be generated by the panels themselves.\n\nHere is a summary of papers with energy payback in years on them:\nhttp://www.resilience.org/stories/2006-06-16/energy-payback-roof-mounted-photovoltaic-cells\n\nthey range from 1-4 years but these paper are all about a decade old and the math looks even better nowadays.\n\nAs far as Solarcity, there is one huge advantage to not owning the panels - you don't have liability for them.  You don't need to increase your homeowners insurance to cover them, you don't need to worry about what to do if the inverter blows up, you don't need to worry about a massive hailstorm breaking them all.  If you don't have Solarcity in Geogia, it's still worth considering a solar lease from another company.\n\nI tried to get USA made solar panels for our house, and it is very hard to buy them.  But it's much easier to get USA assembled panels - so the silicon was produced in China but the panels themselves were assembled in the US.  Maybe it's splitting hairs but I thought \"ok, I can't get manufactured, but assembly is at least something\".\n\nMost on-grid systems do not have batteries.  \n\nIf you lease, hail is not your problem, but in general panels seem to do ok against hail.  My panels are rated for up to 1\" hail falling at a rate of 60 miles per hour.  We seem to get a 1\" hailstorm about once in 20 years per neighborhood (the last one was about 8 years ago) so the odds didn't seem great to me, but not awful either.  Solar damage by hail is covered but you'll need to add coverage when you add the panels to the homeowners insurance policy.\n\nYes, but I can't quantify it.  But definitely shading the roof on the sunny side with a panel that's offset with an air gap of about 5\" on our house does seem to cool the attic a bit.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00021905932226218283,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12743696544462182,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18624272535843955,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.31152751635763104,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19801298194985195,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27411927934226493,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.027022233543296654,"solar_1":-0.13803079103081473,"solar_2":-0.22414314032169752,"solar_3":-0.045900568073799754,"solar_4":-0.11554767863067303,"solar_5":-0.005587797724729171,"solar_6":-0.0015538434563495684,"solar_7":-0.0057675910005248925,"solar_8":-0.008040039385377895,"solar_9":-0.04563844516462012,"solar_10":-0.1536073374833601},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Here's the deal: There has been such demand for the batteries that they don't have any. They're fulfilling orders for people that had a powerwall order down a year+ ago and many got diverted to the cars (without fulfilling the car orders, there is no Tesla so it's understandable).\n\nI was told on good authority that batteries will only be really available in Q1 of 2019, so don't hold out much hope of getting one before.\n\nMy Advice (and what my contact told me) is to make them install Solar as battery ready, but without the battery. Depending on your utility company, you should be eligible for net metering, meaning even without the battery installed, you're getting the benefit of free electricity even when there's not solar. This is exactly my situation as my main power  needs are not during the day.\n\nTell tesla you want the system installed now without a battery and be battery ready (all the hookups etc) and they can come back when they're ready. This may be wiser in the long term anyway, as over the next few years (i.e. 2-3), batteries are going to come down in price and be much more available, possibly resulting in even better performance.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16005869960771474,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17930052444422467,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22395524962295132,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09729693919344509,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10121229183815665,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22749143769770389,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1777870619747167,"solar_1":-0.10929201028394459,"solar_2":-0.22274046930128186,"solar_3":-0.19007543759955428,"solar_4":-0.2183170195853784,"solar_5":-0.05361390580461981,"solar_6":-0.0637530373884753,"solar_7":-0.09833103735385712,"solar_8":-0.055891190625261614,"solar_9":-0.022348364425418765,"solar_10":-0.21067859097637792},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The example bill I have from prior to the installation had the months usage at 1800 kWh roughly and I calculated a difference in rate netting them a savings of about $20 that month if that power had been entirely solar. The base rate they're using is 12.9 cents per hour in the original contract with the up to 2.9% annual increase. Currently the rate is slightly above 13 cents. My research indicates the average rate in/near Philadelphia has been sitting around 15.2 cents for several years now which means if that continues for another 5 years at the 2.9% increase within 5 years we'd be paying more for solar than we would for the utility. \n\n\nI've got the bill history for the entire year of 2018 and they've paid for more energy than they've used with the peak month sitting at 800 kWh so obviously some habits have changed in the process. I'm thinking that their savings were largely due to something like that rather than anything to do with the solar panels.

System size is 15.84kW with 2 Powerwalls.   It is supposed to off-set out usage by 74%.   I know that is crazy, but we never tried to be energy efficient, so we ran our AC at 75 degrees, even when neither one of us were here for 10-12 hours of the day, 5 days a week, so they went off our regular usage.   After we made plans to get solar, we changed our habits.  I started to raise the AC to 80 degrees while we were gone.  When I got home, I lowered it it 75.  It never usually went above 78 degrees while were were gone.  Over a year passed before they installed solar (started process Oct 2017), so that energy offset should be MUCH higher this year.\n\nSo I had our roof replaced last week of March 2019, solar panels installed first week of April 2019, and then they were turned on last week of May (Tesla dropped the ball big time, but they gave me 1 month worth of credit for solar loan after arguing with them).\n\nI screwed up and had solar attic fans installed with new roof, and attic stayed BLISTERING hot, which meant our AC was running 16-18 hours of the day from April - September 15, 2019.  After September 16, the attic was MUCH cooler with the off-ridge vents, and our AC didn't turn on as much; still 10-12 hours max, but nowhere near the 18 hours it was going.\n\nSo all my months I should have overproduced went out the window because of my solar attic fans.  I love solar, but solar attic fans are garbage without a back up energy source. \n\nIn the next month or two I will be upgrading my 17 year old AC unit/air handler to an 18 seer variable speed unit, then add my insulation over our master bedroom (5\") by garage, and add more to the other two bedrooms (10\").   I will also add some insulation to the garage once I get the AC equipment changed out, so they aren't mashing it while they work.   Later this year, but most likely next, I will change our water heater to a heat pump style one.  Windows will be changed too, but that's a way down the line thing.   My house is from 1987, so it's not really energy efficient.   I'm trying to make it one little by little.\n\nMy goal is to have no electric bill 10/12 months out of the year.  With net neutrality, I should be able to do that hopefully by May when I should have new AC equipment.   The only two months I don't think I will be able to is maybe January/February, because the system doesn't produce a lot of power.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.25929683691639926,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21238239652052826,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22082380810650193,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1954943770553955,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22220447779534766,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16767510174152753,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2847571937638442,"solar_1":-0.24176410380440977,"solar_2":-0.1867639696341446,"solar_3":-0.10960930691605124,"solar_4":-0.298921400000528,"solar_5":-0.09692855600345258,"solar_6":-0.1038432540372014,"solar_7":-0.02894899625486384,"solar_8":-0.10478700258924316,"solar_9":-0.16985766382940592,"solar_10":-0.22454465071948418},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

It is do-able, but there are safety concerns that need to be addressed.    \n\n\nWhat you're looking for is called a transfer switch.  It may be an automatic transfer switch (e.g. Tesla Backup Gateway) or a manual transfer switch.  Multiple manufactures make them.  This allows you to cut off from the national grid.  One part of the problem.  \n\nI've seen particular setups where there are shaped pieces of metal that will turn off the mains electrical breaker and force one \"backfeed breaker\" on.  This is safe, but it may not be up to code.    \n\n\nAfterward, you need an inverter (a cheap one off of Amazon?) that does 240v.  Doesn't need to be huge, but it just needs to be enough for your solar inverter to register active power on L1/L2 (my solar inverter is 240v.  You may have a 120v inverter, I dunno).  \n\n\nThird part of the magic is a \"dump load\" or something that will take the remainder of the solar generation load that \"dumps the excess\" power.  Dump Load resisters can be used.  Or a high power usage appliance like maybe an electric heater or an AC.  \n\n\nI have a NEMA 14-50 plug I use for my Electric vehicle, which I could probably use as the backfeed circuit.    \n\n\nAgain ... \\*NEVER\\* have the mains breaker engaged while a backfeeder circuit is operating while the national grid is down.  Transfer switches are the sane/safe option.  Having a method or mechanism that physically prevents a backfeeder and mains from being simultaneously on (like a plastic plate) may be the cheap option.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007220934639917687,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2980903914701074,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2359634521689681,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24097728183026407,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23086807735155396,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14336913152549768,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18997351508778593,"solar_1":-0.2790600684288999,"solar_2":-0.2223698220065125,"solar_3":-0.04272004417362041,"solar_4":-0.08676546242433941,"solar_5":-0.030850953993649455,"solar_6":-0.12136324558135432,"solar_7":-0.2595188569976017,"solar_8":-0.04546065616401999,"solar_9":-0.01884572832881304,"solar_10":-0.18600061943672777},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

The networks aren't build for huge inputs during sunny hours and the large peak of for example the electric cars that get hooked up in the evening in addition to the traditional evening peak (which is also incrwasing). The peak loads are more disruptive in a way that the grids aren't build for. It does alleviate on the large scale tho. The netproviders, who regularly give lunchlectures on the universities, are preparing a smart grid (many projects of the university have to with this, in many fields) and more local redunacny to be prepared to make it all future proof.\n\nAt the moment the growth of distributed renewable energy generation is too fast for the infrastructure to keep up, but the plans are in action to deal with this on massive scales, especially since the load will increase dramatically: large industries moving away from fossils to electricity, datacenters eating more and more power, increased individual consumption via electric vehicles (the ebike is also immensely popular here)\n\nBut overall those are definitely steps in the right direction, and it may not go fast enough. One large goal is to make the technologies we are developing now cheap enough to be viable the world over, and that may still be a problem.\n\nThere are also technologies such as hydrogen in Europe being developed to offset or even solve some of the load, especially for transportation and heavy industries","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006945426791844511,"1.1.1_stance":-0.36207275568900055,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.25571979824007013,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0325686310728391,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15096378423521847,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18305755718400063,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1299107984523289,"solar_1":-0.014855256954130406,"solar_2":-0.2534088709335127,"solar_3":-0.24547174605924266,"solar_4":-0.030528530062535236,"solar_5":-0.008479867901769467,"solar_6":-0.0012718545719205092,"solar_7":-0.001963539221227014,"solar_8":-0.006954132339160424,"solar_9":-0.21868542521163667,"solar_10":-0.246981360912987},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

The solar installation industry here in the US is obscenely overcharging customers. \nNow, there absolutely are some additional expenses in the US due to regulatory and building code requirements, but that's actually comparatively minor in terms of material costs and installation expenses.\n\nIt's not at all uncommon for local authorities in the US to require a building to be evaluated by a structural engineer and an electrician before issuing a permit, along with a few other building code verifications.  But even taking that into account, in many areas of the United States you'll be paying 3 to 4 times as much as virtually any other country beyond the United States.   I can tell you're wondering, how and why in the world are people paying this much for solar panels?\n\nIt really boils down to a perfect storm combination of enthusiasm on the part of the general public to go green paired with a lack of knowledge about the actual cost and expenses of solar panels and reasonable rates for labor.   Most people don't know, and have almost no unbiased sources for information.\n\nPeople literally don't know any better, and the solar installation industry collectively does everything they can to promote that ignorance along with the notion that the prices that are presenting are \"normal\" and \"just how it is\".   They're sailing on a gravy boat, and will do everything they can to fight anything that might tip the ship.  😂\n\nIt's not very popular to bring this topic up because a very large number of the people that frequent the r/solar and r/DIYSolar are actually people working in that industry, and they actively try to promote that narrative and smother anything that is contrary.\n\nAs an example, they've tried repeatedly and very diligently to get the moderators of the subReddit too block or suppress \"solar quote\" threads where people post to ask opinions on whether or not a solar quote is a good deal or not.  They don't want people comparing notes or getting help from unbiased sources.    I saw a post asking about a solar quote not that long ago, it was for I believe a 16 KW system for a quote of over $85,000US... And there were people in that thread telling this person that the quote was just fine. 🙄\n\nAnd on the topic of not getting SCREWED, here are a few of my comments in different threads trying to help poor ignorant fools not get completely fleeced by the very people that are reassuring them that everything is all right and normal.\n\nSeveral of them are downvoted because as I mentioned a significant percentage of the /users that haunt the r/solar and r/solardiy are the very solar installers who are doing everything they can to keep people gullible and ignorant in order to keep the sales flowing. They've apparently tried to have me banned a couple of times though reports in the past couple of months, which I find genuinely funny.\n\n/r/solar/comments/10smyjx/comment/j72ytnl/\n\n/r/solar/comments/zr2ivl/comment/j11ojzk/\n\nRight now you can get pallets of bifacial solar panels for about $0.42-$0.45watt with either free delivery or just a couple hundred dollars for liftgate service, you can buy UL inverters for between $0.15-$0.25/watt capacity, depending on the type of inverter.   Hardware costs including cables, mounting, panels inverter should be right around $1.15/watt or so.    $2.50/watt professionally installed is a reasonable price in my opinion, considering workmanship warranties.    But people are willingly paying $3, $4 $5+? Per watt while being convinced that they're getting a good deal?   That's nauseating.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2691802608902593,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18992003579918476,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12710732299758867,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16816660455473229,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2390035657998851,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2007193016200283,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2703789847959516,"solar_1":-0.23378576092467812,"solar_2":-0.0593494339290055,"solar_3":-0.06899118725102621,"solar_4":-0.1985332969385172,"solar_5":-0.166990769241238,"solar_6":-0.2796111385596047,"solar_7":-0.05053454368802098,"solar_8":-0.17873565420871185,"solar_9":-0.26909933137993836,"solar_10":-0.19717473360597354},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

These numbers all seem incorrect, if you remove the time period. But I am using Wikipedia and a stack of assumptions. Sorry, that probably makes no sense. \n\nWhat I mean is this. (I will intersperse my thoughts among extracts from this Wikipedia article)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene\n\n“Pleiocene)[8] is the epoch in the geologic time scale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58[9] million years ago”\n\nSo.. three million years ago. \n\n“beginning of the Pliocene was marked by an increase in global temperatures relative to the cooler Messinian related to the 1.2 million year obliquity amplitude modulation cycle”\n\nI don’t know what the obliquity amplitude modulation cycle is. It sounds important. \n\n“The global average temperature in the mid-Pliocene (3.3–3 mya) was 2–3 °C higher than today,[20] carbon dioxide levels were the same as today,[21] and global sea level was 25 m higher.[22]”\n\nThis however, is the kicker. If the mid pliocene is a rough and ready explainer of that full 2.3 million year period, then what you have is a set of evidence that runs for 2.3 million years, highlighting how the CO2 is connected to the sea level, and today’s CO2 correlates with 25 meters higher sea level. \n\nI did skim a few papers, maybe 5 or more, about this issue. It seems the sea level was expected at 25 meters here, 15 meters there. So there’s some variation. But the point was that the CO2 today will push 2-3 degrees and lead to 25 meters rise.\n\nSo I like to walk around imagining the sea at 25 meters higher. That’s a really productive way to assess the use of things like steel reinforced cement. If you’re putting in cement and expecting to get good value from it, as in, say 50 to 500 years use, you probably want it well above the new 25 meter high watermark. Everything below that is simply going to be wasted. With high speed long range lithium personal and vehicle mobility devices, you can easily live a bit away from coasts and rivers and riverbanks and floodplains, and still commute. Also, you can utilise coastal life today but withdraw to allow for those changing 100 year flood levels, and that land can go to carbon sinks and rehabilitation of fish nurseries and wetlands and tidal forests and so on. Literally perfect reason to disassemble all housing and industry and commercial and rebuild it using 2023+ designs for ultra low energy and resource usage, better water conservation and also far better temperature and air pollution management. \n\nThere’s a huge amount of really poorly constructed and shoddy buildings that honestly should be removed, they have such high running and maintenance costs. \n\nYet to do so in energy efficient ways, as economic development goes further electric with solar power of batteries, ie. nearly entirely circular, you need to find candidate locations where the win-win is to restore coastal and riverside flora and fauna migration pathways with animal habitats, take a metro carbon credit for it, as well as the tourism and especially local mental health improvements from reduced pollution and lower depression, while also enabling more conscientious development at places where you don’t damage the biofilms from housing that requires all water runoff to drain away (as the water is so polluted by human activity you don’t want it to enter the soils!).\n\nHmm long sentence. (Short for me, but probably makes no sense)\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nRestore habitat at all riparian zones and coasts.  \nCollect the vast range of benefits, but especially the ones that make your population uber-healthy. Eg. Air and water quality and population comfort knowing that it’s not all death and destruction wherever humans are.\nReenable trust in your population by having them learn to disassemble things. Refurbish/repair/relocate. Then rebuild.  Utilise more modern approaches to improving the health of the housing and make it human centric (eg. Evehicle based, where you can carry the evehicle with one hand) so it’s low pollution and zero cost, renewable energy using to make the population mobile.  Also try ensure water runoff is collected and that soils can return to use as filters so that groundwater is preserved.

He shouted the alarm, and then said that the solution was for everybody to turn down their thermostats 2 degrees and get their car tuned up.  Telling us all how totally out of tune he was on the whole issue.  The problem is at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than he thinks.\n\n  \nAnother is it seems that the same people concerned about global warming are also anti nuclear.  Where nuclear is a source of non carbon producing base power which can produce energy when the sun isn't shining, the wind isn't blowing, and the tides are at rest.\n\n  \nSo, instead of increasing our non carbon producing base power capability, they are instead pushing wind and solar PV.  All that capital investment, that at best will get us half way to our goal.  To a point that in order to end global warming, we will still need to cut our generation of carbon dioxide by 99%.\n\nAnd just so you know, I like solar PV and I like wind power.  It's just that they are not capable of getting us where we need to be to end global warming.  They are a distraction of valuable resources.\n\nI may put solar on a home I just purchased in Florida.  The problem is, even with batteries, I will still need to be connected to the grid.  Because, it is totally impractical to install a system with enough battery power to be able to provide consistent power 24/7/52 while disconnected from the grid.

However, I feel like the tenets of why I'm vegan aren't beliefs. Eating meat is cruel and selfish towards animals, our environment, and in some cases, personal health. It's... a fact that I feel I can prove, but mostly keep to myself in social situations. \n\nAlthough I love to discuss/educate people who are considering converting or modifying their lifestyles if they solicit my advice, it's never been my goal to police anyone's life or food. However, I feel disgusted and dissatisfied dating omnivores because beyond watching them eat, I feel like we just clearly don't share the same core values. \n\nI don't want to discount a future partner simply because they eat cheeseburgers, but to me, it's symbolic of so much more than that. I'm 26 years old as well, so I'm thinking about future households and children. I wouldn't disown my future child for eating animals outside of the home if that's what they choose to do after I raise and educate them, but I definitely don't want meat in my house and I don't want to feel like I'm controlling anyone else (a partner/spouse). \n\nI live in a small town, though, and I'm one of two vegans even of my friends--although many are vegetarian. I feel like I'll literally have to relocate to a more progressive town to increase my chances of being surrounded by like-minded people.
