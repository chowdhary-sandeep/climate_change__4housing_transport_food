"comment": "&gt; 8. Why do BEV advocates talk so much about the lack of hydrogen infrastructure? \n\nBecause it costs [millions](http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-fuel-cell-cars-20141026-story.html#page=1) to create a hydrogen fueling station.   A level 3 charger/Supercharger costs $10-25K per plug.\n\nSo, for the price of one hydrogen station, you can install about a hundred fast chargers.  Couple that with higher adoption rates for BEVs an you already have critical mass.",

But he's also been in favor of wind farms for similar reasons:  less coal burning, less greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhitworth is professionally anti-EV because he's an activist for small-scale renewable power generation.\n\nMorris just seems to be moderately good at writing negative letters to the editor that include a range of good points (large-scale wind farms have downsides), clumsy misinformation (batteries need replacing frequently and are destined for landfills), and general negative opinions (EVs are impractical and expensive).\n\nSo this is really an \"Anti-EV rant by somebody who promotes a specific kind of renewable energy\".\n\nThe most efficient EV owners I know are ones who combine their EVs with small-scale renewable power generation.

"comment": "Here is an estimate with actual numbers.\n\nLets say an ICE equiv of the  Tesla MS gets 30mpg and a MS gets  3mpKWH. This suggests 1 gal ~= 10kwh.\n\nA modern heavy truck does ~6 to 12 MPG, and so requires 5 to 2.5x the battery storage of the MS using the Tesla drive/charge cycle. A MS has 70- 85kwh of pack. \n\nSo, for the same driving style as a MS, a heavy truck would need a pack in the range of 175kwh to 425kwh (2.5x70 to 5x85). A MS pack should cost around $250/kwh currently, and hopefully half that within 5yrs. At $250, this gives a pack cost of \n$44k to $107k.\n\nPower companies are enthusiastic about EVs. Partly because of the possibilities they provide in improving grid stability as controlled/influenced storage devices.\n\nEdit: Actual truck: http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2014/05/transpower-transforms-the-trucking-industry-with-ev-big-rig-trucks-with-zero-emissions-at-la-ports/\n\nThese trucks do \"1.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity per mile\" at 65mph. This is on the efficient/cheap side of my estimate range, though they carry 270 kwh packs, with a range of 88.2 miles (3kwh pack / mile), so I assume they are a bit amateurish in pack design.\n\nCharging: Tesla SC stations have up to 8 stalls, charging at up to 675kw total (4x135). There have been no grid problems.",

Too fast, it'll blow up.  The only way to get an ICE to work at any decent output is to keep the RPM's in that sweet range, and to do that and not be limited to only one direction and slow speed, they need a gearbox.\n\nEV's, on the other hand, have a very wide RPM range, starting at zero with full torque, and can go very, very high.  So high, that by the time any halfway decent motor is maxing out it's range, it has surpassed the possible output for the vehicle.\n\nAlso, because of the low end torque, making a gearbox that can absorb that much punishment is more trouble than it's worth.  Tesla had a 2-speed transmission in the Roadster, but it was a main point of failure.  Over time, they figured out that it was easier to design a better motor than it was to make a gearbox work for an EV.",

They have made a difference, but a smaller one, and have sacrificed more for that small difference than many are willing to.\n\nBut the real cost of ideological purity is the vegan at dinner with friends who serves as justification for not worrying about animal welfare.\n\nIf you talk about going vegetarian or reducing consumption, or even if you think about it inwardly, veganism responds \"well if you believe that eating an animal for your own pleasure is wrong then doing it 1/4th as much as everyone else is still wrong. If you don't believe it's wrong, then why reduce at all\".\n\nHow many animals does that save? How many animals does it save when Vegans end up self-organizing into social groups mostly of other vegans because being vegan around omnis is burdensome (and vice versa)?\n\nI think eating less animals and using less animal products is fine and dandy.\n\nI think the jury is out on eating no animals and being very ideological about it, because I think the polarizing effect can kill way more animals than it saves because there is a zero bound on reducing consumption, but a very high bound on increasing it, so the danger of promoting reaction is not to be dismissed out of hand.",

"comment": "Right now the fact that you have to charge them is still the sticking point for most people who are stuck.  For daily use the reality is that this is only perception (and not a real problem) for the vast majority of people - you plug the car in at night and in the morning you have a \"full tank of electricity\" and there are a growing number of choices of cars that have enough range for the average daily commute plus some \"driving around range.\"  For road trips, charging adds time and sometimes a bit of planning to the trip and people freak out about that.  Again, the reality is that it's not *that* bad, and the slightly slower pace is safer and more healthy for you anyway.\n\nThey also cost more, although in reality that is offset by zero fuel costs and lower maintenance costs over the life of the car.\n\nA *huge* part of the reason they aren't far more common, though, is that dealerships make less money on them because the bulk of their profits come from repairs and maintenance, which is lower for EVs...so traditional manufacturers and dealers would *much* rather make and sell ICE vehicles.",

If Tesla isn’t buying enough batteries to make it profitable, and they’ve scaled back 18650 orders by 70% already, then sweetheart pricing probably doesn’t make sense. And when Panasonic is no longer willing to eat those losses while Tesla is on the hook for $15.7B in buys, Tesla’s $/kWh advantage is in jeopardy.\n\nEDIT: BTW, Panasonic’s automotive battery business lost $65M in 2018Q3. They’ve gone on to lose $180M so far. GF1 has yet to show a profit for Panasonic.",

The Prime's EV range is so low that I would imagine it would reduce the range enough to fill up gas a few days more often. As for a Volt, I would still easily get to work and most of the way back on EV in the winter. We don't get below -20C very often, sometimes never during a winter.",

The proposed tax credit is refundable. Let's say in 2021 you bought an electric car and qualified for the full $7500 tax credit. Your tax liability for the year was $6000, and you had exactly that amount withheld. Your refund will be $6000, not $7500.\n\nNow let's say the BBB act passes, and you bought another electric vehicle qualifying for the $7500 credit. Your tax liability was again $6000 and you had that much withheld. Your tax refund will be $7500.",

I'd be fine with a performance boost vs the original, get the top speed higher, but would probably work better as a city car type than high speed highway vehicle.  Safety?  I mean, sure, but people can legally buy 200 horsepower motorcycles and ride them without helmets.....so that's a bad argument as to why someone can't go 20mph or 30mph in an electric car without safety features.

"comment": "In 1978, Congress passed the National Energy Act, bringing Public Utility Regulatory Policies (PURPA) into  Federal law.  PURPA gave small power production facilities (&lt;80MW) greater access to the electric grid, provided they were utilizing cleaner energy resources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, landfill gas, and geothermal. If these facilities could provide power to the grid, the power utility would be forced to purchase this energy at their \"avoided cost\" rate.  \n\nThese generators existed because the grid could not provide all the power they needed to run their heavy-duty equipment (think steel mills). But without grid-connection, these manufacturers were forced to burn off their excess energy, which is environmentally unsound. But the manufacturers needed permission to interconnect to the grid, and the power utilities obviously didn't want the give up that control. Up to that point, utilities wanted onsite manufacturers to be subject to the exact same regulations as much larger (500MW+) power plants. Of course, these utilities had paid for the right to control the grid in their service territories, and as such, they wanted to charge exorbitant fees for these smaller generators to hook up to the grid. So PURPA solved alot of problems, by essentially stating that an onsite generator was a consumer class that warranted protection from the monopolistic nature of grid operation, under the rationale that it was best for the environment, the consumer class it was protecting (manufacturers), and ergo, the general public.\n\nI'm sure the utilities argued that the increase in administrative costs and grid infrastructure raised the price of electricity for consumers, but losers will have their unique points of view. At the end of the day, it's unfair to regulate a consumer of electricity who wants to generate power roughly equal to their consumption as a power utility.\n\nAs such, net-metering is a philosophic extension of PURPA regulation. If you agree that &lt;80MW on-site generators deserve separate regulations vs. 500MW+ power utilities, then you should also agree that &lt;2MW generators deserve separate regulations vs. &gt;50MW generators, so long as the following conditions are met:\n\n* no net-increase in the cost of electricity for non-participants\n* overall environmental benefit\n\nSo say you are a solar array owner. You have the option to either store your electricity, or instead, dump it onto the grid. Either way, you're not increasing the price of your neighbor's electricity. In fact, by bringing clean energy to the grid, you're improving environmental quality which your neighbor enjoys for free.\n\nNow, utilities will say \"harumph! we're being forced to pay for retail electricity which we'd otherwise pay wholesale for, so it's raising grid prices\". But that's simply not true. *The utility would lose the sale regardless if the grid customer stayed interconnected or not*. \n\nThe utility is still allowed to charge monthly fixed rates for grid-access. As to the argument that the solar array user gets free services, by utilizing the grid as a \"battery\"...well... EVERYBODY UTILIZES THE GRID AS A BATTERY! And its environmentally destructive! \n\nThe most fair policy would be one where everybody pays a monthly grid-access charge. But that would make battery-banks more cost-justifiable, and utilities don't want that either. Utilities simply want to operate business as usual. No cost accounting for carbon emmissions. No micro-generators.\n\nThe only cost solar adds to the grid is administrative cost. Yet I've paid the adminsitrative cost for \"smart grid\" upgrades, and still I lack access to time-of-day metering, or other \"smart grid\" benefits. Utilities need to be updating their software, rather than promoting environmentally destructive policies.\n\nAnd that's exactly why consumer protections for solar array owners are necessary. hence net-metering.",

The general consensus \n&gt; among informed people is that Natalie Bennet was the clear\n&gt; winner in the debate, and the only people who weren't\n&gt; won over were knuckle dragging morons who would vote \n&gt;UKIP.\n\nI'm sorry, I see nothing \"obvious\" about either the Conservatists nor UKIP being racist.  UKIP is somewhat nationalist but I don't see any obvious indications that they are racist.  I see several indications they aren't fans of Muslims but that's not racist--the proper term there is along the lines of Islamaphobic or perhaps just bigoted.\n\n&gt; No the Green plan includes cancelling Hinkley C, and \n&gt; phasing out all nuclear power within 8-10 years.\n\nYes I know; that's one of the reasons why it's a bad plan overall.  It has some noble elements in it to be sure, but sacrificing solid baseline power in the form of coal and natural gas for less steady wind and solar power isn't a good idea.  It's a good way to commit national suicide though.  Nuclear is a solid backup for a renewables-based economy and meets all rational people's standards for non-carbon energy in this regard.\n\nYou're calling the UK Energy Research Director a \"denier\"?  On what basis?  He sounds as if he provided an off-the-cuff but probably quite realistic assessment.\n\n&gt; Cancel the defence budget, \n\nThen how do you defend Great Britain?  Or do you believe nobody will ever attack them again?\n\n&gt;tax the rich, \n\nGreat Britain is doing a pretty good job there already it would appear:\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/tax/9654465/Britains-taxes-among-highest-in-world-accountants-say.html\n\nOne presumes you'd like it to be more?  Is that outlined in the Green manifesto?\n\n&gt; punish tax avoiders \n\nPlease define \"tax avoiders\" here.  If we're after folks who are using illegal deductions and the like to avoid taxes I'm more or less with you.  If we're talking people who avoid taxes by, say, claiming a mortgage interest deduction we've got a problem with definitions.\n\n&gt;and tax dodgers. \n\nAgain please define precisely what you mean here. \n\n&gt;The Greens have a fully costed manifesto.\n\nI would genuinely like to see it...link?",

Whether or not they are worth that premium, that's up to you. \n\nIf you have minimal roof space, and need to get every possible watt per sqft of space, then SunPower makes sense as they have the highest efficiencies and will output the most power for a given amount of space. \n\nOtherwise, for \"regular\" panels. They are realistically, regardless of what people will tell you, a commodity product. A 285 watt panel is a 285 watt panel is a 285 watt panel. While things like overall build quality, power tolerances, thermal performance, warranties and \"brand\" strength do indeed matter, the actual differences from brand to brand are generally non-existent, and generally don't impact the end user for a small system at all. \n\nThe term \"tier 1\" is something that you might hear thrown around when talking about modules. All this means is that the financiers of large commercial and utility scale projects view these brands as \"safe bets\" so to speak on large scale projects. The tier 1 manufacturers have generally all been around for at least 5 years, do a lot of internal PV R&amp;D, and are considered the top few percent of manufacturers. \n\nIf you're going for a regular efficiency tier1 panel (I.E. Solar World, LG, Hyundai, Trina, Hanwha, ET, JA, Yingli, Renesola) the most important aspect is generally the product warranty and then the performance warranty. Solarworld I believe has a 10yr product warranty with a 25 year performance warranty.",

"comment": "If you're space constrained, SunPower is the only way to go.  However, I wouldn't feel like I had to replace 100% of your power.  Does your power company use tiered pricing?  If so, you can generally get the cheapest option by only replacing 80% of your power, and paying the Tier 1 rate for the remaining 20%.",

"comment": "I believe that there should be solar on every rooftop in California and the southern states where possible.  However it is not truly a competitive and open Marketplace.  A German company with USA operations uses US laws to prevent competition from China ( high import tarrifs) to drive down prices for consumers citing that the Chinese companies are backed by the Chinese government while US consumers are getting state and federal tax rebates on solar panels. What's the difference?  Means high prices for us but the domestic solar companies don't care as the are using the tax rebates to make the panels appear less expensive.    Yes solar panels are expensive but so it the house and even the roof that it is sitting on.",

"comment": "Just some quick back of the napkin numbers, a $77k system (which is on the expensive side btw, but sunpower always drives a premium. You could probably get a comparable system from a local outfit around 60k), would come out to ~$1,100/mo if you took out an equity line of credit. \n\nTaking avoided electricity cost, srec revenue, and spreading out the 23,100 tax credit over the course of the repayment period, you should be generating roughly $1525/mo compared to the $1,100/mo it costs for the line of credit. So you can afford it if you can get a loan.",

There was i think one configuration where water pooled on the surface of the panel (and it was mounted flat) where cleaning was worth it, but in most cases,  periodic rain kept the panels clean enough that cleaning wasnt worth the cost.\n\nThat said, i clean mine a couple times a year but just spray them off with a hose, i dont actually scrub them.",

"comment": "It's not that they're over charging him. You've got to remember that the power company makes money from buying power at a wholesale cost and reselling it to you at a higher price. They'll pay say 5-6 cents per kWh and sell it to you at 12-18ish cents per kWh. (The cost payed and the cost charged can vary greatly but you get the idea.) If you were to start a solar farm and sell power to the power company as a business, it's reasonable to expect to get payed by the power company the wholesale cost for electricity. Net Metering  is a rule that basically says if you feed say 20 kWh into the grid during the day and draw 20 kWh from the grid at night, your net kWh should be zero and they don't charge you. Some states will pay you out at a wholesale cost at the end of the year of you don't use all that you feed in. Some states just wipe it clean and you don't get payed for it. \n\nHe has chosen to generate electricity from his solar for the grid as if he was running a business instead of using the net metering so that he can be payed at a wholesale rate for any excess. So while he gets paid if he generates more than he uses when he normally wouldn't , it also means that he has to pay retail for what he uses and only gets wholesale for what he generates. \n\nMany utilities are trying to make it this way for everyone.",

"comment": "Thanks for your answer, I guess that's why I can't find what I'm looking for.\n\nI had done an energy audit of my house, what I found was we have a constant 200w draw plus an extra 800w at intermittent intervals. (Fridge 100w on for 5 min every 20min or so etc)\n\nWhat I wanted to do was serve up to 1.2kw max load from batteries over the course of the non solar hours/night, that would require a smaller battery bank that is within budget. \nBut I didn't want to feed back any energy back to the grid from the batteries.\n\nI had in my head that there would be technology available to sense the load from the house and if under the 1.2kw use the batteries, if over that number the grid would kick in and top it up.",

A L1 charger typically provides 1,440 watts (12 amps @ 120V), so this would be just 20% of that power. In a very efficient EV, parking in this spot for 6 hours would add about 5 miles of range to the battery. Perhaps slightly less due to conversion/charging losses.",

"comment": "**Growth of photovoltaics**\n\nWorldwide growth of photovoltaics has been an exponential curve between 2007–2017. During this period of time, photovoltaics (PV), also known as solar PV, evolved from a niche market of small scale applications to a mainstream electricity source. When solar PV systems were first recognized as a promising renewable energy technology, programs, such as feed-in tariffs, were implemented by a number of governments in order to provide economic incentives for investments. For several years, growth was mainly driven by Japan and pioneering European countries.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.26",

If either answer is no, then I'd wait until after November to see where the import tariff lands. \n\nThe next big punch in the gut to watch is the status of the solar tax credit. Many think that it is safe because it is already supposed to sunset, but then again, those same thinkers though the Suniva trade case (import tariff 2.0) was laughable...",

Obviously, the power generated and sent to the outlets isn't guaranteed to power anything (aka, 11PM at night it's not gonna do much at all), but the sales guy said it would power pretty much anything except a refrigerator if it was a sunny day.",

Safety is to cover the operator as well as bystanders or anyone that might come by and touch or try to disconnect something.

"comment": "If you have a solar energy system on your house or property, it is generating SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Credits). These are the certificates that prove that a megawatt hour of energy is generated from a renewable source. Various entities are mandated to generate a certain amount of clean energy, but not always being able to do so, they're also allowed to go out to purchase SRECs from other sources. For example, some groups want to support clean energy but don't always have the room for it, so they'll go out and purchase SRECs from entities that generate them. This creates a market for purchase and sale of SRECs. At the same time, not everyone wants to go out and buy a few SRECs at a time, so SREC trade companies are created to aggregate SRECs from smaller projects and bring to the market at larger volumes that make sense for larger companies to look at purchasing and these SREC brokers would make a fee to set up the transaction. \n\nA lot of it still comes down to regulation though. If you are net metered with your utility you might have given them up to your utility as a part of the net metering agreement. Although if it's a smart group they'll know which utilities have it as part of their program to take SRECs or not. Worth taking a look into if you have a system that is generating SRECs and you have no other use for them. I'd be curious to see how much they offer you. \n\nIf you don't have a solar energy system, this message was misdirected to you.",

The SMA inverters can run an outlet during a grid outage which is nice.\n\nSince posting this, I've gotten some information about my roof. I've had a few installers come by and both of them said they can't put solar on my roof because my concrete tiles don't have any sheathing underneath it. *shrug*\n\nHowever I did get a quote from SunPower and they ranked at about $3.09/watt for a 7.8kW system. That may seem high, but all my research has found SunPower being one of the top PV systems on the market with premium components. I've even talked to their engineers about the roofing problem and they thing they can do something.",

And, They can give you the specs on the 325s... sounds like the guy you were talking to was maybe new... plus, Tesla is all about open patents so that comment doesn't even make sense with their philosophy. And as others have said, its a Panasonic panel so, yeah. I got both SunPower and Tesla to \"price match\" other companies. I know the solar tariff will hit SunPower harder as the SC325 are made in NY, I think. What was the PPW for local installers? I got the 325, but Tesla screwed up my quote and ended up honoring it, so i got a good deal. I would not pay $5k+ premium to get SP or Tesla, just my opinion. If its a $1k difference or even $2-3k difference, and the warranty is better and they are more efficient and you like them better, okay. Or, if space is an issue or it will look better on your roof having less panels. That being said, I had a very positive experience with Tesla. Super clean install. Would highly recommend and the 325 have been great for me.",

"comment": "1) I have done the analysis on MANY systems and efficiency does not make much difference at all in production.  You tried to make an argument that thermal coefficient is making a difference but then you yourself state that panasonic has a similar thermal coefficient (thus no difference). \n\n2) I was pointing out that it blows all your own argument....\n\n3) I am VERY familiar with Aurora and worked with them to improve their modeling.  They use 3D setup with option to base it on LiDAR (so little error there) they have their own model but can optionally use PVWatts model for insulation.  Aurora does all the modeling but you were cooking it down to a rule of thumb, thus dumbing it back down.\n\n&gt; My designer who's been doing Aurora designs for about a year now - and is good with the tool did a roof for me. Aurora came up with 65% (yes lots of shade) My on-site measurements came up with 61%. Not bad for a remote measurement but...\n\nSo your designer is not very good at doing Aurora.  I have trained people with the tool and our results are closer to actual production on many actual sites.  \nBTW Aurora isn't a remote measurement tool.  It is a simulation tool that uses estimates as well as remote measurement tools such as LiDAR.  LiDAR would be the remote measurement tool, google earth would be remote estimate tool.\n\n4) well so do many people and those guarantees have a huge amount of slop in them before they kick in don't they...\n\n5) I helped write a remote modeling system that modeled most whole states of the US and based a patent on it...\n\n6) I never said modeling tools had no adjustments.. what exactly is your point here?  \nStandard and high efficiency is just a simple lever to set things.  You can also set much more precisely to the module type.   BTW, LG, Panasonic and Sunpower would all fit under the high efficiency setting but all can be modeled more precisely by setting exact settings.   Aurora has sub module level modeling which is more precise.\n\n&gt; because I certainly question yours\n\nthats fine but you made the claim that Sunpower outperforms the others including panasonic due to thermal coefficient but then also stated that the thermal coefficients were similar negating your own argument.   The difference in production from sunpower to LG or panasonic is going to be small and it is clear from OPs other posts that the difference is most likely due to poor modeling as I stated.\n\nOh and to help your designer out, one of the things that trips up designers with remote sensing data in tools like Aurora, SolarDesigntool etc. is the temporal nature of the data.  The LiDAR, satellite, and street view images are all from different times sometimes decade or so apart.   Judge elevations with the most recent data and look for growth differences between sets.   Basing your model on LiDAR data might be the most accurate remote sensing data but only if you are building the array in the past.",

"comment": "&gt;But what’s the political agenda? Who benefits from it?\n\nI literally just outlined it. Really? Who benefits from it? The people in charge, the self-proclaimed experts who increase their social influence and financial gain from it. How can you really ask such a naive question? The same way there are those who benefit from denying climate change, there are those who benefit equally from promoting it.\n\n&gt;There’s a a reasonable solution that satisfies both extremes, i.e. incentives, subsidies, tax breaks, etc.\n\nThe reasonable solution is *already happening* \\- renewables are already outpacing fossil fuels in terms of subsidies and growth the world over, and advancements are made in the field every day via taxpayer dollars. Power utilities are largely investing in solar and wind and battery storage versus fossil fuels wherever possible. Yet the hyperbole continues to build around the \"climate crisis\", with talking heads being splayed all over the news to link every disaster the world over to a conversation about more renewable energy, and making increasingly ridiculous predictions about the future, with zero evidence.\n\nThe majority of redditors have been spam fed so much nonsense in this coordinated effort, that a majority of them actually believe that the world will be destroyed if we don't stop emitting CO2 in 12 years, a hypothesis literally no major scientfic power agrees with. (see IPCC reports if you don't believe me) - this is a disinformation campaign, led by an equal mix of well meaning but misinformed people, and immoral profiteers trying to redirect wealth from the fossil fuel industry into their own pockets via lies and alarmism, using stooges like Greta Thunberg and a swath of gullible hollywood celebrities to be their spokespeople and exert influence on people. [Meanwhile, their completely fabricated bullshit is directly linked to spikes in  anxiety, depression, and suicides,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5984805/) and just [a general worsening of mental health](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/03/mental-health-climate.pdf). This is all particularly prevalent among teenagers, who are being told by ignorant, politically motivated liars that if they don't sell out their prosperity to support the mitigation of Climate change, that we'll all be dead within their lifetimes, [a claim which is in no way supported or legitimized by any scientific body.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/12/04/why-climate-alarmism-hurts-us-all/#5b976a3836d8)",

"comment": "No problem.\nWell, being VIC, you can start with your mums electricity distributor (website) and her meter and NMI number (from her bill) and see what sort of system (inverter) size and export limit you have. This seems to vary dramatically, some people can’t even export electricity, and will firmly set some design parameters.\n\nFor quotes, don’t worry, even if rural, installers will travel, but you may not get site visits for quotes, but if you have a simple roof with no shading, that may not be a big problem.\n\nThere are endless debates about premium vs mid vs cheap for components and such, and there are strengths of many different arguments. I found upper mid level stuff to be the most logical.\n\nIf you have no shading, then you probably don’t need optimisers or micro-inverters and can keep it relatively simple. Max your panels/system size, and a simple quality string inverter, most likely. Payback time even with fairly lousy feed in tariffs are fairly easy to calculate. \n\nI am going a fairly complicated system with full optimisers, hybrid inverter, smart functionality, and panel level monitoring. I feel I can make use of all this stuff (all the smart stuff can show us when we are exporting and buying power and help us change our consumption patterns and habits, to use more of our power when we are in surplus, and the panel level monitoring allows us and our installer to actually see what each panel is doing and potentially see issues and make use of the product warranties without the need for site visits and testing- plus I enjoy the detail), but for many all this stuff would be superfluous complication, a waste of money, and just more things to go wrong. \n\nIf your mum has a smart meter already you can also go through your distributor or retailer to get a pile of data on how much and when your mum uses power- this can really help and a decent installer can take that file of data and look at it and use it to size and design a system actually better suited to your mums consumption.\n\nIf you haven’t looked already, whirlpool is a pretty decent place to research for Australian solar, and products.\n\nAside from just researching and calling around, I also put in my details at solarquotes.com.au which then farms your details out to installers who service your area who will then call and quote for you. Most of the calls and quotes I got were OK, one was shonky and pushy as hell.\n\nIt is a bit of a minefield, so be ready to deep dive and help your mum. That is why going with someone you have developed some trust with is so important.\n\nThe federal STC rebate seems to recalculate daily, so don’t worry about that, and the VIC rebate seems to change on an annual basis, and if I was told correctly it seems to be in decline, so waiting till next year may net you a slightly smaller rebate.\n\nI didn’t go with any of those ‘solarquotes’ but I’m glad I got them, I ended up going with a very local company who was recommended by a colleague and who I got a good feeling from and who wanted to install,the relatively new system I was interested in.\n\nGood luck.",

"comment": "I honestly can't think of any advantage, outside of separating the systems completely. e.g. 1 on house 1 on shop.. Which is the only reason I wouldn't stack them, to completely isolate them from each other including their own battery banks..\n\nWithout stacking them, you wouldn't run them into the same breaker panel, to use my above example one would power your house panel the other your shop panel.. In theory you could use the \"Same\" solar array and battery bank but, I have never seen it done that way. A separate system is a separate system..\n\nThe Sol-ARk 12kW is solar input, and can handle a max of 12kW between AC loads and Battery charging, but the max AC output is 8kW off-grid, meaning if you have enough sun and max AC load it is still pushing 4kW into the batteries..\n\nUsing your example of 2 50A 240V circuits however, would break down to 4 25A 120V circuits...It isn't really how that works though a circuit breaker isn't sized to protect the load, it is sized to protect the wire. The circuit breaker your TV is on is probably a 20A, doesn't mean that circuit is using 20A just that it can... It isn't a 1:1 comparison..\n\nI think it would be opinion based largely.. but any time I can use same manufacturer to allow for communication between EVERYTHING I do... The nice thing about Sol-Ark 12kW, it supports a lot of Lithium batteries for communication with the BMS, unlike say a Outback Radian..",

"comment": "That's just absolutely wrong.\n\nMore seriously - look, you seem to be a reasonable person, who has little invested in nuclear electricity generation, and seem to care about climate change. Good. But the reality is, we don't have time for new, ridiculously expensive, slow-to-build nuclear plants. It takes what, more than a decade to build one in the 21st century? And which nuclear plant built in recent years was remotely on time or on budget?\n\nMy main objection is the real cost and opportunity cost of nuclear. The opportunity cost being, that subsidies and support for nuclear displaces funds meant for renewables. The rest of the points are interesting to discuss, but largely irrelevant because of this main objection.\n\nTLDR - Nuclear is dead, let it die.\n\nHere are the rest of the points:\n\n1.The risks of radiation from an accident relating to the reactor or the waste, is not inconsequential, and is not 0%. Therefore, there WILL be an accident in the future, and due to larger scales in modern times, it will be largely felt on this planet.\n\n2. the risks of proliferation (plutonium from nuclear plants for military purposes); \n\n3.the risk of radiation from the storage of nuclear waste; The third risk of radiation from nuclear waste is even greater because it will be passed on to future generations, who will not be able to consume the nuclear power we produce today but will be forced to deal with our waste. Even when all of our nuclear fission plants have been shut down globally, mankind will have to protect its repositories of spent nuclear fuel rods for up to 100,000 years.\n\n4. the limited availability of uranium resources;\n\n5. If we have viable alternatives, then we should rather use them. Renewables are viable.\n\n6. Nuclear, and any baseload is largely incompatible with high penetration of renewables.\n\n7. Modern nuclear, in practice, has been tremendously expensive, this in stark contrast to its theoretical cost, which should indeed be lower. The cost, with nuclear being unbankable at the moment – i.e. banks will not finance the construction of new nuclear plants because the cost is too high in comparison to renewables. All plants currently on the drawing board in Western countries have massive state support – the new Hinkley Point nuclear plant approved in the UK is to have feed-in tariffs higher than what Germany pays for solar power in addition to state guarantees for bank loans; \n\n8. This means, that in practice, despite best intentions, renewables are in fact cheaper.\n\n9. Government taxpayers do not want to be liable anymore for this expensive and risky energy.\n\n10. NIMBY don't want a nuclear fission reactor in their backyards.\n\nLet nuclear die.",

After 12 years, you'll have about 15k in equity in your solar panels and they'll be paid off. \n\nIt's not bad of an investment for putting nothing down.\n\nThink if it like an investment. You are putting down $25 per month to receive $50-100 in the future. Every month.",

We are also getting close to the point where rooftop solar is a touch cheaper than utility electric.  I don't think anyone is arguing those points.\n\nThe point that is being argued is at which point is the need for the subsidy no longer needed.  What's the balance between 'free ride' - as they say - and our renewable energy goals?  Is this served well with net metering?\n\nMyself, I have no problem with wholesale reimbursement.  Net metering is not the reason I bough solar.  I bought solar because I think it's cool, looks neat, and gives me a good feeling that my luxury of having a heated pool isn't contributing to my carbon footprint.  Might buy an electric car at some point...when they mature a bit more.\n\nAnd were it just my solar panels, my system cost would be a touch less than utility electric.  With my batteries it's a different story - but that's an added feature, too.",

So they normally have 3 per module. This is why you see power step down on 1/3rds as a panel is partially shaded. \n\nMicroinverters can help mitigate the impacts but do not solve this problem.

My roof still has another decade or more of life left in it, but is composed of old composite synthetic spanish tiles.  They are very fragile and you can't walk on the roof.  So \"add solar\" also means getting a new roof.  Which is going to greatly add to the cost.  And if I'm going to be spending that much anyway, I need the payback period to be reasonable (under 10 years).\n\nSimply _reducing_ my current SDG&amp;E bill (say, cutting it in half) isn't enough.  I need to completely _eliminate_ my bill if I want to have any hope of making a solar+battery system worth it.\n\nAnother alternative I've considered is skipping the solar part and just adding a battery and running the house off of that battery during peak hours, and charging it during super-off-peak (car charging) hours.  But the models I've run in this situation don't result in much reduction of my bill (on the order of $50-100/mo or so) and so this limits me even more in what I can buy.\n\nMaybe I just need to wait until V2H technology is more mature, and have my EV double as the \"big battery\" for the house.  That's ~100kWh and would almost certainly be enough to run everything in the house (except perhaps an air conditioner) for the entire day aside from the super-off-peak times whenn I'd be recharging the car.",

Your only challenge will be if your Envoy is not located at your electrical panel, in which case you've got to run the CT wire between them, which would have been easily done when the solar installers did the exact same for the solar power carrying wire.\n\nIf the Envoy is conveniently located at the panel it is a piece of cake.  Just get your clamp directions correct and P1, L1, C1 phases all aligned and you are done.",

"comment": "I'm in Chicago suburbs, about to start ~9.6kW DC project.\n\nMy Sunpower conversation was not as great as others and the fact that they reduce your system cost by SREC (and reduce you SREC by their tax liability) made their system worse since it lowered the amount eligible for tax credit. In other words, both a lower SREC and a lower federal tax credit. Even after factoring in my income taxes on the SREC, that setup was still worse. On top of the fact that the Sunpower panels were more expensive per kWh produced... I got sold on REC panels that have the same degradation warranty as Sunpower. Maybe the Sunpower panels really are better, but if so the margin seems very thin. \n\nI did energysage, but I wasn't all that impressed with what turned up. Maybe just my situation (need to use detached garage and house for solar), but all the quotes were pretty jacked up and I had to talk with everyone that responded to discuss what I wanted and go through their pitch. It is a nice tool for discovering well rated installers though. \n\nMy best conversations in alphabetical order were with Certasun, RX Sun/Fresh Coast Solar, and Solar Power Midwest.",

"comment": "Is it really any surprise?  From the Guardian about a month ago:\n\n*emissions from SUVs in 2023 made up 20% of the global increase in CO2, making the vehicles a major cause of the intensifying climate crisis. If SUVs were a country, the IEA said, they would be the world’s fifth-largest emitter of CO2, ahead of the national emissions of both Japan and Germany.*\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/28/global-sales-of-polluting-suvs-hit-record-high-in-2023-data-shows](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/28/global-sales-of-polluting-suvs-hit-record-high-in-2023-data-shows)\n\nYou'll never have a reduction in oil production/consumption when people not only keep buying oversized vehicles that require the most fuel to keep on the road, but keep buying them in increasing numbers.  \n\nWhen you look at the average price of an SUV in a country like the US, around $47k for all SUVs, a homeowner could purchase a Honda Accord (starts at $28k) and put solar panels on their home (average installation price $22k for 11 kw system) for about the same money.  And they'll save money on the gas they use because they'll require far less.  \n\nLuxury/crossover SUVs average $70k and these are still being purchased as well, so every homeowner who buys one could get an EV (average price $54k) and solar panels to charge it (again, $22k) for about the same amount of money.\n\nThat doesn't even address our pickup addiction either.\n\n[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g60385784/bestselling-cars-2024/](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g60385784/bestselling-cars-2024/)\n\nAs u/DamonFields said, humans are insane.",

"comment": "I purchased a home in 2021 with a Solar Edge system already installed.  These are the first solar panels I've ever owned. I haven't had a problem with the system; I set up the monitoring dashboard without issue and pretty much ignore it until I receive alerts that something is wrong.\n\nOver the years, I will occasionally get an alert that the inverter is no longer communicating with the servers.  Most of those issues just fix itself.  There have been a few times where I had to restart the receiver that is hardwired to my home router.\n\nHowever, for the past month I have had constant issues with it.  I've restarted the SE receiver and restarted my home router but nothing's improved.  I checked the inverter status, which has a 'green' light which I assume means it is working.  \n\nUnfortunately, there's not much I can do RIGHT NOW to troubleshoot this issue.  I've been away from my home since these issues started, and my spouse is not very technical, so I can pretty much just ask her to check connections, unplug/replug things, and observe what the lights are doing.  \n\nSo I'm turning to you all to verify whether or not you think this is a networking issue or some other issue.  I attached some images which include everything I know about these issues.  The one problem i don't understand is why the trouble tickets keep opening/closing themselves, and why the issues change from \"inverter\" problems to \"optimizer\" problems.  I assume they are both symptoms of a bad network connection...but I wanted to see if you all think that assumption is wrong.",

"comment": "Everything other than the EG4 cloud app is local that is shown (honestly everything I have in my house is now essentially local so if any company goes south, I'm not screwed).  Inverter is not incorporated into the battery with EG4 like it is in PW so if the inverter goes bad it's just the inverter that gets swapped out (it's much more modular in that regard).  Inverter also has a 10 year warranty.  In your setup you would likely need two inverters given the size of your array, similar to my setup.  Sure, I can't be tech support but I can give you some general ideas and point you in the right direction.  There is some DIY with this setup.  I find that part kinda fun but others may think of it as a headache.  I also think I saw that you were looking for individual array data to know production from individual solar panels.  If your installer uses Tigo rapid shut off/monitor you can do that (https://signaturesolar.com/tigo-15a-700w-1500v-ul-1000v-iec-0-12-1-2m-cable-mc4-ts4-a-s/).  I opted to just go with rapid shut off (this is also a requirement in some areas now).  Rapid shut off essentially cuts the power from the panels in the event of an emergency.  The 18kPV already has this included but you need to have it at the level of the panels for it to work.",

When I was shopping around, I compared prices and specs on a few solar comparison sites and ended up going with a solid mid-range option that wasn’t too flashy but got the job done. \n\nIt’s worth doing your homework and maybe even talking to other homeowners who’ve installed these systems to get real-world feedback. It’s all about balancing cost and functionality for your needs.",

"comment": "Erik Marcus's had a nice response to this article on his blog on vegan.com:\n\nInteresting Businessweek article titled, “The Rise of the Power Vegans.” The story looks at a number of A-list people in the business world, and reports on why they took up vegan eating.\n\nVegas tycoon Steve Wynn might have the most interesting story of the bunch. After seeing the film Eating, he switched overnight to an oil-free vegan diet. He then bought 10,000 copies of the film so that every single one of his casinos’ employees could see it. And then he contacted the head chefs at every one of his properties and told them to revamp their menus by adding extensive vegan options.\n\nOne shared characteristic of business moguls is that, because of their personality type, they don’t do anything halfway. And that tendency applies to how they approach veganism.\n\nThe article has a few missteps (such as calling the diet expensive,) and every other paragraph says something at least vaguely dickish. But this is overall a profoundly important piece, one that will likely appeal strongly to Businessweek’s readers. And the conclusion is an implicit challenge to readers to step up and take control of their eating:\n\n\"And herein lies veganism’s appeal to moguls: It affords them the opportunity to control their own health with the same manic id with which they control everything else.\"\n\nThis piece is as clear an indication as any that vegan eating is gaining critical mass within society. Five or ten years ago, the only reason a publication like Businessweek would have mentioned veganism would have been to make a sneering reference toward ineffective hippies. And now that same publication has all but declared veganism the official diet of masters of the universe.",

"comment": "Ah, gotcha. Well, whatever fits in your cooler should last the whole week, no? And if you buy frozen vegetables, they'll last even longer.\n\nBut it sounds like dehydrated foods might be a good bet if you want some veggies. They're a lot easier to carry, anyhow. Any outfitter should have some just-add-water stuff that's vegan.\n\nAnd more stuff along the \"pantry cooking\" lines:\n\nMix up some flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar, and you can add water to it to make pancakes. Or just buy a vegan pancake mix. Have it with oatmeal with raisins and cinnamon.\n\nPut some dried mushrooms, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and whatever dried herbs you like in the pot. Just add enough water to cover it and a touch of oil or Earth Balance and cook it down until it's mostly dry. It'll approximate sauteed fresh mushrooms.\n\n[Mori-Nu extra-firm silken tofu](http://www.morinu.com/products/products_detail.aspx?id=3) doesn't need to be refrigerated and can be sliced up or crushed by hand and used in so many different recipes as a source of protein. Or just throw a little oil or Earth Balance in the pot and fry up the pieces of tofu with your favorite seasoned salt or spice mix on top. Boil some rice or quinoa to go with it (incidentally, quinoa is more nutritious than rice, can be used in similar ways, and is even easier to cook if you buy pre-rinsed quinoa).\n\nPeanut butter and jelly sandwiches are always good. When camping I use tortillas instead of bread because they are easier to carry, won't get smushed, and last longer before spoiling (especially if you buy the cheap ones that aren't refrigerated in the supermarket). It's kind of ghetto, but Smucker's even makes [jelly-like product in a squeeze bottle](http://www.smucker.com/products/ProductDetail.aspx?groupId=1&amp;categoryId=260&amp;flavorId=381) with a narrow slit as an opening so it's perfect for this purpose.",

Beginning veganism can be very daunting, and while the list isn't neccessarily recommending that these items equal a healthy vegan diet, I think that it is a nice way for people to still enjoy some of their old favourites without feeling as though veganism makes everything except for fruit, veg and nuts off limits ;) I'm quite new to veganism myself, and am always happily surprised when I find that something I have always liked, is actually vegan.",

I became a vegan for ethical reasons, and really was not concerned about \"benefits.\" I mainly was concerned about getting enough iron and B12. The anecdotal things I noticed after going vegan were 1)more energy. I have never been a morning person, but now am perfectly fine on 6-7hours of sleep. I wake up \"ready-to-go.\" No more grogginess. 2)Decreased stress. This sounds weird, but my husband and I both noticed this, and after talking to a number of vegans, so far all agree. Stress hormones in our meat/dairy perhaps? 3) I finally have the body I want to have. I have always eaten healthily and exercised, never weighed more than 125 lb but could never get that \"flat stomach.\" Veganism solved that problem. 4)Acne=gone. 5) My husband has eczema which has always been made worse by soy and peanut butter. One month after cutting out dairy, his soy allergy disappeared. One year after becoming vegan, his peanut allergy disappeared also. 5) I got third place overall in a duathlon (my first race ever). I guess this may not have happened just because I became vegan, but my point is that as a vegan, I performed very well. Perhaps not the outcome that some would expect! Hope this helps!",

Once you start losing weight, not only does it get easier as you lose more, but once you start seeing the changes, you are inspired to do more. I had no idea I would lose weight, it just happened. Obviously, time has passed and I'm getting older so a bit has come back, but I'm no where near the weight I was before veganism.",

I'm just going to end up repeating myself because you've failed to think about this beyond the surface level and think about what things determine if someone is vegan or not *over time.* That last part is the part you are missing. Let's say someone who doesn't use any animal products eats a steak, then their next meal is vegan, then their next one is steak again. Were they vegan between those meals? Are you barred from being a vegan forever because you indulge once? \n\nYou are under some massive assumptions about what OP is proposing and think it would be \"eat meat once a month\" or something that is scheduled when that's clearly not what they're talking about. I understand that it's easier for you to disregard what OP is saying by thinking about it that way but that's not what is going on here at all. Think outside of a schedule. Think about human beings and how they aren't perfect.",

I feel like we're at very beginning of a big cultural change in favor of non-human animal rights which will takes centuries... kind of like the beginnings of abolishing human slavery in European Renaissance perhaps. There were just a few people supporting what would take centuries to manifest (~2% of Americans are vegan, for example.) To go from 2% to a majority capable of enacting of ban in varying developed nations doesn't look to me like a 100 year process. We've got to let all the baby boomers &amp; their old fashioned ways die, &amp; then there is generation X, &amp; then there are we millenials... maybe 12% of millenials are vegetarian or vegan I think. The next generation might be, what, 15%? 20% in 2050? Then *after* that, the next generation might be 30% vegan, but it might be 20% still in 2070... then *after that* in 2090 it might be 30% vegan, but again, we don't know. To get to 70% vegan given the kind of gaps in veganism we see between baby boomers, gen x, &amp; millenials it might take 100 years (just for the youngest generation, while the older ones are still pulling the political strings.) That might not be enough to ban animal agriculture, but just roll it back a lot &amp; make it less unethical... hey, hopefully my 1000 year guess is wrong. Hopefully it will happen tomorrow, but I would expect a few centuries; I'm just going out of limb, pulling numbers of thin air here of course.",

"comment": "Have lived in an unfriendly city. If it's large enough to have 2 or 3 chain grocery stores, and you can cook, you're usually in luck. If you search, you can find tofu, some tofurky, morningstar or gardein, even daiya and earth balance.. Even if vegan items are unheard of, some small towns have at least 1 Chinese restaurant where you can get a veggie fix. You can always ask for no chicken broth (and don't order anything deep fried) and get the veggie dishes. I would keep motivation by not letting it get in the way of every day things. I'd always make sure I ate before going somewhere, had a backup snack, or brought something to gatherings. (Nobody can argue with your veganism if the food is good!) I wouldn't mention it unless someone asked. That way, people would know me for a bit first before judging me. Plus, you'd be surprised. A lot of chain restaurants have obscure options where you can still get a vegan snack or meal other than salad. Even really small towns often have a subway. So, you can still go places with people and \"fit in\". Another thing that made it easier was having a supportive partner. My partner agreed that it would be too much to put meat in the fridge.",

I find that dairy products were pretty easy to replace with things like cashew, soy, and almond milk, home made cashew cheeses, chao cheese or follow your heart cheese, and So Delicious yogurts. The hardest thing is avoiding processed food with bits of whey or casein in them, but that's not that important, especially when starting out. Feel free to PM me or make a new post if you have any questions :)",

"comment": "&gt; To me it seems that dairy supports all of cattle farming, so i don't get why veal is called out by itself.\n\nVeal is called out because the dairy industry produces unique conditions in which veal production makes sense. That is, dairy inherently produces excess calves ([since the most profitable dairy production system involves continual births](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/4599yz/ysk_cows_only_produce_milk_after_giving_birth/czwgv8k)), and dairy breeds are specialized to produce milk rather than mass. So, when compared to specialized beef breeds, dairy calves are less profitable to raise for beef, and therefore veal production provides the highest profit potential (given there is demand for veal).\n\nTo put that simply, dairy can exist without veal, but veal is not likely to exist without dairy.\n\n&gt; i think veal alone is an incomplete and weak argument against dairy.\n\nIt is in the United States for sure ([see my other reply to your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4hmz8c/a_question_for_lurking_vegetarians/d2rjhxy)).",

You will have to factor in LEDCs where nutrition and food choice is limited. In DCs though, once percentages become like 75-25, peer pressure will kick in and meat consumption might fall rapidly. I doubt it wil ever be eradicated though or made a law. There will always be a counter arguement such as God saying animals are for man to eat.\n\nEDIT: People will always be wary about meat substitutes too. Same for vaccines and GMOs even if it may be irrational. Personally I dont eat meat subs. Every vegetarian I know complains about meat subs when given in school meals.",

This isn't always going to be possible, but you should try to make it something that makes others' lives less inconvenient, not more, however you can.  \n\nIf your dad is having trouble cooking these meals for you, start learning how to cook for yourself, perhaps even taking over dinner-making responsibilities once or a few times a week.  \n\nIf you offer to cook for yourself some of the time, maybe even working up to cooking for yourself (and anyone in the family who wants to try it) all the time, your dad has to cook separate meals less, your family gets exposed to veganism, and you can start learning a skill and developing a habit that will serve you well for the rest of your life (it can include developing important organizational skills as well, like researching and planning nutrition, or making and sticking to a [budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/7kno9b/plantbased_january/drhgxxe/)).  It's win-win-win.  If you don't think your dad will be receptive to \"veganism\", frame it in those other sorts of terms.  You're doing this because you want to learn about health, because you want to learn about personal budgeting, and learn cooking skills (these are all important things to learn, and hopefully you are really interested in them as well).",

You said earlier that veganism includes what is possible and practical. Therefore there is a loophole in the rules of veganism that allow you to deviate if your diet is not possible and practical. Idk about you but to me that’s having your cake and eating it too. \n\nSo back to my question..what about insects? Where do vegans stand on insects? It seems contradictory to me to say on one hand all living things should be preserved but hey if my house has termites those are okay to exterminate. You can’t have it both ways.",

"comment": "To be fair, I started on that sub when I first joined reddit, and it did help me question a lot of how and why the environment was screwed up. Got me interested in flexitarianism for the environment and r/vegetarian, and somehow I found Earthlings later and got in this sub eventually. Even with that level of censorship in r/environment, it for sure planted a seed that made me curious. There are people in that sub saying 'hey, it's not the straws floating on the top of the water killing us all...straws just float,'. Then you hear the 'it's the corps' fault,' but you wonder what they make, and wonder if you buy those products... and every now and then, someone posts that 'fishing nets are like 20% of the debris in the ocean'... So, it helps in that way. Some people can get past that 'blame everyone but me' mentality. Just lots of exposure. Plus, the average redditer is like 14, right? So, lots of teens and college peeps on here with no world experience yet. Or old people like me that just take a ton of exposure to learn anything.  \n\n\nAnd going with that, not many people can understand the subsidies in dairy making their mass produced, industrial level milk chocolate bars as an affordable purchase, whereas a mass-produced vegan bar would essentially cost 70% less (in a real world, non subsidized economy). Our taxes pay to keep those candy bars and McDonald's burgers as cheap as they are. And so, we still pay for it. But tell that to the average redditor and their heads will explode...  \n Still, would be nice if we could just teach the entire world in like an hour that animal agriculture is destroying the planet and we can easily shift to plants, don't panic, etc. Would be nice to be able to flip the world with a switch. Even with the massive reach of the internet, things just takes forever.",

Vinh Loi Tofu is a fantastic vegan Vietnamese place and they have two locations, one in Cerri (LA County but pretty far south) and I think Reseda, which is in the Valley. Their pho is also bomb. The owner is very kind and always remembers my son. \n\nSaigon Vegan in Garden Grove has banh mi I think. Their other offerings are fantastic. \n\nThien Dang, also in G.G., I’ve had their banh mi and loved it, plus they have a little grocery with vegan offerings you don’t really see elsewhere.",

You would not find a dish with meat anywhere to be seen, they would very clearly label everything so you wouldn't eat something with dairy if it was only vegetarian. I also attended a 7th day grade school and high school, the grade school asked parents not to send meat in kids lunches and at high school, only vegan or vegetarian foods were offered, it was a boarding school so all the students ate that way. There was even once huge drama in grade school because some parents tried to break the rules and other parents tried to get the kids expelled for having ham sandwiches. Most Seventh Day Adventist that I know considered themselves Republicans or Independent, they are also vegan/vegetarian for health and moral reasons, but they stay out of politics so you don't often hear them voicing their beliefs.",

"comment": "Welcome!!! We're here for you. The animals thank you - every time you choose not to have them killed or milked. I have one daughter who decided to go vegan and just did it. I have another that just couldn't eat cows or pigs anymore but still got chicken on her chipotle bowl. This is over the course of 6 months or so. I'm so happy that she has decided to not have chickens killed for her food. She orders sofritas on the side and guac instead of sour cream. She was honest and said she missed the sour cream. I told her she may miss some things but the peace of mind will overrule it soon. She now chooses on her own to order vegan things with friends and had a daiya pizza for dinner. It wasn't the same as a calf milk pizza but she really liked it and was happy that she wasn't a part of taking baby cows from their mamas. The sacrifice is totally doable for  her now. I'm so happy and proud. So if it take you overnight or a few months or if you eat some animal in a moment of weakness, brush yourself off and get back in here. It is totally worth it &lt;3",

You've already argued the point for me that \"B12 is only hard to come by in our modern society\" - Yet you seem to have ignored how that is a major problem.\n\nWhat do you do if you want to go vegan, but don't want to have to (or can't?) buy supplements? And don't want to risk contracting water borne diseases? Washing foods is sanitary. \n\nTelling people: \"Hi, here's this great diet, but you'll have to buy supplements\" - That's a hard sell. Not for me because I earn more than $100/month. But it's out of reach for a lot of people.\n\n&gt;In the old days, people also had a stronger immune system, and the ones who didn’t were already dead\n\nAhh.... That's some interesting logic. So it's okay that people just dropped dead from dirty foods? \n\n&gt;the converting efficiency depends on the omega ratios, which in ancient times used to be much more balanced than today. You can get that too if you eat a whole foods plant based diet with very little oils or processed foods\n\nYet most vegans today suffer DHA deficiencies - Even with all the readily available information brought by the internet. \n\n\n&gt;And you didn’t need any algal supplements to get DHA/EPA directly: look at Japan’s diet rich in algae.\n\nWell yeah, you don't need supplements if you can just get the thing the supplements are derived from... \n\nConsidering very few cultures eat seaweed regularly... It's a valid concern. Otherwise Vegans should have no issue if they just focused on seaweed - But they don't.",
