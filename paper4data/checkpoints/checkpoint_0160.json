"comment": "&gt;...and if more people on your side of the issue can admit that perhaps we'll get somewhere.\n\nAre you suggesting that the pro-nuclear crowd wants *no* regulation?  That isn't consistent with what I have observed.\n\n&gt;Yes, but that 1/3 of the day is highly coincident with the peak demand for electricity...\n\nCorrect.  That's why nuclear for base load and solar for peak load is a good match.\n\n&gt;The fact that solar produces power precisely when we need it...\n\nLet's be clear.  The peak is about 1.5 times the base load, so even if solar exactly match the demand curve, it can only be a minority player, and that doesn't even account for a secondary system for cloudy days.\n\n&gt;But I think you're overestimating the cost of storage - it's really not that hard of a problem to solve.\n\nI disagree.  I've been trying to make a big solar project work for an off-grid community for five years now, and the cost of storage far outweighs the cost of solar generation.  It is still cheaper, at present, to use diesel generators.\n\n&gt;Large scale solar thermal, in particular, can fairly easily store energy as heat in the fluid medium (such as molten salt) for later generation...\n\nYes, I know, but now you are comparing solar thermal with PV, and you have to scale solar thermal very large before it is as efficient as PV.  Once you get large enough, you still have a great deal of energy loss when converting from molten salt to electricity.  You state that the only additional cost is a storage tank,  but that is not true.  A portion of the energy that would have generated electricity for peak load must then be diverted to heating the salt, and storing highly corrosive molten salt is not as simple as adding a storage tank.\n\n&gt;Beyond that there are several storage strategies already in use and being further developed presently, which should be quite mature by the time we have enough solar production to require storage.\n\nThose storage strategies are nothing new and have shown little improvement over their decades' long lives.  One of the best is still pumped hydro, and the cost of those systems isn't moving.  Compressed gas storage is much for inefficient due to the heating of gasses during compression and the energy loss while compressed gasses cool.  The cheapest battery storage for static applications is still lead-acid batteries, a technology well over 100 years old.  There are more approaches, but none are even as cheap as these three at present.\n\n&gt;One such strategy may even make use of EVs for distributed storage/generation in the not too distant future.\n\nThis was discussed in /r/science recently.  There was some... reluctance to believe that EV owners would be cool with doubling their charge/discharge cycle count.\n\n&gt;I think there's great potential there to start with a few electrified highways between cities\n\nI agree.  The induction system should not add too much additional weight or cost to the car, and you could theoretically charge your battery while you drive.\n\n&gt;...get off the ground (or into the ground, as it were.)\n\n:-)\n\n&gt;Yes, and that's why I agree CNG is a good short term solution, but we still need something else for the long term.\n\nSkyTran, bro!\n\n&gt;The idea of this post seems to belie your idea that used EVs are too expensive.\n\n???  I'm not sure how.  I can buy a used ICE car for half the price of a new ICE car and still have 100,000 miles of use.  I don't think the same is true of an EV which would need a new battery pack before that additional 100,000 miles would be reached.  \n\n&gt;...that not a single Leaf buyer I'm aware of would ever even consider buying the Versa against the Leaf.\n\nI don't know that such would be true of the public at large.  Leaf owners probably represent the portion of the population that are first movers.  $10k Hyundai's are closer to what most of the public can afford to buy.  If EVs cannot compete at the low end, then they are just another product for the relatively well-to-do.\n\nI thought this comment would be shorter since I am trying to get this conversation back to a reasonable brevity, but oh well.",

"comment": "Don't get me wrong - I'm not arguing for some shady conspiracy; I'm only pointing out that it's natural for the major automakers - who make all their profits from a completely different type of car - to approach the EV market with trepidation. While they might not be out to \"kill the electric car\" (anymore at least), they certainly wouldn't be bothered too much if EVs just went away. Of course I'm using \"they\" here when different automakers have varying approaches to EVs, but you get the idea.\n\nAnd I also don't at all mean to imply that you're not dedicated to what you do - I only question the decision-making of those at the top. And it's not even that I'm saying that decision-making is \"wrong\" - your CEO is charged with maximizing short-term profits, and that's what he must do. I'm merely pointing out the fact that Tesla is a company founded and run with the sole purpose of making EVs while the majors were founded and run with the sole purpose of making ICEVs, and just now are \"dabbling\" in EVs. This advantage on Tesla's behalf is seemingly insurmountable.\n\n&gt;we have only seen one generation of EVs from the major automakers so far\n\nTo the contrary, nearly every major automaker has had significant experience with EVs and hybrids since long before Tesla came along. In the 90s we had the EV-1, Rav4-EV, Honda Plus, Nissan Altra, Ranger EV, and so on. The difference is the majors were all happy to pull the plug on their EV programs and pretend as if they never even existed, while Tesla went from nothing to a 300-mile EV that can drive cross country without inordinate charge time in less than 10 years.",

Get those purchase rebates back up, and throw in a Level 2 EVSE with every car. Increasing fines on car makers doesn't make consumers want to buy more of their cars. One could argue that you can increase the fines to the point they discount EVs well below production cost, but the fact that used Leafs are listing for just $8500 and not moving off lots quickly points to the problem not being just price.",

GM spent over $1bn on the EV1 and barely managed to put a thousand cars on the road, even with celebrity endorsement on major talk shows. Despite the fact that GM does not consider the EV1 program a failure, it was widely criticized as being one by the same media outlets that shower current EVs with praise (even though some of them are comparable to the EV1). With that little interest from the market, what business sense did it make to produce an EV until recently?\n\nThey'll be able to make software improvements (limited by existing hardware) to their existing line-up or do a life-cycle update (which usually amounts to a facelift and minor mechanical changes), beyond that any major improvements would have to wait until a new model (or generation) was released. If they're developing another car or new generation of car then it would likely come out around 2020 at this point. Barring any major breakthrough in battery or supporting technology, it's still likely to be comparable to anything that other manufacturers are producing.",

Solarcity's stock value fell by over 50% from their average 2015 price by the time of the Tesla merger in November.\n\nFrom what I heard, NRG investors and board members were spooked by the lack of profit from their Home Solar division, and fired the old CEO back at the start of 2016 over it. \n\nI'm afraid that the home solar industry has peaked, at least in its current form, for the next few years. Tesla's new solar roofs may be a promising new direction for the industry, since they look a lot nicer than the current solar panels on roofs.",

If you don't work for Tesla and you don't own a Tesla, there are already about 15k -20k people ahead of you. Unless you are on the west coast and buying a Ludicrous Performance version, you most likely will not be in the first 30k. \n\nI am more hopeful on reliability because this is the third design, it will incorporate years of experience from the Model S and X. \n\nIn terms of price, your fears of falling value for short range EV's are well founded, since I3, Leaf, Kia and eGolf already loose a lot of value in a couple years (Far more than the tax credits would allow). \n\nSo you are left holding out as long as you can for any 200 mile car. My bet is when you see how far ahead the Tesla Model 3 is, you will have a hard time saying no. Consider 250 mile range, maybe 350kWhr charging, a heads up display worthy of a video game and a truely self driving car. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be at the front of a revolution.",

"comment": "I think the battery economics might buck the trend regarding SUVs/CUVs.\n\nWhile gas powered CUVs are bigger than cars, they don't cost that much more to make - they're cost comparable to similarly optioned out sedans.  The extra material to make a taller cabin and the truck tires doesn't cost all that much.\n\nHowever, the gas milage is a lot worse because they're bigger, heavier, less aerodynamic.  When you start looking at EVs, all of a sudden those things become important, because a big car means less range and/or more battery.  As a result, the cost gap between sedans and SUVs will have to increase to get the same range.\n\nI have a feeling a lot of people who buy these CUVs/SUVs only look at the monthly payment of the car, but don't really take into consideration the higher operating costs or gas milage.  So what will happen is the bigger EVs will have a lot bigger monthly payment, and people will end up opting for the smaller monthly payment.",

That means that at peak, you're actually adding 495 miles/hour of range by charging. So even though you're charging 20 % slower, you're adding 20 % more range because of higher efficiency!\n\nDo note that according to this tests, the e-tron charges at 150 kWh all the way up to 80 %, whereas the Model 3 charge speed slows down rapidly above 50 %, which is a solid advantage for the e-tron.",

"comment": "Yep. To say a bit more:\n\nActually I think a good analogy is a test in a class. Suppose a class takes their final exam. Alice gets 98%, Bob gets 96%; they are the two highest scores in the class. Does Alice know more of the class material than Bob?\n\nLike... maaaybe. And if you're forced to pick one person, you'll go with Alice. But that's a pretty low confidence guess, because there will always be a ton of material that can't be tested, and Bob might know that better than Alice. Maybe Alice got a bit lucky and the test just happened to align with what she does well. Maybe she paid more attention to the syllabus and dedicated time studying for the test to the exclusion of class material that wasn't going to be tested. (That's what I was trying to get at with an offhand remark before.) Or maybe more likely analogy for what could happen with crash testing, Alice spent a lot of time with practice tests while Bob spent more time reading the textbook; I know who I'd think knows the course material better in that scenario.\n\nOr... maybe Alice *does* know more than Bob.\n\nThe point is that there's a *reason* that crash ratings are pretty coarse, just a few out-of-five star ratings or whatever. It's because drawing the fine distinctions that Tesla draws from them isn't really a valid conclusion if you use it to imply that your car is safer. It's better to just say \"we're damn safe\" or \"we're one of the absolute best\" than \"we're the safest.\"",

To say that try to sell their ICE as much as they can compared to EV is a bit negative IMO, especially since they’ve invested so much into electrification, why would they NOT want to sell and lose money?\n\nThese intense marketing will accelerate EV adoption, which is good.",

The Polestar 2 launch edition (dual motor with Pilot and Plus packs) started at $60k and eventually they released a base version (single motor, no packs) in the US starting at $48k. Guessing a similar pricing and rollout might happen here.\n\nBut point taken. A base R1S with dual motor, standard pack (260 mi range), available starting in 2024 can be had for $72.5k. The quad motor, large pack (320mi range) available sooner starts at $84k. \n\nGuessing the Volvo XC90 3 row cousin to the Polestar 3 will be more in line with Rivian's pricing, while Polestar is pegging themselves against the 5 seater configs of the Model X ($115k), BMW iX ($83k), or Porsche Cayenne ($72k ICE, $86.5k hybrid).",

If realizing that Chinese manufacturers (lead by Tesla) were looking to absolutely flood the EU with BEVs, risking major layoffs across EU manufacturing, the government could step in and impose higher tariffs on imports, just like the US did.  Yes, this is absolutely FUD as there's no sign of that happening yet... but certainly something to watch out for that would instantly give all EU manufacturers a huge advantage over Tesla, even with their Berlin plant going online that'll only be producing model Y.",

"comment": "Rather than talk about where hydrogen has inate advantages, they pit it head-to-head with electricity, which is just dumb.  I think hydrogen can have some specific use cases so when reading below it's about the majority of transportation, not all.\n\n* **10** - The lifestyle change going to an EV is mostly good.  The big compromise is with long distance driving.  It's not even so much that it's bad but it is pretty different right now and slower paced.  This gets to be less so every year and in 2-3 years I honestly think this will be a positive change as you can co-locate charging with any retail/food/entertainment unlike gas.\n* **9** - I'm not sure I get the downside of using more electricity.  They mention peak demand but don't mention this isn't when charging will happen so it's just not relevant.  They mention that hydrogen can be located where cheap excess electricity is which is a good point but only if you buy the first point that electricity demand will be a problem.\n* **8** - Range isn't EVs problem, it's charging time and the number of locations is the problem.  It's not like hydrogen is fast to fill up either compared to gas.  I suppose it's possible it could be made fast but there seem to be a lot of inherent problems with icing that would make it cumbersome to do so?\n* **7** - EVs don't take an hour to charge, that is just crazy for all but the slowest EVs.  Just like we are imagining the future of hydrogen, they could at least return the favor and imagine what we think most EVs will look like going forward at the least.  It's also weird that they say \"no need to build infrastructure\" and then talk about the need to build hydrogen infrastructure.  They both need new infrastructure, the end.\n* **6** - They are stuck on range as a problem.  With class-8 trucks drivers have mandatory breaks they have to take that line up will with the need to charge.  Not saying there is no issues here, but they are way overblown.  I think there are some niche uses for hydrogen in large vehicles though.\n* **5** - I would love to see the cost per day per kWh for storage of hydrogen Vs. electricity.  No idea which is cheaper, but this is what we need.  Storage at night for use during the day.\n* **4** - Cleaner short term but they are created using the same power and hydrogen needs more of it per mile.  I guess I just don't understand how it's cleaner short term.  I think they are relying on carefully picking where it's generated and transporting it?\n* **3** - EVs work well in cold temps with the right equipment.  It's not hard to make them with the right equipment.  Again, strawmanning EVs and ironmanning hydrogen.\n* **2** - EV batteries are not being thrown in dumps.  Small batteries are being thrown away yet they are paradoxically saying smaller batteries are better.  No EV batteries will be thrown away and they will be recycled completely once there are more to be recycled.\n* **1** - More job growth is not a feature, it's a bug.  Basically hydrogen cost more to create and transport so it will create more jobs.",

"comment": "Have you actually looked at the charger availability on the routes you are likely to road trip? With faster charging EVs coming to market (see the Hyundai Ioniq 5 which can charger 10-80% in 18 minutes) you don’t need nearly the range you’re talking about to be able to do a road trip. You seem to be assuming that chargers are so sparse you need a battery that can do any possible trip without stopping. That is not the case. \n\nAlso, while you generally want to avoid fully charging or fully depleting the battery, doing so for a road trip is fine. In fact, most batteries charge fastest down low, so to minimize charging time, you want to be near the bottom of the battery.",

They are more aggressive than most manufacturers about cutting features to maximize their profit.\n\nThis works when you have a cult following and/or you are the only halfway decent car on the market.  Fortunately for customers, that's no longer true and it's unnecessary to continue accepting stupid Elon decisions just to have a good EV.",

Why not build an ARES system circling that water tower?  Or perhaps a vertical version, with a system of weights in an \"elevator shaft\"?\n\nBatteries degrade over time/usage (NiFe and some other impractical chemistries not withstanding), where potential energy, well, doesn't.  Or if it does, we have a lot bigger concerns than energy retrieval...",

"comment": "8 250W solar panels laid out side by side would be about 6 feet wide and about 25 feet long. If the panels were ideally tilted for the sunlight, you could probably dump 1500W back into the battery.\n\nThe panels, racking, and cabling would likely weigh around 600 pounds. A 25 foot 10 canoe trailer weighs around 700 pounds, probably pretty close to what we'd need here.\n\nA 3300 pound Nissan LEAF uses about 250 Wh/mile at 55 mph on level ground, or about 14 kW. Add a 1300 pound 25 foot trailer behind the LEAF, and the power draw would probably increase by at least 40% (to 20 kW).\n\nThis solar trailer would use 4 times as much power as it was giving back to the EV on the road!\n\nAfter an hour of driving, the trailer would use an extra 4500 Wh from the LEAF battery. After 3 hours stopped at rest, it would be back to net zero and would start adding net charge to the LEAF. It'd take another 10 ish hours to fully charge the LEAF from its hour of driving, ignoring the fact that the sun is probably down by this time.\n\nNot very good!\n\nHow to improve?\n\nOne way would be to slow down. At 40 mph, the LEAF without a trailer would only use about 8 kW. The same 40% penalty is now only twice as large as the gain from solar; after driving an hour and a half to cover 60 miles, the LEAF would need to stop for about 10 hours to charge back up (vs the 13 hours at 55 mph).\n\nAt even slower speeds - say 20 mph - the panels would start to produce more power than they used. At 10 mph, the panels could almost produce enough energy to drive both the car and the panel trailer.\n\nAnother way would be to ditch the trailer, and carry the panels in the car. The same 8 panels carried in the car would take up most of the cargo volume and payload capacity (not sure they'd even fit), but it would only impart a small penalty to highway power consumption (+10%). After 60 miles of driving at 40 mph and pulling the panels out, the car would fully charge in about 9 hours at the destination.\n\nAnother way would be to build an integrated aero tail for the LEAF and cover the roof and tail with solar cells; probably 1+ kW could be fitted. The solar tail would add some weight - say 200 pounds. The solar tail would really only help at higher speeds, say 25% reduction in power draw at 40 mph (12% from improved aero, 12% from solar power) and about 25% at 55 mph (18% from improved aero, 7% from solar generated). At 70 mph the majority of the power reduction would be from aero, still about 25% overall (20% aero, 4% solar power).\n\nThe 1 kW tail would still take quite a while to charge the car even in ideal conditions: 1.5 hours of driving at 40 mph would take 9 hours to charge; 1 hour of driving at 55 mph would take about 10 hours to charge, and an hour of driving at 70 mph would take about 18 hours to charge.\n\nTo do much better than this you will need a much lighter, more aerodynamic vehicle.",

As long as the panel where the service enters the main panel bussing has 6 or fewer disconnects then you will not violate the six handle rule.  The six handle rule exists so that when there is no main breaker, someone could theoretically take both their hands and open 3 breakers with the left and 3 breakers with the right, cutting all service immediately.\n\nA little side note, sometimes it is possible to argue that commercial system should be allowed six handles PER ELECTRICAL SERVICE.  That means that you could actually have 12 breakers in the main panel (6 per utility service and 6 per solar pv service).",

"comment": "I work in the industry and as much as I don't like the end of net-metering, the end is approaching.\n\nOn one side you have the utility: Sure they are evil and everything but they do have infrastructure that is being used to back feed this unused solar power. There are costs associated with running the grid and although the extent at which they should profit is debatable, there are certainly O&amp;M costs associated with it.\n\nSo right now a lot of states have net metering. You get credited on a 1-1 basis for what you generate and do not use. Is that fair?\n\nI personally struggle with that concept, and as much as I would like to assume that it is..I am not sure I am 100% sold. \n\nFor one reason, every kWh you generate with your system does not make it back perfectly to be used somewhere else..there are losses. So if you get a 1-1 credit you are saying the electricity YOU generate and then send off is just as valuable as the electricity that THEY generated and sent to you... but that is not true.\n\nWithout getting too lost lets say there is a 1% transmission loss both ways.\n\nIf they give you 1kwh of electricity it means they had to generate 1.01 kWh of electricity. \n\nIf you give them 1kwh of electricity it means they end up with .99 kWh of electricity that they are able to sell to the customer.  \n\nSo they are buying it from you at a rate that is 1kwh but only selling it at a rate that is .99. \n\nIn this example they do have to pay the same amount to generate on their own than if you generate and sell to the customer because the losses are the same.\n\nMY overall point is: It is nice and easy to do a 1-1 trade. It makes everyones lives easier right now without the ability to really track and distribute energy because of the lack of a \"smart grid\". But now people are loading on a LOT of solar quickly and utilities are panicking.\n\nEveryone likes to act like they are just afraid of competition, which is true, but I think it is more than that. For awhile they were letting it slide , mostly due to government mandates, but now that the scope of the situation has increased so much so quickly that little 1% scenario is extrapolated to a much larger pool.\n\nAssuming my scenario was still being used and you had that 1% loss/kwh. An average customer uses 7,000 kWh and half of that is net metered so 3,500. That 1% loss leads us with --&gt; 35 kWh of loss that they were paid for. In NYS people are paying between 8-20 cents per kwh so that is about $2.8 per person who has an average system and is net metering. There is (according to some search I just did) about 80,000 homes in new york that have systems. assuming they are all this size and net metering that leaves us with about $224,000. Still not a big number. BUT the number of homes in New York state that have solar is about 1%. So assuming EVERYONE went solar (not happening, atleast for awhile) that would leave us with the grand total of: $22,400,000 per YEAR in overpaid costs from net metering in New York State alone. (I understand ny state is not what the article is about but I am familiar with things here and we are going through a similar issue)\n\nI wrote that all just to make a point that it may not be \"getting scammed out of net metering\" \n\nEDIT: this point does also not consider the other costs like maintain , cost of generation, opportunity costs of not having to generate, infrastructure capacity and load monitoring, etcc... this is just ONE point in all of that\n\nEdit 2: not sure why the downvotes? I was just trying to make a point that it is not so black and white",

"comment": "Yeah, solar thermal is indeed efficient but managing the heat exchange fluid is a serious bottleneck for various reasons. On the other hand, you have thermal storage and storage is emerging as this major issue. \n\nParabolic troughs as this article describes are not anywhere near the end stage of their usefulness. Quite the contrary, what we've seen so far is merely a taste of what could be. Ten meter aperture parabolic mirrors are being installed and they could go even bigger than that. The storage side of things is far from its ultimate form. Some kind of hybrid between PV and solar thermal that involves a high temperature storage seems like an obvious solution if PV really does continue to get cheaper while battery storage remains expensive and CAES or pumped hydro remain too location dependent. \n\nSpeaking of CAES, I learned that one of the reasons why there isn't more room for CAES is because the propane guys took up all the underground salt caverns long ago. There is vast amounts of gas storage but much of it is already occupied storing propane. The attractive thing about high temperature thermal storage is that it could be compact and distributed. Another way to look at it is this way: a boiling water nuclear core runs at about 300C. Now imagine what you can do with a core of molten metal heated by PV electricity to 1000C.",

"comment": "There is also such a beast as Tiered, Time of Use you know.\nMost homes still are not 100% offset for usage and definitely not 100% zero billing.   \n\nBy placing modules on a western azimuth, you can still generate significant power in the peak band.  With also load shifting off from peak usage with timed appliances etc, it is very possible to get excellent ROI with time of Use and even Tiered TOU.  \n\nAgain most home are not 100% kwh offset and can't physically fit that much.     I don't know why you equate % offset to \"break even\"  even small systems have ROI.  If you have a $100 utility bill you can save money off setting $50 a month or spend more and save more off setting more.   Because of the flat fees on the bill getting to a $0 utility bill has the least ROI because your system has to be large enough to offset the flat fees at wholesale rates.   With Tiered TOU, even smaller systems have better ROI.\n\n&gt;  Once they force these homes on to TOU and move peak rate hours to night time, a house that generates less than 50% of their electricity, could easily end up paying more for electricity than if they didn't have solar.\n\nMost with existing solar in CA have a net metering contract that locks them in.   New customers will get slightly less advantagouse rate plans but the rates are so high in CA that there will still be many many installs.",

"comment": "/u/Boris, if you can get a structural PE stamp, that is very useful in solar. An installer position is always a good starting point for a designer, but you should still study up on design. If you can piece together an entire design, with most of the balance of system material, you can do alot in the industry.\n\nI don't think alot of the training programs in solar are very good. Out of a 40 hour course, you get 38 hours of elementary discussion that isn't applicable to a real jobsite, and 2 hours of paper calculations that don't do you any good either! Sadly, alot of these programs were developed to target department of labor grants. As our American education system shows, when the student doesn't pay for the class, you get price inflation.\n\nThe best thing you can do is study up to pass a master electrician's exam (which you might be able to do with your engineering degree depending on your state). That's another certificate that's worth alot in the industry, more so than NABCEP. Get your OSHA 30 while you're at it.\n\nAs an engineer, you will not experience the steep learning curve as others and your expertise will come in handy when it comes time to make critical decisions. \n\nAs my username suggests, I'm a strong advocate of [community.solar's training classes](http://www.community.solar/courses-streampage/) which are designed to be short, dense, and affordable. There is a higher price point for certified continuing education credit and a lower price if you just need the content. For example, if you already know solar design, you may want to just take our Design Your Solar Roof course, which demonstrates the capabilities of various solar design software. Or if you want a very robust intro class, our Solar Power Project Design and Development is very well reviewed.\n\nAnyway, send me a PM and I'll get you hooked up with some quality discounts. You may want to hold off on purchasing for a couple weeks - I'm remastering the audio for all of the programs (GotoWebinar's audio conversion sucks) and that's a giant pain the ass. Course updates are included for as long as I can support the classes. Nothing too fancy.",

"comment": "Well for starters APS is owned by a publicly traded company. http://www.pinnaclewest.com/Home/default.aspx\n \nWhile SRP is a Utility cooperative. This difference changes how they both will approach the rise of Solar.\n\nhere is a little video that explains how a cooperative works.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenKnIx4ouY\n\nFor SRP You do pay a demand rate, You have to pay attention to your demand at one moment, very easy to do with a load controller and awareness. \n\nSRP did increased the Distribution Facilities monthly charge for solar, time of use and basic are charged $4.20, while under the solar plan you are charged $16.64 per month (or $29.64 if you have a huge house)\n\nNow if your demand exceeds what your panels are producing during peak hours, You will be charged for that. That's why you don't want a washer, and dryer running all at once together. Its all very flexible and doable with a demand controller.\n\nAside from that you are still able to net the amount of energy purchased against the energy sent back to the grid.\n\nUnder APS that has changed.(existing will grandfathered for only 20 years). and those installing this year will be grandfather for 10 years and it decreases from there. And if you do any additions to your system will void the 20 or 10 year grandfathering, After that you will not get a 1:1 exchange rate for Net metering, You will get what it costs APS to generate that power minus what they save for you having solar, and you no longer get to bank on credits either, use them or loose them. Its still difficult to know what a ROI would be under the new demand structer as well with APS. The rest of the changes do not get voted on by the  Arizona Corporate comission until the summer.\n\nWhen you compare the two, SRP's approach to solar met haflway. You still get the benefits, but you have to be friendly with the grid.\n\nWhile still early, APS's approach hes been outright hostile to Solar, although they claim otherwise. But instead of offsetting at 1:1 KW rate, you are now looking at a \n(1.3 to 1.5 Kw):1 Kw rate roughly. Installers are going to have to approach APS differently because of that reason. It could potentially make systems more expensive, So you got that and now with a demand rate as well.\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/energy/2016/12/20/arizona-regulators-vote-stop-net-metering-solar/95653350/",

I haven't had issues with it so far (knock on wood).\n\nDoes this mean I don't owe Sungevity's lenders some ungodly sum of money because they were lent money to put my system up and pocketed the money I fronted them?\n\nUpdate: Been reading the Facebook page setup about this matter. Seems like the PPA agreements got bought out and their contracts will be serviced by another company like SunRun. For those of us who did a 20 year prepay, that no company wants to take over for a loss, does this mean we get to keep our panels? If so, still not a horrible deal. And what if I want to sell my house, how do I ask Sungevity for permission to transfer my agreement?\n\nUpdate: Sungevity's customer service email responded saying SunRun financed my panels.",

But solar panels are one of the few devices that can be read by measuring the amps across + to - when they are only connected to the meter. If you want to measure amps while it is connected, put it in series between the panels and the motor, so the current has to flow through the meter.",

"comment": "Right there are a bunch of caveats to what rates you actually get. It's based on system size, utility, offtakers, whether or not there is energy storage, trackers, low income customers. All of those factors into the \"all-in\" rate you will receive. Higher electric rate does equal lower incentive rate, and vice versa. \n\nWhere things get a little bit confusing is the fact that the \"All-In\" rate = Electric Rate + Incentive Rate. Just as an example, say that a project has characteristics that make the \"All-In\" rate of $0.25/kWh. A large industrial customer that's paying $0.05/kWh for power will be receiving a $0.20/kWh incentive rate. A warehouse that is on a small commercial rate of $0.15/kWh, will recieve $0.10/kwh. At the end of the day, both of them will be receiving the same $0.25/kWh \"All-In\" rate  assuming that their projects are the same (size/location/tech/offtakers). \n\nThere are also differences in compensation structure based on whether your system is Behind vs Front of the Meter and if the project participates in net metering. There are a lot of moving parts.",

We could make floating platforms that support decks high enough they aren't affected by waves, and use cables to keep the platforms from moving around.\n\nOf course, one of the best ways to sequester carbon dioxide from the air is to bind the carbon to something else, like hydrogen.  Long hydrocarbon chains are formed.  Combine those with oxygen and we get... plants.  The ocean is full of plankton, some of which is basically little floating plant life.  The little floating animal life eats the little floating plants, and when they die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean.  We can \"sequester\" the carbon dioxide by encouraging the normal function of the oceans, and helping to send more carbon to the bottom of the oceans, where it will be covered by more and more layers, eventually subsuming into the mantle of the Earth.\n\nThis is how oil and coal got buried in the first place. It used to be on the surface, but was buried through natural processes.",

The billing is called Net Metering, which means that you are billed for the NET of production and consumption.   This gives you the full retail value as credit for your solar power that is generated.\n\n&gt; I know how the SRECs work\n\nI am not sure that you do.  The two things are NOT related.   SRECs are legal credit (as in bragging rights) for making green power.   It is NOT the power itself.   So you would get Net Metering credit for your power and in states with a valid SREC market you would ALSO get SRECs.\n\nSRECs are generated at a rate of one (1) SREC per 1MWh (1,000kWh) of power generated.   This is not the same as net metered as the net meter only shows power that made it to the grid (you consume some of the power in your home).  You usually need a production meter for SRECs though some states will allow smaller systems to use predicted generation.",

"comment": "Two or three things are slowing down solar. \n\n1) Politics (regulatory capture, defensive fights from utilities that want to get paid for the coal plants that they bought on a 40-year mortgage, \"cri more libruls\", etc.) I don't have enough research handy to really back this up but I think there's a good case for regulatory capture in Florida, the Carolinas, Nevada and Arizona. \n\n2) Rapid change. Solar's grown by something like 2500&amp;#37; in the last decade. It's pretty much growing as fast as it can.   \n2a) A lot of people don't KNOW that solar's gotten as good, as big, and as cheap as it has. Eight years ago when the Sunshot program started, utility-scale solar averaged $5/W (so a 5 MW system would cost $25 million) and now it's $1/W, or $5 million for that same 5 MW system. Residential has not gotten better as dramatically. People use data points from even five years ago that are terribly inaccurate. Some of them are lying by implication, but not all of them.   \n3) Some places (obv. not Arizona) are reaching the limits of easy, unstored solar. If you have a 20&amp;#37; [capacity factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor) (hard to define simply, but roughly \"running at full power 20&amp;#37; of the time or 20&amp;#37; power all the time\") it is very hard to produce more than 20&amp;#37; of a country's power. Because that's \"whenever you're producing solar, you're supplying 100&amp;#37; of electricity with it.\" Arizona should be around a 25&amp;#37; capacity factor for solar.   \n3a) Economically, if there's a glut of solar (for example, \"it's producing 100&amp;#37; of the power for the next two hours\") it is very hard to get paid for producing solar power. That one gets even harder to explain clearly.   \n\n\nSo Arizona, specifically, is suffering from politics. Germany (terrible solar capacity factor, like Seattle level) is more suffering from physics and economics.",

Seems like the quality of the panels, power output, the warranty and the clean looking design beat the competition. Our solar panels will be very visible so the look matters on our house also live in an association. The biggest negative I see around here is the price of sunpower. On that point the quotes for both options are less than a hundred dollars difference.\n\nSunPower 6.1 kWp 17 panels \nTesla 6.18 kW 19 panels\n\nSo I want to ask here is there a good reason to not consider teslas system over sunpower?",

"comment": "So Hawaii's grids (each island is separate and there are several utilities) are in a state of rapid flux.  With the highest electricity prices in the US, solar adoption has been huge.  Utilities are also adopting solar and some wind, but also significant battery storage.  Existing generation was dominated by oil burners with one smallish (180MW) coal plant on Oahu.  \n\nThanks to coronavirus I could find a number for rental cars on Maui (20500-ish), making some WAGS I'll use 350miles per week on average (50 miles a day) at 3.33kWh/mi for 15kWh/day/vehicle so 307.5MWh per day (call it 300MWh/d for easy numbers).  There's 274MW of \"firm\" generation and 192MW of \"non-firm\" (renewables).  The renewables provided over 40% of the generation.  Since the firm generation was sized to provide 100% of the load pre-renewables, adequate capacity most hours of the day isn't likely to be a problem, but a very robust demand management program would need to be utilized.  \n\nAs the EV rental fleet trickles out into the resident market and EV adoption nears 100% we're probably talking about 150,000 EVs on Maui, but with a lower average daily distance.  \n\nNone of this would happen overnight, so the utilities would have time to adapt.  Resort parking charging setups would be interesting, but doable.  Charging rates could be priced lower during daytime hours when solar is active.  Rental car companies could offer the \"prepaid fill\" upon return and then utilize their own solar.\n\nGiven the logistics of it all, I'm very doubtful it happens by mandate.",

The company estimates that will require a land area some 25% larger than 250,000-acre Fairfax County, west of Washington, DC. That means Dominion Energy’s new solar facilities will blanket 490 square miles (313,000 acres) of beautiful croplands, scenic areas and habitats that now teem with wildlife.* \n\n*That’s almost half the land area of Rhode Island, eight times the District of Columbia, 14 times more land than all Fairfax County parks combined – blanketed by imported solar panels. Still more land will be torn up for access roads and new transmission lines. All this is just for Dominion Energy’s solar panels.*",

Most people park their cars at work for 6+ hours a day, and daylight hours are when the grid is most efficient due to solar power, so it's better for the environment to charge at work too.  One quick mandate that you have to provide *x* number of charging stations per parking space and the problem would be solved for 80% of the people who don't have garages.",

"comment": "I have an almost identical setup (5000+ sq ft house / spa / 3 batteries / 2 200A lines into the house).  My panels necessitated that I put 3 powerwalls on a single 200A leg.  The powerwalls can only hold a 20A peak and I had some 70A breakers.\n\nNext year I might add 2 more powerwalls for the other panel as it controls my upstairs/bedroom.  But for now, the 3 powerwalls run my kitchen / septic pump / basement / storm area / internet closet / hot water heaters--that's enough for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow big is your solar install?  My 21kW install will on a sunny day in the summer fill up my 3 powerwalls and then some but i doubt they will even fill them all of the way up during the winter months.  They will not charge from the grid except during storm warnings.  You'll have to have quite a bit of overhead on your solar to fill them all up.",

Battery storage and solar installations are not only cheaper, but they are highly modular and easy to keep on schedule/in budget. Nobody can say the same for nuclear power. Nuclear is always WAY over budget and years behind schedule. As we continue to roll out more battery capacity, the idea of base-load becomes more and more of a myth.\n\nEdit: I can also add, that as we ramp up production of high quality battery cells for EVs, we are also going to be creating an equally large supply of lower quality cells that would work happily inside a stationary storage facility.",

It's going to take global cooperation, population reduction, abolishment of capitalism and civilization to live in this planet sustainably. The answers aren't as easy as letting corporations change us to solar power.\n\nWe've lived sustainably for many years before agriculture and civilization. \n\nEven the phone I'm using to talk to you is not sustainable. I'm enjoying it while it lasts.",

"comment": "Unless you are working from home then the solar will not be useful in charging your EV. The Catch-22 is that the Powerwall won't do much good either. EV's have a much larger battery than the stationary storage cousins. You would be using a battery to charge a battery but then using the grid to charge one or both of them. It sounds sexy, but I rarely see it work out.\n\nIf you have frequent outages or want to maximize your solar investment then batteries are the only way to do that. You can find a TOU vs solar+stoarge calculator online. They will be within 10-20% of reality.",

We were a Sunpower dealer before they bought solarbridge and left as soon as they started forcing them on us.\n\nWorking with Sunpower was the worst few years of my life.\n\nThey finally abandoned the solarbridge product for Enphase but use their own software on them… which is ridiculous imo because the Enphase power line comms software is half the product.\n\nApparently the best thing about Sunpower, the Maxeon Solar Panels, will be available third party next year. That being said the architecture is too expensive compared to HIT tech developed by Sanyo and now being adopted by everyone. LG reps said this is why they abandoned the back contact product with the LG R series",

"comment": "There is a product called attic foil. It serves as a radiant barrier to reflect back radiant heat coming from your hot roof through your attic that heats up the attic and then causes heat to enter the inhabited spaces of the home. You tack across the rafters with a stapler. It is made from aluminum and the material itself is cheap. The work of installing it is hard and in summer, quite unpleasant. When a roof area has solar panels, I am quite confident that the roof does not get anywhere near as hot as it would were the sun directly shining on it so I think attic foil is a lot less useful where there are panels. That said, it could definitely be seen as a mitigator of any electrical radiation from the panels. I have had it in my attic for years now and it is a great energy efficiency measure.

Whether that's sunpower, lg, rec, q cell, ja, jinko....\nWhat you're paying for is the price per watt. $4/watt for a SunPower panel in Southern California sounds reasonable. But, other brands should be substantially lower priced. SunPower panels are generally overpriced compared to the competition. SunPower does have an excellent warranty.\n\nThat being said, having a nice professional install that looks good, even if it's $1,000 more, can be worthwhile especially considering those panels are going to be on your roof for 20 plus years.\n\nNote, you should insist on the iq7+ inverters.

There's a reason why solar panels go on the roof rather than hanging from the walls.\n\nWhy would you need to?

Now they are jacking up prices to store that power for customers FAR PAST what makes any economic sense and the customers just cannot let go of the concept.\n\nCalifornia is a great example.  They are going to charge for being grid connected based on the customer’s income: https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/electricity-bills-in-california-will-soon-be-based-on-income-heres-how-it-could-work/\n\nWithin the next 10 years, in California it will cost you $500/month or more to be grid connected with solar panels using $0 worth of electricity per month.  There isn’t any possible world that makes any economic sense.  Just purchase an electric vehicle that also doubles as a house battery and defect from the grid: https://www.cars.com/articles/whats-bidirectional-charging-and-which-evs-offer-it-457608/\n\nIf you cannot afford house batteries or an electric vehicle, go with a natural gas generator.

"comment": "Solar + Powerwalls was a great backup for three days.  I plugged in my Tesla and set it to stop charging when the Powerwalls were below 95% so I for use it as a sink for excess production.  We did some driving for the various errands while having air conditioning and tossing cords over to our neighbors so they could have refrigeration.  When everybody was panic buying gas and fighting lines before the storm hit, I simply opened the app on my phone and raised the charge limit.\n\nI watched my neighbors struggle with 10 gallon per day rationing and hour long lines.  They had to go through that daily because 10 gallons are just enough to run the generator for 24 hours and then drive to the gas station to wait in line with the remainder.\n\nA friend with a Bolt did the 12v inverter thing and lived off that for a couple days mostly using it to feed an array of Ryobi batteries.  Glory it was not, but they did have refrigeration, lights, and wifi.",

"comment": "Because you're comparing two different things. Please Google this stuff. A kilowatt is equal to one thousand watts flowing at any specific time. A kilowatt hour is equal to the amount of energy consumee if you used a kilowatt for one hour.\n\n\n\nFor solar panels you're paying for the ability to theoretically generate a specific load, almost indefinitely. 1kw of panels will generate approximately 5kwhr a day for 30+ years, and still likely be functional afterwards. 1 kw of panels will likely generate over 50 megawatts of power over that timeframe. Which if you spent $3,000 per kw of panels, will cost you 5 cents per kwhr. This is without tax subsidies to make it even cheaper. Also during those 30 years time, your electricity bill will go up due to inflation. Solar let's you lock in utility prices at current inflation levels.\n\n\n\nHowever measuring solar panels by cost per kwhr is silly because you're measuring theoretical output in the future. That's why most installers list price per watt installed.\n\n\nA basic Google search would explain this to you. Asking people to explain stuff to you is bad, and not the way to learn for yourself.",

"comment": "True, but at the same time those economics will make it even harder to transition off of oil, if the price keeps getting cheaper. And then at a certain point the price will become too low for US producers to make money, and lead to loss of jobs and economic output from that sector, while countries like Saudi Arabia are able to go much lower (they also have no choice, as their economies are built entirely around oil). Of course, if we can continue with lots of green jobs (EV manufacture, batteries, solar panels, wind farms, electrical grid improvements etc) then that will mitigate the loss of oil jobs. Plus the electrical jobs will be spread more evenly throughout the country, as opposed to the oil jobs which are concentrated in geographic areas…",

But even then the mosaic payment is still 252 so I get to enjoy that and whatever GA power bills me. And that’s gonna go up cause I was also sold on the federal tax rebate but that’s not even a rebate it’s a credit :))))",

Also, veganism is not a diet. It's not even a collection of diets. It's a philosophy against animal exploitation and cruelty which therefore dictates -- among many other things -- a strictly vegetarian diet (though there are many forms of that). But at least you got the veganism is ethical part right. \n\n&gt;It's also not the solution to the majority of the world's food problems.\n\nAnd what is?",

"comment": "The main indicator was low energy, the source of which was found through testing of various food ingredients in my diet, narrowed down over time to Soy based products.  You eliminate all ingredients except one, and eat it for a week, then you see how your body takes to it.  (talking main staples here, obviously this would be impossible with ALL ingredients known to man)  Also, used muscle testing to check as a 2nd opinion, and dowsing to check as a 3rd opinion(which works on the exact same principle as muscle testing--second signal system response)\n\nThat's why I'm mostly on Raw Mono Vegan Diet currently.  Only eat one type of food at a time, raw if possible, vegan preferably.  No health problems whatsoever, save for Myopia, which is my fault for sitting at a computer way too long for work and play.\n\nEDIT:  My list of foods and ingredients I eat is actually quite small now, and I also check every ingredient of things I put ON me(soap, shampoo, laundry soap, etc.), and I also use water filters in the kitchen and shower.\n\nEDIT:  I also should mention, there were other factors besides diet contributing to my emotional and mental issues like depression and low energy and etc.  Which is why I eliminated almost all mainstream music from my life, and only listen to music without lyrics, and that has a positive vibration.  If you're interested in why this is relevant, look up Dr Masaru Emoto, and check out his research.  I also made some other lifestyle changes, and also take steps to eliminate/reduce electrosmog, and etc.",

We went vegan together after being married, so I don't have experience dating as a vegan. However, if I was a single vegan looking for love I would look for another vegan. I'd participate (as I do currently) in local animal rights and vegan-friendly events and I wouldn't mind using online dating sites that were vegan-friendly. Of course, if someone came along that wasn't vegan and I was in love with them, it might not be a deal breaker. But I wouldn't put much effort into seeking out non-vegans.",

I also found out that my health drastically improved.  I have multiple sclerosis and after having a flare-up where I lost feeling from the neck down - was on chemo, IV steroids and plasma apheresis - I decided I needed to seriously make a change for my health.  \n\nFor over 5 years now, I've been mostly a dietary vegan.  I haven't had any multiple sclerosis symptoms or flare-ups.  I believe that eating vegan helps keep inflammation down a lot/works for me very well.  May not work that way for others, but I also had been off any treatment for a year.  \n\nI recently found out that the illness has progressed via more lesions on my brian.  But!  I feel great!  I would not have known if it weren't for my yearly MRI.  I think that if I had not stuck to eating this way, that I would have gotten symptoms and possibly a flare-up (I'm currently back on treatment - Avonex).\n\nI tend to just tell people that I'm vegan to avoid anyone making me something that I need to turn down or whatever.  It's just easier to say that.  Do I feel comfortable talking to someone who is vegan about it?  No.  I once had a friend who was upset when I told them that I'm vegan for my health.  She asked me, \"What about the animals?\".  I wasn't telling her this to upset her at all, she had questioned me.  And I find that I'm really scrutinized by people in the vegan community the most.  Makes me so uncomfortable.  \n\n*quietly walks out of the room*",

I'm also making a wild rice/squash/cranberry salad, and a kale/beet salad.  Both can be made ahead of time and just brought in a serving bowl, which is what I was looking for.",

It all depends on the type of foods you're going to make. For me, a good Thai curry paste is essential as is some full-fat coconut milk. Other spices to have: cumin seeds, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, nutritional yeast, bay leaves, cilantro, chives, parsley, and I'm sure there's more.\n\nIf you aren't going to be drinking or eating lots of fortified foods, you should look into a vegan supplement/multivitamin, specifically for B12, D, calcium, and iron.\n\nDefinitely check out some vegan blogs like Holy Cow Vegan and Vegweb for recipe ideas.",

I am also aware of a number of studies that suggest that the USDA recommended amount of salt is insufficient. The salt recommendation I finally found on the website suggested that the USDA recommended amount was in fact too much. The doctor quoted didn't offer any references and so I won't either. He seemed to be basing his recommendation off of macrobiotics, which, while fascinating and often a good source of healthy, delicious, recipes, is also rife with unproven claims.",

Once you start looking at the numbers and facts around animal based production (about 60 billion landliving animals is killed a year, 100s of billions if you count fish) 1 and 2 are very convincing and heartwrenching.\n\n1. Ethical consideration of animals\n   a) Animal rights, i.e. animals have a right not to be held captive, dictated and killed by humans.\n   b) Utilitarian, i.e. animal based production causes more suffering/frustrates more interests of animals than plant based production.\n\n2. Environmental and humanistic ethics, i.e. eating closer to the bottom of the foodchain  is more resource effective, puts less strain on the environment and allows us to feed more humans with less resources.\n\n3. Health reasons, i.e. see the china study and various other studies finding correlations between meat eating and bad health and see various studies finding correlations between consumption of plant based foods and good health.",

"comment": "Stir fries are really good, because there is so much you can do with them. \n\nCombine:\n\n1. A protein like tofu, tempeh, seitan, fake meat, beans.\n\n2. Veggies, whatever kinds you like!\n\n3. A starch like rice (brown or white), pasta, quinoa, or even bread/toast.\n\nA simple example would be cubed tempeh fried in olive oil until browned, then add frozen asian style veggies, soy sauce, pepper, ginger and any other spices you like to taste. Pineapple chunks are also good. Serve on rice with a bit of fake butter (Earth Balance is good), salt and pepper.\n\nThere are a lot of variations possible, and you can do stuff like serve it on toast, or make a sandwich of it, put the filling into torillas or whatever you like. Mixing peanut butter or tahini and soy milk into the rice makes it really creamy.\n\nOne of my favorites is this: Cut tofu or tempeh into slabs, rub sriracha, garlic powder, a little molasses/maple syrup and smoke flavor on it. Fry in olive oil until browned on both sides. Mix a little veganaise with smoke flavor (or whatever other flavors you like) and use that as \"aoli\". Serve with grits and salad or veggies. It's delicious!\n\nThis may help you: http://www.vegankit.com/\n\nmelann's response was a bit snarky, but this is a question that is asked frequently. You can probably find a lot of ideas by doing a reddit search and looking at some of the previous responses. If there's anything specific that's not answered after a little research, absolutely feel free to ask!",

And also never mind that 90% of the abuses that happen to animals in non organic farms happen in organic farms as well ( body parts chopped off without anesthesia or pain relief, killing of males, killing of 'spent' females, deprivation of natural behaviors, transport under terrible conditions, etc etc etc). \n\nThere's no such thing as \"humane\" animal agriculture, and \"organic\" doesn't even claim to be humane in the first place.

"comment": "I just did a Euro trip last month.\n\nFirst went to Denmark - Copenhagen. Vegan didn't seem very popular there, but most places were accomodating. I was also staying with an omni and didn't want to be a huge pain, so we didn't really seek out any vegan places. There are a lot of fresh markets though, so I ended up eating a ton of fresh fruit and salads. There was a place called Slice of San Francisco, where the owner's daughter happened to be vegan, so she converted their vegetarian sandwich choice for me. Late night pizza places were happy to make me cheeseless pies, and noodle bars would make me veggie dishes as well. There were a few places (this actually happened more than once) where they advertised vegan, and we walked in and they had no vegan dishes... which was a little frustrating. But just ask, you have to be very specific because it's not a popular concept, but everyone speaks English and they won't give you a problem.\n\nNext I went to Vienna which has a great, great selection of vegan places. I highly recommend Landia, they have typical Austrian dishes turned vegan. For cheap Asian type fast food, Formosa is great, and has a snack store attached. More towards inner city Yamm is a vegetarian restaurant with a food bar where you pay by weight. All vegan dishes are labeled. But I felt like it was a bit pricey. And my favorite place of all was Harvest Cafe. They had some unbelievable dishes, including a lavender cake that was just off the wall.\n\nLastly I was in Budapest. May seem a bit far from Berlin but if you can make it there I would say it's 100% worth it. The city itself is unbelievable, and there are a ton of vegan options. Not to mention, everything is unbelievably cheap! We made up for it by eating twice as much :) This was my favorite city for both food and sights. I went to Edeni, which is a cafeteria style restaurant a bit off the beaten path but worth it if you don't mind walking (or rent a bike!) I used Le-bar, a vegan friendly store to stock up on snacks. Not all items are vegan here and it was difficult to overcome the language barrier - but they tried very hard to help us. Some super great vegan chocolates here though! And raw treats too if you're into that. I used google translate to confirm a lot of the ingredients - you can download packages to use offline on your phone. It also seems that paleo is very big in Hungary, and many of the paleo items are also vegan items (but check the labels).\n\nMy hands down favorite restaurant in Budapest was Napfenyes Etterem - oh my gosh I can't even begin to describe how good the food was, I'm drooling while typing this. They have staple dishes and rotate in specials daily. And lastly, if you're into raw food (or even if you're not, so worth it), you should try Mannatural. They had 10 dishes and offered a platter where you sample all of them. There was a bit of a language barrier here but the people were great. You could also get a dessert as a combo deal with the platter. The waitress decided she was going to give us a combo deal on that, so we ended up sampling all of their raw desserts, which were just unbelievable.\n\nThere were a ton more places in those cities I didn't get to try, but those are the suggestions I can make.\n\nJust a few random travel tips - you can download maps ahead of time on Google maps and use them offline. GPS is free to use (just make sure your data is off) and it will locate you on the map. You can save places on your map and use GPS to get around. This was super handy in all the cities. The only issue is, when I traveled to Budapest, Google didn't have that city map available for download. But if I opened it up on wifi in the morning and synced it all, I could keep it open all day and still use it.\n\nAlso seeing as your going to Germany, you may be flying Lufthansa. Call ahead of time and request a vegan meal! They may not have it on the plane if you don't do that, but it is a decent meal - I had a decent polenta and veggies dish, decent for airplane food.",

"comment": "KerSan, thank you for your feedback.\nEven if VeganWall is developed in Meteor, it is not a mock up of Telescope (the website I guess you are referring to). We decided to write VeganWall from scratch as we want to provide a different set of features that Telescope will never do.\n\nAnd if you are wondering why we are doing this, the answer can be summarize in 2 world: vegan belief and technical challenge. As we are all web developers that want to have fun with a new technology (Meteor), we want also build something ambitious that can be useful for our cause. \nWhy would you use our service instead happycow.com or reddit? because we will focus only on Vegan related info, by trying to deliver a high quality service with the aim to connect vegans between them.\nSo for the the next months, keep using your favorite sites and once we are online, please come check veganwall.com and let us know what do you think about it.",

"comment": "Well, that sucks and I can understand how experiencing that kind of hostility again and again could really wear you down. But, like you say, you know who you are. And after 18 years, maybe you don't think about it as often, but I'm sure you know that veganism ought to be the baseline as far as living an ethical life and not being a selfish and/or ignorant ass. \n\nI can assure you though, that even if there are people like that out there, there are many more who are not. I've only been vegan for 2 years, but I have yet to encounter anything remotely like that (in real life-online is another story). I don't get people saying \"Tell me more..\", but they do sometimes ask whether it's an ethical thing or a health thing, and then they often volunteer something like \"Oh, I hardly ever eat meat at home. We try to only buy organic meat when we buy it\". It's mostly just awkward rather than confrontational, because I on the one hand, I'm not going to tell them what I really think about so-called \"humane\" meat (unless they ask), but on the other hand, I'm not about to lie and say I think it's great either. I usually just say \"Oh.\" and look a bit sad/concerned. I think people get nervous and embarrassed/ashamed around me when they find out I'm a vegan. \n\nI'm very curious to know how the other people you were with, when you ran into Bacon-Waver and Beer-Police, reacted. Did anyone stick up for you? Did they take their sides and gang up on you? Did they sit in shocked silence?\n\nBut back to the point, I was suggesting that going out and doing some activism as part of a group might help the OP get rid of some of the hopelessness he is feeling. At 18 and as a new-ish vegan, he might be full of the passionate energy that we can tend to lose over time. It's not for everyone, and it doesn't have to be. But I think it's really important that we, as vegans, support those vegans who are out there doing the hard work of actively trying to make things better for animals.",

My plan is to live in an apartment for a while with my partner while we save up money, and then once we can afford it, move outside the city to a more rural area and start a homestead. I know there are some great organic markets and farms around, but the restaurants are good too? I want to know that there will be nice places to go to on special occasions when we don't feel like cooking! Is any of it healthy food? We don't eat super high-fat food, like fried things.",

"comment": "I have had exactly one Burger King Quarter Pounder in my life. Last week I was working a show where I was physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted for days on end and I had literal DREAMS about shoving a BK quarter pounder in my maw. Unlike most (seldom, I've abstained from meat more of my life than I ate it) meat dreams, it was glorious.\n\nI woke up very confused. My veganism is not new and very non-negotiable. I felt guilty and weak even though I knew I'd never follow through in waking life.\n\nI reminded myself that living vegan means living kindness. I reminded myself that one of the kindnesses all people seem to struggle with is kindness to themselves. I forgave myself, scheduled one of my runners for Veggie Grill the minute they opened, shoved some hummus in my face and went on shift.\n\nLongwinded point is that it happens. As others have said here, you are mentally, physically, and emotionally accustomed to eating certain things. If you're stressed, those cravings will crop up. Be understanding with yourself, just don't cave. Be kind to animals, including you.\n\nYou got this.",

I thought being vegetarian/vegan and eating tofu goes hand in hand.\nOnce I found out that eating starches like rice, beans, potatoes, grains, corn, oats was actually a really healthy thing to base every single meal around, I had no trouble imagining what I could eat and cook throughout the month.\nI find soy milk also disgusting, but that's no problem because there is rice milk (my favorite), almond milk, hemp milk, hazelnut milk, cashew milk and oat milk.\n\n&gt;Or what is a good soy replacement?\n\nYou don't need to replace soy much like you don't need to replace meat. You just eat all the other goodness that's out there.",

It was my special treat.\n\nVegan Chunky Monkey however...*is even better!*  It's even harder to resist, because somehow, the slightly less creaminess of the ice cream compliments the overall taste of everything together. It's more banana-y, and lighter tasting.  Would (and have, many many times) heartily recommend.",

Then just ovo vegetarian as long as the eggs were labeled \"free range\".  Then sort of vegan-lite, where I wasn't paying too much attention to labels and while still sort of eating vegan, honey was fine.  Finally just straight up vegan while simultaneously cutting out most refined sugar.\n\nThis 50/50 stuff could be that baby step people need to take towards going 100% plant based.  If they buy it, it already shows they have an interest in cutting their meat consumption for whatever reason.",

"comment": "&gt; You trying to co-opt veganism to your political cause.\n\nNope, what u/BacchantBoyBFD is describing is called ethical veganism, and it is on the top of the [Wikipedia page about veganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism).\n\nOn a personal note, the /u/BacchantBoyBFD opinions and reasoning are much more relatable to me as a non-vegan. He at least accepts my existence and my rights. It is easier to admire and aspire to be that person since we share parts of the own ethical framework. Even from the perspective of pure logic -- being an ethical vegan makes you (more) morally consistent and impervious to many anti-vegan arguments.\n\nI would argue that vegans who draw the line at human are alienating non-vegans or people considering at least some changes.\n\nWhen it comes to politics... well veganism is inherently political since there is no ethical consumption under capitalism and in the last couple of hundred years we brought the planet to the edge of collapse under the current system. With that, every animal is at jeopardy. I would argue abstaining from politics is intently anti-vegan, since the current political establishment around the world is focused on profit first (GDP).",

"comment": "1500cal is a cutting diet. You do that for for a competition form.  What do non vegan body builders do to get 120g on this low amount of calories? Protien powders. So you can do the same :)\n\nYou shouldn't have any issues getting 120g by eating a little over 2000 calories though. The other thing is, if you are eating whole foods, a good chunk of those calories either don't get absorbed and pass through you as insoluble fiber, or you actually end up burning calories during digestion.\n\n\nIf you have just started, aim for 80g of protien from whole foods and I suspect you'll make gains just as fine. Many people don't account for thr fact that our body recycles 85% of the broken down muscle protien. We're just topping up, not refilling when we eat.\n\nMicronutrients from whole plant foods are more important than getting the numbers exact on a macro calculator. Eat the rainbow they say :)\n\nIt's a 3 year endeavour to get a gym body naturally, take your time to eat a diet that will nourishbyour entire body rather than racing to the finish with supplements and powders. Focus on form and think of the animals for your last rep in a set :)\n\n\n\nAlso plantstrong.com.and hench Herbivore are good resources.\n\nHappy lifting!",

"comment": "Agreed. At the same time, I do think it needs to be acknowledged that some rescues are unreasonable to the point that I suspect some of them may just be legal fronts for animal hoarders.\n\nFor example, I live in a big city right near several dog parks and trails, and I live with my partner and we both work from home.\n\nBut even for small, low-energy breeds, rescues wouldn't even consider anyone who didn't own a house with a large yard with an 8 foot fence. So that was a large number of rescues I had to rule out immediately.\n\nThen the one rescue I dealt with, everything seemed to be going smoothly until we set up a home inspection...only for the owner to no-show. I reached out afterwards and offered to reschedule, and she said she would, but then I never heard from her. Nearly 2 MONTHS later, she called completely out of the blue, but I wasn't able to pick up the phone at that moment because I was in a work meeting. After the meeting, I check my phone to find a completely unhinged voicemail about how I must not be serious about wanting the dog (that I applied for months ago and she vanished on me about) if I couldn't be bothered to be near my phone.\n\nSo I just gave up after researching others' experiences and finding how many people have issues with them. (I was open to adopting from a shelter, but my partner has allergies and couldn't do most breeds that shelters mainly had). But we didn't want to support breeders either, so we gave up.\n\nA year later, we got VERY lucky and had a friend who needed to give her dog up (who was a hypoallergenic breed) due to moving to another country. I adopted her dog, and now my partner and I get CONSTANT compliments about how happy and healthy our dog is. We walk him 3x per day, letting him explore the world for a half hour each time, he's always snuggled up with us at home, feed him a vet-supervised vegan diet, and vets mistaken him for a few years younger than he is because of how \"bright eyed and bushy tailed\" he is (one vet's words lol).\n\nAgain, I do NOT condone people going to breeders in lieu of rescues. But at the same time, rescues need to strive to strike a balance between not sacrificing standards for quality owners and not pushing away many potentially good owners.",

Think there is anyway for me to count how many cases of scurvy were cured from fresh meat because that was the cure for it before vitamin C was discovered which is interesting because people on carnivore diet do not need any vitamin C because they get so much carnintine.  How many COVID shots have you had if it is more than 0 than it is a waste of time arguing with you.  I will bet you plan on still getting COVID shots anyways…",
