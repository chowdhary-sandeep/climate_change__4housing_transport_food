I originally told him to buy the panel, but since he doesn't have the capital currently I mentioned considering a lease as an alternative and now I've gotten several rude responses and PMs which I don't feel like I deserve.\n\nIs owning a system better in the long run? Usually yes.\n\nBut it becomes less clear if you are taking out a loan to pay for solar. are you going to stay in the same house for 25+ years to see the benefit? Owning doesn't pay back for like 10 years or so... Do you owe taxes typically or get a refund? Do you want the extra liability of owning the system? Can you sell back to the grid? How many incentives, rebates, and tax credits do you qualify for? What is your cost of electricity? *CAN YOU AFFORD TO BUY THE FUCKING SOLAR PANELS IN THE FIRST PLACE?*\n\nLessing still saves money compared to paying utilities, but owning can save maybe 50% more in the long run. \n\nIt's like leasing a car. It's usually better to buy, but some people still prefer to lease for whatever reason. \n\nY'all are a little too paranoid...",

How committed are they to electrification? Can they carry the leadership position for electrification of light vehicle transport?\n\nThe answer seems to be, well, they planned a modest launch. They are not tackling infrastructure in a major way. They are not embarking on a big battery plant expansion project. They are not switching the entire company over to BEVs Real Soon Now.\n\nAt 30k for the first year, that's well below the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S in 2015. It is more on the level of 2015 BMW i3. Hardly grabbing the mantle of the first 200 mile range mass market BEV and running with it.\n\nIt will take GM about 3 years to be shipping 100,000's of long range BEVs... that's how long it would take LG to build new capacity for them if they started today.",

"comment": "For sure, obviously if you have the cash on hand to spend on the panels then you're going to get far and away the best return. \n\nI could easily qualify for a loan, my credit is more than good enough to do so. The issue is most solar loans I've come across are somewhere in the 4-5% interest range. Even taking into account all the tax credits and the SREC's that come along with owning your own panels. That interest rate is MASSIVE. And honestly kills a lot of your return value. Odds are the loan isn't paid off for 8-10 years. At that point you've probably accumulated several thousand in interest and if you want to go sell the house now, you'll 'maybe' break even with the increase in home value. \n\nRight now this is our \"starter\" home so to speak. We really only intend on being here for 10-12 years tops as long as things don't go horribly wrong in our lives over the next decade. So I think in our future home, I'll probably look into buying panels out right with cash on hand. \n\nBut for the time being I think leasing is the best way to save a chunk of money over the short and long term. And also make the house more appealing for resale. Initially I thought the lease might be a detriment to resale but the more I think about the more I'm changing my thought process there. \n\nThat thought process started because my father HATES solar panels and thinks they're awful. That said, most people under 30 have a wildly different opinion than that. In the next 8-10 years as solar becomes more and more normal in our everyday lives it won't be seen as a detriment. It could be to the point where people specifically look for homes that already have solar capability. Especially first time homebuyers who won't have the money to buy the panels themselves. It'll be a different generation, taking my 58 year old fathers opinion into account is kind of silly in retrospect. I'm not going to be selling my house to a 55-60 year old more than likely.",

"comment": "When I bought my EV I was going to get a used Leaf,, 2015 or 2014 model. I decided against it due to a poor rating on one of the IIHS safety tests - http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/nissan/leaf-4-door-hatchback\n\nI ended up purchasing a new 2016 Chevy Spark EV, with the tax credit it came out to a little over what I'd have paid for the used Leaf.\n\nThe biggest trade off has been fast charging, and I knew this when I made my decision, which is why it was a tough one. The Leaf uses CHADeMo which has a great network, especially where I live on the West Coast of the US. The Spark EV uses CCS which is pretty limited. Given that I rarely go on road trips, I decided to keep my Zipcar membership in case I needed a car for something like that, I can always rent a Hybrid.\n\nFor insurance, it depends on what coverage you get. If you're getting a new care and financing, then you will have to carry more insurance. I used an unsecured loan but opted for higher coverage. EV's will typically cost more. 6 months of a crap ton of coverage costs me $500 through State Farm. If you don't drive a lot you can get mileage based coverage, you have to install a device in your car. I opted not to go that route because privacy but it would have saved a lot of money. \n\nAs far as maintenance goes, electric cars need very little since they don't use that crazy gas engine.\n\nGood luck on your Leaf purchase! EV's are awesome, whichever car you choose!",

Which means it was designed to manufacture over 1 GW annual capacity, from all products, panels and tiles (I assume tiles).\n\nA public company has marginal \"insulation\" from the usual investor measures. Unless the tile business skyrockets immediately, quarter by quarter results WILL matter to most investors. Musk has some cache. But that is limited. And it certainly won't overcome a second, third, etc., quarter of declining results. So far, all Tesla projectionss are VERY modest for the tiles for a while, so no \"skyrocketing\" is likely.",

"comment": "&gt;When?\n\n[S22E04](https://www.topgear.com/videos/jeremy-clarkson/sls-black-versus-sls-electric-part-22-series-20-episode-4)\n\n&gt;Oh wow, they just had to use a Tesla blessed unit from the factory to review it and just refuse otherwise. What a bunch of BS.\n\nWhy would they go out of their way to review cars from a company that has no interest in letting them touch one?  They've done that exactly once in the history of the show, as far as I know.\n\n&gt;The P1 LM is not production either and it's a tuned car of a track only variant of a hypercar.\n\nI didn't say it was.  But the Radical SR8 LM and Lamborghini Huracan Performante did it in 6:48 and 6:52, and those are both production, street-legal cars that cost under $500k.  So a million dollar non-production hypercar beating that by a couple seconds isn't exactly mind-blowing.\n\n&gt;I don't recall them making fun of ICE per se but they do of EVs.\n\nThey make fun of characteristics and stereotypes of each.\n\n&gt;But he didn't, hence my wild conspiracy theories.\n\nHe didn't die so it's a conspiracy?\n\n&gt;Like the ones that set records and win races. Because those are unknown and much more niche than what they usually review. /sarcasm\n\nNot really sure what you're expecting.  Are they supposed to do a special one-off episode because an EV did a full lap of a track in a decent time?  They also haven't reviewed the Huracan Performante or SR8 LM, are they also out to get Lamborghini and Radical?\n\n&gt;Hybrids are hybrids, meaning both electric and ICE. Electric vehicles are not. \n\nNot according to most governments that offer EV rebates.\n\n\n&gt;They haven't reviewed any of the notable EVs in years and are known EV haters by anyone including their community who are also by and large the same.\n\nKnown EV hater who owns an EV.  Because that makes sense.\n\n&gt;Please, the one I chose hold the Ring record, \n\nBriefly *held*, past tense, a Ring record that's \n\n&gt;won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb\n\nIn a year where no major ICE competition showed up.\n\n&gt;hold the record for the fastest accelerating production cars, sedan and SUV etc. \n\nFastest accelerating currently produced car.  Fastest accelerating production car is still the 918, potentially now the Demon.  And I've already addressed the Tesla thing, I'm sure they'd happily take up an offer from Tesla to test their cars.\n\n&gt;Those aren't just any other niche EV that have no contribution or importance.\n\nAgain, they're important in the EV category but not really outside of that.\n\n&gt;WHAT EV?\n\ni3\n\n&gt;I said it's the first of it's kind they reviewed and crashed immediately. How curious.\n\nFirst of an oddly specific niche?  How convenient.",

If you do lots of long journeys then, somewhat counter intuitively, the PHEV is worse off since they can't rapid charge (except i3 rex and outlander phev afaik) on the motorways.\n\nSo you're trading charging time for journey time at the expense of emissions and economy. So I would have thought longer range EVs would be better if we're talking emissions. \n\nBut if you do the occasional long trip then you could say it's better not to have those big batteries that are 'unused' most of the time and better to have good infrastructure and spend more time travelling.",

Another crimp.\n\nBase model Lucids will be $80,000, which is less than many high-end Tesla’s. And Lucid has said it hopes to cut its prices eventually. \n\nPlus, Lucid’s 2023 SUV will be another crimper.",

"comment": "PARIS -- Peugeot said it will offer a full-electric version of the 308 compact hatchback by 2023, a previously unannounced powertrain configuration that could compete with the Volkswagen ID3.\n\nThe new-generation Astra from sister brand Opel/Vauxhall will also have a full-electric version, according to news reports. \n\nThe new 308 was introduced earlier this month, with sales set to start in the second half, but only with internal combustion and plug-in hybrid options.\n\nA Peugeot spokesman confirmed Wednesday that a full-electric version has been approved for production in 2023, but said it was \"too early\" to offer any more details, including what platform it would be built on.\n\nThe technical details of a full-electric 308 are not yet clear, although there are two options within parent company Stellantis. The group's newest compact EV, the Citroen C4, is built on the CMP architecture for small and compact cars, which can accommodate gasoline, diesel or full-electric drivetrains. But the 308 is built on the EMP2 platform, which is for compact and midsize models and is designed for plug-in hybrid electrification, not full electric.\n\nA more likely choice is the coming e-VMP architecture, a battery-electric adaptation of EMP2 that will first appear on the next generation of Peugeot 3008 compact SUVs, slated for launch by 2023.\n\nStellantis is in the process of vertically integrating its electrified drivetrains, with a collaboration with Nidec on electric motors, with Punch Powertrain on transmissions and with Total/Saft on battery cell factories.\n\nThe 3008 is scheduled to be built at Stellantis' factory in Sochaux, eastern France. The 308 will be built at the group's nearby Mulhouse factory.\n\n###Astra plug-in hybrid\n\nThe new Astra is scheduled to be launched later this year, with production set for Opel's home factory in Ruesselsheim, Germany, where it will be built alongside the DS 4 compact car also based on PSA's EMP2 platform.\n\nReuters reported on Wednesday that a full-electric Astra would appear this year, without providing any more details.\n\nThe Astra will have a plug-in hybrid variant, Opel CEO Michael Lohscheller told German motoring magazine auto-motor-sport in an interview.\n\nAn Opel spokesman told Automotive News Europe that while the new Astra will have a hybrid option, a full-electric option would not be offered this year. The spokesman said Opel would not comment further on future product plans for competitive reasons.\n\nVauxhall-branded Astras have been built in Ellesmere Port, England, but Brexit has left the factory's future role in doubt. Opel said in 2019 that the next Astra would be built in two European factories. The company has not yet disclosed the Astra's second production location in addition to Ruesselsheim.\n\n###Segment starts to electrify\n\nThe news about the full-electric 308 was first reported in French news media. In a video segment recorded by the enthusiast magazine Auto-Moto and broadcast last week, Agnes Tesson-Faget, the product executive for the new 308, said a full-electric 308 was in the works.\n\nAnother French media outlet, L'Argus, said Monday that Peugeot brand CEO Linda Jackson had confirmed in an interview that an electric 308 was coming in 2023. \n\nThe compact segment, the third-largest in Europe in 2020, is starting to see more full-electric options. The Nissan Leaf had long been the only EV available, but the ID3, launched last autumn, has recorded 6,858 sales through February, according to data from JATO Dynamics, about one-third of the segment-leading VW Golf. Nissan has sold 3,514 Leafs through February.\n\nIn addition to the full-electric Citroen C4, the Renault Megane-e is slated to appear in 2022, and the Cupra Born, a higher-performance version of the ID3 from the Seat performance subbrand on the same VW Group MEB platform, will go into production toward the end of this year.\n\nPotential, although unannounced, vehicles could include a Skoda version of the ID3 and a Ford vehicle on Volkswagen's MEB platform under a technology sharing agreement.",

I would highly recommend that if your in the market to actually drive each car as I had the deposit for the Polestar 2 in hand and after I left the test drive I just felt it lacked in parts ,thus the search restarted and glad it did.",

The idea that every single one of them should switch to NACS, instead of just one (Tesla) switching to the agreed-upon standard is absurd. \n\nThough it should be noted that NACS *is* CCS in almost all aspects that matter. It just uses the physical Tesla plug. Which is superior to the one chosen for CCS Type 1 TBH. \n\nThis means that all CCS1 chargers and (apparently?) all future Tesla chargers are compatible with all CCS cars and all Teslas produced from now on and for the last couple of years. All it takes is a relativley simple (and thus cheap) adapter.\n\nYes, Tesla should just move to CCS compatible charging. They have given in and done so with their cars. Now they are also doing it with new charger installations. It's happening.",

You also don't want to use more than about 80% of the battery in a day to prevent rapid degradation. So you put all that together:\n\n250 mi EPA range x 60% winter range x 75% health after 15 years x 80% per day = 90 miles worst case range.\n\nMy commute is only 60 miles per day, so I'll be good until the battery needs to be replaced in 10-15 years.\n\nAutomakers are required by federal law to supply parts for a minimum of 10 years. And the Model 3 is popular so I'd expect parts to be available or harvested from junkyards for quite a bit longer than that.",

So I think efficiency will fall off if the vehicle is sitting on top of too much snow, but I think it would take several inches ( packed under the tires ) to make a really big difference... https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357919998_Effect_of_Additional_Transmitting_Coils_on_Transfer_Distance_in_Multiple-Transmitter_Wireless_Power_Transfer_System\n\nAs for whether the presence of snow would directly affect the efficiency, it's a magnetic field...I don't think the presence of snow between the plates would affect the efficiency... but I'm willing to be told otherwise...\n\n&gt;No problem until they’re completely buried and the longer cable gives you flexibility to park around snow drifts.\n\nMy concerns, as someone who plowed snow many years ago, is that pedestals will make the process of plowing a lot more difficult once you have enough electric cars that you need pedestals installed in the middle of the lot, ie once you've used up all the peripheral spaces.\n\nAlso, at least around here ( Boston ) the cables tend to be draped on the ground which increases the chance of cutting cables with the plow. Chargers along the side of the road are begging for their cables to get cut. ( We could go to cables that hang down, like I think some of the EA chargers do... But I don't think you want 7 foot tall EVSEs along every sidewalk ).\n\nFinally, cables in general are going to get frozen to the ground in snow + ice storms... And thoughtless people will just drop charging handles into the snow / ice...\n\nLet's not even get into the subject of how many will be taken out by drivers who don't see them in their blind spots... Again, probably not an issue while the chargers can be made to fit the periphery of the lot... But if they're in the middle of the lot...\n\nEven ignoring snow &amp; ice, physical connectors have lots of issues... There was a reddit post a while back where the screwed up charger port wrecked a pin on the car... That could strand you if you can no longer charge...\n\nIt's certainly going to be interesting to watch this all unfold!!!",

At this point, EVs don't make much profit as it is, because they are paying back their R and D and infrastructure development (funds to build factories) money. This is why manufacturers release the top trims first.... because there is more profit in them. \n\nAs EVs become more popular, the prices will drop further, and we'll have more lower trim models. There are more lower rent cars on the horizon, like VW's $25k car in 2027-9 and the Rivian R3.",

Get the right arrangement of heater voltage and power, and solar cells and it is a good fit.\n\nIs it enough?  If you have enough collection and enough sun, then sure, yes it'll work!  To figure out if it will work for *you*, you need to crunch the numbers.  And you need to start with how much energy you are pouring into hot water a day, to get your demand.  Only then can you start to think about addressing the demand.",

"comment": "I think it would be physically possible with current technology, but it definitely would not be worth the expense. \n\nLet's take Hawaii, for example.  Hawaii has the most expensive electricity of any state in the United States.  It also gets a lot of sun and naturally has the highest solar per capita.   Land in Hawaii is also very expensive and since it is made up of a bunch of islands, most places are close to the ocean.  If any place is ideal for floating solar panels, Hawaii would seem to be it.\n\nProblem 1: Building anything on the ocean is darn near impossible in Hawaii. Impossible.  The environmentalists freak out over anything built on or near the ocean.  A while back, there was a plan to install floating ocean windmills, far enough off the coast, so they could not be seen.  This plan was curb stomped so fast the developer probably didn't even spend more than $5,000 pushing the idea.  From a political or permitting standpoint, a large solar array on the ocean cannot be built. \n\nProblem 2: Installing panels on roofs is MUCH cheaper and a very developed technology.  Despite the tons of solar penetration, there are tons of empty roofs in Hawaii.  Land, or rather space for solar panels, isn't sparse enough to warrant building stuff on the ocean.\n\nProblem 3: Storms.  I can't imagine how much insurance would be for a solar farm.  This is the [2015 hurricane season for Hawaii in one image.](http://wxshift.com/uploads/img-news/11_19_15_Brian_WXThumb_HawaiiHurricane.jpg) Yeah, that's a lot of storms.",

The SE10000 (SE10k is commercial), can handle this system though not as well as the SE11400.   I would ask about the additional costs for electrical work like a line side tap or MSP upgrade to handle such a large system.\nAlso it looks like they did not count on any fire setbacks on the layout on the roof.  So either you are in a state that doesn't have setbacks or they missed that and are going to try to hit you up for a change latter.",

Unique might be another way to put it.\n\nTesla is willing to produce some unique designs as well - Model X with Falcon Wing doors comes to mind. They're also willing to price their vehicles at the high end of the conventional market, although $27000 for the Johammer is well past that point for motorcycles.\n\nTesla is a game changer. The Roadster shattered expectations of the EV as glorified golf carts. The Model S set new EV bars for performance, utility, and capability.\n\nI don't see Johammer doing any of that. The bike has decent range and charges in a few hours, but Brammo and Zero have produced bikes with similar or greater specs since 2012.",

"comment": "That's going to depend on the customer's system and usage patterns (and utility), of course. But today, most customers should benefit significantly, particularly if they have west facing panels, because most of their generation is during peak/semi peak hours, but much of their consumption is during off peak hours (or during winter with lower peak pricing). There's only really a risk of being a net loss if your solar array production doesn't come anywhere close to matching your consumption (and even then, it could still be a net win if you can shift enough of your consumption out of peak hours).\n\nThere are really two major implications of TOU:\n\n1.  It penalizes east facing panels and rewards west facing panels (the major CA utilities have TOU peak hours in the range of noon to 7pm). I'm not going to do the math, but west facing panels may give better returns than south facing.\n2. In the future, as solar adoption increases, peak hours will shift. Solar noon will become off peak instead high demand, and solar customers will find that with typical usage patterns, much of their production stops being credited at peak rates while much of their consumption is still billed at peak rates (unless they make an effort to shift load out of peak times). In 2020, TOU net metering could be a much worse deal than flat rate net metering.",

A CSP concentrates light and so has a 50%+ potential but do not generate across a 5'x3' surface, the PV plate in this case is usually small.  So while yes, at the plate it is quite efficient, the lensing required for each plate takes up more space than the less efficient regular ol' PV panel without the needed lens.\n\nThis all without mentioning tracking, which can be built-in to the lens now but definitely needs some extra maintenance.",

"comment": "&gt;That's an unreasonable position. What you should pay in 5 years is a somewhat-discounted (for 5 years of wear-and-tear) rate based not in any sense on whatever the original cost is but on the cost of a comparable system (given rebates available) at the time you buy the house.\n\nWho said home buyers are reasonable?  \n\nIf you spend $50,000 on a pool, do you think you'll get $50,000 back when you sell your house a few year later because that's what it would cost to replace the pool?  Of course not. You'll be lucky to get $20,000 of it back.\n\nYou can expect whatever you want, but reality is buyers aren't going to pay you full depreciated value for your solar panels.  They are going to compare your house to the one down the street and think \"Well, wolftune's house has solar, so I guess it's worth a little bit more, but I really like the kitchen layout in the other house, so lets buy the one with the nicer kitchen.\"  That's the level of analysis you need to expect.\n\nAlso, maybe your solar system is ideally sized for your usage, but maybe not for a buyer.  Therefore it won't have the same value to them as it does for you.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've got solar panels myself that I spent $25,000 on.  I would love to get most of that back when I sell my house, but I'm not counting on it, especially when that is only 2-3% of the overall value of my house and would be impossible to quantify one way or the other.",

As part of the survey they are required to give you an accurate assessment on energy performance of your system.\nTesla roof tiles are not yet available in the UK and are going to be very expensive.  A much better option is an in-roof PV system like viridian Solar's Fusion system.  http://www.viridiansolar.co.uk/gallery-of-solar-installations.html\n\nIf you want an honest company in Bristol have a chat with Jeanie at ecocetera http://www.ecocetera.com\nOr Sam Hunter at Forever Green renewables http://forevergreen-energy.co.uk\n\nBattery storage would be an option but you will probably end up paying more for your energy than buying it from the grid.  Storage can very easily be added in a year or two when battery prices are less.",

If this had happened two months ago I would have folded it in.  That's a no brainier.\n\nAnyway, the more I look at the PPA the more I don't like it for various reasons in particular the 20 year contract for a place I don't think I'll be living in for 20 years leaving me theoretically on the hook and looking for a buyer who'd OK with that (I don't know if that's a big deal).\n\nAlso, though I can't refi right now, I can dig up the money to self fund it and with the Solar tax credit giving knocking the price down from $28K to $20K, that looks really good (also sunrun has some deal with Costco and so, as a member, maybe I can get a significantly better price on that).",

"comment": "That's a complicated question. Yes, the economics of solar have been getting drastically more competitive (for certain applications) compared to conventional fossil fuel energy sources. The future of the industry should therefore be bright. :) However, you need to remember several things about solar:\n\n1. Energy is a highly regulated industry globally.  Along with that solar is highly dependent on federal and state incentive programs (in the US at least).  Political and regulatory changes are a big reason for the industry moniker - \"The Solar Coaster\". See latest tariffs on steel and modules for a recent example.\n2. Office job salaries are going to depend highly on the type of firm, and where that company sits in the market. SolarEdge employees, for example, will be printing money due to their patented technology they have been able to bake into building code regulations. Some poor schmuck at a mom &amp; pop residential installer company with no unique value proposition could struggle to do well in a race to the bottom cost.\n3. There has been a ton of hype around solar, and photovoltaics specifically, for the past 10-15 years, and so I'd argue that salaries are driven down compared to other industries by the \"ideologists\" taking pay cuts for the opportunity to work in Solar. Yes, the industry is competitive.\n4. Big technical solutions are needed to overcome a key limitation to solar - our stupid sun plays peekaboo for 12 hours a day. How am I supposed to microwave popcorn at night when its dark?!? Solutions are in the works:\n\na) Add battery storage to the grid\n\nb) Make the grid more efficient at dealing with variable energy generation and demand, and\n\nc) Stop the earth from spinning!!\n\nUntil those solutions are here, the grid has a limit as to how much solar it can accept and so the solar industry has a cap. We ain't close to that cap in the US yet, FYI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get specific about salaries, find your desired role on the IREC career map:\n\n[http://www.irecsolarcareermap.org/](http://www.irecsolarcareermap.org/)\n\nAnd then search salaries for that job title on your favorite job board. Also, check out the career pages of companies that attend solar conferences like SPI, ASES, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple general suggestions for you:\n\n1. Look into Quality/Lean/Six Sigma methods so you can bring continuous improvement to wherever you end up. Noone in solar will care if you actually have those certs, but every job you ever have will value your ability to effectively solve problems, and most importantly prevent the problems from ever happening again.\n2. Learn how to automate/script things. You don't have to be a coding prodigy, but just being able to make excel formulas will take you a long way. Every solar project will be similar, so get a computer to do the repetitive things!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to you, and don't believe a thing I said because I don't know what I'm talking about.",

"comment": "&gt; one didn't come with the charger\n\nThey are usually optional added costs on smaller CC\n\n&gt; That's ludicrous. Without an MPPT you're literally throwing solar power away often by large amounts (for instance outside of solar noon or with overcast). Like I said I was drawing 123W this morning at 11V below nominal. You won't do that with a PWM or straight DC connection.\n\nWe were talking about charging a laptop.  There is no need for MPPT to charge a laptop, but all you can see is your system....\n\n&gt; All else being equal (e.g. same brand) a larger inverter should last longer since it has more cooling and heat tolerance.\n\nsame thing though operating a large inverter at the low end of its range constantly is going to increase heat as it is least efficient there.\n\n&gt; \"in rush\" is a factor of the design not the size. (and mine has a \"soft start\" feature for this very reason).\n\nIn rush is the load system.  Some loads demand more .  Yes there are soft start that helps reduce in rush but you still have it.   \nhttps://www.sunpower-uk.com/glossary/what-is-inrush-current/\n\n&gt; Yes, but the upside is I can run my home office at night or during a rain storm....\n\nProjecting your needs and wants on OPs question....\n\n&gt; Yes, but the upside is he can use conventional devices with it. Typically where you want to use a laptop you might also have a desk lamp, maybe a TV or stereo, etc...\n\nAgain projecting your needs and system on others.  he ONLY mentioned a laptop.  Maybe he is going to be hiking all around, no lamp, no TV, no stereo, etc, and the weight and size of your system would be a huge burden.  \n\n&gt; I'm literally running a comparable superset of what the OP wants.\n\nYou assume.  OP only mentioned laptop...\n\n&gt; Sure he could scale back the storage but he still needs storage.\n\nIn your (limited) experience, and projection of your system to OPs needs...",

"comment": "So I'm thinking an example of your second paragraph would be something like: producing wind turbines, solar panels, electric cars, etc. which cost us in the form of carbon production to produce now, but with the hopeful offsetting over the next decade or so, they will help keep other possible future carbon from getting into our atmosphere. \n\nIf you are looking for practical carbon pricing information based on what organizations are already implementing or trying to implement, the [Climate Citizen Lobby has some information you might find helpful](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/). I'm having trouble finding the *exact* graphs/info I seem to remember seeing before, so you might have to search around their site a bit more or even ask them. They are a very friendly group! :p",

Based on your $0.21/kWh, it's going to be 6.6 years before your system pays for itself.  This will definitely be something that will increase your home's value.

"comment": "Greetings everyone, new here, TIA for help and for being gentle with me as I learn my way through circuits and power.\n\nAfter two small, but scary fires with an LP fridge at our fly-in cabin, we replaced one of our LP fridges with a Unique [370L1](https://uniqueappliances.com/product/unique-13-0-cu-ft-solar-powered-dc-fridge/) Solar/DC fridge.. We have been very happy so far, and are looking to replace the other LP fridge with a Unique [470](https://uniqueappliances.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UGP-470L_solar_fridge_manual_Eng_V5_2017.pdf), and I am looking for advice on best approach on the combined solar system..\n\nOur fridge setup is currently separate from our main solar electrical - it might makes sense to combine them eventually, but that is a post for another time.\n\nI believe our current fridge solar setup consists of:\n\n* two 270 watt/24v solar panels  \n\n   * 570w \\* 6 hours of good sun a day (which is conservative in northern Ontario summers, many days are 10+) \\* .75 buffer = 2,565 wh/day charge capacity. (106 ah @ 24v).\n* Armada [ARC40-MPPT](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57ec05e5bebafbd7890d75e0/t/5dd2d7e958983f13f1b7ddf7/1574098923358/ARC20%2C30%2C40-MPPT+Data+Sheet.pdf) controller,\n* four 205Ah 6v batteries in series to get to 24v out  \n\n   * 100Ah 'safe' capacity to keep the batteries from discharging beyond 50%. (?? I am pretty sure the dealer said 10 days, but that seems as though it would be at full drain? and the controller would cut off before then to prevent battery drain?)\n\nHere are the power specs of the two fridges.\n\n**370 470 combined**\n\n12/24V 24V (system will be at 24V).\n\n2.6 amp 6.2A 8.2A\n\n62W 148W 210 W\n\n24Ah/day. 28Ah/day 52 ah/day\n\n587 Wh/day 865Wh/day 1400 wh/day\n\nThe ARC40 can handle a 20A load current, so we should be fine there.\n\nIf I added an addition 220ah (this time in parallel) - and my calculations are correct (big 'if'), we should stay at around 4 days of battery only power.\n\nAdd \\~300 more watts of solar power (controller can handle 1100W on 24V), that would give us 840w total charge capacity. 840\\*6\\*.75 = 3780 wh/day, or 157 ah, which would be enough to power the system and recharge half the battery bank on a conservative day.\n\nAm i missing anything that would prevent the fridges from running in series on the proposed system?\n\nIf there are any experts out there that like remote walleye/northern/lake trout fishing, I might entertain a trade of goods/services for cabin use :).\n\nThanks again for any help. If this is better suited for another sub, let me know. (Or should I cross post?)",

"comment": "1) Reduce, Reuse, Recycle... In that order. Just because you can afford it doesn't mean it's worth it and you should. Consumerism and marketing will attempt to trick you at every corner! Do you really need that stuff? \n\n2) Switch your power company over to a renewable energy option if available. If you don't live in an area that provides renewable energy options from the distributor then consider installing solar panels or if you just like the idea and have good sunlight access.\n\n3) Reduce redundant and unnecessary transportation and plan to buy an electric car even if it cost a little bit more. There is significant savings per year in gas and affordable options will be here very soon and gas will probably be going up as the planet finally decides to start doing something about climate change. The next batch of affordable electric cars should be in the 20 to $30,000 range making them only a little bit more expensive for a vehicle that probably depreciates much slower. \n\n4) Seal up your houses air leaks and transition to heat pumps for all your heating needs. Upgrade the programmable thermostats if you haven't. Do a better job at sealing window air conditioners or upgrade to ductless mini split heat pumps. Open the windows and use ventilation when temperature and humidity allow. Reduce your heating and cooling load by sealing off sections of your house and only air conditioning the places you need as well as wearing more clothes around the house in the winter and using electric blankets. \n\n5) Transition your diet to low CO2 and low water use per calorie foods.\n\n6) Choose homes and rentals that are more energy efficient and have the minimal amount of climate excess climate controlled area. If you can add porches and sheds and other non-climate controlled areas that is far more ideal than taking on a bunch of square feet you don't really need to heat and cool. \n\n7) Upgrade all your lighting to LED, its significantly more efficient. \n\n8) Avoid high wattage resistance heating like plug-in heaters or using your coffee pot as a heating pad. It's more efficient to heat things up in the microwave. It makes sense for electric blankets because you minimize the distribution loss by being in physical contact with the thing getting warm so the wattage required is low and you can keep the entire house cooler. Somebody needs to invent a cooling blanket to go along with our heating blankets and we could probably all turn our thermostats down significantly.\n\n9) Reduce your hot water usage and try to avoid unnecessarily burning through lots of different outfits per day and creating a bunch of laundry, but also don't do tiny loads of laundry because that's not nearly as energy efficient. The new hybrid water heaters will probably be the way to go though they're still a little bit new for now.\n\n10) Research your energy bill and try to get it as low as possible. Some people don't realize the devices in their home that may be using the most wattage, like maybe a dehumidifier that runs all the time. It might not seem like it's doing much, but they are not very energy efficient. Plug-in heaters are also not efficient, though they could be reasonably used to heat one room in your house while keeping the rest of the house at a significantly lower temperature. Those old school high intensity discharge lights like people put up on polls or on their garages are also particularly inefficient especially when you leave them out there for years and they've lost huge amounts of their output but still burn up tons of wattage. Understanding what in your home uses the most wattage is a good plan in general.",

You can can have a much much larger system if you build it yourself. I have bought 3 used Nissan Leaf batteries and have nearly 70kw of battery storage for about $3000. Also building your own system has an added benefit of you’ll end up knowing the system inside out. Any issues that may arise, you’ll be able to fix it yourself immediately and not wait for a serviceman to come out. This could take days or longer, and If you are relying on your own power fixing the issue yourself will be the best solution in my opinion. \nThis is my battery I built using Nissan Leaf batteries. \n\nhttps://web.tresorit.com/l/ZTdNv#hrdVZHpVXY3iZdUyqDD3Og",

"comment": "We got a PwrCell system installed in June. 13.5KW solar + 17.1KWhr battery pack (this is before the recent capacity upgrades).\n\nOne thing I REALLY like about this system vs PowerWall is the batteries are on the same DC bus as the solar panels. That means during peak solar output in the summer, when the panels are putting out more than the 8.1ish KW the inverter consume the extra can get pushed into the battery pack. In the summer we kept the pack with a min reserve around 35% and on really sunny days it would charge up to around 95% then drain back to the grid when the panel production went down in the evening. Ended up increasing our net-meter output by several KWh each day.\n\nMy biggest gripe is they still don't have a way to control it remotely. Ideally I'd be able to set mode, min reserve, and max reserve remotely. Right now that is only doable via the control panel on the inverter which is annoying.\n\nLet me know if you have other questions about it.",

"comment": "# You're not just paying for the car itself. That has NEVER been the case even since the Model T. The price partly reflects Rivian's efforts to bring a brand new BEV to the USDM and establish itself as a BEV manufacturer.\n\nThe past, present, and future of the product dictates the price you'll pay. It's not just the actual product you own but the services you use, the future software updates that can be pushed, the hardware that has to be installed with future software updates in mind, the logistics of delivering and marketing a vehicle let alone a brand new company (a car company at that too). You're paying a portion of their legal defense and insurance when something breaks with the product and then someone gets hurt or something gets damaged. A product is never just limited to what you can hold, own, and use. It's not that simple.\n\nThe United States is 50 states. 50 different areas where laws have to be interpreted and prepared for not only when launching a car model but also an actual company itself with that car model. Just like how Tesla had to get through all the red tape before selling the Model S. State AND federal regulations have to be obeyed like tint level, license plate locations, etc. 50 different areas where weather and animals have to be accounted for (see Mazda's engine and spider problem, Denver's problem with rabbits nibbling car wires, etc.).\n\nYou're correct. It's no longer a complicated engine with many moving parts. It's complicated battery chemistry, complicated battery storage and temperature maintenance, complicated battery health monitors with sensors, federal crash test requirements, passive and active safety systems, first responder considerations, electrical safety regulations when the vehicle is operated by someone who obviously isn't an electrician or engineer or is being charged at a less than stellar charging station.\n\nIf the car ends up in an accident and a fire starts, that's a completely different story for an ICE car vs. a BEV.\n\nIf this was Europe or China, that would be an entirely different story with a different price tag. That's one of the literal prices we pay for being able to drive and operate motorized vehicles (and now BEV's) in our country.",

"comment": "Well guys, using my alt account to avoid someone finding me out, but I worked at POWERHOME for about 6 months selling, and this company is robbing you blind.\n\nThe interest rates are only 2.99-4.49% but they overcharge by a mile. In training we were told we're selling \"the mercedes of solar panels\" which meant we were charging 5.50-8.00 per watt for Silfab panels and Generac batteries.(nothing special about them) \n\nWe charged customers $20,000 for a Generac PWRcell 8.7Kwh base model. Other companies were installing them for 11-13,000.\n\nIt was regular for me to show someone a 90,000 quote that had a large electric bill. Basically they charged as high as they could while still \"saving you money over 30 years\" .\n\nTheir Energy Efficiency Package is where is gets really sketchy. Basically they have roof insulation, led light bulbs, sink faucets, etc that they're claiming will cut your energy usage by 20+%.\n\nProblem is, basically every house already has those things, or at the very least has a good portion. This means we'd build up a system for a \"90-95%\" offset and by the time you take that bullshit off the quote it'd be down to 70% actual solar offset. Most salesman barely went over this. \n\nThe final part, talking on that douche nozzle Waller \"get rich like me\". The salesman are HEAVILY incentivized to close in the house. Basically they're preying on people who know nothing about solar, and pushing them to close in the house before they can shop around. The salesman are paid 5% of the revenue on those company appointments and 10% on self generated ...... most don't give a shit if it's right for you because they're making 2-10 grand to get you to close. Nothing illegal there, it's a tough  job, but it's highly unethical. The appointments were dwindling when I quit so I'm hoping this is the beginning of their fall.\n\nWHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!\n\nDisclaimer. Most of the salesman aren't to blame. They purposely hire people with no sales/ business experience, and the top performing salesmen were clearly not the people who looked into pricing or even began to question our sales tactics. It's the company's fault for misleading them.",

"comment": "I feel the same way as you're comments about how 'renewables and solar have reached a cult like level of support' except about Nuclear's supporters.\n\nNobody said solar is the only option. You just pretended that's what was said then go on to make an argument against it. (I can't remember what that tactic is called at the moment.)\n\nAlso, that Quora post you linked about 200 million solar panels is based off an extremely conservative estimate using the low bounds on the solar side. It's also based in Connecticut, which has a lower solar Irradiance then Tennessee. ( Also, you say it's 13 sq miles, it's not  it's 169. A 13 x 13 square.) Using the same formulas as that random poster on Quora I came up with a 6x6 square. What do you get when you do it?\n\nEven better is that we don't have to do 'back of the napkin' math. The worlds largest Solar Farm is 22 square miles (\\~5x5) and produces 2.2GW's. So, that's a pretty good estimate of how many square miles it would take to equal a Nuclear plant (depending on the nuclear plant size, of course.)\n\nI can't help but feel there's a astro-turf campaign to keep Nuclear's opinion positive on public forums like this one. Either that, or people are re-using the same arguments with the same data from 10-15 years ago.\n\nBleh, but really, it doesn't matter. Technology doesn't care about arguments, if solar is working, then it's working, whether you think it still immature or not. The sad part is public policy is shaped by public opinion (or industry opinion, if we're being honest) and if those opinions are that renewables can't do it alone and need nuclear, then they're going to build nuclear. (Which is why astro-turfing could be effective.)\n\nLuckily, there's strong support of skipping the 'tie-over-tech' and just implementing sustainable solutions now, which is kind of what we need, right?\n\nBah,  if only we could all just be 'sensible', right?\n\nFun sources in case you're interested:\n\n[https://www.freeingenergy.com/how-much-solar-would-it-take-to-power-the-u-s/](https://www.freeingenergy.com/how-much-solar-would-it-take-to-power-the-u-s/)\n\n[https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/nuclear-power](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/nuclear-power)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_photovoltaic\\_power\\_stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photovoltaic_power_stations)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew plant basis costs:\n\n[1.6k$ / kw for Wind, 3.1k$ /kw for Solar, and 5k$ for Nuclear](https://proest.com/construction/cost-estimates/power-plants/)\n\n(No idea if that above link is legit, just googled it and thought it was interesting.)",

The whole process took 2-3 months and we ended up with a 6.84 kw system and one powerwall.

Everyone else just tries to sell me their products and don't seem to be unbiased. I was hoping to get some feedback from an individual that truly has some experience with this, so thank you! My only other questions would be the following:\na) If you had been able to get a system twice the size it is now, do you think you would recommend your experience more so? b) has the system allowed you and your family to significantly save on your electric bill? In other words, for the cost of the system, has it been a good return on investment (financially) so far? c) if you end up building or purchasing a new house, do you think you will do solar panels again? Thank you!!",

"comment": "Tesla sunrun and sunpower are generally some of the absolute worst value buys in solar. I have been a solar consultant for 6 years including working for 2 of these 3 for several years.\n\nJust look at the reviews for starters. Sunrun recently wiped out their bad reviews. They had a 1.5 on Yelp with thousands of reviews.\n\nTesla is solar city rebranded. Customer service is not good. Sunrun customer service is absolute bottom of the barrel. Not just one of thr worst in solar but one of the worst of any company in the world I've ever seen.\n\nSunpower is not worth the premium and if it is the same price as sunrun then you are not getting a bid from the lower priced sunpower dealers. They are very manipulative and dishonest in their sales pitch. \n\nGood luck",

"comment": "I have the same brand of charge controller.  PV is photovoltaic, aka your solar panels.  It's showing how much is coming from the panels.  You can cycle through the menu to show PV volts and amps.  Multiply that number and you get watts.\n\nBatt is battery obviously.  It's showing how much current is feeding into the battery.  Once again, multiply the numbers to get watts.  What's important to know is the PV numbers won't always be the same as the batt number.  The charge controller is responsible for regulating how much to send to the battery.  If it's a sunny day, but your battery is at 100%, then the charge controller stops charging the battery.\n\nLoad is if you have something directly connected to the charge controller.  It will show how much you're drawing.  The only thing I have directly to my charge controller are some 12volt lights.  You should have only 2 buttons on the charge controller if it's like mine.  The left one cycles through the menu, the right one turns on/off the device connected to the load.  So that's how I turn on/off my lights.",

"comment": "Why the hate on this article? I'm shocked at the lack of intelligence here...\n\nOf course it's obvious that dust and pollen piles up on solar panels. The scientific investigation is important because they have to quantify \"how much will rain and wind naturally clean the dust?\" and \"how much will the solar performance degrade?\". You can't invest in maintainance without knowing the actual values.\n\nIf you were working at a solar energy company and told your manager \"We need to spend more money on maintainance because the panels are OBVIOUSLY dirty\" without providing data on how much performance degradation there actually is, your manager will just laugh at you. And if you ran a solar energy company with that level of intelligence you'll go out of business pretty quickly.",

If you’d asked me if I’d swap my Mazda to keep that driving experience but with less range and need to take extra time on long drives I’d have traded in an instant, even though I’d never consciously wanted any of the luxuries. \n\nNow we’re effortlessly cruising around in our Volvo c40, driving from home-grown electricity from our solar panels having ditched the rattles and noise of our diesel car. Its not the fact that other cars have better range or speed - this experience just feels good in a way it’d be hard to describe without trying it.",

"comment": "First, it depends which utility both of you are on.  It would help if you told us that.  If you guys are both CPUC utilities, then his guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  However, if he's on SMUD or LADWP or municipal utility, then his guy is right, but you're also then not comparing apples to apples if you're on a CPUC utility.\n\nBasically on 3.0, if you go without a battery, you're basically going to be giving the utility lots of free energy because the net metering agreement is so bad.  It's shifted the cost to the consumer (you) to get batteries.  You'd need to capture all that excess energy you're producing during the day that you can use right away by the batteries, so it's just going to be lost and you'll have to pay to pull it back from the grid some other time.\n\nBuying is always better.  Finance if you have to.  I would not lease if you can help it.  You don't get the 30% credit because you don't own the panels.  And you'd have to get the solar company's permission to do any work on your own roof!  Plus they are going to be taking a lot more of the savings of solar through their lease.",

"comment": "I strongly agree with the last statement. it's a complete waste of money for the government to subsidize any business IMHO Tyson foods just got 6 million to build a new plant from state government. That idiocy and I'm including government incentives for alternative energy needs to stop. I'm not saying this to delay progress of anything. It's my personal view for fiscal responsibility of the government. \n\nI don't know how pervasive it is but I have seen horror stories on people having to remove solar panels from their roofs. I'm always skeptical, that could easily be an oil company funding videos behind fake corporations. \n\nI'm personally looking forward to a breakthrough that would allow us to use little to no battery storage for power.  I'll go look into nuclear again. I am under the impression that it's fine. We have been using it to power submarines for decades",

There is A LOT of confusion about what even a vegan diet consists of, so it's hard for me to imagine it being simpler to say \"I'm vegan\". I make a point of saying it sometimes, though, because I hope that people will ask me about that. \n\nAnd there is another word for it, if people choose to use it: strict vegetarian. If that isn't good enough, then perhaps people should come up with another word, but I don't think it's right to misuse the word vegan where it doesn't apply.",

Also maybe read up on net nitrogen balance, in that study (which was carried out for a month), they found 1.4-1.5g/kg to be optimal for newbie lifters and gain in muscle mass. No distinction was made for fat loss (where a higher net protein consumption would be better). They've repeatedly demonstrate that though, as well as showing during periods of weight loss more protein is better. Also there's not exactly many real world examples of vegan athletes at the top tiers of fitness. In fact I'd venture to say there is a *much* smaller proportion of vegan athletes in the top tier of fitness when compared to the average population and the number of vegans:non-vegans.\n\n**TL;DR**: I know plenty of people who are either fast, strong, or both, and plenty of people with six packs or a great deal of muscular definition; but none of them are vegans. I know a few vegans and they're mostly pudgy balls of dough.",

This is exactly what people like the OP is reacting to.

Everyone reacts this way, some more than others and some will be far, far more stupid.\n\nIn any case that's why it is so hard to change people's minds.

Also I feel bad for them missing out on the cute dry food mixes with all different colour and shape and flavour biscuits you know so I have to make my own for them haha. Ami also has smaller biscuits. I don't find it more costly than normal food overall but I do buy in bulk online and I spoil them so it wouldn't be the cheapest food anyway\n\nOccasionally I buy them vegourmet cat sausages, they like the fishy one best (the most disgusting stinky one ofc!). Apart from that it's my food or meat treat bags but those aren't a big part of their diet at all\n\nThey've had 2 vets (moved house) and both say they're healthy. They have very pretty fur and eyes, obviously I am going to be biased and say that but one of the vets said so too!\n\nYou could always do something like half Ami / half whatever she currently eats, that's the best of both worlds I guess, if you're really not convinced by vegan cat food",

The OP talked of \"not harming\" and now it has come down to using an axe to intentionally kill a sentient, breathing being. When we fill in the blanks of the \"humane\" myth we are left with intentional harmful killing, selling animals as resources for profit, beheadings and and more like it. That even a well-meaning you person like you get sucked into such patterns of exploitation shows how deep the problem is. My lesson from all this is that vegans should work even harder to end and criminalize all exploitation of animals for food.\n\n&gt; Head removed with axe(first strike)\n\nI'm especially saddened by reading that. Picture someone doing the same to a dog! It is so very wrong but since you don't see that there is nothing more to say here.",

Unfortunately he seems to have gone off the grid recently :(     \n\nI also recently discovered [Mr. Vegan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn2lKFXnPGoO25KExp986Bg) which I am 50/50 on. The quick shot food recipe videos are good and the guy is fun/eccentric. Seems it's small channel (only 131 subs, 30 vids) but it's good content.  \n\nEdit:  \nOh oh, and I enjoy [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) who I think does good vegan activism videos",

"comment": "Agreed. Sounds similar to my situation, too. My last 2 dogs were rescues, and I just figured I would let them hang out with me and I'll pamper them and we'll have fun together, instead of being killed. After they passed, up until I was vegan, I really wanted to get another dog. The companionship is awesome. But since going vegan, I can't impose my will on them like that. Who knows, maybe my rescues would have preferred being killed than have to live in my house, eat dog food, be neutered, be on a leash all the time, etc. Not saying they would prefer death to living with a human, but I don't know that they wouldn't, either, and I think that's the main problem. We have to impose our will on them and make that decision for them, and that's not cool. Kind of in the same vein that my friends who own chickens have decided it's OK to take their eggs because they give them a yard and food and stuff to live. Who's to say the chickens want that or think that's fair? My friends have made that decision for them, and I don't think that's right.",

Some people have very extreme reactions to vegans because deep down they know how wrong it is to eat animals. Carnism is really [an ideology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0VrZPBskpg) in and of itself. The dad sounds like he's desperately clinging to his carnivorous lifestyle and traditions. I wouldn't be surprised if he went more plant-based himself once he overcomes whatever cognitive dissonance he's experiencing right now.",

We don't naturally have 70 billion cows, pigs, sheep, etc. We create them. \n\nUltimately, with less animals being bred and housed, we will have a lot of land left. And a majority of that land can go back to it's natural ecosystem. I hope I am alive to see that day.",

Don't get me wrong I think I understand your points, but I don't see how this follows from the morality behind veganism. If I can make something useful out of a waste product ( and that's the case for *humane wool*) why should that be wrong? Because it is not feasible for everyone? Or because it can lead to something like the current wool industry (which we are both agree is awful), where animals are seen as a resource and not as sentient beings? I think this is more a problem of a greedy and capitalist mindset",

Even sometimes without being aware of it. I have spoken with many people claiming to be vegan when their only consideration was diet. Which was (if I’m not mistaken) one of the reasons why vegans began to make the distinction between vegan and plant-based. \n\nBecause if you’re plant-based because you don’t agree with the industry (not necessarily that eating animals is wrong) or for health or the environment, you can kinda break those rules occasionally or even disregard them eventually.",

It did have stearic acid that may or may not have been animal derived as a dough conditioner but it was under the \"contains 2% or less\" label, so I let it slide. It also had 0mg of cholesterol and 0mg of trans fats, so I assumed it was vegan and ate a few. They were a delightful treat and I very much missed jelly donuts.",

Do you have empathy for them? Or is a cell phone or computer too vital to modern living and we can justify it somehow? \n\nI know a few other vegans in my personal life through friends and I don’t think some of them are very compassionate about other humans lol (some weird comments about the homeless population in our city, etc.)",

It's challenging but not impossible!\n\nFirst off, kudos to you for being attentive to your health and diet. You might want to consider legume-based protein sources such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans. They can be versatile in recipes and provide a good amount of protein. Additionally, explore protein-packed seeds like chia, flaxseed, and hemp. These can be easily integrated into smoothies, oatmeal, or baked goods.\n\nAnother option is to find plant-based protein powders that are free from seed oils and gluten. Pea protein, for example, can be a good fit for your dietary requirements. \n\nIf you do decide to reintroduce animal-based protein, it's essential to do what feels right for your body and health. Listen to your body, and prioritize your well-being. \n\nLastly, perhaps you could reach out to vegan communities or forums online. Many people might have had similar experiences and can offer recipes, alternatives, or suggestions to help you on your journey. Stay strong and best of luck!",

This problem seems to be a reoccurring one and maybe there just needs to be a person who spends a bit of time getting to know each member so they can be introduced. 🤔 Algorithms can be good but in my research the types of algorithms a lot of the dating sites use (the sweep left/right) kind are inadequate even for non vegans. The algorithms used on sites like Match and eHarmony are just not available to clone or alter. (Can you tell I’ve spent time thinking of this?). \n\nI think there are several factors one has to consider when trying to match folks and a big one is location and/or willingness/ability to either have a LDR or relocate if it’s a great fit. \n\nMaybe I’ll make a post about this and gauge interest…\n\nthoughts?",

There are plenty of vegan microwaveable options like canned chilli, pre-packaged asian foods (I eat a lot of pad thai and teriyaki bowls), frozen meals like burritos, pastas, and mock meats, and you can make high calorie smoothies too with peanut butter, tofu, frozen fruits and vegetables. Cereal with your choice of plant based milk is easy, along with oatmeal and granola bars. Nearly everything I buy is recycleable and it isn’t very expensive (although not as cheap as whole foods.) As long as you buy a variety of these foods and are making smoothies you can easily hit your nutrient goals. I take a multivitamin too though because why not. Been going like this for several years and I feel perfect health wise.",

It could be spending too much on groceries. Show them how much they can save with vegan. This is basic sales/marketing. Find out what they need first. Then offer the vegan solution. It doesn’t always work. I used to talk to 100s/day abt solar. If I was lucky I would make 1 sale. But over 10 yrs I have helped save so much carbon, mostly to ppl who didn’t care abt climate like I did but they did want to save $$. Can you go to stores & demo vegan food? Then you’ll see. You can effect change if you marry your passion to purposeful action.",
