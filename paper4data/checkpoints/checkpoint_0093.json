Same thing, really.\n\nI've found that, once the car is warmed up, the drain on the batteries from the climate system is very low.  If you're doing a typical commute or a run to the grocery store or something, odds are you won't even notice the climate system's drain.\n\nOn the other hand, the batteries operate much more efficiently when they are warm.  If they cool down, or even get cold, the amount of energy they store and release is pretty drastically reduced.  The Leaf, for example, shows an 84 mile average range.  In the summer, I typically get close to 100 miles, but in the winter, I only get about 70.

It will take 10 years for it all to come together, but those who wait even 5 years are risking being to late to the game.\nedit sp.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0024382874253205955,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17262263581192908,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3202896462647208,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28470501977144524,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08939971700434247,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.02781969913242695,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2114419761734704,"ev_1":-0.1447628903432858,"ev_2":-0.09098912693055657,"ev_3":-0.22091639736512056,"ev_4":-0.12149430980207399,"ev_5":-0.13163829868189758,"ev_6":-0.11308730053091608},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.

In similar debates, I have noted that I would not have bought an EV if I had to keep or even rent an ICE to do road trips...and I can actually *afford* to keep an extra car...for many people it's just not an option.\n\nMy experience to date doing road trips using superchargers has been that it's less of an inconvenience than even I was expecting - and I'm sure I was less pessimistic about it than most EV (or just Tesla) detractors.  I know it's not the case (yet) for everyone for all road trips, but for me the Model X is an excellent road trip car and the half hour or so every 200 miles or so is utterly worth not having to deal with owning, renting, fueling, or repairing an ICE.\n\nMore direct answer: I would not buy an EV without some kind of fast charging network like Tesla's supercharger network.

Do you hit the gas station every day? Probably not. Most of us gas up a little less than once a week. Presumably, your children won’t be driving all that much (certainly not 1000+ miles per month on average). \n\nIn a car with a 300 mile range... you’ll only need to charge it 3-4 times a month to handle that. Just stagger L2 charging for when it’s needed, and use L1 for everything else. L1 charging can’t fully charge a 300 mile car overnight (that would take literal days), but it CAN top a car off from a typical day of use, and since you rarely do 200-300 mile days back to back around your home, it’ll have plenty of time to catch back up.\n\nOr you can use the L2 in a pinch, top the car off, and you’re fine!\n\nEven if they’re driving short range used EVs it’s no big deal. My 2016 i3 charges up fifty miles of range in a couple hours at L2 charging, and fully charges the car in a little over four-five hours from damn near empty.\n\nL1 charging handles everything else. My L1 charger only shoves about 4 miles of range into my car per hour, but that’s fine. Overnight it can pretty much full charge it even if I ran it dry the day before. Your kids can all leave their cars on L1 charging when they’re not using them and it wouldn’t equal the electrical load of a typical home air conditioner. I’ve went months using nothing but my L1 charger while putting 1100-1300 miles a month on my i3 and never needed a faster charger. If they’re operating in a 30 mile circle of your house (typically), they will not need faster charging. They’ll be starting almost every day with a full battery and plenty of range to do anything they want.\n\nYou will probably need to run a few more dedicated L1 charging plugs to handle that many cars (can’t charge 2 off the same low power circuit, you’ll need a few more breakers), but your home can handle it no problem. \n\nAnd if you have an L2 that can split things up and charge two cars simultaneously, that just makes things even easier.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0020501952773580947,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28767436901349835,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2671679854677149,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1912982695472646,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26755184055004666,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18916953534014405,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17537095239611997,"ev_1":-0.16326362574263212,"ev_2":-0.062274097770568915,"ev_3":-0.026301548042586848,"ev_4":-0.1600027673969938,"ev_5":-0.007062277004782421,"ev_6":-0.2240708400499436},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Currently I have a 2020 Bolt as my daily driver and a 2017 F150 in the same configuration the lightning will come in except with the 5 liter V8 gas motor. \n\nI use my truck to haul and tow and usually this is over long distances. I towed a car 750 miles each way for a weekend car event last summer then towed a different car 400 miles each way to a different event earlier this month. \n\nHaving a gas truck made this easy. Fuel stations especially on the main highways make it easy to pull right up to a pump often not even blocking another pump due to spacing. \n\nHaving used my bolt at a few different fast chargers this would not be the case. I would need to find somewhere to unhook the trailer, then go charge, wait the 40 minutes to get to 80%, go hook up the trailer again then drive. \n\nWhile towing I see between a 25% and 50% reduction in fuel economy. So assuming the lightning has 300 true miles of range and I charge up to 80% I’m at 120 miles to 180 miles of range on 80% while towing. \n\nMy other main concern is I don’t daily my truck now. I daily my compact bolt. I work downtown and park in a large parking garage and while trucks do fit with no issues it’s super convenient to be able to wherever I want. \n\nIf I were to get one I would sell both my bolt and truck and daily the truck.

The fact that it can charge at 200kw isn't proof that they did, especially since the Model 3 can charge to 250kw.  If Tesla had put in the effort to improve the cooling architecture of their battery pack in the Model S they would have at least matched the capabilities of the cheaper Model 3 if not passed it.  200kw is the best they can do without significant changes to the battery pack, which didn't happen with the Raven refresh.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00013599571805874197,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3594659043124812,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1141323372721672,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06759946048259735,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1952373679745947,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.008387721609324217,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.005090709562258174,"ev_1":-0.003994641996541759,"ev_2":-0.004088302986929193,"ev_3":-0.0006269503392104525,"ev_4":-0.001045415761230591,"ev_5":-0.00030859068647259846,"ev_6":-0.012090924816826979},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (Tesla's EV technology is good but they could improve specific models)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers or other (since the reference group is implied but not explicitly stated as \"my coworkers who work in the electric vehicle industry\" or similar)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against.","1.3.3_second_order":"strong.","ev_1":"NO.","ev_2":"NO.","ev_3":"NO.","ev_4":"NO.","ev_5":"NO.","ev_6":"NO."},"year":2019}],"housing":[{"comment_index":20200,"comment":"Most likely 10 to 12k installed for the battery system, if you were going for Daily usage.

It's rising 3 times faster than it was just a few years ago. That's whats alarming about it. \n\nFor example from 2000 - 2012, it went from 1855-1880 (delta 35ppb); then from 2012 to 2015, it went from 1880 - 1920 (delta 40 ppb) in 1/3 the time.\n\nCO2 isn't accelerating, it's pretty much on a linear march. So, the real question is what will methane do going forward? Accelerate more? Stay the same? go backward? The data suggests it's getting amplified -  maybe it's from arctic thawing. maybe its from fracking. Who knows. If you use the same math (100X multiplier), and if it's rate keeps going up, then it will displace CO2 in just a few years as the #1 cause of CC.\n\nI'd further like to add that this graph is definitely NOT recording some statistical abberation. It's systematic. And nobody knows exactly why or how. Whatever it is, it's likely not going to go away if we shut down coal plants and put up solar panels.

The way we wire our systems we add a breaker to your main service panel and after the excess power can make it all the way back through your panel you then send excess back to the grid. You are still credited 1:1 on this. Youre right but because you also have less draw in the day your are getting credited more. Therefore you will be supplementing your power use at night.  The math is very similar for the 2 methods. The biggest difference is going to be whether you are using the power first or if your sending all of the solar to the grid and buying right back. As far as the guarantees are concerned its hard to say. My \"local shop\" company offers a 5 year workmanship warranty as well as any factory warranties offered by product makers. We had used suniva modules for some time now and they are very high quality but out of nowhere Suniva is now declaring bankruptcy. This doesn't mean that our customers are screwed but they might have to meet in the middle with a company to swap the mods out. SunRun is pretty much being forced out of SC because they have installed in lots of HOAs without approval first. The last number i heard was around 600 jobs that aren't interconnected just in state. Also if you want to  help offset even more of your night time use you could consider a small battery storage if offered.The price range can be pretty extreme depending on what you want to do but we offer a small 4kw battery backup for 4000$.

So we want to make sure we’ve got the capability of providing for that market,” Western Australia’s Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan told Reuters.\n\n**The state on Oct. 25 launched a Renewable Hydrogen Council**, including Woodside, French power producer Engie SA, and Norway’s Yara International, to form a plan to use land, wind and solar resources to produce hydrogen.\n\n“The development of a hydrogen business is similar to the early days of the LNG business,” said Shaun Gregory, Woodside’s executive vice president for exploration and technology.\n\nTo reduce global warming, hydrogen could be used in fuel cells for vehicles and manufacturing plants, and could eventually replace natural gas for space heating, water heating and cooking in homes.\n\nOutput may start through the gasification of brown coal with the hydrogen and carbon dioxide separated out. But eventually wind and solar power would be used to crack water to become the biggest hydrogen source.\n\nCurrently, hydrogen derived from coal gasification is cheaper to produce than from water. The goal is drive down the costs of a hydrogen cargo by 2030 to a level that Japanese buyers would accept, said Australia’s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, who is advising the government on a hydrogen strategy.\n\n“The biggest potential show-stopper is that we can’t meet the price target,” he told Reuters.\n\n**Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) is leading a A$500 million demonstration project to produce hydrogen from brown coal from Australia’s largest coal mine, Loy Yang in Victoria. (!!!)**\n\n“At this point it is clearly cheaper (than hydrogen from renewables), but in the future they might be the same,” KHI Executive Officer Eiichi Harada told Reuters at the GHGT-14 conference in Melbourne on Oct. 25.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, Woodside is working with Korea Gas Corp to potentially produce “blue hydrogen” in a carbon-neutral process of reforming methane from natural gas while eventually shifting to solar or wind to crack water to make “green hydrogen”\n\n“We believe blue hydrogen – carbon neutral hydrogen, sourced from gas - is the key to building scale and lowering costs in hydrogen transport and distribution, which will enable an earlier transition to green hydrogen,” Woodside’s Gregory said in an email.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.26668639930206695,"1.1.1_stance":-0.160976839256825,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2037567024371798,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24687071307364533,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1133175235672458,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2287083077879689,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.185678747500122,"solar_1":-0.14402701890771202,"solar_2":-0.22704402634833223,"solar_3":-0.07464207493328559,"solar_4":-0.07991589509565662,"solar_5":-0.11261243345902135,"solar_6":-0.06934512426475219,"solar_7":-0.05709602798257644,"solar_8":-0.043317269016488746,"solar_9":-0.08901339813223075,"solar_10":-0.22871925130955587},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

We loved the idea of Tesla, and wanted to be customers of theirs, and we have never talked to another solar company. We've spent 3 months with an unsigned contract with Tesla trying to get basic questions answered. They book appointments with us, and then leave us sitting here with no call, not even an acknowledgement they forgot to call us. It is insane for a company that depends on customers. The only people who've called us are the contract closers, who refuse to answer our dumb rookie questions such as if we need to file any permits or how long does the whole process take. We didn't shop around and knew nothing about solar, so we were far from being picky or demanding, because we were happy to let Tesla plan it all out for us and we pay them whatever they said it cost. But now that Tesla has annoyed us for 3 months, and caused our delays in even signing a contract, we've joined this subreddit in the past few days, and are learning fast. We would have signed for their medium panels + 2 powerwalls. You'd think for more than $30,000 a company would speak to their customer. Our neighbor loves their Tesla panels, they don't have pw because their Tesla salesman didn't know what the pw's were 3 yrs ago, much to our neighbors amusement when they asked him. But they do love their solar, and we'd really like to have that experience too! We'd love to have been able to get the whole order done with Tesla, sign, pay and done. We live in SoCal, and after 3 months of this void with Tesla, and the contract saying 5 months to install, we're now probably looking at early January, so we're losing the tax incentives. Just guessing on timing here, because we can't ask Tesla. And if this is just our pre-contract service, then what will be our post-install experience?? BBB has pages of people with dead solar and service appointments booking out 6 months from now at the earliest. We would LOVE to have worked with Tesla, we had been so excited about the whole process idea, but this is just so f*cking stupid to have a customer chasing a company to work with them. We love the idea of working with only one company for the whole process, loved their powerwalls for efficiency and backup, the sleek panels, and ability to manage everything with their app. We're on the verge of quitting the idea of solar entirely, &amp; maybe see if Biden gets elected and see what his incentives will be next year. So, given our experience to date, do you have any suggestions for my family? We're stuck. It feele like the sales people only want to grab the easiest customers who pay without any questions at all? We don't even bug them, just be nice, sit and wait. Given yesterday's post with the bad roof conduit thingy install, I can imagine that install day could be a mess, but we won't have a choice on what happens to our home, which really stresses me out! How do we get the installers who do the beautiful jobs we can see on this subreddit??","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"yes","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.15848311521151892,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0714686816774994,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.4015895824910232,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1728348776565587,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14143428450915962,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1889937440574837,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05539941584963041,"solar_1":-0.20679754204539544,"solar_2":-0.21170201254026727,"solar_3":-0.22578050982558714,"solar_4":-0.18878941716069778,"solar_5":-0.0906164264306426,"solar_6":-0.20773874390093885,"solar_7":-0.20105920333151237,"solar_8":-0.23159022268213478,"solar_9":-0.2069624437011934,"solar_10":-0.11322782127501796},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

SolarShield was developed by the same folks who developed rain-x and is specifically designed for solar panels. As a test, I also applied it to my vehicle's windshield and shower glass door. The shower door is holding up well with daily use and squeegee and beading has been persistent since January. Over time, the panels did get dirty with bird poop, rain spots and dust. Spraying them with a garden hose and spray attachment worked well but didn't get them spotless. I only cleaned when it was overcast, in the early morning or near sunset. Last month, I purchased the Unger brush head, extension pole and also the Unger glass cleaner and that made it much easier. Very little cleaner is required and is mixed with water. I do have to squeegee them after or I get water spotting.  The brush head has a crude squeegee that's not perfect but gets most of the water off. Here in Los Angeles, birds drop these small yellow poops the size of a rice grain and those are difficult to remove. I have to use the squeegee end to gently rub them off.

So I see it does happen. How common it is that I don't know. If you were to do something like this you probably wouldn't get a warranty but let's be real most solar installers only last a short time so their warranties are basically useless. If you want a warranty your best off going with Tesla because they're likely to be in business 20-30 years from now. That said it seems like your situation requires micro inverters because you indicated that you're in an area with high tree cover so partial shading will be best addressed with micro inverters.\n\nI know one person that might do it for me as my parents flip houses and he does do solar installs but he's also very busy. Next time I talk to him I'll ask him about his interest level and then direct message you. It'll probably be a month or so I wouldn't wait for that I would rather try to be proactive with your own Solutions.\n\nOne last thing. Since you're in Texas you probably have TXU as an option for your power company on Oncore. They have a plan called free nights and solar days that gives you free energy from 8:00 p.m. to 459 a.m. so it may be the battery power is better for you if you're not looking for grid Independence because each additional power wall is 13.5 KW and only about 6,500 bucks. So that's cheaper than solar for getting your power but you're obviously not independent and the contract can definitely change after 2 years so you definitely buy more security with solar panels. I just figured I'd mentioned this because some battery actually makes a lot of sense in Texas often times.\n\nHope this helps.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2739385874780666,"1.1.1_stance":-0.337480649524884,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2248178567591653,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07555695933600266,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2499337498054956,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3712824362342227,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06575324471729498,"solar_1":-0.15409086012908307,"solar_2":-0.15476191820913401,"solar_3":-0.004484575517684182,"solar_4":-0.2011087933581924,"solar_5":-0.047150954207609175,"solar_6":-0.05064556929088818,"solar_7":-0.04300423550982183,"solar_8":-0.0497748249945289,"solar_9":-0.028508174036829814,"solar_10":-0.0477414908236824},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Multi-function control electronics that control and direct the operation of the other components. You can think of this as the 'motherboard' of the device, as it controls and ties together the operation of all of the other components that are attached to it. It may have several other sub components such as Wi-Fi, communication ports, etc. As you've discovered, these devices typically draw DC power from the battery to operate.\n\n\n\n2. MPPT charge controller that accepts DC input within a specific voltage range.  These are typically used for regulating irregular voltage from solar panels, but with a dump load, could be used for any number of DC outputting devices provided the output sources within it's voltage range.\n\n\n3. The battery or energy storage system. This is where all the energy collected is stored for use by the system.\n\n\n4. DC to AC inverter, which on draws DC power from the shared terminal bus that the battery and charge controller output are connected to.  It doesn't care where it gets its DC power in real time.\n\n\n\n5. Some hybrid inverters can have AC to DC transformers or rectifiers to convert available grid power to DC for charging batteries. Your inverter seems to have one of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n>what happens to an inverter when there is no available AC, no generator and no sun? Is the inverter destroyed? I don't think so. It will either kill the battery or cut itself off at a certain voltage. Am I right?\n\n\nCorrect, by their very design these devices *should* have under voltage protections which will allow it to simply shut off without damage under normal conditions.  Poorly designed devices will flicker on and off rapidly has the DC capacitor that controls the electronics rapidly charges and discharges.  This *can* cause damage to the control electronics and other attached components.\n\n\n\nBy far the component most likely to sustain damage from any source during operation is going to be the DC to AC inverter.  It has to deal with both DC and AC circuits and any problems that might occur.\n\n\nA DC to AC inverter is designed to accept DC current within a specific voltage range and have minimum and maximum current requirements.  If the available DC current or voltage is insufficient and inverter either will not activate or will malfunction.  \n\n\nA well-designed DC to AC inverter has protections against malfunction and damage from irregular circuit behavior, whether it be rapid power loss or over/excess load on the inverter AC output, and they usually produce a warning tone or flashing light and just shut off until the operator can correct the situation and reset. The poorly designed inverters just keep working until something fries.\n\n\n\n\n>If that's the case, what do you think is the possibility of something bad happening with this test I want to do?\n\n\nBiggest risk as I see is likely going to be an overdrawn current on the battery or overcharging either of which could cause resistantnce overheating of the wiring and the internal systems of the battery which can cause an electrical fire or causes damage to the battery itself resulting in the outcomes I listed in it earlier comment.  \n\n\nThis is the limiting factor of everything we've discussed. As long as the voltage provided by the battery is within the operating range of the inverter and control electronics and it can provide the minimum required current to sustain the wattage needs of the control electronics, it should be possible to start up the control electronics for basic diagnostics provided you don't try to charge the battery at an excessive current or voltage and that you don't attempt to draw any significant AC load that would exceed the battery's current output limitations.  Depending on the type of battery, it may very well be able to produce more than 1c for short periods without sustaining damage, but that's something you'd have to check.  Inappropriately rated fuse to limit maximum current draw and a DC shut off switch, like I mentioned before, should always be used for safety.\n\n\n\nI can't tell you whether this is something you *should* attempt, only you know you, but only that it is something that *can* be done with appropriate precautions.\n\n\nIf this is something that you want to attempt and you want additional help, you should probably contact a licensed electrician in your area for hands-on assistance.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008037347154944049,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20543529070311023,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14097384970543836,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.35177056385379046,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14833647410243125,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23461625299252659,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.026867618806136306,"solar_1":-0.09109452790831214,"solar_2":-0.16071040690632418,"solar_3":-0.07680729112338251,"solar_4":-0.05763500654266723,"solar_5":-0.02716791003088777,"solar_6":-0.057657614180020966,"solar_7":-0.02155091235286477,"solar_8":-0.023720556678502664,"solar_9":-0.009841957427163095,"solar_10":-0.17856668292458583},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Therefore any religious meat eater may indulge on their fleshy delights guilt free. Atheists on the other hand do not have the convenience of a book to tell them what is right and what is wrong. Consequently, an atheist might make the decision that killing animals is wrong. I myself made that decision...a big part of it too is that as a rational-minded person I know that all life only lives on this planet once; so I believe taking the gift of life away from any animal for merely eating is selfish. \n\nKeep in mind I only hold this conviction because in today's world there is an abundance of non-meat foods...take a different scenario from today such as the Native Americans who pretty much lived in the wilderness. For them eating meat could be justified because it was a matter of survival, not the taste of a juicy hamburger. It is no different from a frog eating a fly, the food chain is a natural thing; however, when it is industrialized I believe that it is disgusting and completely immoral. When animals are raised in stalls just to be killed and eaten for the pure joy of eating, that is when consuming meat becomes a selfish, immoral indulgence.\n\nAnd to me, I really do not believe a (fundamentally/truly) religious person could understand that reasoning...but there are of course exceptions. For instance, my girlfriend who is Catholic decided to be a vegan for pretty much the same reason (mind you this was her own decision, I did not coax it or anything). Then again though she is not fundamentally Catholic (i.e. she does not believe that God hates gay people), so there is some question to that. Either way anecdotal evidence really means nothing but I am just trying to say there are still of course religious people who can make the decision to be a vegan.\n\nAnd if you disagree with what I said, and you're asking something like 'well still? what makes that immoral?' just ask yourself this question...would you not think it to be a bit immoral, unfair, messed up, whatever you like to call it, if another, more intelligent, stronger race took humans and bread them just to eat them? Imagine if Earth was just some huge slaughter house for the Omicronians (from the planet Omicron Persei 8 of course). Would that not irk you one bit at all? After all, I believe the best thing about human intelligence is that it can be used for compassion above all things. Otherwise, what would make us any different from animals?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2238387207486309,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22168445427160044,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2189651351273556,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28196573116817525,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07157114765304455,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2069377547128228,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.172002456150949,"diet_1":-0.030267230547906365,"diet_2":-0.2244414260678225,"diet_3":-0.15601150790489554,"diet_4":-0.11626127256507364,"diet_5":-0.08497661892518711,"diet_6":-0.03371267002027404,"diet_8":-0.015100054390131845,"diet_9":-0.011263907593577946,"diet_10":-0.09937116649237916,"diet_11":-0.004679123025804681,"diet_13":-0.1478975542607562,"diet_14":-0.08423494124990485,"diet_17":-0.22402401442250244},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

You have provided a lot of useful information for me to look at. I'm excited to go home and look into all the links. I have actually been doing a lot of research.  I'm happy to find that there are a lot of blogs promoting veganism. Today is my 9th day since I became vegan and it's already an amazing experience and in the short time I have already enjoyed amazing meals. I must admit I do crave a lot of sweets and yes I contemplated on maybe having 1 day out of the week where I can have dairy but I immediately discarded the thought because I've been doing so good and to be honest I don't want to participate in anything that has to do with animal cruelty. I do feel a bit tired or weak sometimes but i guess I just have to make sure I'm getting the proper nutrition. It's funny because for memorial weekend my friends had a bbq and it was such an awkward situation because they think that it's a phase I'm going through or that I just want to feel special and in no way they want to hear anything about it but it's ok because I know I'm doing the right thing and in a small way I'm helping out our Mother Earth.

I may look like a cis-straight-white-Christian, but in reality, I'm a pansexual, atheist, vegan, Marxist with extreme prejudice against anyone who advocates for - or are passive accomplices of the destruction of our planet, mistreatment of our sibling lifeforms on said planet, and the associated horrors around the meat/dairy/breeding/testing industries etc. Being vegan is just another way we humans can be less dickish and more dudeish.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.021364207689960796,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14267761167138815,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.08011458068938282,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.15897421026904346,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13116398826241493,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.026900356613926608,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1545500879360578,"diet_1":-0.22771829969858004,"diet_2":-0.21689479049550947,"diet_3":-0.22524273707395132,"diet_4":-0.19623856864885772,"diet_5":-0.22532423559952278,"diet_6":-0.22302459866261667,"diet_8":-0.011112108586530667,"diet_9":-0.26075350244839984,"diet_10":-0.21581758422478592,"diet_11":-0.04225278561352752,"diet_13":-0.13943919188712783,"diet_14":-0.15664595873645418,"diet_17":-0.20521268051781932},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.

I encourage you to expect more of yourself and expose yourself to the discomfort and anxiety of trying new things. There’s an important difference between safety/danger & comfort/discomfort.\n\nAlso, I don’t imagine the cow being forcefully impregnated and then having her baby stolen from her and slaughtered every year, milked to the point of severe infection, wading in her own and others’ excrement, physically and emotionally abused, and then slaughtered herself at only 4 years old due to decreased milk production cares that you’re addicted to her secretions or afraid to go without them. Come on, one of the “superpowers” (it’s honestly rather vexing) of being autistic is hyper-compassion. Exercise it.\n\nI used to only eat chicken fingers/chicken patties, plain hamburgers (I couldn’t even do the cheese), spaghetti, PB&J, pancakes, a few types of cereal, gummy candies, cosmic brownie type snacks, and a handful of other things. It’s honestly not at all difficult once you break the seal…your profound sense of justice and compassion will fortify you.\n\nThat dialogue within the physically disabled community last year about returning one’s cart at the grocery store was EVERYTHING. Even if we use a wheelchair, a cane, have chronic pain, vision impairment etc it’s still our responsibility to make sure our cart gets returned. Whether we need to wait an extra minute to get a parking spot right next to the cart corral for an easy return, take 2 extra minutes to walk it back and 5 minutes to recover from the additional exertion, bring a cane with us so we have something to assist us when walking back without a cart to hold onto, or ask someone for help as we’re leaving the store - there’s no justification for making someone else suffer or experience displeasure because we decided not to return our cart. This is an exercise in “negative utilitarian” ethics and norms. We’re a social species and cooperation and consent are the names of the game.\n\nThat example can clearly be applied to other disabilities, like autism, in the realm of animal exploitation and suffering, climate justice, and every other injustice that veganism addresses. Know better, do better, comrade 🖤\n\nSince you’re into direct action, honest question: How do you justify paying people to kill captive animals for your enjoyment? Do you believe in consent?\n\nThey’re sentient beings and didn’t consent to being confined, force-bred, exploited, and (obvz) killed. Just like you wouldn’t consent to a cop throwing a tear gas canister at you or detaining you in handcuffs…you just wanna be free.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.046305803582062786,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24367834565540156,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26504585902445493,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24173710854886954,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24901077514250813,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24440769232406426,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.004817016510060057,"diet_1":-0.22215351446964374,"diet_2":-0.1342057556944951,"diet_3":-0.1195142900638615,"diet_4":-0.36491762451866333,"diet_5":-0.09499019567253224,"diet_6":-0.04898852794445929,"diet_8":-0.0089222596034233,"diet_9":-0.04619951743128089,"diet_10":-0.20390623394632712,"diet_11":-0.034546877524311036,"diet_13":-0.2967507013804048,"diet_14":-0.08848384058332057,"diet_17":-0.17283783359762772},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

Isn’t urging for systemic change also a moral stance? Advocacy for any form of action, whether it's organizing or altering one's diet, stems from a belief in making a positive impact. Discrediting personal actions like adopting a vegan diet, especially when such choices are gaining enough traction to threaten established industries, overlooks their influence.\n\nTrue activism involves a range of efforts, from personal to political. Dismissing any part of this spectrum misses the nature of change. Every action, small or large, contributes to our collective goal of a healthier planet.
