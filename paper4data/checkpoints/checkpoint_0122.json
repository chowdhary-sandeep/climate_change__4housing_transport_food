You'd always want regenerative braking to be used first and only start using the actual brakes if the car is still not slowing down enough. The driver makes that decision by pressing harder on the brake pedal if they're not stopping fast enough.\n\nFrom the video I really can't figure out the purpose of the switch. They mention the Cadillac ELR where I found this information:\n\n&gt; [The ELR has what Cadillac calls “Regen on Demand,”  which sort of mimics the way the Tesla Model S initiates regenerative braking every time its driver lifts off the throttle. Squeezing and holding either of the steering-wheel paddles triggers this function. It is either on or off, not progressive like a brake pedal, so there is a bit of a learning curve. Regen on Demand decelerates the car at a maximum of 0.20 g, with the brake lights illuminating at 0.12 g and above. At 0.20 g, an ELR would theoretically stop from 70 mph in about 800 feet, versus 173 feet (0.95 g) in a full-brake situation. But the ELR won’t come to a complete stop using only Regen on Demand.](http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2014-cadillac-elr-coupe-plug-in-hybrid-tested-review-regen-on-demand-page-2)\n\nThe Leaf has a separate \"B\" driving mode that causes more regeneration while coasting but the brake pedal is not part of that equation either. You take your foot off of the accelerator and the car simply slows down faster than usual while coasting. It's kind of like downshifting in a manual. It sounds to me like the Chevy Volt feature is just like this but perhaps with a range of control.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2683198553439681,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1823637688045808,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18771811264204707,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16398832206986022,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31269125813239496,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17416926309693173,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01731488010652053,"ev_1":-0.11038993847691171,"ev_2":-0.0403194578223823,"ev_3":-0.009692771180804508,"ev_4":-0.004041928145549416,"ev_5":-0.0515060955270504,"ev_6":-0.08419898497482367},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

EV advocates would rejoice for having another high end halo car they can parade in front of petrol heads, Porsche fans would be happy because it would be better than the Model S in various metrics and so on. But no, we have to hear why EVs are just incapable of matching ICE cars because Porsche couldn't set any lap records with their prototype.

They have cut down to about half their installs from 2 years ago(while the industry has still grown). \n\nI work in the industry, started as an installer 1 for Solar City and moved up to now working as a SR Applications Engineer for the largest racking company in the US outside of Solar City(/zep/tesla whatever you wanna call it)  \n\nIt sounds like what you want to do is be some sort of designer.   If you struggle with math you will probably not like the electrical courses and most of the designers that I know are either graphic design or graphic arts majors that got into design because it was an open job. \n\nAlmost all companies use software that generates the BOM and electrical needs of the system, very few people are sitting there doing electrical design. \n \nTo become a designer I think there are two paths, one is to get into a big enough company that does in house design, and one is to get a job with a contractor that people use to do designs for them and work your way up there.  \n\nSince you already have a degree, I would recommend working for a company to get hands on experience, while telling your boss you want to move into some sort of design roll for projects.  It may require you to transition companies at some point, but it's always best to start inside an industry and know it from the ground up.  If you're going to spend 2-3 years working on schooling, you might as well spend 2-3 years earning good money and moving up, learning and make it that way.  Teach yourself some Autocad at some point and go to a company and say Hey I have tuns of roof or ground experience and I know Autocad, let me be a designer for you.  \n\nI know this seems biased by my personal experience and maybe it is a little bit, but I've seen multiple people follow this same path to design, management or engineering.  \n\nIf at some point you're not making progress and thinking it won't work, I would look into getting your electrical license. \n\nThere are multiple companies that are working on automated design software that will really remove a lot of the need for designers and the roll you're talking about for residential, so I think going towards comercial would be way better. \n\nEdit: Sorry if this was super long winded, and yes, there are tuns of ways to get to various jobs.  I should have said there are two easy paths I've seen as industry trends.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001921748868577803,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0421424600172486,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2613792807031856,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21621321274984004,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12151214222978979,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24993924129287776,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3053778293405776,"ev_1":-0.006258417299250141,"ev_2":-0.0021561799961394477,"ev_3":-0.00025442630067118444,"ev_4":-0.000822351964112992,"ev_5":-0.0003418141144114391,"ev_6":-0.002618670216179453},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

They only tested the Ioniq 5 RWD, but it is likely that the AWD would behave similar as the Kia since they are on the same platform. These have permanently magnetized motorns, which give resistance when freewheeling, but also a clutch that disconnects the front engine in eco mode. The Kia is 105 kg heavier as AWD. \n\nThe Polestar 2 also has PSM motorns, but without any disconnect, and it seems like it suffers a surprisingly large penalty from that. Interesting to see that it is not only the aerodynamics that hurts the range of the Polestar, but also the drive line. The AWD adds 120 kg here.\n\nEdit: The ID4 and the Enyaq also looses about 15 % with AWD. They use a PSM motor in the back and an induction motor in the front, the latter which should give less resistance when freewheeling. Tesla had the same setup. But that doesn't seem to help VW much in this test. I think previous tests have shown less range loss, so I'm not sure what to believe.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00042216787551296875,"1.1.1_stance":-0.04625187331964611,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26152759393644864,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12861720845103264,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2902145663103713,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2265057472146241,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08701751125045121,"ev_1":-0.12476215914022803,"ev_2":-0.1688008284860795,"ev_3":-0.21225382761529507,"ev_4":-0.008790039025673954,"ev_5":-0.2976395361086664,"ev_6":-0.25398470125335193},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

According to Yahoo, the USA’s “chokepoint filled federal system” is threatening to derail Biden’s radical climate change agenda.\n\n…..\n\n\nThe one thing which is missing from this big green lament is an effort to meaningfully respond to people’s objections – not one ounce of compassion for all the people their climate push is hurting.\n\nWhy are “Democratic state governments cutting gasoline taxes”? The reason is people can’t afford gasoline. Greens would love people to switch to electric vehicles, but most people can’t afford electric vehicles either. Even if people could afford EVs, EVs have serious limitations, like a massive drop in range in cold or hot weather, when power is diverted to heating or cooling. And you better leave your EV on charge if you park it in the frost.\n\nYet instead of pausing to reflect, to ask whether there is anything which can be done to alleviate these problems, greens treat objections as obstructions, and pin their hopes to ramming through their agenda before ordinary people have an opportunity to express their policy direction preferences at the midterms.\n\nEven mild alleviation efforts, such as some less committed “Democratic state governments cutting gasoline taxes”, are seen as backsliding.\n\n➖ The sad part is there are ways greens could meet us halfway, and make real progress towards their goal of reducing CO2 emissions. If greens ditched their insistence on useless renewables, left gasoline vehicles alone for now, and focussed on replacing coal and gas with zero carbon nuclear power, like France did in the 1970s, I would write positive stories about how reasonable greens were being lately, and the massive CO2 emissions reductions they had achieved without messing up anyone’s life. But I think an outbreak of green sanity like that is as unlikely as me witnessing a flock of flying pigs pass my window.\n\nThe inability of deep greens to compromise even slightly is their undoing. The total inability of greens to empathise with and try to help the people they hurt is their downfall.

Yes, the trip planner can be more accurate for sure due to all the factors you mention.  My frustration with Tesla is squarely in the fact the estimated range is suddenly much more realistic when based on reality at a lower state of charge.  It’s complete deception to use an optimistic algorithm and change to an accurate one when battery level decreases.

There's not really a problem with supply but costs would be huge, much less the oft-overlooked **additional costs of infrastructure** upgrade/extension.\n\nThere's also the problem that solar really no longer \"works\" (financially) when you scale it up.\n\nEven if you **entirely IGNORE** the fact that *additional* infrastructure is needed  (both to accommodate the additional ever-fluctuating diurnal nature of solar power being pumped into the grid, as well as provide backup/reserve power capacity for nights/cloudy periods)...\n\nThe current way that electricity is priced -- based on kWh \"consumed\" -- allows a **minority** of \"solar\" households to essentially have a \"free ride\" on the infrastructure (i.e. the household with panels fully expects that the power generated will effectively defray all or nearly all of their utility-bill, not merely generating more kWh than they use, but generating extra so that they can defray their base \"connection\" charges).\n\nThat equation no longer \"works\" once the number of \"solar\" homes is beyond the trivial. The utilities still need to (somehow) cover the costs of maintaining the grid -- and eventually that means a \"tipping point\" will be reached where they will have NO CHOICE but to shift the cost burden from a kWh billing basis over to the per household \"base connection\".\n\nWhich then entirely \"undermines\" all of the oh-so-cute 20+ year \"return on investment\" (which was always a marginal &amp; somewhat dubious \"calculation\") of all of the early-adopters who thought they were going to have $0.00 annual electric bills in perpetuity.\n\n**The politicians -- like Hillary et al -- then face a nasty twofold \"backlash\" situation, either:**\n\n1. Pass laws that PREVENT the utility companies from shifting the cost-basis -- in order to \"save\" that ROI equation of all of the already-installed solar.\n\n2. Allow the cost-shifting, and thus cause the ROI on the solar to be revealed as untenable, and the whole thing as being some really BAD long term investment.\n\nDoing #1 will invariably end up being seen as \"pandering to the rich\" -- and will have the knock on effect of overburdening anyone without solar. From the \"green\" perspective that may *seem* attractive -- but from a *political* perspective all it really does is pissing off anyone who either doesn't HAVE solar (mainly poor people), and/or whose solar isn't \"performing\" up to the claims (i.e. the northern half of the country, basically anyone outside of the \"sun belt\").\n\nDoing #2 doesn't work very well either -- it means essentially \"betraying\" the greenies (and the \"rich\" and/or \"sun belt\") -- which isn't politically great either.\n\nThey could try to \"mitigate\" the burden of #1 by handing out additional \"energy assistance\" to \"poor people\" -- but that money has to come from somewhere in the budget as well (either some other taxation, or else massive additional borrowing... which can only go on so long, especially as *other* budget stuff will be demanding similar increases).\n\n---\n\nEDIT: BTW the same kind of \"free ride\" problem exists with the financial/cost/ROI justification for electric cars.  \n\nSo long as the number of such vehicles is trivial on a % basis, then it works \"fine\" in terms of avoiding not only the cost of gas, but the cost of gas taxes that pay for the roads, and the knock on effect of sucking power from the grid at a cheap cost (or purportedly \"free\" at so called \"supercharger sites).  But if/when the number of such vehicles ever becomes substantial, well the effect of a large number of \"free riders\" begins to become both noticeable AND problematic (the maintenance of the roads still has a \"cost\" and the funds to pay for that must come from *somewhere*). \n\nEnd result is that either some other \"per vehicle\" or \"per mile\" taxation is imposed, OR some equivalent of the \"gas tax\" gets placed on the per kWh charging (including at the formerly \"free\" charging sites in addition to any \"home\" charger).\n\nAnd likewise Option #1 above -- the overburdening of the \"per kWh\" system -- also increases the costs of recharging electric vehicles at home.\n\n*Can/will they try to displace the charges onto DAYTIME power users? Onto commercial/industrial users?* Sure, undoubtedly they will attempt to do so -- but that's not tenable long term either; businesses &amp; factories aren't an \"endless\" source of funds, in fact they tend to be a LOT more \"sensitive\" to such costs than the general household: small businesses will cease operations (increasing unemployment, reducing GDP) and large corporations will seek other means (government exemptions, subsidies, etc)... effectively negating the gains that were imagined.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06947672188592453,"1.1.1_stance":-0.4565052959807799,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21062430248326908,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2383699597139704,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2329317324607172,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.005752621160354465,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.27554559097356446,"solar_1":-0.2462023731995771,"solar_2":-0.2428804799558711,"solar_3":-0.33868264262540465,"solar_4":-0.24538448420206557,"solar_5":-0.11870166667256862,"solar_6":-0.12328722172750531,"solar_7":-0.08254747303281462,"solar_8":-0.04522849961032109,"solar_9":-0.037561110814174015,"solar_10":-0.2039867393338065,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.04360349476337433},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author expresses opposition to solar energy due to the financial and infrastructure challenges associated with its widespread adoption.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I live in CA and SolarCity will offer SMUD customers (the local utility) a .104 kw/h starting rate with the escalator, while PGE customers (which is a much larger statewide utility company) at .165 kw/h.

Some cheap charge controllers might not work at this low voltage - it would be odd though. Most controllers won't charge the battery if the batteries get below 11 or 10.5 volts. This is way too low and a special charge needs to be put on the battery - it's called a soft charge. Some controllers will do this for you. \n\nAlso - 160 watts is 9 amps an hour.

Amps × time is energy. So if your pump only uses 3 Amps and it runs for a few minutes at a time you wont need too much in solar power or batteries.  But small continuous loads will be much more of a problem.   Most invertors on standby will use one amp that would be 24 Amp hours a day. Average production  of solar is 5 times the peak output. For example: 120 Watts of PV @ 12 Volts would provide 10 Amps the Daily average would be 50 Amp hours or 600 Watt hours. So a 3 Amp pump run intermittently for a total of 10 minutes would only use a half an Amp hour.   \nWhen I was running an AC pump with a pressure switch I used a continuous duty solenoid to provide power to the inverter so it wouldn't use energy until needed. \nWhen your on solar and batteries saving energy is usually far more economical than maximizing production. \n\nI run my entire home including deep well pump, refrigerator and big screen TVs with 2 kW of PV and 12 6 Volt golf cart batteries.  It works great until a little problem that wastes energy runs down batteries.  Leak on a toilet that cost nothing but time to identify and $5 dollars to fix saved me hundreds in not having to add panels or replace batteries.  \n\nAn investment in an energy  production and monitoring devices such as Bogart Engineering's Pentametric system is fairly expensive but will allow you to measure real energy production and use to optimize a mobile or home PV and battery equipment.  Even has alarms and relays to start a generator as needed. \nBut cheaper monitoring can provide you with plenty of information. If you keep track of battery voltage, amps produced and used you should be able to affordably have solar meet your needs. Nice feature of PV modules is you can start small and add more if needed. \nDon't forget to check and maintain your batteries.

The more important numbers are the kilowatt hours it produces at the end of the year.  That is a more accurate sample size.  Solar panels very rarely run at peak efficiency outside of a laboratory.  That is a given.  But if the equation says that this solar panel on an ideal roof is supposed to produce XYZ kwh a year based on the angle and azimuth, and it produces that, who cares about the efficiency.

They are **not significantly radioactive**...Uranium mill tailings typically **also contain chemically hazardous heavy metal such as lead and arsenic**. **Vast mounds of uranium mill tailings are left at many old mining sites**, especially in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.\n\nAlthough mill tailings are not very radioactive, **they have long half-lives. Mill tailings often contain radium, thorium and trace amounts of uranium.**\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nArguing that the majority of waste from nuclear power plants isn't radioactive without mentioning what that waste is actually made up of is being disingenuous. Who cares if it's not radioactive if it's as toxic as lead and arsenic but lasts much longer?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13508967296007057,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19177837719899876,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17599094817713945,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19438139841737562,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30611058317853856,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20147595009351577,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24352266771683162,"solar_1":-0.08815268955087656,"solar_2":-0.25541756180609276,"solar_3":-0.07909224598855165,"solar_4":-0.018981152809935925,"solar_5":-0.05206023983265866,"solar_6":-0.04142147717512324,"solar_7":-0.2021766462518523,"solar_8":-0.035387192464744054,"solar_9":-0.09443793361522414,"solar_10":-0.16748415505581796},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (injunctive norm): \"they have long half-lives.

I haven’t downvoted you btw.\n\nYour first questions I’m not all that agreeable with - 1. What do I get get out of opposing the idea of man-made climate change? 2. What’s in it for me personally? One at a time..\n\n1. I could simply answer that by saying there’s lots of evidence to prove the entire theory is a hoax. But I’d say you’re looking for something deeper. I would suggest that you revisit my original post, spend a few minutes understanding it, and a few minutes more watching the video clips and reading the articles. In addition, I would say this: The UN IPCC are the leading proponent of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). So what has one of their leading executives said about AGW? This -\n\n“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore. We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate change policy.”\n\nI’ll spell out what that means: Climate change and AGW has virtually nothing to do with the environment, and everything to do with enforcing a massive redistribution of wealth from rich nations to poor nations. It’s a massive, global socialist program. And THAT explains the ideological divide among political parties - the left advocate for climate action, tax subsidies for renewables and carbon credits. The right is against this ‘cos they recognise the scam.\n\n2. What’s in it for me personally? I could simply answer that by saying I don’t support a hoax. But more importantly, as a worker and father running a household, I don’t want to be taxed for a hoax via increased electricity prices.\n\n3. What negative things would come as a result of moving to renewable, clean energy. \n\nMy answer to that comes in two parts. On the one hand, the fact the world is moving away from fossil fuels is a good thing. But not because of the Co2 released by using them, but because of less pollution and cleaner air. Nothing at all wrong with that. However, when it comes to current renewables, I have two issues. a) Cost and reliability. Right now, electricity produced via wind turbines and solar panels costs more and only work when the wind blows or sun shines. b) The waste problem they will create into the future will be astronomical. Wind turbine blades cannot be recycled and end up in land fill. Solar panels are chocka-full of toxic chemicals. The average life span of a solar panel is 20-25 years. There are literally millions of them. The bulk of them too will end up in land fill. Until renewable technology advances and improves, the climate change scare is creating a huge future waste problem. We should be investigating more in nuclear now, not renewables. Nuclear is 100% emission free, reliable base load power. That said, if we redirected the some of the multi billions being spent to prove and solve a problem that doesn’t exist (AGW) into new power technologies, we’d then develop an even better and safer clean energy option to nuclear. Hope all this helps.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0022454134693058827,"1.1.1_stance":-0.35270829879305476,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21720530249509515,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23658585533645438,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20920317203523403,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.04276227687175075,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24058688351904997,"solar_1":-0.13370330853433102,"solar_2":-0.20410149708767666,"solar_3":-0.16406319510012204,"solar_4":-0.1600279211149124,"solar_5":-0.17791340562932115,"solar_6":-0.05717062911086638,"solar_7":-0.07374795743089635,"solar_8":-0.11763013396011957,"solar_9":-0.007961189168469218,"solar_10":-0.0798395440189565},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed (The author expresses support for clean energy but opposes specific renewable technologies and the climate change narrative, and expresses skepticism towards the anthropogenic cause of climate change)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Honestly, it's seriously amazing that you have the means to utilize green power in your everyday life, and that's something that myself and I'm sure many others on here aspire to do.\n\nThe issue is that green energy is far less accessible than plant-based eating. That upsets me; in a better world, environmentally-sound practices would be available to everyone who is willing (like plant-based food is in many cases), but in this world, those of us from low-income rural or urban areas do not and unfortunately will not have access to change the type of energy we have to live on, not until major movements are made to make renewable resources cheaper and more widespread (which is currently what my family and I are banking on, we really want to try to be able to afford it without starving). Some of us don't live in places where renewable energy is available. Some of us simply can not afford to buy a Tesla, or to refit our roofs with solar panels, or even just to forego using powered transportation at all, and that sucks majorly. But there are things we can change.\n\nThings that I personally believe should be championed because they are easily accessible to most people are the easier personal lifestyle changes, such as veganism, not the buying of a hybrid car or other more expensive options. But because (I assume, and I apologize and will amend it if this assumption is incorrect) you are in a situation where you can afford the greener power, it is beyond likely that you can also handle simply not paying for animal agriculture, which is a pretty dang easy way to be consistent in your brave fight against personal drivers of climate change. \n\nAfter all, while it is all too true that the greatest drivers are overpopulation, common transportation, and non-renewable energy sources, another that does come close is living a plant-based lifestyle--this change is among the top 6 differences a person can make in their lives to reduce their carbon footprint by greater than 0.8 tCO2e (tons of carbon dioxide equivalent). My source for this is [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/four-lifestyle-choices-most-reduce-your-carbon-footprint).\n\nI don't intend to sound rude when I ask this, but considering your probable stereotypical notion of what vegans are like, it might: why tear down our personal changes for the environmentally better if you also celebrate your personal changes for the environmentally better, when both are making fantastic quantifiable differences? It seems someone with as much care as you would want to celebrate any change that improves and/or inspires a lesser carbon impact. I agree the original post's takedown of diets with animal products isn't the best or the kindest, but neither is eating meat when it is unnecessary. We are upset and kind of screaming into the void at times since it seems people aren't even willing to make a \"sacrifice\" (which it isn't even much of one) to lessen their carbon footprint.\n\nTo end my long reply, I want to address why you were \"sworn at\" in this thread. You come on here downgrading our improvements in the near-holy spotlight of your own, which are great, but not accessible to many in the same ways plant-based diets are. To great chagrin, you claim it's hypocritical to demonize a climate change driver while supporting others, somehow not realizing that if we could, oh God how we (as people who went vegan at least in part of environmental concerns) would forego cars and appliances that run on fossil fuels. \n\nAnd no, sir/ma'am/or other, this post was not about animal cruelty, but because climate change should never, *ever* be seen in just facts and statistics, it is also hurting non-human animals and humans and will soon do even more harm: in a roundabout way, if you want to reduce sentient suffering in the future by making sustainable lifestyle changes now (solar energy to reduce personal GHG emissions), you are being morally consistent by preventing suffering *in the* *present* by eating vegan.\n\nTL;DR; At present, it's unfortunately a privilege, not an easy lifestyle change, to go green by way of eliminating fossil fuels. Veganism is a change that almost anyone can and should make, for the reason of caring about their individual carbon footprint. Awesome job with the green energy, I hope to be where you are with that someday soon!

Now if you had eves overhang it wouldn’t be that big of a worry because if it did leak it would be outside. But because you don’t have eves it is very much a concern having water pooling there. \n\nWhy did you choose to go with this method? It’s a lot of extra cost in labour, and it creates potential problems with water, all for the single purpose of having the roofing and solar panels flush at the same height. Also another problem I see could be the solar panels not being able to cool down properly because of the lack of airflow underneath. Solar panels are more efficient the cooler they are. Personally I can’t justify the extra cost, possible leaks, and reduced efficiency all for the aesthetic look of flush roofing and panels. \n\nI would be interested to see how they finish off the bottom going into the gutter after the roofing is on.

People often meet at our place because it's a working kitchen. We're in the south, but there's a community of people that come in and out. \n\nSo, I'd say think about your vegan friends who actually cook, and do small potlucks. We usually have only 1 or 2 other people over unless it's special event. That way, you all get to eat what everyone took part in making and you get to take some home the next day. \n\nIf they're vegan, chances are they're usual their critical thinking skills and are already atheist or whatever you want to call it.

I don't do that at all.  I wonder who does?\n\nIn all seriousness, if you're going to get this butthurt maybe stick inside your /r/the_donald hugbox?  Won't have to worry about any mean old vegans hurting your feelings in there, will you?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002898007963570611,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24900467457271896,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16152107366410157,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14725612352291742,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28349190368916766,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22289159301658157,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0021155724922815957,"diet_1":-0.00044069016197075445,"diet_2":-0.0011537203148085002,"diet_3":-0.000463534007697793,"diet_4":-0.00011942818309762515,"diet_5":-0.00022773475211579353,"diet_6":-0.00011251638898102101,"diet_8":-8.657556918478804e-05,"diet_9":-0.0004923532275521817,"diet_10":-0.0006605490028353719,"diet_11":-0.0006027275388381289,"diet_13":-0.0015544588980750025,"diet_14":-0.0039145709173074765,"diet_17":-0.0004912548126109565,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.030084620494017146},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against (the author's comments are condescending and arrogant towards non-vegans)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Every moment longer that one makes someone resist by being a preachy asshole about veganism *means more animals killed/eaten by that person*, and any vegan with a shred of logic should understand this.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1066157187313949,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2468011310378312,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2082545347250092,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.05422372184693813,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19972741254709175,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2904956898513894,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.022958159369106095,"diet_1":-0.00729260789618517,"diet_2":-0.1811867565513866,"diet_3":-0.10934495807694589,"diet_4":-0.006693992683722172,"diet_5":-0.012436504092571946,"diet_6":-0.007954071479010357,"diet_8":-0.0015131373863065771,"diet_9":-0.0010243204354386155,"diet_10":-0.021586859991657548,"diet_11":-0.006304563824717964,"diet_13":-0.01800177757104393,"diet_14":-0.04010386706067948,"diet_17":-0.0035021906363302455,"1.1.1_stance_lack_recheck":-0.293345358222723},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I switched her to dairy-free milk since it has a longer shelf life which is better for how infrequently she uses it. Another example --- I've turned several people on to dairy-free Ben and Jerry's ice cream because it just tastes good and I don't want stores to stop carrying it, so I tell everyone to buy it to keep the demand high so it's always available for me lol. Others have switched to vegan burgers for their health based on things I've shown them, and they feel the taste is comparable enough to substitute a vegan burger every now and then.

This might mean eggs, chicken, fish, whatever - eggs from a backyard chicken that scratches for weeds, bugs &amp; the occasional feed, the eggs they'll just drop from time to time, or cows &amp; other ruminants that graze - whatever. That's an issue as you're probably not going to support a population that want beef with every meal with that plan, the production just isn't high enough.\n\nThe problem is for folks (and really, very few if any full-on vegans and vegetarians have said this) for whom the hairshirt argument is their first &amp; only go-to.
