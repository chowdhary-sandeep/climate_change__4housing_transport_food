"comment": "I'm aware of these stations. The problem is that right now during this undecided time of battery vs fuel cells, batteries have the advantage in charging availability. If I were to buy a leaf right now, I could charge it at home with no additional hardware purchases. I could just plug it into any socket in my garage and it will charge. This reduces the cost of adoption for battery electric. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love hydrogen but right now it's just not as good as battery electric.",

Many charging stations are on-street facilities provided by electric utility companies, mobile charging stations have been recently introduced. Some of these special charging stations provide one or a range of heavy duty or special connectors and/or charging without a physical connection using parking places equipped with [inductive charging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging) mats.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/6mSAzF3.jpg) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tesla_Roadster_at_recharge_station.jpg) - *A Tesla Roadster Sport being charged at an electric charging station in Iwate, Shizuoka, Japan.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Electric ^vehicle ^network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle_network) ^| [^Electric ^vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle) ^| [^Nissan ^Leaf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf) ^| [^Plug-in ^hybrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid) \n\n*^\\/u/hb9nbb ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cffrk7p) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cffrk7p)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 57625:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1xyhvh/why_is_a_wall_box_needed_for_faster_charging_of_a/cffrk3i)",

"comment": "&gt; You're missing the point, most people buy trucks to fill a certain role, a role that a BEV cannot currently fill ... everyone I know who drives a pickup truck could not have their needs met by a BEV pickup.\n\nYou and I know completely different groups of people, then.\n\nI grew up in a large ag-town where every other car on the road was a full sized pickup.  Most of them were used for commuting to high school, or commutting to work.\n\nYou had a truck because \"it's normal\", and so you could occasionally haul big things.\n\nI think you overestimate the percentage of full-sized truck owners who actually use them as serious full time workhorses, and underestimate how many are basically \"huge commuters\"\n\n&gt; My parents tow an RV trailer from state to state or regularly haul thousands of pounds of equipment to their cabin 400+ miles away, my sister's BF hauls around motorcycles from state to state to trick-ride in shows, the neighbor south of me regularly goes hunting in mountains that are a couple hundred miles away, a neighbor north of me owns a ranch that's in those same mountains, some people haul horse trailers from a winter home to a summer home, some people haul boats to lakes that are hundreds of miles away, some people have giant RV trailers that would reduce the range of a BEV to nothing... I could go on and on. The energy requirement for trucks is simply too high for them to be powered by batteries in any kind of real world use. The battery tech simply isn't there yet.\n\nYou just listed a whole bunch of things that people you know do that are not suitable for *ANY* BEV. The fact that we're talking about trucks is entirely irrelevant.\n\nIt sounds like you live somewhere quite rural, with wilderness-loving friends and family. That's *great*, and no BEV works well for that lifestyle yet.\n\nThe target markets for BEVs (and that would be the markets for a BEV truck) are *NOT* that market.\n\n&gt; Those S10 conversions are almost always already at gross payload.\n\nJust like the [Ford Ranger EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ranger_EV), the [Chevy S-10 EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_S-10_EV) was not a conversion. It was a manufactured vehicle sold as-new by Chevrolet.\n\nThe S-10 with lead acid batteries has a [951lb payload](http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2012/04/remembering-the-97-98-chevy-s-10-ev.html).  Not quite a half-ton like the ICE S-10, but close.\n\nI can't find the numbers, but I'd suspect the NiMH batteries (again as a factory option) would've given you the full half ton, in addition to more range and battery acceleration",

"comment": "&gt; It takes around 300kWh to create hydrogen needed to fill up Toyota Mirai (5 kgs), and Mirai can do 300 miles. With 300kWh, electric car can do 900 miles. Is wasting 2/3 of energy green?\n\nMost electricity is generated between [30%-45% efficiency](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=107&amp;t=3), so 300 kWh of energy only generates say 100 kWh of electricity, take away [6.5%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission#Losses) to deliver to the home, and 10% for battery charge/discharge.  You're left with ~85 kWH which drives a Tesla around 300 miles in good conditions.\n\nSo hydrogen is green compared to most grid power.  It's certainly not dirty at least.\n\nCompared to solar panels it's still fairly green, because the 'battery' in a hydrogen storage system is very cheap compared to the battery needed to store the power in electricity so you can buy more generation to make up for some of the storage loss.",

"comment": "If we apply the greatest tool we have, namely common sense, it would mean that the rest of the price is from transportation of raw materials, manufacturing, packaging and again transportation to the consumer (in this case Tesla as they still source most of their batteries from other manufacturers) with the added extra so that the manufacturer can make a profit, can't forget that. Additionally, one has to think about the other parts required, you can't just throw the batteries inside, you need to arrange them in a certain manner, use materials to connect them, install a temperature monitor as well as a way to heat or cool them when needed. This will also add to the final price for cars. \n\nThe good news is that the part of the costs that doesn't include the raw materials can be lowered by competition and production at larger scale. The less good news is that the part that does include the raw materials cannot ever be lowered more than what the market has to offer. If that's the case, one can assume that without a chemistry change, the price can never be lower than the raw materials, again using common sense. The only exception to this would be for world governments to subsidies them.",

But, I'd much rather have a charger at a dealer than no charger at all.\n\nAnd not all dealers are in outer Mongolia.  Many are on commercial streets within walking distance of at least a restaurant or strip mall.  Worst case, I spend an hour in the service lounge sipping free coffee while my car charges.\n\n&gt; GM might like to see more chargers installed, but they haven't allocated any money to make that happen. The company seems like it wants taxpayers or other charging companies to pay for the infrastructure.\n\nExactly.  The network is already getting built.  GM doesn't run a chain of gas stations, either.  Why is it a requirement they get into the charging business when others are already doing it?\n\nThat's why the open standard was developed - so that many companies can participate.  There are already 1500+ SAE plugs in the US, with lots more to come.  Some were installed by car companies, some by charging companies, some by hotels, some by governments.  Many are pitching in, and everyone benefits.\n\nContrast that to Tesla, who installed and maintains all 2100 Supercharger plugs.  Perhaps it is good business for them, perhaps not.  Still, it is infrastructure they have to continually maintain.  And, as the Model 3 comes on line, they will have to expand that network to keep customers happy.",

"comment": "So, if we logically follow this argument...\n\nCurrently, the highest density mobile hydrogen pressure vessel is the one in the Mirai with two 85kg canisters (including piping) to store 5kg of hydrogen. Considering the efficiency of a PEM fuel cell of around 60%, that means you're storing about 100kWh of recoverable energy in about 200kg of canisters+fuel, or about 500 Wh/kg. That is only very marginally better than the 400Wh/kg achievable with batteries - especially if you consider the added weight of the fuel cell, piping, cooling and other subsystems. And of course, most batteries in EVs are lower density, but much the same can be said about practical hydrogen implementations.\n\nEven the claimed improvement in pressure vessel weight of the Nikola One will not really fix this too much. \n\nYou'll see much the same applies if you look at system cost. A fuel cell could theoretically only cost $30/kW, but currently costs 10x that. High (peak) power applications get only marginal benefits from fuel cells. Fuel cells are also not really getting cheaper over time, while batteries are (massively so).\n\nEnergy density is not a particularly good argument for hydrogen. Yes, it is for just the gaseous hydrogen, but not for the *entire fuel cell and storage system*. Hydrogen only really excels in energy density at low pressure, where you can just fill a big balloon (or underground cave, or spent natural gas field, or undersea pressure vessel) with the stuff.\n\nIn the Orkney example, I can see a decent case for hydrogen for the ferries. Fast refueling times do count for a lot, cheap renewables offset much of the cost of producing hydrogen and seaborne vehicles are not particularly bound by volume or weight restrictions. But I can imagine a battery-based system could work similarly well if designed to the task. Not because I know exactly the technical details, but because fuel cell and pure battery tech is already pretty close on these scales.",

I've done the calculations in the past and with my C-Max averaging around 130MPGe or 4mi/kwh in the warmer months the electric cost is half that of gas for the same distance traveled for a car getting between 40-45mph. Going down to 25mpg gets closer to 1/4 the cost. It's to the point that my daily commute that fits within the 20-22mi AER, the cost to charge at home just blends in with the normal month to month bill fluctuations.\n\nAnd the fact that EVs are completely energy agnostic is a BIG benefit. As the grid cleans up, so do EVs. And if a homeowner decides to go solar, that is an immediate boost to indirect 'fuel' economy from the wall.",

No grease or any of the other messy things associated with chains.\n\nIf you're talking actual ebike (the ones you can ride without a license) you'll find a great number of them have neither; they often use a hub motor.",

"comment": "Tesla has a long track record of not supporting off grid installations - their PowerWalls aren't typically rated for off grid use either, which... I interpret that as a vote of no confidence in the systems.\n\nOff grid systems tend to be more custom, and tend to have people who want to actually understand the system they'll be living from.  Tesla's market is more \"bog standard houses on waiting lists,\" and \"people who want to write really, really big checks so they can say they have Tesla hardware on their house and in their garage.\"\n\nThey can't deliver on a schedule either, which is a problem when you're looking to power an off grid house sometime within a few month window of the rest of it being complete (or, likely, before, so you can use the power to build it).\n\nI just don't see why you'd want to pay the Tesla tax for an off grid system that you can't repair yourself, can't see the data from, and generally can't rely on.\n\nIf you're living off grid, a \"Two is one, one is none\" approach to hardware, with enough knowledge about it to be able to bypass and reconfigure things, is a wise way to go.",

"comment": "&gt; Hydrogen can be produced whenever energy costs are low. EV requires charging on demand\n\n\nSure, but EVs can also be dynamically charged whenever costs are low or used to balance the grid by giving power back to the grid when demand is high.\n\n\nObviously that's not going to suit all EV users, but the majority of cars spend 20+ hours a day sat parked doing nothing at home, a place of work or parked on a street or car-park somewhere. Left plugged in and signed up to a vehicle-to-grid storage services they could provide a massive network to support improved balancing of the grid (and as an incentive could be offered reduced charge costs or earn money for allowing the grid to use their battery as a source at peak demand). \n\n\nMaybe it's overly optimistic but I don't think the excess power produced by the likes of solar is some big issue that Hydrogen is by default better placed to solve than EVs.\n\n\n&gt; [Open Energi’s](https://theenergyst.com/electric-vehicles-provide-11gw-flexible-capacity/) analysis is based on one of National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios, the most optimistic ‘two degrees’ forecast in which investment in green technology is high in order to avoid overshooting climate targets.\n\n&gt; Under that scenario, it suggests that by 2020, with an estimated 1.6 million EVs on the road, some 200-550MW of turn-up flexibility would exist at different times of day. Some 400MW-1.3GW of turn-down flexibility could also be unlocked from smart-charging. Available volumes would depend upon charging patterns throughout the day.",

"comment": "I understand that a PHEV doesn't NEED to be charged, however they do if your goal is to avoid burning gas and contributing to global warming.\n\nWe started with a Honda Fit BEV that had a rated range of 85 miles. The other BEV available at the time was the Leaf, with only slightly longer range. The Honda got crashed, and both daughters asked me not to get another BEV because they felt trip planning/charging was too difficult. This was before the Bolt came out. So it came down to replacing the Honda with an ICE or a PHEV. We got a Volt.\n\nWhen my daughter was commuting to college, she needed to recharge at school in order to make the round trip totally electric, which was our goal: try to drive totally electric so as not to contribute to global warming. There were only two charging ports for the entire campus. One port was used by a faculty member to charge their Leaf. It was left plugged in all day. The other port was available most days, but not all the time.\n\nKeep in mind that the Volt has a slow on board charger: it takes 4 hours to charge the car when plugged into a level 2 charger ( there were no 110 volt plugs available on campus ) despite the small battery.\n\nSo, the choices were to tie up the remaining port for four hours, or to simply drive home using gas. But most of the time, the second port wasn't used by anyone else, so kind of a waste to burn gas when there was a charger available most of the time. So, sometimes she charged and sometimes she had to burn gas. Exactly what the Volt was designed to do! \n\nBut there's no doubt that tying up the second port sux if someone in a BEV needs the charge to get home.  Solvable by leaving a \"if you need to plug in\" card on the car, which I would be willing to do, but as a young girl she was reluctant to leave her phone number in public.\n\nWould be nice if the Chargepoint app gave you a way to send a request to a cars owner requesting to unplug... But of course the real solution is more chargers and longer range cars. I have a long range Model 3, and I never plug in away from home because I have the range to make the round trip ( or supercharge ). I'm happy to leave the level 2 chargers for the shorter range cars, but this continues to be an issue for the Volt...",

"comment": "The flat parts before 2017?  You mean the huge ramp up in sales since the early 2000s?  Flat for a few years before 2017?  Maybe because starting in the early 2010's, the US went on a buying spree for larger vehicles; something Toyota wasn't exactly excelling at.  But oh geeze, it was flat, while they were selling nearly 10 million vehicles per year and owned about 12-13% of the entire global new vehicle market.  \n\nLike listen to yourself.  You're trying to argue that Toyota was in a downtrend because their sales were flat while sitting up around 10 million sales per year.  They're in a downtrend if they don't continue growing market share in a market with a finite amount of demand.  Like, Toyota is failing if they're not literally killing every other OEM on the planet.  That's silly talk.\n\nAh yes, the best and the brightest... they all want to work for Tesla, the best car company ever!.... right until they quit and go to another company.  Funny because it's true.\n\nElon's share is based on valuation, yes, that's true.  I wonder how a company builds valuation.  Hmmm...  Maybe someone advertises for the company on twitter, and in interviews.  Maybe someone makes up amazing lies about the timelines for his vehicles and technology, like the $35k model 3 which didn't even last a year, like Tesla Semi in 2019, Tesla roadster in 2020, feature complete FSD by 2019 that'll earn Tesla car owners $30k per year where \"it's basically crazy to buy another car\", 1 million Robotaxis in 2020, 20 million sales per year by 2030 wiping multiple established OEMs out of the game.  \n\nMeanwhile, as we know, Musk was busy using all of his Tesla and SpaceX shares as collateral to get massive low interest loans from the bank (paying income taxes is for suckers), which he then used the loan money to buy more Tesla shares, and push the stock price up... which no doubt had a large part to play in the short squeezes that Tesla was going through, leading to higher valuations, that resulted in huge stock options bonuses.  Fun!\n\nHonestly, if it wasn't for carnival barkers like Elon Musk, I don't think any other large OEM CEO would bother spending as much time in the limelight as they have been recently.  They think they have to compete with Musk in this way; making a spectacle of themselves.  I think they're wrong about that.  Know what I do appreciate about the CEO's of large OEMs... they're ok with paying employees to work... while Musk wants to replace those employees with robots and keep all the moneys for himself.\n\nYou do realize it's ok to mess around with other technologies, right?  Last I heard, Toyota didn't convert all of their plants, or even a single plant, over to build hydrogen combustion engines.  Developing tech is not manufacturing tech; unless the developments show promise.  Frankly, what people like you don't seem to understand is that not all regions in the world have easy access to renewable energies, and hydrogen may still make sense in many applications like ships, semi trucks, airplanes, and RVs.",

"comment": "Seems to be that the Russian invasion of Ukraine had very intentional reasons; namely it's putting a huge amount of pressure on Europe's manufacturing and energy sectors, and could help push the West into recession.\n\nUkraine isn't just a pathway for Russian fossil fuel gas pipelines.  They're a net electricity exporter to multiple European nations, and one of the first things Russia did was go after the Nuclear plants.  (Russia wasn't happy that Ukraine was trying to sign fuel contracts for their nuclear plants with other nations)\n\nCutting off those energy exports to Europe, means that energy deficit needs to be made up somehow.  Well Europe doesn't want to startup their nuclear plants, so they're relying on Coal / Natural gas to make up the deficit, making Russia shutting down their natural gas pipeline to Europe far more critical a move.\n\nIn terms of BEVs, I imagine the main European battery factory (LG in Poland) is likely using Russian Nickel to produce NCMA cells.  Russia's the third or fourth largest producer of Nickel.  I wouldn't be surprised if Ukraine is using Russian copper for the wiring.  Russia's the eight largest copper producer.\n\nOh and btw, Russia's also the third largest producer of aluminum...\n\nOddly enough...every move Russia is making seems to be benefiting China.  They're essentially handing China a bigger foothold in the global vehicle industry and increasing justification to allow greater imports of Chinese vehicles to Europe.  Russia may have shutoff Europe's raw material supply, but they're seemingly increasing their raw material exports to China.  Could it be that Russia's trying to transfer more economic power to China from the West?\n\nNow you have Europeans freaking out about fuel prices and wanting to rush out and buy a BEV no matter what the markup... but European companies can't produce many, so where will they turn?  Oh right, the huge flood of Chinese vehicles.  Do people not realize this could cause a huge transfer of manufacturing from the West to China, forcing large European manufacturing layoffs?\n\nI'm sure there's a lot of reasons Russia invaded.  They probably have a nice big whiteboard of Pros and Cons for invading Ukraine.  They knew there would be sanctions.  They knew the ruble would be devalued.  They seem to have figured it was worth it over the long run being that their economy relies heavily on fossil fuels and they need to divest.\n\nAnd don't be surprised if Russia come's out like a bandit in this. Russia knew they were invading months ago, which essentially means Russia was one of the largest insider traders on the planet over the past few months.  What stocks do you think they were buying?  Oil prices were incrementally increasing throughout December and January before soaring with the invasion, and then there was suddenly a steep sell off; as if a major player sold a huge chunk of oil futures.  Wonder who that was. ;)",

"comment": "That doesn't really help the case. More discharging into the grid means you have to charge your battery more often, which means it sirens the battery life. And again, you can set it but it still means you have to charge more frequently, and setting a high limit reduces the effectiveness of this program. A big problem with EVs at the moment is how long it takes to charge. There are fast charging stations but those again wear out the battery more. And still take longer than coming up with gas. As an anecdote, on multiple occasions I've had to leave my job for an emergency. I had to go home early, and if my gas powered car was low, it would take me 5 minutes to fill up. If I had to leave work and was planning to surely charge it at work, I wouldn't be able to go if my better was low. That's an instant unreliability buikt in. Having the grid drawing power is adding to this. You're left with the problem of either seeing a low limit to benefit from the money and assistance to the grid, but having a gamble that you'll need to drive more than you thought and now can't. It you set it high which reduces your incentive and the bandit to the grid with less loss of reliability. Making the grid dependent on something like car batteries seems really fragile.",

I make clear that I just want to know the price and if it's actually available, and they usually still try to get me to come in.  I repeat that I just want to know what I asked first, and almost always the EV6 isn't actually available and they want me to come in and order one (I've already got an EV6 at MSRP ordered), and when the EV6 is available there's at least a $10,000 markup.  \n\nOn a side note I've had virtually identical experiences looking at the Mach-E and Ioniq 5, so it's not just a Kia problem.

Auto manufacturers will probably offer the ability to swap out the plugs. Dealerships would probably salivate over the idea of being able to charge a premium to retrofit old models of vehicles with NACS. \n\nTesla actually did the inverse and added CCS2 to the Model 3 and Y in late 2018 in Europe. I'm willing to bet that Rivian will be happy to offer a swap out of the plug to owners should they decide to pony up the cost. I mean, the NACS is actually a smaller port than CCS 2, so it's not like there won't be extra space to do it.",

IF the \"kilowatts\" figure corresponds to a number of fingers and toes, that's level 2 AC. \n\nIf they are DC fast chargers, most are NOT compatible. It's because in the 2000s, Tesla needed to GO NOW! and SAE was dragging their feet on setting a charging standard (some say: the other automakers were doing this deliberately to screw Tesla). So Tesla was all like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu\\_hw963AG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_hw963ag4)\n\nI think the other automakers thought that would go badly for Tesla, but earlier this year, Ford said \"Tesla was right, we're switching ports\" *and also signed agreements for access to the Supercharger network for past and future Fords*.  Jaws dropped all over the world, and a week later GM announced the same thing. Mind you, changing GM's mind is like getting a supertanker to do a 180, so I'm pretty sure GM was cued up on this and was just letting Ford be the first mover. SAE also moved to make NACS a real SAE standard. The rest of the industry went Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and a couple months later they started dogpiling in as well.

"comment": "Honestly, you're not going to need to do any suspension, brakes etc work on an ev. Any ev you get will likely be less than 5 years old and shouldn't need a lot of work at all.\n\nSuspension will be the same as ice vehicles, and should be fine for the first 10 years with maybe some minor stuff wearing out if you drive them hard and have a lot of salt.\n\nBrakes are used a lot less on EVs because they use the motor to slow down and regen some power, they may need changing before they wear out because of rust though.\n\nLook at used options, as others have said leaf and bolt will be fine. If you're in a cold climate you won't have the heat related issues leafs have in very warm places.\n\nThey're both kinda meh roadtrip vehicles, the bolt charges slow and the leaf charges slow and has a chademo charge port which is a dying standard. But for daily driving they'll both be brilliant, and they're perfectly capable of roadtrips, it just requires a bit more foresight and longer charging stops.\n\nThe bolt isn't very expensive as far as new vehicles go, but ofc they're even cheaper used, and they won't really have developed a lot of issues. Especially as they've all had their batteries replaced after a recall (there may be some out there who hasn't had a replacement yet, read up on that if you're buying used).",

"comment": "*first few paragraphs from FT:*  \n  \nIn 2017, Hyundai invested $1.15bn in a new factory in Chongqing, south-western China, with the goal of reaching an annual output of 300,000 internal combustion engine cars. \n\nBut six years later, the rapid switch by Chinese consumers to electric vehicles has stalled sales, forcing the carmaker to sell the factory in December for less than a quarter of the investment value. “The Chongqing plant continued to be in the red and China’s auto market is grappling with oversupply,” said Lee Hang-koo at the Jeonbuk Institute of Automotive Convergence Technology, a South Korean research group. “No one was willing to buy the plant at a high price.” \n\nThat plant is one of the hundreds of zombie factories that analysts are predicting over the next decade in the Chinese car market, the world’s biggest across sales, production and, since last year, exports. In 2023, China produced 17.7mn internal combustion engine cars, a 37 per cent fall from its prior peak in 2017, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy. \n\nBill Russo, the former head of Chrysler in China and founder of Automobility, said the “precipitous decline” of internal combustion engine car sales meant as much as half of the industry’s installed capacity — about 25mn out of 50mn units’ annual capacity — was not being used. \n\nWhile some older factories will be repurposed for plug-in hybrids or pure battery electric vehicles, others will never produce another car, posing a problem for both foreign and Chinese companies. Many carmakers in China, Russo said, ultimately face two choices: “Leave the factory mothballed or crank out some volume and send it to Russia, send it to Mexico.”",

"comment": "Hi there, I used to work for SolarCity. All the points you mentioned in your post are typical for solar installers (no upfront cost, fixed rate, they maintain/operate the panels, they pay you for less-than-estimated power production, etc). If your solar system is not street facing and receives good sunlight, the sales rep is probably drooling to get you signed up. Having a prime house like that is rare, you're in a good spot.\n\nOne question you should consider is if your electric usage will go up or down... and the biggest factor for electrical usage is how many people live in the home. Do you plan on having kids or getting married soon (usage will go up)? Will your wife/husband be a stay-at-home spouse (usage will go up)? If you already have spouse/kids, will your kids be grown up and gone within the next 20 years (usage will go down)? Do you plan on retiring within the next 20 years, and thus will be home more often (usage will go up)? Do you plan on owning your own business and working from home (usage will go up)? Do you plan on buying an electric car and charging it at home (usage will go waaaay up)? The amount of people in a house and the amount of time that people are in a house are the two biggest factors in electrical usage. Spend a few minutes thinking about how that will change in the next 20 years.",

He was from somewhere else in Texas, and he was telling me about his home projects: solar panels, geothermal, etc. He pretty much blew my mind away. I guess I had some preconceived ideas about Texans :-) Anyway, he was making his own solar cells and told me that even if he didn't take his own time as cost into account and was importing the cheapest components he could find, he was still not able to beat the price of Chinese solar cells. He said they cost about a third of the cheapest he could do. And this was back in 2010.",

"comment": "Just want to add that by far, the hardest part is the physical installation on the roof. I had the help of two experienced roofers, but none of us had ever installed solar panels. My fathers roof is a 12:12 pitch, and it made things challenging. We ended up using scaffolding and a rope system to pull the panels up one by one. They were mounted directly to the standing seam roof with S-5! N-mini clamps, which are designed to exactly fit our metal roof from asc in kenai. You will have to account for whatever roof type you have. \n\nYou should also know that those microinverters are suitable for modules up to 300 watts or so, clipping is a very minor problem.",

"comment": "If you did not take a look at the [link](http://solar-panels.nz/blogs/news/113728067-usb-battery-banks) in the previous message I would suggest that you take a look. The main point to take away is that some battery banks will allow pass though charging and others will not. From what you have outlined with your project this is going to be an important feature for your battery bank. Check that your battery bank is going to provide the 5V output even when charging via solar panels. If the battery bank you have is able to do this then that great and all that will be needed is to test that the BMS on the battery will charge correctly from solar panels.\n\nThe Voltaic panels output 6V as such with them or whichever panels you end up using, check that your battery bank is able to accept the panels output voltage. The Voltaic panels are nice and easy to setup as they are modular (you can add additional panels to your setup if additional solar input is required) without any soldering by using [Y combiner cables](http://solar-panels.nz/products/voltaic-m3511-splitter). Also, the Voltaic batteries BMS (battery management system) fully supports charging from solar panels.",

The same is true for community solar, and smart controls on thermal devices - a community with a decent bit of solar can rely radically less on external energy inputs, though winter is a challenge - town heating and biomass is a good start.\n\nI'm just sick of the left arguing that, basically, \"We've been talking about carbon and climate for decades, and it hasn't worked, so we have to do the same thing more!\"",

"comment": "It'll always be your own choice. But consider this.\n\nSome countries in Europe, like Denmark and Germany, have already experienced very windy or sunny days on which they had a large excess of renewable energy. They actually paid utilities in other countries to take the excess off their hands. This is likely to happen more often in the future. That excess could be used to charge car batteries at super low cost, maybe even zero.\n\nWhen there is a dearth of renewable energy, the electricity price will go up and EV drivers that don't immediately need the charge in their car's battery may opt to sell it to the grid.\n\nI personally think degradation will not be a big issue, since we're talking about spreading the load over a large number of battery packs, which will not be doing fast charging or discharging. After all, a Tesla PowerWall can stand thousands of cycles over the course of ten years or more without any great degradation, so why couldn't a Tesla Model 3, with exactly the same batteries, be able to do the same?",

If they're cheap enough, perhaps it'll be one of many things they'll do to increase range. \n\nOn the other hand, it seems unlikely that it'll be cheap enough in the near future.

"comment": "Well, looking at the numbers compared to a pier mount system, they're spending about $3k more on concrete by going with a slab instead of piers. But there are some advantages of having a pad instead of piers in terms of maintenance. That's assuming the pad is just underneath the array, which should cost around $11k. \n\nSo there is some price creep, but without sufficient detail, I don't think its anything to cry foul about. For example, the pad could be 30% larger than the array itself to make the site more accessible for the associated dog-and-pony show. But you wouldn't see that kind of mounting technique on a typical 20kW solar array because as you expect, it kills the economics. If they didn't have that subsidy fund, they'd likely look into cheaper alternative designs.",

"comment": "#Abstract\n\nThe electricity mix worldwide has become diversified mainly by exploiting endogenous and green resources. This trend has been spurred on so as to reduce both carbon dioxide emissions and external energy dependency. One would expect the larger penetration of renewable energies to provoke a substitution effect of fossil fuels by renewable sources, in the electricity generation mix. However, this effect is far from evident in the literature. This paper thus contributes to clarifying whether the effect exists and, if so, the characteristics of the effect by source. Three approaches, generation, capacity and demand, were analysed jointly to accomplish the main aim of this study. An autoregressive distributed lag model was estimated using the Driscoll and Kraay estimator with fixed effects, to analyse ten European countries in a time-span from 1990 until 2014. **The paper provides evidence for the substitution effect in solar PV and hydropower, but not in wind power sources**. Indeed, the generation approach highlights the necessity for flexible and controllable electricity production from natural gas and hydropower to back up renewable sources. Moreover, **the results prove that peaks of electricity have been an obstacle to the accommodation of intermittent renewable sources**.",

"comment": "Very biased take! You have a compulsion to portray Enphase as an inferior solution when it’s simply not the case. Why are so many premium solar manufacturers choosing them as the preferred MLPE partner? Where’s the Panasonic / SE optimizer?? Where’s the SE grid-agnostic solution??\nAlso, you’re breezed right over the TJ Rodgers/ Cypress Semi connection, which is like replacing the old mgmt. with the latest, high powered OS...one that’s seasoned and more capable...far more experienced and AGGRESSIVE. The fact is, it’s been just one year...let’s see if your centralized solution retains market share. My bet is on decentralization... all panels will come equipped with a tiny micro built into the frame over time and Enphase is the innovative company shrinking the micro until it disappears!!!\n\nP.s. * You gotta love Enphase becoming SunPower’s exclusive ACM partner.... HUGE bump in market share there (TJ Rodgers). True, I am an Enphase investor, but you don’t seem to appreciate WHY I am an investor- it’s because I saw plainly that their solution is superior and that the company was (is) undervalued. With the addition of new BOD and executive leadership, it was evident that a turnaround was imminent..not rocket science.\n\nLet’s see how it all plays out",

They're also very well-built and get great reviews.\n\n&gt; When it comes to insurance, if a fire starts because of your chinese non-UL listed hardwired EVSE... you're outta luck on a claim.\n\nThat's nonsense, even if they weren't UL listed. There is no law or insurance contract requiring UL listing for consumer products. And your stereotype of Chinese products is outdated. China is the world leader in EVs, PV panels, smartphones and other advanced technology products. China makes more EVs and EV equipment than the rest of the world combined.",

"comment": "9 months is a pretty short amount of time. Model S went from first reveal to first production in \\~3 years, Model 3 in \\~18 months (+ another 6-9 months of production teething issues), Taycan \\~5 years..\n\nFullyCharged did a show [covering an early prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSbWwn_YCr8) of the Lightyear One.\n\nI don't think it's a stretch to call this car solar-powered, with appropriate caveats. Solar is heavily dependent upon favorable conditions; and under **heavily** favorable conditions, it's not unreasonable for this car's solar cells to provide the majority of the energy needed for a typical driver. That's not the case for many previous vehicles that touted \"solar power\", which either had small solar panels that only charged the 12V battery (Prius, Nissan LEAF, Fiskar Karma) or slightly larger solar panels that can provide only a tiny fraction of the actual energy needed to drive the car (Ford C-Max Concept, Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, Toyota Prius Prime, Cybertruck .. ).\n\nUnder prolonged unfavorable conditions, of course, any car with integrated solar will get significantly reduced power from their cells. Overcast conditions, northern latitudes, frequent parking under trees, buildings, or garages, etc .. there's a reason the Lightyear One and the Sono Sion support level 2 charging and CCS.\n\nI think there's a place for the Lightyear One as a halo vehicle demonstrating what is possible - not unlike the original Tesla Roadster. There are plenty of excellent conventional EVs available; plenty of room for new products that fit a small niche.",

"comment": "I disagree, I think the more you can run DC the easier, since you battery and solar generation is going to be DC you don't have to invert to AC. The conversation process alone uses a lot of energy. That's why boats and etc use a lot of DC or all DC. No need to convert. I think you should run both but I would choose DC in a lot of cases. Since this is off grid recreational cabin how different of usage would this be compared to a decent size boat or RV in regards to power consumption and need? Do you know what your average power usages/consumption would be?\n\nI do agree with the propane about and taxes comment for generator fuel. I also would suggest if you are on a gulf island look at adding a small wind Mill or 2. A lot of sailboats generate more power this way. They will have one or two solar panels and a wind mill. I imagine you will almost always have a see breeze even at night, you could do a solar array and add wind generation as well oversize the generation a little bit on both and oversize the battery some and skip the generator.\n\nA just fyi when I say wind generation here is a small example of what I mean. You can get different sizes and different ratings. \n\nYaeTek 400W Wind Turbine Generator DC 24V Wind Turbine Generator 3 Blades with Controller https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JN23B3W/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_dNjeEbN453VB8\n\nThey aren't really that big and you can get charge controllers that support both wind and solar if you did a good solar array enough to power the place and then added wind generation you could power fully sustainable and not worry about fuel for a generator at all.",

"comment": "I would suggest to slowly increase your battery storage by adding your own lithium batteries over time. So you can eventually get to the point where you won’t need to worry about the grid power and you won’t need to worry about cycling your batteries. By slowly increasing your system you are investing in your future for complete independence of power. With the current unprecedented printing of money globally the next 5-10 years are going to be tough. If you can secure your own electricity, water and a lot of your own food, you will be way better off! You can never have a too bigger battery!!! I have nearly 70kw of storage in lithium. A daily use of 6kw is less than 10% of my storage. Perfect for having my batteries last for a very very long time!",

"comment": "I mean, yeah, that's kind of my point. This boat is simply not going to produce enough power through solar panels to either charge the battery *or* power the engines, let alone both. If you're planning on having a net increase in battery charge for a day, you pretty much have to plan on not moving the boat. And if you plan on keeping the battery at the same level for all day (the \"continuous cruise\" they tout) you may not even have enough power to overcome a mild headwind or current.\n\nPlanning to have an vehicle that is powered entirely by the solar panels that cover it is something that sounds amazing but just isn't realistic most of the time. Either you've got to radically redesign it to do almost nothing but have panels and also move kind of slowly, or else accept that it's going to need batteries and get charged at night. I'm not saying this boat is useless or uncool, it's just that their \"continuous cruise\" scenario doesn't pencil out.",

"comment": "As others have said, not much point in going solar if you use so little electricity.  Your total use is about the same as what I buy from the utility *after* installing solar panels.  Solar credits don't transfer to gas bills, they won't let you install that many panels.  If you care about that sort of thing, the best way to reduce your carbon emissions is not solar offsets, but actually reducing what gets burned in your home.\n\nReally the only step you can take right now is to electrify more of your energy use.  You'll have to do it pretty quickly in order to get all the good tax credits:  you need several months of bills to prove to the utility you deserve a decently sized system.  I have friends who ran their AC with the doors open for a month to get their \"baseline\" high enough that the permit they wanted would go through.  Obviously they intend to electrify things later on and use all that capacity.\n\nIf the roof can't wait, you'll have to replace it with asphalt and settle for retrofit panels a few years from now.  Technically you could add a small retrofit system, and expand it later, but your money is probably better spent on appliances.  You missed a golden opportunity to install a heat pump to supplement the furnace, but you could still add it.  I would be nervous living with a gas dryer in the house--sell that baby on Craigslist and get a cheap electric one.  Induction cook tops heat about as fast as gas but without making you breathe PM2.5 pollution inside your house.  Heat pump water heaters are an option but depend a lot on your situation.\n\nUnless you've got $100k in the bank, I'm sure doing all this at once is not an option.  We'd love to help you prioritize things based on your needs if you like!",

"comment": "I've wanted the Tesla solar roof for some time and I am among the group of solar roof customers that had a contract (unsigned) that was updated to reflect pricing changes.\n\nThe original system was an 8.24kW (too large) system at $51k that I asked them to change to something closer to my average usage of 2.8kW. It took them over 1 month to get back to me with the \"changes,\" which came back as an identical system with a price increase of $61k. Compared to the 100% increases that others (signed) have seen, I count my blessings because I'm still very optimistic about the product itself. I eventually got a call back with a smaller system design after 3 months of calling, texting, emailing, getting passed around.\n\nThe service is what doesn't inspire confidence. The 3 months it took to finally get a call from my third service representative was the critical period of time when the pricing changed. Luckily, they finally decreased my system size to a 4.56kW system to accommodate our PHEV, reducing the price to $54k before credits. I can't help but think what the price before the premium could have been. Considering the costs of construction material are skyrocketing and just replacing a roof with comp shingles would have run me $35k in the Bay Area, I think it's still fair.\n\nI'm lucky that I work in construction as a GC with a roofer that can do the job for $25k labor and materials. The $54k Tesla solar roof will run a slight premium compared to my discounted roof ($25k) + panels ($11k) + battery ($10k), plus they called to offer a free Powerwall as an incentive within the last few weeks.\n\nThe whole process has been discouraging and reneging on signed contracts sucks, but honestly, I have a \"force majeure\" clause in my modular construction contracts that have saved my ass lately when the cost of lumber and steel increased over 250% over the last 6 months. It sucks to know that Tesla has known about the materials increases and didn't notify people until they did a sweeping change, but here we are.\n\nI plan to move forward with the solar panels given the free battery and the reviews that I hear from people that have had it installed for several years now.",

EVs have about five years of serious development (disregarding flash in the pan attempts like the GM EV, or one-off research projects).\n\nIn 100 years of serious EV research and development, I predict that they will significantly outstrip their ICE counterparts in almost every conceivable way. The only thing I can think about now is deep country /off roading. Gasoline has a very high energy density (even if ICEs are only capable of using about 20% of that energy, vs 80% of stored battery power, for an EV). The ability to store and easily transport gasoline in tanks, for medium amounts of time, is something hard to do with electricity. Yes, there is battery storage, but that's not feasible for wilderness ranging. Similarly, PV panels wouldn't work so well.\n\nThis is one of the few use cases I can see remaining.",

Imagine trying to fight the fire approaching your house, only to have a low battery light start flashing on your fire fighting water pump. Or someone who requires powered medical equipment, like oxygen generators or sleep apnea devices, struggling through an extended power outage without proper treatment for their health condition.\n\nGasoline powered equipment, barring a mechanical failure, works as long as you can keep it supplied with gasoline. But battery equipment needs power to recharge it. Where do you get more power, if the sky is covered with smoke or clouds, or the solar panels are covered in dust, snow or ash, and the power lines are down?\n\nObviously it is possible that regulators will embrace sanity on these issues, and provide sensible exceptions – but at this stage an outbreak of common sense is far from guaranteed.\n\n[Net Zero California Governor Just Banned Backup Generators and Fire Pumps](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/10/11/california-climate-activists-just-banned-backup-generators-and-fire-pumps/)\n\n    California is banning gasoline powered emergency equipment, including generators, because, you know, the government should be in charge of your energy consumption.

From a combination of angies list vendors and energysage. \n\nI have yet to pull the trigger but hope to do so in 1-2 years. I am most hesitant because I don’t want to damage my roof with the necessary penetrations for racks. One quote suggested for this issue a foam based adhesive mounting solution for the racks but I felt ill equipped to parse out the options. I suppose one solution would be to go tesla solar panels but I hesitate about the subcontractor install quality and the aforementioned roof issues, specifically how they might coordinate with my roofer to ensure my newish roof warranty is not voided. I guess contracting someone myself might be able to identify a business with better customer support or better coordination. Perhaps all these coordination / support issues are non-factors, or at least no contractor has an inherent advantage. I have no frame of reference. \n\nThis sub is interesting but often too esoteric. I have noticed it leans heavily in favor of battery storage but not sure cost effective for South Florida unless if replacing an existing generator.\n\nI have not fully grasped yet what is a desirable monitoring set up. I suppose panels + enphase i7 will have the right stuff. \n\nI have contemplated whether to wait on components given worldwide chip shortage and unsure how that is affecting pricing not to mention availability, and also as a previous poster contemplated, waiting on i8 which has been months away apparently for years.",

Everything is a money grab but if you charge at home it’s not really that big of a deal. If they wanted it to be fair, they’d have you get an inspection every year and charge you accordingly but then you’ll have your scammers rolling car’s back every year. Unless it’s over a thousand bucks you’re still coming out ahead of the game. This is the price of going green. My local utility has a program where I get paid to charge at night and I charge from my solar panels net metering. 30k miles and only paid for about 10 fast charger’s.",

Never made sense to have solar panels and still lose power when the grid is down. \n\nThe system I have is basically all Enphase the way they designed it to work. I like all the micro inverters for redundancy and control. You can see in the screen grab that solar production dipped during the power outage. That's because the was no grid to send excess energy to. Those micro inverters give a lot of control so solar production was turned down to match what the house was drawing. Power went out but didn't use the batteries to keep the lights on.",

The CT ESS program is great and provides a minimum $200 per kWh of energy storage rebate plus a 10-year performance incentive. \n\nYou can get low cost financing from the Smart-E loan program. We typically quote $21,000 for 3x of the 5P battery and the rebate is $3,000 but can be up to $4,500 depending on your location on the grid. \n\nNot sure which panels were quoted here but I’d look at the Hanwha QTron 425 or REC 420 to maximize your energy production. \n\nIf you have eversource you’re also eligible for $0.0318 per kWh generated. \n\nLong story short, you need some more quotes. I’m a fan of the Smart E loan for battery storage.",

"comment": "&gt;Lower carbon compared to what, exactly?\n\nCompared to fossil fuels, which in most places is the only feasible alternative\n\n&gt;The EU has been all-in on renewables for 20+ years now.\n\nGonna have to disagree there. They were all in on fossil fuels but hedging their bets with renewables\n\n&gt;That's really just not true. It has a longer build time in the sense that it takes a while to build (9 years average for a reactor), but once it's done it produces far more clean energy than renewables built out over that same period.\n\nThis is entirely dependent on the amount of each built\n\n&gt;The UAE built more nuclear energy in 12 years than Denmark has built renewable energy in 25.\n\nLook at this: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/levelized-cost-of-energy?time=2000..latest\n\nThink that might have something to do with the fact that in 2000, onshore wind was 3x as expensive, offshore wind was twice as expensive. Solar PV doesn't even show on the chart until 2010, since then the cost went down by a factor of 8! Has nuclear gotten any cheaper? Hydro hasn't. But, hydro is a great option for dispatchable renewables! Don't get me wrong, they can be great to reduce the need for batteries or pumped hydro.\n\nNuclear was a great option decades ago. We should have done more of it. It doesn't make sense to stop building out the cheapest low carbon source we have.\n\n&gt;Nuclear can also increase and decrease loads pretty well. Modern reactors can ramp up to 80% up and down in 30 minutes.\n\nI'd be excited to learn more, are these reactors in use anywhere? What is their LCOE?\n\n&gt;France, Sweden, Switzerland, and plenty of other nuclear nations have proven, over, and over, and over, and over, that it works. It's not more expensive either, especially with life extensions of nuclear plants.\n\nThe upfront cost is still very high. Keeping existing plants operational is an economic option because the upfront cost is already paid\n\nWhat I don't understand about French energy policy is why they scale down nuclear production to make room for renewables. Nuclear's fuel cost is way low compared to the operating costs, why would they ramp down except to keep the grid balanced when demand is low? Those nukes should be on max output, and excess solar and wind should be sold off or stored in batteries. \n\n&gt; and we don't have any affordable storage to hit 100%.\n\n&gt;It's completely idiotic and our policy is driven 100% by feelings, not facts.\n\nWhat about the fact that energy storage is also getting cheaper every year? Nuclear, sadly, isn't",

If you can only charge at DCFC, there’s not much point getting an EV - unless you happen to live in a country like Australia where DCFC rates are still cheaper than filling up with petrol. There are also deals for cheaper DCFC charging - such as a monthly subscription (which I don’t bother with because I rarely DCFC), or deals with your car insurance company. \n\n2. EVs can be made even cheaper if you can charge off rooftop solar (pretty common in Australia, we’ve got plenty of sun here)\n\n3. EVs have far less maintenance and servicing needed because they have far less moving parts and items that need servicing. In the space of 2 years so far, I’ve only had to replace my cabin air filter and that’s it.",

High level nuclear waste is at least small in volume.

At least four people ask where I get protein from or if I'll eat chicken or turkey, because apparently they're not meat. \n\nI usually make something beforehand and bring it along. Since you sometimes have to dash right to the dinner from work I would make something the night before that can be refrigerated.  They might take offense at first, but after a while they'll get used to it.  Plus the host has one less mouth to feed and therefore less stress. Everyone wins.",

Also, being vegan proved to be reheheheally expensive (I went from omnivore to vegan to omnivore- no red meat- to vegetarian) and it was kanda hard to find a lot of the things on which I was nomming. Had to go to special stores, sometimes more than one. I would suggest staying vegetarian, but getting plenty of rest and excercise. Also be sure to get lots of protein- I started getting sickly a few months ago because I didn't adequately substitute meat protein with protein of some other form.\nGOOD LUCK IN YOUR DIETARY ADVENTURES, GOOD SIR! *removes hat and bows, sliding off stage theatrically*",

Personally, I think foodswings sucks shit, but I encourage you to check it out and decide for yourself.\n\nThere are a lot of places that aren't too great like any of the Blossom restaurants- my experience has been that they serve boca burgers and jack up the price\n\nIf you're in Brooklyn or don't mind traveling, Champs is fantastic.\n\nIf you're going to be near Barclays, check out V Spot, Dao Palate and Snice. I live in that neighborhood and can vouch for each of them. You might even be in range to get delivery.\n\nAlso, I've heard MOB (walking distance from Barclays) is good.\n\n*Depending on where you're staying, you might also look into Veggie castle 2. There is a of of vegan Caribbean food in Brooklyn because of a large Rasta community.",

Sometimes I think that vegans (especially on the internet) turn the whole thing into some sort of quasi-religious puritanism where the act of ingesting an animal product is immoral irrespective of how and why it came to be, and the impact of either ingesting or not-ingesting it.\n\nNo, it's not vegan to eat flies as a food source, but that doesn't mean you're not a vegan if you're not afraid of getting bugs in your teeth when you ride a bike.\n\nIn the case of isinglass, it is a byproduct of the fish-food industry, it is only used in beer because of the availability and low price, and even then it is pretty rare depending on where you live.  If you want isinglass out of beer, the best way to go about it is by boycotting fish.  If we weren't fishing to such a massive extent, the price of isinglass would go up and they'd use something else.  \n\nEven if every single brewery ceased using isinglass, it wouldn't change the fishing industry or prevent the killing of fish.  On the other hand, if every single person stopped eating fish, not only would fishing cease, but isinglass would be far too expensive to be used at commercial scale for beer.\n\nI already have a hard enough time convincing people that I'm not completely bonkers when I turn down cheese plates or BBQ, if I started scrutinizing their beer I think that would probably write off veganism for them entirely.  I'm not willing to sabotage the spread of acceptance of veganism over isinglass.",

"comment": "&gt;This is harder to swallow though. Sure it's plausible, but something being plausible isn't the same as it being the case. Plausible means we can't rule it out as ridiculous, and it may seem somewhat intuitive. However it's a long leap from \"plausible\" to something you try to rest a justification on. It's too big a leap for me: I need rational justification to bridge the gap.\n\nMy understanding of the word \"plausible\" is that it means \"reasonable or probable\" (at least one online dictionary agrees with me) -- not simply \"possible\". I mention reasons why I believe a link between parenting style and bio-children existing is probable and reasonable. This is because of the effect of heritability of various factors such as intelligence, empathy, personality, and (though I didn't mention it previously), physical attributes like race or hair color or attractiveness.  A simpler way of putting it is that bio-kids are more like their bio-parents (on average) than adopted kids are like their adopted parents and this difference can be a cause for negative outcomes in raising a child holding parenting styles constant.  For example, if the parent is the sort of person who values intelligence in the form of academic success, this could be disasterous for a child who, through no fault of his/her own, is unable to succeed in school. White American parents of a non-white child, through no fault of their own, might not be able to adequately guide their child through the realities of American racism because they lack the experiential wisdom of having gone through it.  They might not be able to even dispel the basic biological confusion that must happen when a baby doesn't look like his/her parents.  This makes parenting more difficult.\n\nThe probability that this sort of thing happens is going to be higher with a non-bio kid than a bio-kid.\n\n&gt; We're talking about adoptees that:\n1. Probably spent some time in the system, which as far as I know is really not ideal for child development.\n2.  Have to live with the knowledge that their biological parents abandoned them.\n\nYes I agree.  This is part of the reality with adoption.  This is the sort trauma almost every adopted child will face.  It makes good child-rearing outcomes more difficult and therefore less likely.\n\n&gt;From that link: Not until children are around 5 to 7 years of age do significant differences between these groups begin to emerge. At this age most children begin to understand the meaning and implications of being adopted.\n\n&gt;That would seem to back up my objection. If it was actually simpatico between child-rearing techniques and a child's disposition to accept specific approaches then you'd expect to see a clash sooner, no?\n\nPerhaps, but I don't know why I would expect that.  Ages 5 to 7 is typically when a child starts doing things like attending grade school and assumes greater responsibility and decision making in his or her life.  Before that, out of either necessity or preference, the parent makes the great majority of decisions for the child.  It seems sensible to me that such differences would come about during this time.\n\n&gt;That may well be, but the very important thing to note is the prospective adoptive child already exists. Whatever damage they do will happen. They almost certainly aren't going to go vegan, since most people do not.\n\nYes, and in my claim I have clearly bitten that bullet.\n\n&gt;I think that's a really important distinction to be aware of. You can take something that by default is going to be very harmful (from vegan/environmentalist standards) and mitigate that damage or you can leave all that harm untouched and bring more harm into existence that may be less than the average harm humans contribute to.\n\nYes, I am aware of that distinction.  My hypothesis is that even despite the harm that is attendant with bringing another human into this world, this harm is justified by the increased probability (over an adopted kid) that a bio-kid of parents (who are intelligent and empathic) turns out to be an ethically motivated advocate for the environment and for animals.  My reasons primarily have to do with \n1. network effects that happen when you add the marginal ethically-motivated citizen of the world to the population and \n2. the out-sized stakes that are involved (the existence of life on Earth).\n\n&gt;But you can do that without producing biological children. You need to be arguing here for effects that only apply to biological children, but a lot of your arguments apply in both cases. So again: the difference based purely on genetics has to be great enough to justify not only what the child you could have adopted would do if not adopted but how your own biological child would contribute to the problem.\n\nYes, you can influence the next generation's beliefs through an adoptive kid.  I would never deny that and never have.  The difference between the way in which this argument applies to bio-kids and adopted kids is a difference in degree, not a difference in kind.  \n\n&gt;This might also serve as an indirect argument against yours as well: if being able to make deliberate changes of that sort is in the near future, then some slightly better people in the meantime wouldn't really much much effect in the long term. They'll only mean more people/more resource consumption/more environmental damage, etc.\n\nMy concern is that the \"long term\" itself is in jeopardy -- at least for humans and possible for all life on Earth.  Spending resources to act now is more valuable than the chance of spending resources in the future since there is an known existential threat looming.  One way out is to see an eco-Martin Luther King type of revolutionary come along... another way out is science and technology finding a solution.  On both these counts, smart and empathic people who want to have ethically motivated children raise the probability of achieving this sort of outcome and maybe even do so in a way which justifies the harm caused by the child's existence as well as the harm of the orphan-who-wasn't-adopted's existence.",

The pollinated fruit would not exist without the system that exploits the bees. The bees are going to be exploited whether you take the honey part, or the fruit part. I'm afraid that you can't divide up the exploitation where it is convenient.\n\n&gt;Honey is pretty easy to avoid and by refusing it you reduce the demand for the exploitation of bees for their honey.\n\nSorry, but this just isn't the case: you aren't reducing demand for the exploitation of bees by eating the fruit they pollinate and not the honey they produce: it's the exact same bee keepers doing exactly the same job. \n\nEither you avoid exploiting bees, or you don't.",

It's not that dissimilar a situation, because very few people directly own farmed animals. Non-vegans often try to justify their actions precisely by the idea it's not them harming the animals. Slavery also wasn't just American, and it isn't today either.\n\nI went vegan thanks to 'pushy' vegans, I love them.",

"comment": "It's hard at first. I post vegan memes on my IG, and I try to make sure that they're thought-provoking or funny. I've had people reach out to me and tell me it helps them. So share your thoughts, share your recipes, share memes, and hope for the best. I try to meet people where they're at and encourage them to dip their toes in the water. A lot of vegans are opposed to any sort of messaging that isn't 'go 100% vegan or else don't waste my time', and I get why people feel that way. But if you have a person who's an omni that might try veganism a few times a week, encouraging them to see how they like it is a win for animals.",

Though I don't know what type you have.\n\nIf you have firm or extra firm: Add some veggies, soy sauce, turmeric, and black salt (or regular salt) for a tofu scramble, make some [popcorn tofu nuggets](https://tasty.co/recipe/popcorn-tofu-nuggets), or this [baked peanut tofu](http://www.marystestkitchen.com/easy-baked-peanut-tofu-recipe/) that I highly recommend,\n\nIf you have medium firm: It will work as an \"egg\" in this [fried egg sandwich](http://www.marystestkitchen.com/vegan-fried-egg-sandwich-recipe/), \n\nIf you have soft or silken: Add cubes of it into miso soup, make this [spinach lasagna](http://www.thevegancorner.com/spinach-lasagne/) or [vegan pho](https://tasty.co/recipe/how-to-make-vegan-pho).\n\nThere are so many things you can make or use tofu as a substitute for, but these are some starting points!",

But drives a hybrid that uses some gas. But hey, we’re just arguing on the internet about hypotheticals. \n\nYou’re a hypocrite who’s bad for veganism. I think you hurt the community instead of adding to it. You’re not good at this, and your blind emotion is harmful to the animals.",

I have slowly weened myself off of milk. She was always encouraging and never negative. That's the best approach to win people over. Compassion and empathy goes a long way. The biggest meanies I've encountered are vegans for cussing at me when I still ate dairy. That almost made me go back to it. Be kind.",

"comment": ">There would be alot more vegan/vegetarians if people had to slaughter their own food\n\n\nHmm I think this is just the perspective of people in 1st world countries. Thankfully my mother allowed me to make my own choice whether I want to participate in eating animals or not but it was very normalised where I'm from to make a whole event out of killing and dismembering the animals. On average meat was consumed a lot less due to cost and I think it's consumed in 1st world countries more because it's been made so convenient. But all the neighbours and their kids coming together and watching a pig be chased by the men as it screamed in fear and then shot in the head - this is normal in villages in many countries. Or grandma cutting off a chickens head with a blunt knife as she talks to you about the weather. People become desensitised to it. I really don't know why I was different but I still remember hiding in my room, covering my ears and sobbing as I heard the distant screams. Other children learnt to see it as normal.",

"comment": "A tip: if you're new to eating meat alternatives, don't expect them to taste like meat. No matter how many other vegans (since most haven't had meat in awhile) say \"it tastes just like meat\", I suggest going into it with the mindset that it's an entirely different product (which it is). Often times I found myself being disappointed with products because they didn't perfectly replicate the product it was an alternative to. It wasn't because the alternative tasted bad, I found a few that I actually really like, but   it's just because it was different. \n\nAnother thing (if you're currently used to eating a lot of animals or the bi-products as your main foods) is to search for new foods/meals/snacks then what you were used to. When I first went vegan I expected that I would be able to eat the same but just swap out animals/bi-products for alternatives, something which I quickly learned was that it's far more difficult and not as appetizing to do that. It's better to find new foods or meals that are either already plant-based or easy to make plant-based. \n\nYour also probably going to be increasing your cooking skills. While vegan options are much more common now, it's still easier to make food at home since options are still limited in many areas. This also gives you better management over your nutrition as well, which could be useful in the beginning of the transition (at least until you have gained some experience with plant-based meals). \n\nI suggest researching your bodies dietary requirements (how much of specific vitamins and minerals are needed in a day) if it's not something you already do. Once you know the daily requirements it will be easier to create a meal plan. I also suggest looking at [lists of nutritious vegan foods](https://gentleworld.org/vegan-sources-of-vitamins-minerals/#:~:text=cereals%20%26%20whole%20grains%2C%20breads%2C,%2C%20peanuts%2C%20molasses%2C%20legumes.&amp;text=nuts%20and%20seeds%2C%20whole%20grains%2C%20dried%20beans%2C%20mushrooms.&amp;text=legumes%2C%20lentils%2C%20oranges%2C%20whole,asparagus%2C%20spinach%2C%20romaine%20lettuce.&amp;text=iodine%2Drich%20sea%20vegetables%2C%20kelp,grown%20in%20iodine%2Drich%20soil.) to help you get started. \n\nLabels will try to trick you, always read the ingredients (you may also want to look at brand [controversies](https://climaterealtalk.org/unethical-companies-in-the-world/) as it can effect what you decide to support). Many things will say \"made with plant based (X)\" but that doesn't mean the product is fully plant based or vegan. There will also be products that look completely innocent (look at you salt and vinegar chips) but have secret meat or animal bi-products hidden in the ingredients lists. \n\nSome foods I really like:\n\nSmoked tofu; this is my favorite discovery since going vegan. You can you it on practically everything (even if you're not a huge tofu fan, smoked tofu is different from the regular). I use it in stir-fry, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pan-fried, in sushi and more. It's very versatile and can be used in many ways like cheese or chicken. \n\nGardein Fishless Filets; this is my favorite meat alternative (meant to resemble fish and chips). The batter is delicious and the interior has a flaky texture that I haven't seen in any other plant-based alternatives. I went into them thinking they'd be grossed and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nChickpeas; my body hates me when I eat too many of these (suspected IBS), but they are incredibly versatile. Like smoked tofu, you can put them in nearly everything and prepare them in different ways.\n\nSoups; I make different soups all the time. I buy vegtable broth then just shove whatever I feel like in it. Recently I made a post showcasing my tofu noodle soup (made to resemble chicken noodle). These are relatively easy and affordable.\n\nChili; full of beans and full of nutrition. I suggest just making a veggie chili unless you find/make a ground you like a lot (I just prefer veggie chili).\n\nGravy; veggie broth, nutritional yeast, seasoning, soy sauce and cornstarch slurries are all you need for a good veggie gravy.\n\nPotatoes; potatoes get a bad rep by many people, but they are relatively high in iron and other vitamin/minerals. They are also very filling and delicious (sweet potatoes are included in this). \n\nYves Veggie ham slices; this is the best sandwich \"meat\" I've had. \n\nSushi; once you get a hang of it, it's a great meal (to me anyways). You can shove veggies, tofu, sweet potatoes or whatever else you want into one nutritional bundle of easy to eat goodness.\n\nGardein Turk'y Cutlets; I wouldn't say these taste like turkey, but they are good. It's breaded and comes with a small gravy packet (I always need to make more). It's my favorite food for holiday meals that generally have turkey's. \n\nFoods I don't like:\n\nGardein Crabless Cakes; I have claimed these as my mortal enemy. They taint everything they touch with an artificial taste and are unpalatable. I hate them with a passion. They ruined my sushi bowl.\n\nYves ground; I've seen other people say they like these, so this is just my personal opinion, but to me they taste like dog food. That being said, it's not the worst thing I've eaten, just undesirable.",
