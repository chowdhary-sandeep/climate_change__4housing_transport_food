Because they continuously attempt to pitch skeptical PR (=lies and smears) money vs. every single dollar spent on reducing carbon emissions and developing clean technology. \n\nWhy would you count something like the wind-farm tax credit, or money granted to Tesla motors towards \"green lobbying\", and then compare that to the \"mere\" 7M available to Heartland? One is clearly an investment in technology, while the other is a mere PR budget.\n\nIf you want to play it like that, you'd have to compare not to those 7M but to the overall budget available to big oil. Exxon alone has a net worth of something like $500 billion.",

When I did my research, I found that brands were not that important unless you were really interested in paying more for your system (and/or avoiding Chinese made panels).  Where brand matters most is in the inverter(s).\n\nAs a couple of others have mentioned, anyone who can afford to get solar, should.  Right now the cost benefit is too obvious to not pass up.  I can see someone not having the money up front for it or if they don't plan to stay in a house for any length of time -- both fair reasons to not do it.  However, with a fully (professionally) installed system getting between an 8-11 year payback (price dependent), you're just printing money after that.  Solar panels should last a significant amount of time.  Future panels will be better than the ones you have now, but by the time they come out, your panels will be busy printing money.",

"comment": "For a PHEV with a small battery they add a small buffer so the battery doesn't go over 85% with regen (when starting charged at 85%) and they also have a large part as a backup to make it to the warranty just in case. I think it's because it cycles more than a plain EV. I saw a video recently of a GM engineer saying the Volt had a 16.5 kWh battery pack (good for ~61 km depending on how you count) but only 8.9 kWh (numbers from memory, sorry, but ballpark) was actually used. About 2 kWh (again from memory) was used as an over 85% buffer and the rest was a backup for the end of the warranty. Check other PHEVs coming out with about the same range, they all have a much bigger battery pack than the range suggest.\n\nEdit: Damn, can't find that video. It was a GM engineer giving a presentation at a university.\n\nEdit 2: Here it says 10 kWh used and explain the buffer and warranty bits:\n\nhttp://www.hybridcars.com/what-happens-when-your-volt-or-ampera-battery-gets-old-46185/",

The most popular range chart for this vehicles uses about a 50% overall efficiency the difference between climbing 1000' elevation (2KW) vs. descending 1000' (1KW recovered).  I assume this is related to the effeciency difference for \"round triping\" power by converting battery power to elevation and then back to battery power again through regen.\n\nYou would be limited by the system's ability to charge the battery (which depends on temperature as well as current).  The Tesla motor will consume 115KW (154hp) in my car (actually thats output, input to the motor should be slightly more but a/c induction motors are pretty efficient).  However you cant \"charge\" the battery at a 115KW rate (likely more like 50-60KW max, which is what \"fast\" chargers do.  The charger that comes with the car will only \"charge\" it at 10KW as an example, however from the DC side you could charge much faster if you maintained good control of the charge rate.\n\nSo if you tried to stop extremely quickly, you'd run into the problem of the electromagnetic braking could only \"draw\" a certain amount of power back from the wheels and when you had the power, you'd have to inject it into the battery, which is going to be current limited by your battery technology (maximum charge rate, and likely cooling for the battery)",

"comment": "&gt; Roofing is way more complicated than installing modules\" Sure. Guess what's measurably orders of magnitude harder? Rocket science.\n\nSure, but dealing with high paid engineers is different than dealing with roofing labor. It is back breaking work, and that means SolarCity will become a roofing contractor as well. Installing a roof is a different animal and based on SC's track record on their installation quality I dont want a roof installed by them, at all. \n\nFinding the right labor force will be a challenge, as Solar PV is an easy job mostly without much skill. Roofing is a different trade altogether, much harder on the body, much more taxing and needs to be done right. Will SC roof the entire roof, warranty the entire roof?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This guy breaks it down to 'first principles'. That means: if the baseline math and physics deem an engineering project beneficial compared to the current methods of production and products output then they will adapt the current mode to the ideal.\n\nSC was heading to bankrupcy. The deal with Tesla is widely known as a corporate bailout to his cousin at SC. This seems to me Musk is coming up with a shiny headline to get some bounce on the bad investment. The market he is going after is a niche, so it will be interesting to see how he does. \n\nSolar is slowing down, with a lot of the big players feeling the pain. SC has a bad outlook on installs this year, Vivint is reeling, it has been a funky year for solar. SC's main model (leases/PPAs) is dying and although they say they will be focusing on lending, there are better offers and more competitive products nowadays.  \n\n&gt; It really doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that the current solar market is not based on a particular level of efficiency/quality but on whatever sales tactics a very limited subset of self serving companies have employed.\n\nYou must not be in the industry then. The market may not have been fully dictated by efficiency/quality but there has been a hard shift. Customers are more educated and are not going solar just to go solar. Competition has flourished and SC is starting to feel the hits. \n\n&gt; I will grudgingly accept idealistic challenges to what I say. But if you challenge, explain how I'm wrong or where I came off track. Because as I see it this is all very basic math.\n\nThe basic math is that SC is reeling from a shifting industry, and the roofing side presents severe more challenges than your typical PV install. I think this will be one of those technologies that sound ok in concept but will be withdrawn from their portfolio in a few years. \n\nJust my point of view from someone in the solar industry, heavily involved in the finance and management side and having worked as well in the roofing contractor industry. Musk has been known to overpromise sometimes, but he overdelivers on other projects. We shall see...",

"comment": "Sorry for the late reply but the amount of misinformation you spew is utterly staggering.  \n\nFirstly, you call Teslas 'overpriced' but you have to bear in mind they're actually pretty competitively priced compared to their direct category competition like the Porsche Panamera.\n\nSecondly, you say a slow charger is useless when eating a meal.  Most meals out take around 1 hr 45 min on average.  The goal isn't to 'fully recharge' a vehicle while eating; it's to recoup enough range to get home.  Keep cherry picking your stupid middle-of-nowhere example if you want.  Any moron knows you don't drive an EV if you're planning to go into the middle of nowhere.\n\nNow, I lost credibility for suggesting EV chargers are easy to install?  Well, compared to installing a gas station or a hydrogen station?  Yes, much easier - and cheaper.  Please bear in mind not everyone lives in YOUR country.  I'm European, where local councils are trying to encourage charging station uptake by loosening regulations and offering incentives.  That's the thing that annoys me most about Americans - they always act as if theirs is the only country of relevance, and their regulations must therefore be global.\n\nCold is a problem with EVs, but it's LESS of a problem than you might think.  I never said 'cold isn't a problem', so the fact you went putting words in my mouth, if anything, means YOU'RE the one who loses credibility.  Again, I remind you that Norway - one of the coldest countries on the planet - are well pleased with their EV performance.  If you want to cherry pick the earlier generations of Nissan LEAF with resistance heaters, go ahead, but the later models with the heat pump are far more efficient.  I'll say it again:  You need REALLY cold weather to lose 1/3 of range.  -5 Celsius does not count as 'really cold'.  If people in Norway are acceptable of their range loss when it gets REALLY cold, I'm sure warmer climes can cope better.\n\n\"Look, I'm excited for when real EVs arrive. But right now, their all pretty useless to the average driver.\"\n\nAnd this is why we're having this stupid argument.  Because you go and say stupid rubbish like that.  I repeat:  EVs ARE SUITABLE TO THE AVERAGE DRIVER.  The vast, vast, vast, vast, vast  majority of trips are WELL WITHIN 50 miles radius.  \n\nBMW recently found the range extender hardly gets used in the i3.  A family member bought an i3 - and she falls into the 'average driver' cateogry.  Commuting, shopping, etc.  \n\nThat's what average driving IS.  Average driving and going on 200+ mile roundtrips into the middle of nowhere are NOT the same thing.   Here's the thing:  I'm the one who obsesses over this subject and does research on it almost daily.  I'm constantly trying to learn WHAT real EV drivers think, how they're behaving.  The overwhelming consensus is thus:  People are finding EVs ARE suitable to their everyday needs, even with current range limitations.  You, some random guy, presume to speak on behalf of average drivers everywhere?  No.  You're just speaking on behalf of your own opinion and trying to pass it off as 'fact'.",

"comment": "Notice that in every example I've mentioned we always go back to humans -what we feel, what we acknowledge as moral, what we are allowed to tolerate as part of our daily lives, what we are willing to give up - always in regard to ourselves. There's other moral frameworks to focus less on the humans and more on the environment itself which I particularly feel are more sound. For example, Aldo Leopold's deep ecology moves away from the individual and states that a thing \"is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”\n\nFrom this perspective the right thing could be reducing populations of grazing animals that can deplete limited resources; or killing individuals of invading animal species (like feral pigs in North America or feral cats and rabbits in Australia); or putting in place eco-friendly mixed farming-husbandry systems that use animal traction to protect soils and the lives of wild animals; or not having to balance out your diet importing foodstuff whose production or exportation is detrimental for the environment and the quality of life of the inhabitants in their places of origin, like \"ethical\" \"green\" palm oil from Brazil or Bolivian quinoa.\n\nThe fact that I belive that we can consume and use animals for our benefits does note mean that we can treat them however we want. I believe it is desirable that we limit unnecessary suffering as much as possible, and I could probably start justifying this position on the basis of deontology by I thinks this has gotten long enough. I think you get the idea in any case.",

My 2012 Leaf has lost 25% of it's range, and I'm estimating 4-5% loss a year. It's horrible, but I knew that going in and made sure it would still work for me even with 50% loss.

"comment": "This is all your own speculation BS that you are spreading around. At least recognize it for what it is. BS.\n\nIn 2017, Tesla still had enough capital to ship the SR version soon after the launch of the vehicle, assuming they get near the 5k/week production level. If things had gone according to plan, they would have hit near 4k/week production in December of 2017 and they can start to blend in SR versions.  However, those production plans didn’t work out. And the $3.5 billion in cash plus plenty of credit lines is now $2.3 billion in cash plus not so much left on the credit lines. They will be fine financially, but the 6 month delay in getting near 5k/week production rates have really hammered their financial position. Now, they have no choice. They must delay the SR model. It doesn’t mean it isn’t coming. But they need to generate cash first and achieve better costs. That’s just the financial realities. Now once they are at scale, they should be able to ship SR versions. We have two independent professional tear downs that confirm they can do it. And they want to do it because it lowers their costs to have  the SR in the mix as they seek to increase volumes.\n\nThe Model S was a different situation altogether. The 40 kWh version was never actually developed and so they software limited a 60 kWh version. If they did ship a 40, it would never has Supercharging few customers wanted that version. I was on the TMC forums at the time. Few orders were placed for this version.",

"comment": "When Germany persuaded the EU to adopt a standardized charging protocol, there were already standards.  There was the J1772 standard, there was the ChaDeMo standard, and the nascent CCS standard.  If all they intended to do was to pick a neutral standard to help spread the electric car, that would have been great, and I would have been all for it.\n\nBut instead, there was another standard at the time.  The Tesla standard.  And the reason the Tesla standard came to be is that Tesla couldn't wait dick around and wait while SAE and the manufacturers got their shit together.  They wanted to put cars on the road, and so they went their own way.  And then started building a charging infrastructure.\n\nSo from this standpoint, the idea of the EU picking a \"neutral standard\" becomes kind of fake.  There is no question that German manufacturers put a ton of pressure on Merkel to structure the charging is such a way so as to penalize all the work that Tesla had done.\n\nThis isn't some random conspiracy theory.  This is EXACTLY what happened.\n\nIf Tesla hadn't made their patents openly available, there might be more of a justification for how things went down.  But Tesla did, literally, everything they could to help spread the electric car, and what the EU did was say, SHIT, TESLA HAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE.  How can we cut their legs out from under them?",

"comment": "Two is almost certainly incorrect. Rimac is the de facto standard for EV and PHEV torque vectoring. It is one of services/modules that they provide to other OEMs. Tesla may be slightly behind, equal or slightly better with the vectoring  but not enough to make a difference. \n\nAFAIK there are 2 reasons for a slower claimed 0-60 time. The first is gearing. The second is that, in Ludicrous mode, Tesla increases the current draw on the batteries for a short time. Extra current provides extra power at the cost of extra heat. This is why current Tesla cars have to cool the batteries and motors  after a few launches. It is also why you have go into the settings to get Ludicrous mode. In the current Rimac, (as shown on the TGT) you just put your foot down. \n\nInterestingly the Roadster 2 prototype did continuous launches without over heating but it was not possible to see the times. I would guess that they adjusted the overdraw to less than half a second to give people test sitting in the car the \"snap back\" feeling of the torque without stressing the current gen batteries. \n\nI suspect Rimac doesn't have same expertise in managing the battery draw profiles to ensure they minimize battery damage which is why they do not offer a launch mode. They also mentioned that they do not want to shred the tires. \n\nAlthough 0-60 times are impressive there are enough 60-100 videos of \"spanked\" hyper-cars catching or passing Model S's like they were standing still that it seems to me to be a party trick rather than a harbinger of good performance.",

Everyone talks about all the \"features\" that Tesla has, when it's literally just gimmicky updates (because Fart Mode is truly a revolutionary feature) and Autopilot, of which you get 99.99% of the functionality with from TACC+LKA. Oh yeah, and you have to pay $40k for a Model 3 with fucking cloth seats, just to have ACC.",

It could help some people though the states' voters may not like the US Senate trying to spend their local tax money  on this program.  A lot of people confuse federal tax credits with subsidies, but this is actual subsidy and the senate's proposal is to make state taxes cover those subsidies.  They'd have to raise taxes or cut programs to cover the budget.",

It would also get stripped away if prices where increased to capture the incentive, so there is that in building a better incentive.\n\n*Ideally the extra bonus would also apply to more expensive vehicle trims. I believe consumer Choice should be protected and that auto manufacturers simply need to offer a base model that can be bought for Value customers. I'd probably also like to have a standard that the base model should generally have a similar range to higher trim models so we don't see things like a base model with a undersized battery designed to fit the letter if the bill but largely capture the incentive, etc. Complicated, but workable imo.",

The MSRP of the 2LT awd is close to the AWD EV6 and ioniq 5 SEL even before the tax credit. They should have no issues selling the 20-30k per year of these that they will build over the next year or two. If they want to get to even 20% of model Y sales levels they'll need to lower prices, but US emissions standards are weak AF until 2026 so I wouldn't expect a push for volume until around then.",

"comment": "TOU billing actually already takes this into consideration. For example, under the PG&amp;E E-1 rate schedule (non-solar), the rate tops out at $0.32/kwh. For solar users on TOU billing, the rate tops out at $0.49/kwh. In other words, yes they pay us the full retail rate, but they also charge punitive rates when we are taking electricity from the grid to help make up for this. \n\nEven with solar, the average price I paid last year (my 2nd year of owning solar) for electricity I took from grid was $0.16/kwh, which is the equivalent of the Tier 1 rate for non solar owners. That seems fair, but the proposed changes will increase that significantly. \n\nIronically, the rates are designed to punish solar owners who have under-sized systems and reward solar owners that over-build. The first year I owned solar, I used 25% less grid electricity and only paid $0.06/kwh for it. I'm in the process of adding more panels right now to try and bring my average down a bit.\n\nAlso, the voters have decided time after time that they want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California. The best way to do that is to promote the growth of rooftop solar and make it easier for everyone to install solar.  Those that don't have solar SHOULD pay more because they are contributing more to greenhouse gas emissions. The primary reason electric rates are so high in California to begin with is the environmental regulations.  Solar owners generate and use clean energy, non-solar owners use dirty energy and they should have to pay a premium for that.",

"comment": "with Solar PV, efficiency is the amount of power generated per fixed area.   So a 250 watt module of 15% efficient is just slightly larger than a 250 watt module of 18% efficiency.   The 18% efficient module will cost more, and they will both generate the same amount of power.\nYou seem to be miss stating the definition of STC.\nSTC (Standard Test Condition) is 1,000 watts per square meter of light is flashed for a second on the module, and the output is tested.  I don't know where you get 100w for that. \n\nThe Sun does not provide 1000 watts of illumination at all locations on the earth at all times.  Most of the US never gets STC.   And further even if it did, the modules would quickly heat up, dropping performance.   \n\nFrom your comments most of this is going to be too indepeth anyway.  Suffice it to say that Price does not have anything to do with performance.  Price is going down based on demand and production responding to that primarily.   Performance just has to do with the spatial size of a given kw power array.   Also higher watt rating of a module does not mean higher efficiency, there are different sized modules.\n\nHere is an example of a spec sheet on a very popular module the Canadian 265 (CS6P-265P) which has an efficiency of 16.47%\nhttp://www.canadiansolar.com/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/datasheets/v5.4/Canadian_Solar-Datasheet-CS6PPSD_SmartDC-v5.4en.pdf",

"comment": "Is this in Minnesota? I believe it's one of the best community solar offers out there, one of the only ones comparable to rooftop investment.\n\nMake sure you check the tax status of your purchase. Do you pay the income tax in the revenue - if so, then what about depreciation? Are you claiming the tax credit directly? The residential renewable energy tax credit or the Commercial investment tax credit?\n\nMajor difference between community solar and rooftop PV is that you gain a contract and lose ability to go off-grid during power utages or more permanently.\n\nEdit: Oh, this is CPS energy! No, if you have a good rooftop, you should put solar on your roof. CPS has some good incentive money available. There's plenty of talent in your area. Let me know if you want a referral.",

"comment": "&gt;Most homes would need battery banks before this even became a real discussion.\n\nReading about [Tesla's Power Wall](https://www.tesla.com/powerwall) 14kWh (double last years 7) costs $5,550 w/ integrated inverter. And [solar roof](https://www.tesla.com/solarroof), it would seem solar is slowly becoming main stream and price is starting to drop. \n\nI'm sure there there may be better prices out there (I haven't even started looking yet) but tesla is bringing it to the forefront of peoples minds which is great in my opinion. \n\nAs far as tiny homes, thats great and all but I really want to know about the average home, I could imagine a two tier system with both AC and DC, maybe DC for the LED lights and light electronics and AC taking care of the more heavy lifting: fridge, washer/dryer, water pump, ect.  \n\nEdit: changed \"it\" to \"solar\"",

"comment": "Does SolarEdge have any inverters that work on lower voltages?  I know they've got the stuff that interfaces with the Powerwall, but the chances of me getting one of those in my lifetime are roughly zero as far as I can tell, and I'd rather do this system at some point in the next few years.  I also have some concerns about putting Tesla's stuff in my house, as I generally don't like devices I can't interface with.  The Outback hardware, at least, is SunSpec compliant, so I can just converse with it about the state of things and do my own monitoring.\n\nI'll get in touch with wholesalesolar - I've spent plenty of time digging around their site.\n\nThat said, I am running a fully grid-free office on the property with solar &amp; battery, so I'm at least somewhat familiar with the challenges.  One reason I'm specifically interested in a 48V system and somewhat compatible voltages is that it means I have parts commonality and interchangeability between my two systems if needed, and I'd need fewer varieties of spares (for instance, I have a Midnite Classic 200 on my office - if the house solar is compatible with those, I would be able to keep a single spare on hand for everything).\n\nI'm familiar with the hydrogen venting issues and watering requirements - I've got a bank of 8 T105REs right now, and am considering a set of recombiner caps this summer to replace my watering system.\n\nHowever, I'm also considering the feasibility of going with a LiFePO4 bank for the house.  The lower maintenance requirements would be nice, and I know the newer Outback inverters support \"advanced battery\" charging where you can program in the desired behavior for a lithium bank - I'd probably float it around 85% SoC normally to keep the internal stresses down.\n\nI don't plan to take the house fully off grid - there's no advantage to that, when I have perfectly good grid power (and, you're right, it would annoy my wife rather significantly).  But neither do I want a system that is useless without grid power, which is most of the stuff being installed out here (micro inverters).  I want something that's useful as a grid tied system, can function as a whole house UPS (or most of house UPS), and has the potential of being at least somewhat useful in a longer term power outage situation.\n\nI'm looking at making the investments now to reduce my long term power costs, and also give me better power stability (I'm less than happy with power quality out here).",

"comment": "1. Enphase is not a dual panel micro inverter so they work 1 to 1. Another company did that and those suckers failed all of the time. \n\n2. If the panels are blank it typically means shade or an obstruction. I have not seen 1 come online then go offline. \n\nIf there is a lack of communications it could be that your envoy is plugged into a powerstrip. The installer if they were worth anything should have installed a dedicated outlet next to the main panel just so it could read the inverters clearly. The old pill style would occasionally have that as an issue. \n\nVery few inverter manufacturers allow the customer to just call and trouble shoot\n\nI work for a company and we have installed 22,000 of the Enphase microinverters and only 59 of them have given us any issues over the past 6 years. Pretty good track record in my opinion. \n\nI wouldn't read to much into the stock talk. The amount of patents that Enphase has I doubt they will be an insolvent company when LG and Jinko(and more) are racing to market with AC modules. Sunpower already is doing an AC Module. Just makes for faster installs and disperses the warranty issues to the panel manufacturer. \n\nFind a local installer who installs Enphase mostly. We have picked up 4 other companies customers who have gone out of business. They are out there, just call around. \n\nWhere do you live?  I have an in at Enphase I can ask who you can call for help.",

Again, all I'm saying is you can't compare $/kwh cost of a coal power plant to $/kwh cost of a solar power plant unless the solar plant included batteries.\n\nIt would be like comparing two coal power plants with the same capacity, but one can operate 24/7 and one can operate for only 8 hours a day.  The one that can operate 24/7 would be worth more than the one that can operate only 10 hours a day.",

It's decreased by cloud cover, for example.  You multiply that by the power rating of your panels.  If you have a 23kW system, and you get 5 solar hours per day, then you generate 115 kilowatt hours per day, or 3450 kWh per month.\n\nYou can look up solar hours per day and type in your location to figure out what your number would be.  \n\nI suspect this is just a small part of the math you're trying to do to justify your solar installation.

"comment": "I believe you have captured the conflicts and lack of incentives that are barriers to big box retail solar roofs. \n\nMaybe solar panel installations can be engineered to be above the roof tops so that the roofing can be replaced independently of solar panels. Maybe the solar panels can partially protect the roof from sun and rain and extend the lifetime of the roofing material. \n\nMaybe big box landlords will have an advantage by attracting tenants if they can subsidize electricity costs with solar.   Or the landlord can charge market rate to tenants for electricity but pocket the difference in what they save by having solar. Lots of retail is open during day and closed at night. \n\nMaybe big box retailers would rather invest in a covered parking lot structure made entirely of solar panels that also provide free/reduced power to shoppers electric cars.   An app tells the customer that spaces are available at the mall. Your phone needs to be moving inside the mall in order for your car to continue to receive free mall electricity to your car.",

I’m very happy that I’m getting a car that will be faster than my Camaro SS, and a little bit greener than my Prius! \n\nMy long-term plan when my wife gets out of the military is to install solar panels in the very first house we buy. I suspect the technology will get even cheaper, and the pay off for that will be even quicker! I see it as a solid 5 to 7 year investment that I will get my money back on. Going green is just icing on the cake.",

"comment": "dbukley (below) is correct. You first need to know the actual overnight load in amp hours used for the lights.  From there you can calculate the size of a battery in Ah (amp hours) you would need.  Only then can you determine the size of solar array needed to charge up the batteries.  Given limited peak sun hours in NY in winter, it is highly unlikely that a reasonable sized solar array would fully charge that battery overnight.  Therefore you'd want to increase the Ah of your battery choice to create some balance. Even then, depending on the numbers, you might find that a grid-tied solar panel configuration system would be the best approach to lowering energy costs overall.\n\nI recommend looking into Tycon Power RemotePro systems.  \n\nhttp://www.tyconsystems.com/index.php/products/tycon-power/remotepro\n\nThey have complete off-grid systems pre-built according to any number of specifications.  That would include panels, charge controllers (either PMW or MPPT), voltage input/output ratings, batteries (all AGM, either gel or sealed lead acid).  Tycon also has grid-tie options.\n\nFull disclosure - I am a reseller of Tycon Products, and I'd be happy to help you explore that further if you wish.",

"comment": "No, it doesn't make sense even for most people.  Making some reasonable assumptions, solar panels on a car could generate the equivalent of about 0.08 gallons of gas per day.  So, unless you only go through a couple of gallons of gas per month then you'd probably waste more fuel on the compromised aerodynamics than you'd get from the panels.\n\nYour 5 minute commute length is three times shorter than the shortest metro area average, and 7.5 times shorter than the average for larger metro areas.  That is pretty far from \"most people's daily driving.\"\n\nYou'd either need a folding mechanism that dramatically increases both the area and the efficiency of the panels or a plug connected to a larger stationary array and a battery.",

"comment": "&gt; Electrical power, to my knowledge, can't be transmitted that far.\n\nExisting [High Voltage Direct Current (HDVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current) powerlines only lose 5% per 1000 miles. Half way round the earth is about 13000 miles, so we would lose 50% of the power transmitted from the exact opposite side of the earth on an HVDC. But the solar power would usually only travel a fraction of that distance because the sun always shines on half the earth and we use most power early in the evening rather than the middle of the night. The northern hemisphere winter could be powered by the southern summer and the other way. \n\nBulding a [Super Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_grid) would cost less than a single nuclear power station like Hinkley Point C. \n\nAnd the transmission losses will reduce when we start building [superconducting power lines](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/182278-the-worlds-first-superconducting-power-line-paves-the-way-for-billions-of-dollars-in-savings).",

"comment": "That's exactly my point. I've read a bunch of comments in this sub that promote EVs but demonize fossil fuel power plants in the very next sentence. As I said coal plant with scrubbers have little to no harmful emissions, nuclear is air pollution free assuming no meltdowns, and natural gas is about as clean burning as anything combustible. I have a friend who does long haul transport (cars, live stock, etc) who runs his truck on liquid natural gas, he gets around 18 mpgs with a loaded trailer, and before the conversion he was getting 10 to 12mpgs. \nI mentioned that most EVs are charged at home overnight. The only issue with that currently, is that with more people driving EVs and plugging them in when they get home that charging draw is occurring during peak usage hours, when the family is all home using power. It puts a strain on the old worn out electrical grid found in most major cities. A similar thing happens when A lot of people have solar an older electrical grid, the grid has a hard time with the current flow during peak production. In my area we've had transformers blow due to the high current flow in some of the older neighborhoods that have a high number of homes with solar panels. It's all about the current flow, if it's too high for the grid, something is gonna blow. \nMaybe my comment wasn't worded well, but you're saying pretty much what I was trying to say.",

"comment": "don't mean to be picky but do want to clarify that \"it won't make that big of a difference\" doesn't mean all the panels are the same.  I was trying to say that if you're just commuting to work everyday, it likely won't make that much of a difference which car you pick.  If you want to nerd out and compare every detail to determine what matters to you, then there is also plenty of opportunity for that. :) As others have pointed out, solar panels degrade and a quick first cut is looking at the warranty. The other thing is that solar panels don't like the heat so in AZ you may want a panel that degrades less when it gets hot (temperature coefficient). \n\nI would second what others have said that looking at the system holistically makes more sense than just comparing panels. The inverter decision is probably more important as (if you wanted to) any monitoring and interaction would be with those and not the panels directly. So if you're the type that would be interested to augment what the vendor provides, I'd search github for projects related to it and see if the vendor has a REST API.  \n\nI'd probably look to undersize any batteries by a little bit.  It seems like the vehicle to grid/home stuff might be catching on more with things like dcbel.energy having an all-in-one inverter with car charger and the announcement of the F-150 Lightning. \n\nI'd also consider what matters the most to you. If you are looking to mostly save money, there is definitely a set of 'budget picks' vs if you want to be as independent as possible and your goal is to generate as much as you can (vs. wanting another hobby - e.g. as a quick hack since the Enphase web monitoring only has 15 minute resolution but you can stream 1 second resolution data from the local box, I wrote a small python script to grab the streaming data and dump into a grafite/grafana container I deployed on my desktop)",

Meanwhile, hydrogen is only the cheapest for applications above 10 days (seasonal storage).\n\nThe trend only continues in favor of batteries. In 2030 they are cheapest for almost all stationary applications, and by 2040 for 14 hour durations. \n\nWith the exception of niche uses, hydrogen is uninteresting.\n\n&gt; We find that LCOS will reduce by one-third to one-half by 2030 and 2050, respectively, across the modeled applications, with lithium ion likely to become most cost efficient for nearly all stationary applications from 2030. Investments in alternative technologies may prove futile unless significant performance improvements can retain competitiveness with lithium ion.\n\n&gt; Projected cost reductions for battery technologies limit the competitiveness of pumped hydro and compressed air. Battery technologies exhibit the highest probability of lowest LCOS in most applications beyond 2025. By 2030, lithium ion appears to be most cost efficient in most applications, in particular with &lt;4 h discharge and &lt;300 annual cycles such as power quality and black start.\n\nEdit: added intro paragraph",

I don't know how much solar costs but I imagine that in California it'd be cheaper to have solar than pay $0.30 KWh. According to [this](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php) calculator you'd get between 1,583 to 1,696 kWh per year for every 1KW of solar panels. As long as you can get a system for less than $10k per KW you'd be saving money.",

They want you to buy in to their solar farm. Basically you buy them a panel and at about 10 years when the investment turns a profit they own it and get the profit. \n\n&gt; could not get a quote as low as yours from anyone except a smaller one man operation\n\nIt does seem like a reasonable quote for MN. Still a lot of money and a long time. I lost sleep last night thinking about taking that money out of the market and spending it on solar. Right now I really don't want to move and could see myself staying in our house forever. We have 4.5 years old twins and my perspective has changed several times as they grow up. So I can't say for sure what I will want to do in 5 years.",

As others have noted, the effect of high temps on panels is quantifiable, but isn’t a huge make or break factor. \n\nTo reduce losses on hot days, if you live in an area with really toasty summer temps, look for a mono crystalline solar panel with a [low temperature coefficient listed of the spec sheet](https://www.ny-engineers.com/blog/understanding-solar-panel-specifications). Those panels are going to put out the most power during those long, sunny days.",

"comment": "With a \\~8 kW system and no bills for 10/12 months, I'm surprised you need to add panels at all.  Are all your lights LED and your screens turned off when not in use?\n\nThe idea of \"net energy metering\" suggests you will be accruing \"credits\" during the summer months of high energy production to use during the winter months of low energy production.  \"No bills\" would actually be \"credits\".  You should have net credits (\"no bills\") for around 6 months and a draw down of those credits for the remaining months.  It's OK to not be \"net zero\" and be slightly \"net negative\" because you can shift the EV charging to the lowest Time of Use (TOU) pricing.  It's not good to be \"net positive\" since utilities don't give you market rate credit (1:1) for annualized over production.\n\nYou might have an oversized system prior to electrification of your kitchen and EV.  I would wait to see what the new load looks like before adding more panels.  I would also stick to the current installer since they might have learned their lessons and you don't want bad karma from 2 installers.  Adding a smart battery instead of solar panels might be more cost effective.",

"comment": "I have a couple of questions about these quotes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, what is the total kW DC size of each system? Here in Georgia, you need special permission from the utility company to install above a 10 kW AC system, and you need to sign an agreement that you can never feed power back to the grid. With the IQ7s, your system has the potential to produce exactly 10 kW AC, which makes it a large system, but not too far out of the ordinary. The other system, however, has the potential to produce 18 kW AC, which seems excessive for a residential system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow without knowing the size of the modules, I cannot determine how much clipping might occur, but I have a feeling there may be a decent amount of clipping from the Canadian Solar panels. I don't sell the IQ7s anymore because the panels we install require a larger inverter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, regardless of kW size, the encharge 10 can only support 23 modules using the IQ7's, so that means the rest of your system would feed directly into the grid, and you would be losing all excess power or selling it back to the utility company. If you use enough energy to require that amount of solar, then one battery will not get you very far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese companies have also likely quoted you a financed price, and they've hidden the dealer fee into the price of the solar. The financing company may pay the company as little as 75% of the contract price to the solar installer.  If you were to tell them that you were paying cash, they would likely give you a \"discount\" of 10-15%. You can ask what the dealer fee for the financing is, but they'll likely not tell you. Also, the larger company may have a cheaper financing option than the smaller company. Honestly, adding up battery, solar, and dealer fee, these prices seem like they might be fair, but I don't know your market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally, the best way to compare pricing is to subtract the battery cost, and then to compare the price per watt for the solar. Energysage can give you a good range to expect in price per watt for your area, and then you can find a solar company in your area with good reviews that can provide that for you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck!",

"comment": "Lol - not sure where you get your Info but the tesla doesnt shut down below 10%. I’ve used it down to 5% no issue bro. \n\nBut in off grid the solar array recharges the PWs when they drain below 80%. So at sundown the system is never less than 80% capacity. \n\nMoreover I have a span panel on the tesla PW array so there is no situation where overnight the Pw would drain below 5%. My homes are highly efficient so no danger of going dark!",

Age plays a huge difference in cars, more than mileage, and as such your question is very open ended. \n\nDo you mean what happens at 300k after 20 years of averaging 15k each year, or what happens at 300k after averaging 40k for 8 years?\n\nOr what happens at 300k after averaging 60k for five years. \n\nThose are all going to be different answers, and so far we don’t even have enough statistics to answer the latter one. \n\nAnd as others are pointing out, LFP batteries are likely to last longer as they have about 3x the cycle life of conventional EV batteries.\n\nBut battery packs are more than the sum of their batteries. BMS boards could fail, mechanical connections could fail, fuses can blow, etc. \n\nEV’s are full of electronics and I wouldn’t be surprised if at a certain age electronic components reliability is going to favor reselling the cars for battery pack extraction vs. being a used car. \n\nBattery storage could easily use a 15 year old battery pack for another 10 to 15 years, if not more. \n\nAs such used prices are likely to hit a cutoff threshold when they reach a certain age where the used market will be 1:1 with the repurposing market.",

"comment": ">The one thing I’d want to check here is whether your inverters will operate on battery.  I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that Enphase will only work with an Enphase battery…\n\nSo, Enphase is what's known as an \"AC coupled\" system.  The other way is \"DC coupled\".  What this refers to is where the sources of generation/storage come together - do you tie them together on the DC side, or AC side. The DC side is not available with an Enphase system, they are a 1:1 match of microinverter to panel, no DC is brought down to a common point.\n\nOP - Enphase, being an AC coupled system, is actually compatible with any battery system that puts out standard AC. Tesla powerwall, the enphase batteries themselves of course, Sonnen, SMA, etc - search for \"AC coupled battery\" and you should find options.\n\nMore [here](https://www.deegesolar.co.uk/ac_coupling_vs_dc_coupling_solar_battery_storage/).",

See how cagey SunRun is being.  If you like the house just force the seller and seller’s realtor to provide documentation stating the seller owns the solar panels outright and is selling them as a fixture as part of the house.  At closing the debt to SunRun and all loans, taxes, transfer fees will be paid in full by the seller.  Or something like that.  Prepaid might be the Prepaid agreement which means it’s connected with your property taxes.  You don’t want that.  And as you has seen, SunRun has been honest with some, but not with others.  Don’t be one of the others.  Depending on how long the solar panels have been on the roof, the seller could tell SunRun to remove them and repair the roof.  In reality SunRun will realize it’s not worth the effort and abandon them.  Just be very careful.",

"comment": "> Let's stop the hysteria. Climate change is not an existential threat. \n\nNobody who understands the science has ever claimed humanity will go extinct from climate change. The issue has always been *how many* and *at what cost*. \n\n> Perhaps humans are affecting it, perhaps not.\n\nIf you want to be taken seriously about climate change action, don't bring up Exxon Mobil's 1990's-era propaganda. Arrhenius had back of the envelope GHG warming estimates in 1896, Callendar had a bang-on prediction for warming from CO2 back in 1938.\n\n> But over time, technology makes our world a better place to live. \n\nAnd also creates new problems, some of which require urgent action to address. The world isn't as simple as an intro econ textbook. \n\n> The changes being forced on us by government (EVs, solar power, wind power, etc.) are creating unnatural market dislocations\n\nCost-free emission of CO2 is an unnatural market dislocation by the government to create wealth at the expense of future generations who have to live with the environmental damage. If fossil-fuel costs included the cost of carbon capture or offsets, it would not be competitive. \n\nIn any case, renewables are growing exponentially because innovation and mass production cut the cost exponentially. In 20-30 years when solar dominates the electrical sector, using fossil fuels to spin turbines will seem as impractical as burning whale oil. In the long term, decentralized energy production and storage is far more efficient and reliable than large power plants.\n\n> Hydrogen power, given time and a fair shot in a free market would win out over battery technology.\n\nThe market disagrees. Hydrogen cars have been around for decades and never took off, even with early subsidies. The problem is that fueling stations are expensive which creates the chicken and egg problem that EV's have already overcome.\n\nLarge-scale subsidies actually followed early EV market success, they didn't determine their economic viability. The current growth of EV sales despite subsidy phase-out demonstrates that. \n\n>  Nuclear is clearly the cleanest reliable source of electricity. Why are we not investing in new nuclear technology?\n\nMoney. Without subsidies, it clearly isn't competitive. The world economy is much more tailored to rapid innovation and mass production of electronic devices (solar panels, wind turbines) compared to capital-heavy decades-long power-plant projects. The time-scale for nuclear innovation is simply too long to expect it to develop into cheap form-factors and grow like renewables are already doing. Perhaps if we had been investing heavily since the 1950's, but that ship has sailed. There's no benefit to conventional nuclear once solar dominates the market.  \n\nAlso, if you want to talk about free-markets, you cannot assume government-imposed regulation in nuclear will continue indefinitely at the expense of profits. Shareholders will demand cutting \"excess\" safety measures over time. \n\n> Airplanes will never, ever, be battery powered, nor will the massive mining equipment or slave labor that digs up the metals needed to make them. \n\nAgreed, that's why we net-zero biofuels are under development. \n\n>  And despite the bad rap that plastics get, engineering plastics have made a massively positive impact on human life. \n\nCost aside, nobody cares whether their polyurethane came from plant matter grown at the surface or compressed under it. It just so happens the former is less costly if you have to pay for CO2 emissions. \n\n> The government should not be shutting down ANWR.\n\nMy knowledge of ANWR is limited, but isn't the US already a net-exporter of oil without ever having tapped ANWR? How can not using a source of oil we already haven't been using cause a harmful change?\n\nLibertarian types often fool themselves into thinking free-market demand always aligns with the way the world is (and how they prefer it to be), but what you call \"hysteria\" over climate change is nothing less than widespread pent-up demand, stifled by conservative governments which have largely ignored those secondary needs. Dismissing that demand as hysterical is as silly as saying people just need to stop being hysterical about making money.",

The first year I did not produce what they guaranteed I got a $800 true up and they paid $243 a year later someone came out said the system wasn't working and that the wire was exposed from the time it was installed the man from Vivint said he fixed it a year and a half later Sunrun emails me saying my system is not producing a gentleman from Infinity came out and said that the wires are burnt from the ground up and need to be replaced. Meanwhile 5 years had passed and I tried to purchase the contract or panels the salesman had got me a hero loan that was attached to my property and I needed it off my property so I told Sunrun I would like to purchase they told me $9,8004 I said okay find it then I told them okay it gets rid of the 23,000 still owed for the contractor right they said no that's a separate situation and put me in collections and turned off my system. Then the guy from Infinity came out and said it was burned so it was very dangerous and turned off the breakers and that was in September of 2023 and I'm still sitting here with nothing I pay the $23,000 to the HERO program to get it off of my property taxes.

Because I don't think that if I (force myself to) eat a hot wing I'll think it's good.  Even if I could get over its origins and appreciate it without conscious contemplation of its nature (i.e., I'm eating skin and flesh), I'd be confronted with one fundamental problem: after ten years as a vegan, I find meat entirely unappetising, and moderately gross.  I just stopped perceiving it as an edible substance, after a while.  \n  \nI believe I remember pretty precisely how chicken wings and chicken's feet taste.  And I'm fairly sure that I'd eat them with a shudder of disgust.  That's probably for the most part just an ingrained perception built on long abstention/aversion (I've known a non-practising Muslim and a couple non-practising Jews who didn't eat pig, simply because they'd learned to be averse to it growing up).  But it's there nonetheless.  I don't think it'd evaporate if I chowed down on a chicken wing.",

So people who don't eat animal products for health reasons - they're likely to continue to wear leather because there's no health reasons to not to do so. \n\nThat's why the distinction is important - it's not just the reason why people don't eat animal products, it also manifests itself in other areas unrelated to foods.",

I'm torn on this one: as far as my diet, I am strictly vegan; in my organic garden however, I use worm castings collected from my in-house vermicomposter as well as bat guanos at times (though I avoid sketchier and ickier animal-based organic fertilizers such as fish emulsions, bone/blood meal). I've had some more self-righteous vegans argue that even this use of animal products is wrong, though I tend to disagree. Worm castings are top notch fertilizer, and a great way for me to divert my kitchen waste, and with my worms happy and healthy I have trouble not advocating for this and other locally or responsibly sourced animal-based organic fertilizers. Not bashing on veganic obviously, just my two cents (the Strawberry Cough certainly seems to speak for it!)",

Even the popular chicken restaurant Nando's has a lot of vegan choices.\n\nI'd recommend a place in Camden called Cakes 'n' Treats if you're looking for amazing cakes or hot food. http://www.cakes-n-treats.co.uk\n\nLa Gelateria in Covent garden has vegan sorbet icecreams too. http://www.lagelatiera.co.uk",

Its a parade of infinite choices that we make, with some of them bad and some of them not so bad, and even a good chunk that can even conflict with each other. Veganism is a good choice that can set our sights in the right direction, I'm just playing devil's advocate because I feel most people pigeon hole their vegan identity and don't see some of the conflicting nature of the diet choice or even see it as a \"step\" to a more holistic, ecofriendly lifestyle but rather as a religion to be practiced. I get the impression that there are plenty of subscribers here that aren't even aware about the hypocrisy of eating mass refined foods, and I thought it should be pointed out.",

"comment": "So here's the recipe (sorry for the delay). I used these two as basis:     \n[Potato-Savoy-Gratin](http://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/1565751264064145/Kartoffel-Wirsing-Auflauf.html)      \n[Yeast Sauce](http://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/1872951304423958/Hefeschmelz.html)     \nBut I did modify them a bit, so here's my version (from memory, so it may be inaccurate). It will cover 2 average people or 1 really hungry student who likes to get seconds:          \n    \n**Potato-Savoy-Gratin**        \n    \n* 2 large potatoes (think fist-size)\n* around 10 savoy leaves (when cut, it'll fill up a cereal bowl)    \n* 2 red onions    \n* 1 cup soy granules    \n* 1 carrot     \n* Veggie broth    \n* 150ml soy cream (like [this](http://www.alpro.com/uk/products/cream-variation/soya-cuisine-single))      \n* Salt    \n* Pepper    \n      \n**Yeast Sauce**     \n    \n* 2 Tbsp margarine (used olive oil because I'm going palm- and coconut-free)     \n* 3 tsp flour     \n* 150ml water     \n* 3 Tbsp nutritional yeast    \n* 1 tsp medium-hot mustard    \n* garlic powder     \n* 1 tsp salt      \n        \n**Preparation Steps:**    \nGranules:   \n\n1. Cover the soy granules in hot veggie broth until they're ready. When done, keep the broth and press the liquid out of the granules (so they will get crispier later).     \n2. Stir-fry the granules and chopped red onions until they're crisp    \n      \nVeggies:    \n     \n1. Cut the savoy leaves into strips. Blanch (I just learned this word today) for 3-4 minutes and take them out of the water.     \n2. Peel and cut the potatoes into 1cm slices and peel and dice the carrot.    \n3. Cook the potatoes and carrot in the same savoy-water until the potatoes are almost completely soft (they still had a bit of bite in them in the middle).     \n4. Coat baking dish with oil.    \n5. Make 1 layer out of the potatoes and carrot, then 1 layer with the savoy strips, then put the granules+onions on top. Use 100ml leftover veggie broth and the soy cream and distribute them evenly over the dish. Salt + pepper on top according to taste preferences.   \n6. Put into the oven at 200°C for around 10minutes.        \n      \nYeast Sauce:      \n     \n1. Heat the margarine/oil and stir in the flour until it becomes light brown. (Do you call this roux?)     \n2. Add the water and stir in the nutritional yeast, mustard, garlic powder and salt.     \n3. Simmer for a few minutes, add flour if you feel it's not thick enough.     \n4. Get the dish out of the oven, spread sauce on top.     \n5. Back into the oven for another 5-10minutes.       \n       \nEnjoy :)     \nBtw., this sauce is really great on top of pizza as well. It's nothing like cheese but I just love the yeast+mustard+salt+garlic combination!",

Yet you still see many businesses providing their services to blacks, including letting them rent in places where it's illegal for them to live. It is simply unprofitable for businesses not to deal with minorities in a free market. \n\nI think you will find that boycotts are prevalent. For example, It's happening today. Many people are refusing to do business with a company that doesn't explicitly reject racism, let alone the ones that openly accept racist customers. \n\nIn fact, boycotting is the main method in which you use to promote veganism. Vegans don't buy vegan products because they don't want to support the industries that abuse animals. This whole subreddit is dedicated to boycotting.\n\nThe rich and powerful are rich and powerful because they bribe the government, which has a monopoly on force, to implement laws, the laws you advocate for, to reduce competition in the marketplace so that they do not have to provide as quality services. The laws you advocate for we're often, in history used and created as Eugenics devices to unemploy and starve those who were \"undesirable\" in society.\n\nWould you say that the historical trend is that governments have become more authoritarian, or less authoritarian? Would you rather be a minority today or farther back in history? \n\nIf what I'm saying truly is fallacious, you should have no trouble finding the flaws in the book I recommended to you. Try to remember, though, we are on the same side. We have the same goals, we just feel that different implementations will work better. Good luck to you too!",

"comment": "&gt; I'm also asking about cities and development. Is there anything vegan about expanding a city if it means killing the natural habitat of animals? \n\nIt's true that simply by existing, human beings encroach upon the environment we all have to share together. This competition for land and resources used for genuine survival inevitably leads to animal deaths. [Veganism doesn't claim 'perfection'](https://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/you-cannot-be-100-percent-vegan), whatever one might imagine that to be. The [Vegan Society](http://www.vegansociety.com/try-vegan/definition-veganism), which coined the term 'vegan', acknowledges reality:\n\n&gt; \"*Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.*\"\n\nEssentially \"be aware and do you best\". Ultimately the question of human population control will be forced upon us, perhaps in the century to come. That's a political hot potato noone want to address, but it's inevitable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; If there wasn't any animal suffering in the act of eating meat, would you?\n\nI exploited and abused animals for almost 40 years until I finally took the time to learn that my behaviour wasn't optimal or even necessary. There is nothing gained from the consumption of animal products that cannot be gained from a plant or bacterial source. That is why a well planned plant based diet is commended by [all the major dietetics organisations around the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs). \n\nApart from being explicitly unnecessary from a nutritional standpoint, feeding crops to animals before slaughtering them rather than just eating the crops directly is massively energy inefficient. The understanding of trophic levels, the relationship between food production from plants to herbivores and then carnivores, reveals that: [The efficiency with which energy or biomass is transferred from one trophic level to the next is called the ecological efficiency. Consumers at each level convert on average only about 10% of the chemical energy in their food to their own organic tissue (the ten-percent law).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level#Biomass_transfer_efficiency). Another interesting article here asked [Where Do Humans Really Rank on the Food Chain?](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/where-do-humans-really-rank-on-the-food-chain-180948053/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; If we make a move to more and more energy efficient and non polluting energy sources, is there an issue here concerning the energy we use for growing animals? \n\nI don't quite follow this question. But in any case, veganism in part calls for the abolition or ending of 'growing animals' assuming you are referring to livestock such as cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, ducks, farmed fish and [others tallied here](http://thevegancalculator.com/animal-slaughter/). Other animal abuses such as wild caught fishing and hunting are equally unnecessary for citizens of reasonably developed and civilised societies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; i live in a country where i could eat like a king on 10 dollara a say. Let's say, without meat, i cannot eat a balanced diet.\n\nSome people here have expressed their grocery costs are as little as $USD60 a month or $2 a day. Plant foods are not expensive and adequate nutrition is accessible to most people imaginable living as part of civilised societies across most of the world. The use of free tools including nutritional analysis websites [HappyForks](https://happyforks.com/) (no signup required) or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) (signup required) help alleviate concerns over nutrition and dietary intake.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; How would you be able to influence an entire country to become vegan? \n\nMisinformation and poor education are the primary obstacles stalling the progressive adoption of a plant based diet and of veganism as the conscientious opposition to animal abuse. Widespread social change is slow and challenging, there is no denying that fact. Look at the change in societal attitude toward smoking tobacco for example. Around 70 years ago, in the 1940s and 1950s, almost everyone smoked tobacco - it was the norm. Many decades passed until we saw major changes in policy such as banning tobacco sponsorship (sporting events for example) and more recently plain packaging. Smoking is now quite socially unacceptable and a somewhat pitiful addiction affecting certain demographics.\n\nI certainly hope veganism doesn't taken 70 years to become socially dominant in this age of information, but it may well do seeing how humans tend to really drag their psychological feet when it comes to selfish addictive habits of personal pleasure.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Is your honest desire to see everyone become a vegan? Or to fight a good fight? \n\nThe question is one of justice. Is the unnecessary exploitation and abuse of animals fair or just? The animal rights and abolition perspective is no, our treatment of non-human animals is not fair, justified or even necessary. Abuse is abuse. We must oppose. Tom Regan provides a clear answer:\n\n[Tom Regan: An Introduction to Animal Rights ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyCxnMdpUg)\n\n&gt;(written by Tom Regan)  \n&gt;The position we hold, the abolitionist position, is often said to be 'extreme,' and those of us who hold it are said to be 'extremists.' The unspoken suggestions are that extreme positions cannot be right and that extremists must be wrong. \n&gt; \n&gt; But I am an extremist when it comes to rape - I am against it all the time. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I am an extremist when it comes to child abuse - I am against it all the time. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I am an extremist when it comes to sexual discrimination, racial discrimination - I am against it all the time. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I am an extremist when it comes to abuse of the elderly - I am against it all the time. \n&gt;  \n&gt; The plain fact is, moral truth often is extreme, and must be, for when the injustice is absolute, then one must oppose it - absolutely.",

If you view it as a huge burden, and something that you're almost forced to do, then of course you're not gonna stick with it.\n\nI'm doing the right thing, even though it's easier and more convenient to just go along with everybody else and partake in the torture and slaughter that comes with animal agriculture. You could do it too. You did it for 3 months, and if you have the right attitude, you can do it for life. \n\nHit me up if you need any advice or anything. And maybe partake in some shitposts once in a while. It's good for the soul.",

You're absolutely right that profit motivated animal agriculture is the \"enemy,\" so to speak. That's why vegan activism seeks to educate meat eaters about animal agriculture, because the only way to make changes under capitalism is by changing demand on the consumer level.\n\nAs for solving animal cruelty, the goal of veganism is not and never was about ending all suffering or cruelty. It's about not breeding animals into existence for the sake of being cruel to them, and vastly reducing the suffering that we directly cause to animals now that it's no longer necessary for our survival as a society.",

I know a lot of people in our environment will try to disregard them as an exaggeration, but it's most definitely not!\n\nThat being said, you do not deserve feeling like this and there's no shame in seeking professional help. When you find some strength please do, it can only help .\n\nLastly I want you to know that you helped me personally. My wife is vegan and I'm not and our situation resembles what you described in many ways. She doesn't seem to care much but I know how strong her feelings are towards animals and she's probably holding it to protect me. Your post made me realize I should be way more active and supportive in this! So thank you!",

(Weddings are another example of this...a vegan couple could host a fully catered plant based wedding with tons of tasty options, and some omnis will still have a toddler meltdown when they learn there's no meat on the menu.) Like damn, I could understand being upset if they were serving nothing but celery sticks and raw tofu, but to turn your nose up at tasty, filling foods like mashed potatoes and stuffing and pie that just happens to not have dairy in it strikes me as really childish and entitled. You're right that we don't know the full situation and I'm sure MIL isn't a mustache twirling cartoon villain or anything, but unfortunately this kind of rudeness to vegans is so common that I don't think it even registers to most people.",

"comment": "From a scientific standpoint, there is no such thing as a true omnivore unlike carnivores or herbivores. Even with the carnivores and herbivores, they have a digestive system that is specialized for meat for the former and plants for the latter but that does not mean animals with those specialized systems do not gain some amount of nutrition from the other category of food. One example of this is the panda and other species of bears except the polar bear, where their diet is predominantly herbivorous although they have a carnivorous digestive system. \n\nSo most animals, to some degree can be considered omnivorous. \nAny of these other dietary classifications are only used as a descriptor of the predominant diet. It doesn't really mean anything, because many animals will eat whatever is available to them in their environment and adapt accordingly over time if they don't die out from insufficient nutrition. \n\nA review article on EC Nutrition by Kerna, *et al* say it is difficult to conclude but evidence points to humans having started with a herbivorous system but adapting to omnivorous diet and evolving over time.\n\nBut I would say don't be too hung up on it, classifications change all the time as more evidence shows up. That also isn't a good argument for veganism, there are just valid scientific ones that have a different focus besides evolution.",

Money can help in ways that other ways can't - it helps.\n\nI think talking about the here and now isn't helping to get to an answer of if a sustainable, vegan capitalistic system is inherently bad. I don't think that was answered by you yet.\n\nFaux products aren't technically vegan - and neither is buying from non-vegan places either.\n\nI'm not sure if you understand what capitalism is about - the word has 'capital' in it - and that's just having items - land, labor, and capital. So yeah - gardens would be capitalism minus the visible dollar bills. The money's still there - it's just placed into property. That doesn't change it for what it is.\n\nI think what you're referring to is a non-fiat economy - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-monetary\\_economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-monetary_economy) , because that's different than capitalism, which I get has been synonymous with a monetary system.\n\nWhat I talk about - is past all that - which is post-scarcity. You can have capitalism and money in a post-scarce world. So I feel there's both a lack of understanding of concepts if not a lack of knowing certain ones. But that's ok - hopefully we can get somewhere with this.\n\nAgrarian societies are still capitalistic. They also aren't the best setups for society, which is why we moved onto the industrial age. I don't believe in backsliding like this, but moving forward - which involves agrarian elements, but not going back to an agrarian society again. Or if it is, it's agrarian society 2.0 as I call it.\n\nI grow my own food and community gardens where I live exist, but that doesn't mean I don't sell what I have periodically. I usually give it away, but people still give me money when they feel like it.\n\nI've found the reason why people work a job is because someone else wants them to work for them. If people work for themselves (and I don't mean pandering to customers) - then there's full independence.\n\nAnd yes, that's my quote - you don't need a job if you don't spend money.\n\nThe issue isn't the capitalistic part of your example - it's the controlling aspect. If someone finds a way to save someone else money a lot that they want a few dollars of that - I don't see any issue with that. \n\nThat's why I created my own economic system called an 'appreciation economy' - where people live off the excesses of others freely on the supply side and the demand side is just providing for oneself. That's the ultimate economy we both talk about here.",

That night I watched a few videos/read about it and went vegan. I was stupid enough to go my whole life thinking that cows just magically produced milk. They are mammals, they need to be pregnant to produce milk, just like all mammals do. \n\nMy husband ate everything and went vegan overnight too after a a few days of conversation on my part. \n\nVegetarians need to face the reality of the hypocrisy of their diet - if you won’t eat animals for ethics, look into dairy/eggs. Those industries are even more cruel than meat. Go vegan.",

It's about sustainability and about compassion - not taste or what is \"natural\" (I'm going to say that Cheetos aren't exactly \"natural\" - we've moved past hunting and gathering and shitting in holes outside - why not move forward when it comes to our diet when we have the means to do so?). \n\nAlso, it's not like caring about this cause means that we don't or can't care about other causes. In fact, I'm going to say that many vegans feel deep compassion toward people and have great passion for other causes. \n\nAnyway, I won't feed the troll anymore.

"comment": "I would have worried about this as well, and this is by no means what you want to hear if you are anything like me 5-10 years ago but here it goes. Worrying about things like this does not help you or the animals. Minor ingredient hunting is as close to vegan dogma as there is. In the end if you live a relaxed vegan lifestyle you are removing 99.8% of animal products from your life. \n\nI have this opinion for a few reasons. First it is not comfortable, if you want a bagel, grab one!  second it is discouraging to new vegans to learn that so many things are technically not vegan. and finally it makes us all look really picky and ignores the big picture.",

In that case, staying vegan might be a challenge or even impossible, but it certainly won't mean that he should go carnivore or eat meat every day (or at all - vegetarian might already work).",
