Their wholesale cost for that electricity is 3-5 cents/kWh, and the retail rate averages 8.5 cents an hour, which makes for a *very* heavy subsidy indeed.\n\nTOU rates are available in some places. In that case, they wind up being a kind of sleight-of-hand. The ratepayer \"subsidizes\" himself, cutting use during the day and using more at night. What you ask -- for the utility to pay retail high TOU rates for mid-day panel generation while collecting low TOU rates for night-time panel generation -- would be a gigantic subsidy. How gigantic would, of course, depend on the details.\n\nI'm a believer in both solar and EVs, and support *some* subsidies. I think 1:1 swaps are reasonable, i.e., a kilowatt for a kilowatt, but I wouldn't support going past that and forcing utilities to pay peak retail rates for power generated by panels. The farthest I'd go is forcing them to pay the higher of a kilowatt-for-kilowatt and the peak wholesale rate.\n\nPast that, you wind up subsidizing solar panels in places where they're simply not the best alternative. Germany has done this, and as a result their electricity rates are just astronomical. And the hilariously misleading statistical cherry picking that gets done aside, the results of solar power there have been miniscule at best. The claims for big results *always* fall apart on honest and rigorous examination.\n\nSolar power makes a whole lot of sense in sunny, southern latitudes. Make me emperor, and every rooftop in Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, San Diego, and the L.A. basin would have panels, and so would some pretty big stretches of the Mojave Desert. It makes all kinds of sense there. Same in parts of Texas and Florida. But heavy subsidies in places like Massachusetts and Washington State (even in the sunny areas east of the Cascades) simply do not cost out.\n\nAre we going to do this just to make ourselves feel good? Well, that's the local specialty in Seattle, where everyone falls all over themselves to *appear* virtuous. Or are we going to do this for real, and deploy limited resources in the smartest way? Are people serious, or just playing some sort of virtue-status game? At the horrible (ha ha!) risk of offending some of the innumerate dreamers here, I'm a realist. Show me the real numbers, not some faked-up fantasies, and then we talk.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012681134976446629,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1270473350504678,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1962491137747042,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30075728079939296,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23073490344540915,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22548104024599985,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.008449760915633911,"ev_1":-0.18662665562138056,"ev_2":-0.2722919368887072,"ev_3":-0.13885456862311912,"ev_4":-0.020084851479623467,"ev_5":-0.0014006285903936562,"ev_6":-0.027842138496149953},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

By \"your side of the issue\" I was referring to the climate issue, not the nuclear issue; and by \"people\" I  meant Republicans. \n\n&gt;nuclear for base load and solar for peak load is a good match\n\nI agree, with other stuff thrown in as well I'm sure. Ultimately the economics of each will decide how significant of a player it'll be. I just don't want to see those economics skewed by unpriced externalities or other \"hidden subsidies\" if we can call them that.\n\n&gt;I've been trying to make a big solar project work for an off-grid community for five years now, and the cost of storage far outweighs the cost of solar generation\n\nI agree setting up a small-scale off-grid solar system is very costly (and those costs are usually unjustified if on-grid power is available), but you have many more options available when you think in terms of a national power grid and have the flexibility to decouple the storage system from the generation system, and you did a good job running through some of those options. Of course none of them are ideal options now, but using a blend of all available and throwing in some \"smart grid\" technology can get the job done.\n\n&gt;There was some... reluctance to believe that EV owners would be cool with doubling their charge/discharge cycle count.\n\nAnd I'm in that reluctant camp, but I'm starting to come around. And again I don't think this will even be needed, at least specifically for solar, for many decades to come, so it's not hard to imagine batteries may have improved in durability and lowered in cost by then. Also we're still uncertain about what exactly ages EV batteries, but early indications are that for today's lithium batteries things like calendar age and ambient temperature matter just as much or more than cycle count, so it could very well be that the extra cycling would have a barely measurable effect on longevity.\n\nBut obviously nobody would ever be \"cool with it\" for free - EV owners would clearly need to be compensated. And it's also possible that you could do it in such a way that doesn't even add extra cycling - a vehicle charger connected to a smart grid could be instructed to charge only when power is abundant (and pay lower rates for the electricity as a consequence.) This selective charging could go a long way to solving the problem, without EVs even needing to put energy back into the grid (since they'll just *not be charging* when they otherwise might've been at times with less supply), assuming a hypothetical future with widespread adoption of EVs and widespread availability of stations for them to be connected to the grid.\n\n&gt;don't think the same is true of an EV which would need a new battery pack before that additional 100,000 miles would be reached\n\nWell we really don't know how this will play out yet. A used EV may very well \"last\" just as long as an ICE, but the unique problem with EVs is their usefulness (i.e. range) declines gradually with time - it's not a binary works or doesn't work like it is with an ICE. So those who don't need much range can certainly make good use of a used EV, and probably get a very good deal, while those who need more range probably would need a replacement battery or to just buy new.\n\nAnd don't forget that while EVs might \"need\" (again that need is a function of range needed, so it varies by individual driver) a new battery after some time, they need almost *no other maintenance.* The cost of all those oil changes and smog checks and brake jobs and transmission repairs and timing belts and who-knows-what could easily add up to something very close to the cost of a battery replacement.\n\n&gt;I don't know that such would be true of the public at large\n\nOf course it's not - the idea is that purchasing decisions are made one buyer at a time, and a buyer who's not in the Leaf's price range would probably never even think to consider the payback period of its \"price premium.\" However there are already some EVs out there available for cheaper than the Leaf, and with mass production (especially if helped along by subsidy of course) we can expect more to trickle downward. Indeed EVs are a product for the relatively well-to-do right now, but that's true of almost any new product - don't lose sight of just how early in the game it still is.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2999643466468072,"1.1.1_stance":-0.331416207474097,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2757004536274798,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09231156104942784,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07821514558357497,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2120751471225046,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15618716284128217,"ev_1":-0.12088884859392535,"ev_2":-0.2336847892929228,"ev_3":-0.14151877571166552,"ev_4":-0.06991750071241565,"ev_5":-0.2510646808853683,"ev_6":-0.11232303974821364},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

People like the conveniences too much, they'll never want to give them up. And I don't blame them, the world is harsh and technology has made things so much better.\n\nI think we'll just keep pushing through these issues though. Electric cars and proving desirable despite battery tech still being in the early days. If there was a way to rapidly fill up an electric car in as many places as we currently have gas stations, most people would want electric. Their cheaper to drive, deliver power much more smoothly, have few parts to break and don't stink up the place, so I think they'll win without any subsidy (though I do know the subsidies have increased appeal for the early vehicles, which helps manufacturers get the volumes they need for lower prices).\n\nThe only issue right now is that battery tech isn't good for the environment either in mining or disposal, so a future where every car has a giant lithium battery isn't much of an improvement ecologically. Ultimately though I imagine more and more money will be poured into battery research and we'll have cleaner tech storage systems that can be more readily recycled. I've seen some aluminum and carbon based batteries that would use abundant materials which are easily recycled.\n\nIf we can solve the battery problems (and I think the market will press on that till we do) electric vehicles have wonderful characteristics that will cause them to beat fossil fuels on merit alone.\n\nBeyond cars, Elon Musk has said that an electric airplane (which doesn't breathe oxygen like a petrol one does) can get better efficiency by flying at high altitudes. After starting a car company and a rocket company (two of the hardest industries to break into), it wouldn't be totally unreasonable to see an electric jet company pop up. Air travel is extremely expensive due to the fuel costs, and if you owned your own solar array (Musk owns a whole solar factory!) you'd have your own free \"fuel\" for your electric jets. Maybe Musk will pull a Richard Branson and start his own airline.\n\nSo in the end, \"life will find a way\". No one will be forced into the stone age, but no one will be reliant on increasingly scarce fossil fuels. Technology always moves forward. We used to pollute every major city and smoke hung in the air all day, but we didn't close all the factories and tell everyone to give up their cars for horses, we just invented catalytic converters and put regulations on factory pollution. And it worked, because now we have bigger cities with much better air and water despite more cars and an abundance of business.\n\nSo in the future, the airplanes probably will stop polluting, by going electric. Hippies will breathe a sigh of relief but we'll all still ha e our freedom of mobility. No one's really trying to send us back to the stone age, they just know something needs to change. Things will change. For the better.\n\nHonestly, I don't even know why everyone fights about it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23325686017051103,"1.1.1_stance":-0.03298596890332798,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21249965345444885,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.34831692378666046,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28692517994731553,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19023042172193527,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21398139860897747,"ev_1":-0.2338037737636534,"ev_2":-0.09105202448457324,"ev_3":-0.14442553735869296,"ev_4":-0.32970307922611636,"ev_5":-0.09136066438054352,"ev_6":-0.11027128804282237},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

They can be rated for the same output of light but have different consumptions on a Watt basis. It's not the same idea but similar. \n\nAlso, their degradation is industry top guaranteeing more power for the life of the system than any other power. \n\nSo they start off smaller, and producing power, and over the life they degrade much much less and so they produce more for longer. \n\nIn a lot of cases it is actually cheaper on a per kwh basis than other panels. The key there being kwh and not kw. Aka over lifetime the power you are generating with a sun power system will save you electricity you would have to get from the grid if you didn't go sun power. \n\nAlso important that since the system is smaller you can expand the number of panels in the future (ev charging station? Pool.. Etc.) where if you get a less efficient larger system you may have the space to do so. \n\nAlso their warranty is the best.

If one of the battery banks fails, it can be disabled and system will switch to charging/discharging other automatically.\n\n2) if one cell fails or cable gets loose, it is easy to replace it, and no need to have spares or do it immediately.\n\n3) it is easy to perform periodic full capacity check by doing fill charge / discharge\n\n4) when battery bank becomes old, or you used poor batteries for one of the banks, and want to switch to something else, it is easy.\n\n5) it can be done using DC/DC converters which have higher power density and higher efficiency than DC/ac/DC conversion, and don't require frequency and phase synchronization, or worrying about skin effect loses.\n\n6) if you have some big DC loads, like electric car, and DC bus is 380-400V, you don't need to have a big DC/ac converter for it.\n\n7) one of the banks can be composed of used cells or batteries, if you can find them cheap. This is because the other bank would be composed of trusted, new, higher quality ones, and failure of the bank is not putting you offline. This can in fact improve economics in some cases.\n\n8) one of the batteries could be the EV itself, which if it happens the sun is not out for some time, I could decide to not use it as a vehicle, but instead as a battery storage for house.\n\n9) ability to experiment safely with smaller bank, including new chemistries and technologies (like zinc-bromide batteries), as the second bank can be setup to be smaller if needed, and one can configure how often to cycle it.\n\n10) ability to resize system without putting it offline.\n\n11) lithium so have better end to end efficiency. So combing lithium and lead, and just using lead sporadically (with more than 50% DoD even), can be beneficial.\n\nThe system doesn't actually need to be more complex, in fact I figured out how to make it using off the shelf components.\n\nIf you make system DC focused it has some other extra benefits, especially if you have big DC loads. One of them is not needing to worry about reactive power, and in general higher efficiency and modularity. You can make many loads more efficient if you make them DC based instead of AC based, including EV charging, HVAC using BLDC, heating is trivial to convert, lighting, but even more. On average efficiency can be improved by at least 5%, sometimes 10%, especially under smaller loads.\n\nThe efficiencies are rather of the side effect, when exposing DC bus and hooking two batteries to it, via bidirectional DCDC converters.\n\nOther option is to use UPS as a second layer, with ability to make various loads use separate circuits, (also super easy to do with off the shelve components), but in general is less efficient, unless you use just standby UPS, which isn't perfect normally. Online ups is better, but is less efficient. But in my use case standby UPS also is acceptable, because I can instruct almost any UPS to stop charging and start internal inverter and synchronize before switching to it, so there would be almost zero switching time usually associated with standby UPS. I was going to have a separate UPS for one of main IT loads anyway (and it is a big part of total load in house), so resizing battery in it to support multi day operation doesn't add any extra complexity. The only problem with UPS based secondary bank, is that I can't truly make it sequential discharge, if it only support parts of the loads.\n\nI also did find some publications exactly about this approach of using multiple storage options, so it is not unheard of.\n\nI didn't do full economics studies of it, but I am certain there are situations where it is going to be clearly beneficial.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00020377699790212014,"1.1.1_stance":-0.6551428884267807,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.179030762911679,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1743647794549664,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26906106942882957,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2177578457549172,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09261397824836119,"ev_1":-0.14712429234241206,"ev_2":-0.00593898774968693,"ev_3":-0.004170393704650148,"ev_4":-0.057598589560560264,"ev_5":-0.008672447358549107,"ev_6":-0.21770455511967188},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

They are arranged such that half of the cells, 198, are in parallel with the other half. The big number that’s been thrown around for years now is “800,” as it’s a rather high system voltage for an EV.\n\nThe fact is, they went with 800v, because it was the only way to get any charging faster than 150kw without doing all the work tesla did to enable it.  Tesla does 300kw currently on a pack configuration the taycan would have to handle at half power.  The subpacks in the taycan are worse than a tesla pack that was doing 150kw and are creamed by the newest packs that do 300kw.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003014355643244926,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07556322246211948,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18123361500261734,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07726048429807027,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21801952629402876,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17668725589776121,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.019091632969017763,"ev_1":-0.0103200798597148,"ev_2":-0.002271424818900414,"ev_3":-0.0024745940366604677,"ev_4":-0.00036515205283649266,"ev_5":-0.0009625891082881329,"ev_6":-0.20258452606465677},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

He also has a deposit on their car. I said good luck on that one...\n\nI also see their bikes around town sometimes and they’re always on Craigslist. \n\nBased on this I did pay for an ebike up front about 4 months ago that should be delivered in two months now. I tried to place the $100 deposit and wait to pay the rest but you are right : it was a credit account and not a deposit. You end up paying for the whole thing right away basically or waiting while making payments, unlike most people’s idea of a deposit. They should change their strategy. \n\nAll this aside this motorcycle still looks too good to be true to me. Especially the range.. 80 miles from 4 kwh, and a top speed of 80 mph? It would probably go 30 miles at 60-65, maybe 40, but I think it would only get 80 miles of range at about 20 mph.\n\nAlso curious about charging.

So depending on the income and financial structure of his company, the only real advantage is getting those tax savings over the depreciation schedule + paying the money back as income over time. Still, it may be worthwhile if the array is sufficiently expensive. \n\nWhere the real fun begins is if OP buys the material directly and then installs the array himself. What would be the tax basis of the array?  Leasing companies will often take the basis at \"fair market value\". By setting the FMV at a high enough rate, its possible for the tax credit + depreciation advantage to exceed the hard costs - basically netting you a free solar array until it comes time to pay your taxes. What's the solution? Keep installing more solar and getting more tax deferrals! Then again, if you claim FMV above what others are claiming FMV at... is it really FMV? And since leases include maintenance costs, which are excluded from the tax credit + depreciation, should that be used as an argument to justify a higher than average FMV?\n\nAt which point, it's not too hard to understand [what SolarCity's business model and why it might be cause for concern](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2364215-the-impact-of-a-federal-investigation-and-lawsuits-on-solarcitys-stock-price).

Ohms law states that amps, multiplied by volts, equals watts.  Your particular panel is 230v @ 6.8A, which gives you 1564 watts.  You need a minimum of that to run this pump.  You will need an array of panels to run this, along with a 230v inverter, and a battery bank.  \n\nelectrical motors on things like pumps and fans draw their maximum power at startup.  You will probably need some sort of boosting capacitor to give the motor the extra oomph it needs on startup.  Also, you are going to need to find out how much power you will generate on the worst winter days with the least amount of sun.  Can you provide enough energy to run the pump, at least enough to keep you from going without water?  Multiply the size of the array to cover this need.  \n\nConclusion, yes you could run that on a solar array, but you might be better off going with something like [this](http://www.pumpsandtanks.com/Pumps/simple_pump.htm) along with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65ZGfbRxbGc&amp;feature=youtu.be).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0027764300854566195,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21518780669047868,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27832185037596274,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2404517873606605,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28614529202976274,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20006423889712846,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.058073666538499914,"solar_1":-0.1550294589367938,"solar_2":-0.2375633516020391,"solar_3":-0.2902421326575094,"solar_4":-0.07496328767903418,"solar_5":-0.08517060289159417,"solar_6":-0.10003043222241104,"solar_7":-0.13294786028563976,"solar_8":-0.04989866179415753,"solar_9":-0.1763266654580979,"solar_10":-0.22223663135811034},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

It really depends on the duty cycle of the AC. If it's running 100% of the time the numbers are easy.

The good thing is that the hottest part of the day is also when the sun in shining. And during the night when power in expensive (because of battery storage), the temperature drops and so does the duty cycle. \n\nWhat we really need to answer the question is the COP of the AC unit, the size of the area to be cooled, and the cooling hours (or days, whatever the metric is) for the area where OP lives.\n\nBut I'm going to go off on a tangent and suggest that we get rid of the AC-DC conversion all together.

He needs to correct his VAR demands first. Then, he should realistically contact the utility and ask if they have any energy efficiency programs that could help reduce inefficient loads and power factor correction. Utilities love this, because it's mostly already in their rate base and reduces loading on their feeders.  \n  \nThis issue is not at first a \"solar power\" issue. This is a large industrial complex that needs careful load management.  \n  \nSolar power or other peak shaving on-site generation works well in conjunction with energy efficiency, but will never be affordable to cover the investment costs for businesses. They would need a short payback period, around 3 years for tax benefit spread.  \n  \nAs far as power and energy management would go, their bill is primarily being charged for demand power charges, which captures the highest demand over the billing period. To really reduce this charge, you need peak shaving that hits the same period in the day to coincide with peak power loads. Solar, while great at accumulating kWhr throughout the day, is only its best for power between 11a-1p.  \n  \nOff-grid is off the table. The power a plant like this would need cannot be sustained with small-footprint renewables. It would need mutilple gen-sets running on deisel or natural gas just to meet those demands. I can't imagine any Air Quality district that would green light this off-grid project.  \n  \nFor an idea of scale, an acre of solar PV can acheieve about 200 kW of panels.  \n  \nEDIT: there may be limits to the amount of solar the utility may allow to interconnect. Check with the utility's website for information regarding on-site parallel generation. I know in California, it's currently limited to 1 MW and will be soon going to 5 MW for \"Net Metered\" solar.

Out of that how many kWh of electricity will be produced with a fuel cell? In the end how many driven km? Now compare it to a battery electric vehicle, how many panels would you need to have an equal amount of energy and by extension, an equal amount of traveled km? My common sense calculation would be more than 2x compared to solar panels and batteries but I said 2x to be generous.\n\n70% of 100 kWh is 70 kWh.\n\n60% of 70 kWh is 42 kWh. That's less than half of 100 kWh without accounting for any electricity needed to store/pump the hydrogen or losses along the transfers.\n\nTo be clear, this car has nothing to do with hydrogen fuel cells  as the nano flow cell battery does not use hydrogen and oxygen as the source of the charge. The reaction is not reversible afaik thus the liquids must be replaced to restore the charge. This might not be a technical limitation per se, rather an imposed system by the company.

However most powerwalls are sold in TOU billing locations though so the main point in these locations is load shifting and for the incentives in CA and MD the powerwall needs to cycle and charge from solar, thus the efficiency issue.\nFurther with your pushing of Enphase you still get more power with StorEdge from Solar in a grid up situation.\n\n&gt; Literally SolarEdge's own engineering team is fine with it,\n\nNO they are not toughting clipping.  SolarEdge is ok with over panneling but they do not encourage clipping.  In high shadow and East/West situations, you can over panel and still not clip.\n\n&gt;  It's not about clipping being good; it's the fact that on oversized array can keep an inverter in its maximum efficiency range more of the time, therefore resulting in higher overall generation over the course of the year.\n\nNo see this is ass backwards. It keeps the inverter working at it's hardest but in almost all solar installations the inverter is the cheapest component and with clipping the PV is NOT working at its highest efficiency.  See you are getting your information from INVERTER companies, and ones with limitations at that.  \nSee solaredge has a very flat production curve.  You can have 3kW of solar on a 3kW inverter or a 3.8kW inverter or a 5kW inverter and produce almost identical power with solarEdge.  But if you have 5kW of solar and put it on a 3kW or 3.8kW inverter you will produce drastically less power than if you put it on a 5kW.  I am not saying that installations should be a 1:1 ratio but modeling should be used for the situation to insure a low amount of clipping and often (as with OP) oversizing the inverter so that the customer could expand latter is not going to hurt production.   \nYou should understand this production curve.   But I am not surprised many installer make the same mistake taking it as a recommendation when SolarEdge design tool actually is just telling you it is not going to void the warranty.  They are not telling you clipping is a design recommendation.  \n\n&gt; Sonnen would be a different conversation\n\nSonnen is just a pre-packaged OutBack...\n\n&gt; And you're clearly on LG's payroll, because only someone on their payroll would argue in its favor over the Powerwall 2\n\nPowerwalls are not easy to get and in many locations.

Thus, our house is 100% energy self-sufficient and does not need even an external power connection.\"\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/bzwoc8/german_home_receives_federal_prize_for/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~405943 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **solar**^#1 **energy**^#2 **power**^#3 **system**^#4 **H&amp;ouml;rmann**^#5","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3012771019931303,"1.1.1_stance":-0.026192694359148543,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.10053520830673038,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.020841007741789024,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14008637502168617,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.004128850880078971,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01907944188375647,"solar_1":-0.13128713953096063,"solar_2":-0.033702645661719544,"solar_3":-0.00014322036198185137,"solar_4":-0.0006810284533761054,"solar_5":-0.0006980079633649439,"solar_6":-0.0001798011392869133,"solar_7":-0.0003374827914133978,"solar_8":-0.00039820374756042537,"solar_9":-0.015024834200933887,"solar_10":-0.0005956825273945773},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I have a million dollar policy for my panels and just kept paying for it yearly.  You can get it for the first year and drop it, but for the $220 I pay for it yearly I just keep it for peace of mind. I can give you the information if you want.  The company is out of Orlando.\n\nTECO will still charge you about a $18 grid connect fee, which is crazy stupid high, but nothing we can do about that.\n\nMy 15.84kW system is supposed to produce about 1,703 kWh per month.   Most of my panels are west facing.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Xb8tQEg) are some pics of my system.  In March and April I almost hit 1,900kWh, but January and Februrary I was producing about 1,300 on average.  From May-Sep last year I was producing an average of 1,800, and then it starts to drop.  I just got a new AC and it dropped my electricity use DRAMATICALLY, so hopefully this year I can build net metering credits to offset those lower producing months.\n\nIf you are getting Powerwalls, then do yourself a favor and get a variable speed AC.   If you are trying to save money, then they offer no benefit.  They added about $30-$35 each to my solar bill.  If you want power from when there is an outtage or just to stay off the grid as much as possible, then you need a variable speed AC.   My 17 year old AC was my biggest power hog and would drain the Powerwalls to 10% by 2am if I kept the AC comfortable.   With my variable speed they lasted me until 9:15am and then solar was able to offset my energy load by 10:25am.   I'm sure a brand new AC will do tons better than my old one, but a variable speed AC is the real deal.  I went with a Trane XV20i.   \n\nThe other thing I recommend is get yourself a hybrid water heater to help save electricity usage.   That is my next goal.  With a system my size it I should be 100% energy offset (original est with old AC was 74%), but I want to stay off the grid as much as possible, so a hybrid water heater is in the works very soon.\n\nNow about pricing.  Yours seems pretty high compared to what I paid.  I paid $53,236 for a 15.84kW system with 2 Powerwalls.  My solar loan is $255 a month.    [Here](https://imgur.com/a/m81kLv7) is my information.  After tax credits it comes out to about $37k at the 30% rate.   It's only 26% now, so it'd be a little higher for you now if paid what I did.\n\n\nEDIT: Just saw you want 4 Powerwalls.  My regular solar loan would have been $190 without Powerwalls, so I guess that isn't too much much more from the rate you are getting.  4 Powerwalls is a lot if your house is going to be built more efficiently.  If money is no option, then definitely go for 4.  I guess charging off them at night and probably having a bigger 5 ton unit would use more power. Do you have 1 or 2 AC's for a house that size?  \n\n\nFor your pool, make sure to get a variable speed AC.  I bought one about 5-6 years ago and it instantly knocked off about $75 off my electricity bill.   I run my pool pump about 8 hours on a slow 1k rpm speed to constantly have the water cycle, then run it for an hour at 2,800rpm to get all the leaves, but it's always crystal clear. On my old pool pump it was single speed and ran at 3,450 rpm for 6 hours.  I didn't realize how much electricity that thing used.\n\nYesterday we produced 90kWh of electricity and only used 58.2kWh.   Before the AC I would have used all 90kWh I produced yesterday.   The past few days since we got the AC we have never passed 60kWh, and we do everything like before.   I'm super impressed with it.   So like I said, a variable speed AC is a must if you want those Powerwalls to last you through the night.\n\nI have diesels (got them when they were considered \"green\"), but I still love them.  I couldn't help you there as far as telling you how much electricity they'll use to charge them.  From what I can find to charge about 60 miles would take 15-20kWh, so for a solar system my size that would still leave extra room at the current solar producing rate.\n\nI just have  TECO's regular plan.  I don't do time of usage and stick with net metering.  I have been unable to take advantage of net metering, but I'm pretty sure from here on out I will be able to.  Any excess solar you produce at the end of the year goes towards the grid connect fees the way I understand.  My low months cost me $180 and my highs were $380.  Again, this was with my old AC.  With my new AC I probably would of cut it by 40% and it'd be more like $108 low and $228 high.\n\nI would try to get the solar payments lower.  I will say the guy I dealt with left Tesla and went to another company (sun run I think).  He did supposedly give me a deal, but hopefully the pics I provided will help you get a lower bill.  Don't tell them they gave me a deal and hassle with the sales rep to help you out to meet that.   Again, the 74% offset was on my OLD AC.  We never shut that thing off, so at the time our energy usage was SUPER high at 2,700kWh a month.  After a whole year and half of waiting for solar (Hurricane Irma and Tesla Model 3 roll out) we cut our energy usage to around 2,200kWh on that old AC by turning it up when we aren't here so it wouldn't run most of the day.  We can leave at 78 now all the time now and it'll barely use power.  78 might sound high but with constant cold air blowing it's really nice, but if you like colder I still couldn't see this thing using more than a few kWh per day than what it is using now. It removes TONS of humidty.\n\n\nIf there is anything else I can help you with let me know.  I kind of mixed everything up because I was trying to tell you everything I could think that was important.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"yes","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.22329794118801752,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3724871985565849,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.030041585210369703,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2271583415567875,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.5025643052217025,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15242439586048326,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1726210198685294,"solar_1":-0.12806320956024103,"solar_2":-0.28331145111878353,"solar_3":-0.2893021295173301,"solar_4":-0.05819880365662383,"solar_5":-0.12106726859966581,"solar_6":-0.09948794834500681,"solar_7":-0.20305774304954574,"solar_8":-0.26334192016451996,"solar_9":-0.17704589025466458,"solar_10":-0.24492339775772198},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Each time he has a cheeky idea, the fanbois go nuts and trip over their own dicks to suck his. It's that any criticism, valid or not, gets met with attacks and vitriol, like you just insinuated that their mothers are inexpensive prostitutes.\n\nTesla is by far not a perfect company.  I'm a soon-to-be former customer of their solar division.  We leased solar panels through Solar City and transferred the lease to the new owners.  I'm still getting texts about the solar system because it takes them several weeks to confirm that we closed on the house.  They are literally the last people to recognize the closing.  The mortgage is paid off, all the utilities are moved over, I'm paid, but yet their closing company can't be bothered to check to see if it's been done or not.  I'd like to work with them in the future, but this process hasn't left the best taste in my mouth.  And from what I've seen and heard, this isn't a one-off.\n\nAnother gripe I have is when Elon gets a bug up his ass about some crazy feature and he makes some blanket statement or promise without even questioning if it's viable, then makes changes across multiple fronts because now the engineers are stuck having to make his fever dreams reality.  Like FSD and the yoke.  He's been promising Full Self Driving for several years, and we're still nowhere near it.  Like, it'll be several years before that's even on the horizon.  So what does Elon do?  Replaces the steering wheel with a yoke in the newest iteration of the S, X, and probably CT that has all the worst features of a wheel, yoke, and touchscreen.  Point out how dangerous it is or how you've spent time using a yoke on a race car simulator or how your friend that drives race cars said there's no way in Hell he'd ever recommend a yoke to anyone for a daily driver, and you're a Tesla hater and just cheering for their downfall.\n\nWhen these said features fail, or flop, or his unrealistic timelines meet reality, does he step back and admit that he was wrong?  No, he doubles down and blames everyone else from the government to not letting him use cameras for mirrors or putting restrictions on FSD or recalls on cars because the GPU's in the consoles have failed and need replaced to the other car companies for their practices preventing him from selling cars his way to blaming vendors for missing parts or slipping deadlines.\n\nWhat really bothers me the most is their stance on Right To Repair, their lack of service centers, and how there are little to no options for keeping older cars on the road.  If we're going to have an EV future, they need to be as easy if not easier to repair than ICE.  That means taking them to the local mechanic for a brake job, or going to the local EV mechanic to check out the battery health and replace/rebalance the pack if it errors out.  It means being able to buy individual parts from the market to fix devices, not get stuck having to spend $20k to replace the battery pack because Tesla doesn't want to deal with it themselves.  Small pieces break from time to time.  If the coolant nipple cracks going into the pack, that doesn't mean the pack is dead and it's a repair worth more than the car itself.  It's a $5 part that just takes a while to get to so a few hours in the shop.  Maybe a few hundred dollars to fix this, but not $20k.  When the console fails because the GPU died of old age, a local shop could swap out the unit in a couple hours and either repair the GPU or swap it out with a newer unit.  But Tesla is not opening this up to third parties.  If we don't get R2R codified into law, the EV movement will die before it starts.\n\nHere's the thing.  All of us EV fans are grateful for what Tesla showed could be done with EV's and sales, but they are not perfect.  Not by a long shot.  And the stuff they're doing right (proving EV's work everywhere, direct sales without haggling, OTA updates) are being adopted by the older manufacturers going forward.  Ford announced that they're looking into a direct order process with their future vehicles.  According to some of their dealers, they're going to a one-price model for EV's, and they're pushing OTA updates.  Pretty soon Tesla will have to stand on it's own merits as a car company and will need to leverage the Supercharger network to keep that foothold.  Considering that Tesla's weak point is service, they need to improve that for as many cars as they sell.  Back again to the Ford/Tesla comparison.  There is one Tesla service center within 50 miles of me.  There are close to 30 Ford dealers in that same area, and almost half of them are certified for EV service.  The other half will get there if they're dragged kicking and screaming into the future.\n\nWith all that being said, if my current vehicle died today, I'd probably order a Model Y.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.007644996667901675,"1.1.1_stance":-0.263586206669667,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22764896070928886,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.010078583300734559,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18800886612416245,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23240244530170953,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02577215805558808,"solar_1":-0.12734148237116946,"solar_2":-0.05937871753121726,"solar_3":-0.16328600424202758,"solar_4":-0.12241046216998559,"solar_5":-0.0036457801616052166,"solar_6":-0.2369082964621663,"solar_7":-0.05003426829352975,"solar_8":-0.010927303211550074,"solar_9":-0.1420243296500606,"solar_10":-0.20704042505334963},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Here in Canada I can get 305W panels for $220 Canadian each, I'm not sure if you can find them with that kind of pricing down under. The smaller 100W panels are like $200 here. Run a pair of those 305W panels into a MPPT charge controller and you will have all the power you need.  A 260Ah battery at 12v is 3120Wh, with only 290W of solar it will take 10.75h of ideal conditions to charge from dead not including powering any loads while you charge. If you can get cheap panels, it's better to have the excess supply, just make sure you batteries can handle the charge current. \n\nTypical 2 way RV fridges are terribly inefficient when running on electricity. They use something like 5kWh per day.  On propane they don't use a whole lot. Not sure how much the 3way fridges draw on 12v.\n\nWe put in 1200W of panels and 1100Ah of flooded batteries at 12v to power my parents RV(and future cabin). The RV fridge would run off that system if we have continuous sunny days. But after a cloudy day they would hit the low voltage point on the inverter and the alarm would wake them up in the middle of the night. They recently bought a 12/24v fridge that only uses 0.5kWh and is the same size as a typical home fridge. It wasn't cheap but they now have more power available than they can use. They live there 7 days a week through the summer.  \n\nAt this point I would spend a little more and get LiFePO4 batteries. Last year when I installed my parents system I couldn't justify the cost. But there are some better deals out there now. LiFePO4 batteries just last so much longer(10-15 years+). Cheap deep cycle lead acid batteries might last three years. Good flooded deep cycle batteries can last up to 10 years with really good care but more typically 5-7 years). Also with lead acid, you can really only use 50% of the capacity. So a 200Ah LifePO4 battery really replaces a 400Ah lead acid battery. Also no hydrogen off gassing to worry about. \n\nAll that said, stuff like TVs and laptops really don't use all that much power. Laptop's typically only use like 45W while charging. A small TV is around the same but can vary depending on what type of back light. You don't typically leave them running 24/7, so not really  a significant part of the power budget. \n\nMaking sure all the lights in the RV are LED can save you quite a bit of power.  \n\nFans vary greatly depending on size.  \n\nWith small systems the idle draw of an inverter can be significant if your running it 24/7. If your only turning it on for a few hours to watch tv and charge laptops/devices its not a big deal.  Depending on the size of the inverter it will be somewhere between 10W and 30W. Over 24 hours that is 240Wh to 720Wh.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.07589979987824336,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27472394577944215,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3193990066741653,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23740865290164948,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27822457057936845,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21427761868485876,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19163813317815462,"solar_1":-0.2943844376081669,"solar_2":-0.16184588701806665,"solar_3":-0.06166792684234679,"solar_4":-0.11646710739374638,"solar_5":-0.31248881716581295,"solar_6":-0.05140247076633386,"solar_7":-0.016905981368230034,"solar_8":-0.02345448209598544,"solar_9":-0.2808037570634583,"solar_10":-0.0347849564665618},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (mentions desiring more solar options and discussing limitations in availability)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear\n\n(The text mentions some descriptive norms related to solar panel usage and battery capacity, but it's not clear if these are intended to be prescriptive or descriptive in nature.

No longer think about it as a $30K dollar investment, think about everything monthly.  And how this has happened is solar installers are basically forced to partner with lenders.  They will advertise zero rates or little rates to finance solar!  But in reality a bank is never going to lend money for free, so they have to make up the difference somewhere.

But the proposals rely on discouraging Texas' fastest growing energy sources – wind and solar power – while incentivizing the construction of natural gas power plants that will take years to build. Failures at gas plants in freezing weather were the primary cause of the 2021 blackout.  \n> \n> https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/03/texas-electric-vehicle-charging-bills/  \n> But companies that operate gas stations and could start adding electric vehicle chargers to their locations are cheering on Senate Bill 1002, which prevents utilities in the state’s electricity market from making their customers pay extra so they can build and operate electric vehicle charging stations. Instead, the bill would require utilities to operate charging stations through affiliated, but separate, entities.  \n> \n> Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition that includes businesses pushing to expand access to electric vehicle charging, and companies such as Circle K, RaceTrac and TXB wrote to legislators in support of the bill. Kim Okafor, the general manager of Zero Emission Solutions for Trillium and Love’s Travel Stops, explained to lawmakers that, without the legislation, they could not compete with utilities — which can sell electricity cheaper if they can pass on some of the cost to their power customers.  \n\nMaybe those charging stations are waiting for transformers or maybe they are waiting for new laws.

One thing that's almost the same are the brakes, though in BEVs with strong regen and one-pedal driving, the brakes tend not to be used much and thus don't need servicing or replacement as often.\n\nThere's not a whole lot to do in an EV to boost power or efficiency, and swapping out batteries simply isn't very practical. However, you can do things like add hitches, swap out lights, bumper covers, wheels, add ambient lights, etc. What you really can't do is change the software in the car, and there's some practical limits to aftermarket electronic components because of how they work with the software in the car (all the bits make up an in-car network). You can certainly replace parts yourself, and even upgrade parts.\n\nThere are EV conversion kits for all classes of vehicles too, though a battery and motors for a bus would be very expensive (conversion kits are typically cheaper than a new vehicle), and it would be terribly annoying to charge since most chargers are not pull-thru style but rather parking-space style. The roof of a bus is about 280 square feet, and a top-line solar panel today is going to put out out 20W / sqft, so the best you can do with a schoolbus-sized solar array is about 5.6kW., which would get you about 28 kWh of power per sunny day in direct sun.

My BF is technically obese, and I work at a buffet restaurant. It's pretty much par for the course to see every type of body every day, so I don't think about it.\n\n&gt;Do you think that going veg will generally make people lose weight?\n\nNot necessarily. I've known many new vegetarians to replace protein with carbs, and that doesn't help. If someone has the right tools to plan a menu and creates a caloric deficit, then sure.\n\n&gt;How do you view the health of a fat person?\n\nAgain, you can't judge. BF had a total blood workup last month (he's been overweight for years) and everything was totally normal.\n\n&gt;Do you think fat veg's eat all of the \"bad\" foods? (like fries, sweets, pasta, etc?)\n\nNo.\n\n&gt;Is it always a fat person's fault that they're fat?\n\nNot always.\n\n&gt;Can fat people easily lose weight by eating healthfully and exercising?\n\nI'd say that the majority can, with a consistent effort towards both.\n\n&gt;What do you think of fat people who say they eat healthfully and exercise regularly but don't lose weight?\n\nThey should go get tested for metabolic issues or check the side effects on any medications they may be taking.\n\n&gt;do you think that fat veg's badly portray or represent veganism and/or feel that fat vegans turn people off to veganism?\n\nAbsolutely not. That's absurd.\n\n&gt;Do you feel veganism is about animal rights, environmentalism, health, or what combination thereof?\n\nI might get a lot of flack here, but I'm health first, animal second, environmentalism third. Most of the vegans I've seen on Reddit are animal first. I was a vegetarian who has always been lactose intolerant, so it just made sense.\n\n&gt;Do you feel that bullying/taunting/teasing/cat calling fat people is helpful and will motivate them to lose weight or harmful?\n\nHarmful in every sense of the word.\n\n&gt;Do you feel that fat people are right to hate themselves and their bodies? Do you think that if they lost weight it would lead to greater happiness or success?\n\nAbsolutely not. Absolutely not. You are who you are, and if you are true to yourself and live to your fullest potential no matter your size than it doesn't make a bit of difference.\n\n&gt;Do you feel it's okay to discriminate against fat people?\n\nAgain, absolutely not.\n\n&gt;How do you feel that body size/weight relates to veganism (if at all)?\n\nI don't feel that it does at all.

There's no evidence for it.\n\nIf I took a drug that made me hallucinate the invisible pink unicorn on Mars, would that then be evidence of it?\n\n&gt; You don't have any first-hand knowledge of plant spirits\n\nI certainly don't.\n\n&gt; you somehow feel entitled to dismiss the experience of others who had that experience as mere \"hallucinations\". \n\nThe burden of proof is on the individual making extraordinary claims — extraordinary evidence must be provided when making that sort of claim. \n\nI dismiss it because it doesn't have significant scientific evidence, extraordinary or not. Not only that, but it would essentially contradict pretty much all existing scientific knowledge if such a thing was shown to be true. It seems especially ridiculous to me to make such claims *using a computer*, pretty much the epitome of the scientific process. You're rejecting the foundation that supports the existence of the tool you're using at this very moment to communicate with me.\n\n&gt; It's more like sticking your head in the sand and hoping the issue goes away.\n\nYou seem to think that I don't want magic to exist. I'd actually love it if magic existed. It would be amazing. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to come to the conclusion that it does. Demonstrate \"magic\" in a way compatible with the scientific process and I would be more than happy to accept its existence.\n\n&gt; A real truth seeker investigates for him/herself.\n\nIt isn't practical to investigate every claim personally. It's also not possible to prove that things *don't* exist most of the time. If someone is making the claim that some fact is true, the burden is on them to demonstrate how that is so.\n\nNot only isn't it practical to investigate every claim, but it's also to not possible for a single individual to acquire the specialized knowledge that is necessary to investigate claims on their merits. I could devote my life to a single discipline, such as quantum physics, but to be an expert on *everything* isn't possible. And as a layperson, I can't speak definitively on advanced quantum physics. If something appears unintuitive to me, that is pretty much meaningless.\n\nI am forced to rely on webs of trust/credibility and in processes tailored to minimize error (ie, the scientific process). \n\n&gt; Stephan Beyer did that and he now says things like:\n\nAnd what evidence do we have that he didn't simply hallucinate his revelations? Again, if he is privy to knowledge that isn't explainable by science, this should be demonstrable. And if it's demonstrable, $1,000,000 is waiting for him (or anyone else) that is able to prove their claims.\n\nI don't necessarily doubt he believes it and that you believe him. Facts aren't subjective — it really wouldn't matter if I drank a Big Gulp full of ayahuasca and changed my tune: my opinion is only significant if it's aligned with fact.\n\n&gt; don't want to listen to those who did then I can't help you, sorry.\n\nI can't help you either if you choose to substitute fantasy for reality. I just hope you don't harm causes I believe in through association. Most people considerably less likely to accept the claims of veganism if it has a strong connection to pseudoscience.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001008023027679883,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07180289918960625,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2187695981313785,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.02765970164909959,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20652559275428453,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30238521164802734,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04278346573119052,"diet_1":-0.0357056420277028,"diet_2":-0.008737163760088151,"diet_3":-0.011006083688698709,"diet_4":-0.004845697975421596,"diet_5":-0.010874209224615091,"diet_6":-0.0037537039485566006,"diet_8":-0.0012925678590060368,"diet_9":-0.0014675843801038961,"diet_10":-0.004341386789747048,"diet_11":-0.004249275564992179,"diet_13":-0.0012991248574204899,"diet_14":-0.05940486439916034,"diet_17":-0.011061532534464883},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against.

You could do microwave dinners either way. If you're going to cook, it's going to take just as long either way, possibly longer for omni clean-up because animal protein is harder to clean off. And animal-based foods are certainly more expensive than plant-based foods.\n\nSo, knowing that you're in the same boat effort-wise either way, the question becomes: How can you ease the pain while cooking more healthy options? How does it feel to sit, like on a high stool? Could you maybe place one or two of those strategically in your kitchen so you wouldn't have to stand as much?\n\nOr, quite possibly, because most of the work I seem to do in the kitchen is chopping and cutting vegetables, could you do that sitting at a table instead of standing at a counter?\n\nAside from that, I'm sorry that I can't offer much else. I enjoy cooking and am fortunately relatively healthy so I think nothing of standing in the kitchen for 2-4 hours on Sunday afternoons cooking up batches of meals to last the week. I'm guessing you'd do better 15-30 minutes at a stretch over multiple days than hours straight one day a week.\n\nEven something like homemade Seitan, which I use as a base protein for a lot of meals, is a commitment to 20-ish straight minutes on your feet once you start mixing it.\n\nWhen I want something quick and am willing to sacrifice the healthiness of the food, I usually turn to Gardein brand stuff. The \"porkless pockets\" are killer and minutes in the microwave. That's not cheap, though.\n\nAbout the easiest recipe I do is a simplistic veggie sandwich. Tomato and cucumber on a nice rye or whole grain bread with hommous.\n\nBasic rice &amp; beans might not be too bad on prep time, either, and it's super easy on the budget. Once you get it assembled, it seems like it would require occasional stirring. Maybe make a big batch and use it as a base for salads (spinach and hommous go nice with that, with other assorted salad veggies of course).\n\nSimilarly quinoa salad. Cooks up like rice, then cut up (hopefully sitting) a bunch of other salad type veggies and toss it with your favorite salad dressing.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"yes","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16936554536634527,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2689886012735808,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18793838701599697,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11485218070447445,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2905319750567215,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24614559736292024,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23008704230111712,"diet_1":-0.030101458314068925,"diet_2":-0.0011262921786207396,"diet_3":-0.00924878341902513,"diet_4":-0.016458792810832772,"diet_5":-0.010517869988689199,"diet_6":-0.01313299420507974,"diet_8":-0.0006637055666942615,"diet_9":-0.003559273580322042,"diet_10":-0.21482488095507832,"diet_11":-0.015947427914456955,"diet_13":-0.021871816386313487,"diet_14":-0.12235495381901274,"diet_17":-0.000959239318035543},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

My (and others) position on this is that the ethics don't quite work out to make animal products \"vegan\", or even \"ethical to consume\", if they come from \"throw away\" sources. By eating animal items, one is consuming the products of death, suffering, and objectification; even if plant foods from the same source are considered to have an \"ethical load\" (if you will) as well, the animal sourced items are still orders of magnitude more \"loaded\". Unless someone has no other option but to eat those animal products, then they're consuming the result of death, suffering, and objectification for the sake of their personal pleasure.\n\nI look at this pretty much the same way that I'd look at material that promotes other ethically indefensible acts.

Purchasing such a magazine for the sake of one's own gratification is clearly ethically indefensible, as doing so supports an ethically indefensible industry.

I would go so far as to say that the vast majority of meat eaters, and 100% of \"ethical\" vegetarians, are fundamentally hypocritical in their views.\n\nThat being said, not all meat eaters are like that.  I've seen multiple documentaries like Food Inc and stuff like that, I've seen multiple \"horrifying\" videos smuggled out of slaughterhouses and the like.  That being said, I still happily enjoy eating meat, and I feel that my position is very well justified and consistent both internally and with my larger philosophical worldview.\n\nBut I'm part of an incredibly tiny minority.  Basically all other meat eaters and vegetarians do so for primarily for emotional or intuitive reasons, and they tend to hold inherently hypocritical positions like \"eating meat is okay but kill shelters are inhumane\" or other craziness like \"human slaughter\".\n\nAt the end of the day, most people simply don't have the mental energy to contend with complicated and difficult philosophical ideas.  They've got too much else going on in their life, so there just isn't room for careful consideration of the issue of animal rights.  So they stick to flimsy rationalizations to justify their continued enjoyment of meat, and don't ever really consider the ethical issues.\n\nIt's important to always remember that while humanity is possibly the only species that is cognitively capable of wrestling with these abstract moral issues, we're also still animals.  Often our emotions or physical needs will override our sense of morality, even in far more dangerous situations than eating meat.

Like any mammal, the process of lactation begins with pregnancy, milk is food for babies, so cows are artificially impregnated. It doesn't look like a process you would want done to a pet cat or a dog let alone have done to yourself.\n\nAfter being pregnant for nine months the cow gives birth and are happy for that. Their calf suckles for a day or so and then is taken away. Mama cow is distressed, may bellow for days even to the point of going hoarse. Baby cow is confused and tied up to a little shed, fed formula. If male, will be processed  into veal, and traditionally fed low iron to induce anemic for desired white meat. If female, same fate as mom.\n\nMama cow gets hooked up to milking machines on a regular basis, ask anyone how fun pumping milk is, but include being bred to produce huge quantities with elevated risk of mastitis infection. Soon enough mama cow is impregnated again to keep the milk flowing and the process repeats until she's spent which is about five years. Cows have a lifespan of 20 years, but there's no retirement pasture, she's slaughtered, made into low grade meat. Most cows in the US never go outdoors.\n\nThe veal industry and the dairy industry are the same. Some cheese use an ingredient called rennet for coagulation, collected from the stomach lining of slaughtered calves. A slim argument could be made for including some meat in a human diet, how natural it is, but there's no nutritional requirement for cows' milk. It's superfluous and consumed out of taste and tradition from an exploitative, bleak, and callous process.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1234628235300003,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3055495180759524,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.10304383026355358,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2855249044853959,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.254184618859134,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29751107826208073,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06896770653353694,"diet_1":-0.2260185463707458,"diet_2":-0.21867451770474072,"diet_3":-0.17153236867510607,"diet_4":-0.20846351322906367,"diet_5":-0.15159792302470065,"diet_6":-0.13614444861545238,"diet_8":-0.1347943056607619,"diet_9":-0.27662233814895126,"diet_10":-0.3033231542737364,"diet_11":-0.24435783793211865,"diet_13":-0.34264693587406114,"diet_14":-0.23495180798589077,"diet_17":-0.14825277239549145},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (the author is expressing their belief in the ethical concerns of veganism or vegetarianism, but also acknowledging the lack of availability and difficulty in implementing it fully)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

So that's not promoting the development of animal-free alternatives, but increasing exploitation (of their looks, texture, etc.) of animals in food. \n\nAnd you're kind of cherry picking - it's saying animal-free products that benefit humans. So it's a specific type of animal-free product. No ordinary animal-free product will do. If you think that it is any animal-free product, not much I can do, but I can't sit around calling 'vegans' that eat unhealthy foods 'vegan'. \n\nActually - if you listen to doctors - they will explain an unhealthy 'vegan' (according to your own idea) diet is worse than a healthy animal-based one. It's because sugar, oil, etc. - are not truly vegan - they damage our health too much. All the foods you mention aren't even vegan - they not only replicate the animal for texture, taste, comfort, etc., but replicate its negative health effects too.\n\nIt's weird that you're relabeling what I'm saying that follows the VS's definition to say it's not that, when it is. You don't believe in the VS's definition now? You don't believe in calling it as it is?

I just wonder a couple things though:\n\n1. How much of a privilege is it? Especially for lower incomes due to the fact that its more affordable than animal products. Rice, legumes, potatoes, frozen veggies etc. are some of cheapest foods you can find even cheaper than the junk that people on lower incomes say they have to buy due to price. Its also a lot cheaper when you think about how much it fills you up and how far it goes, not to mention how much healthier is which saves you money in healthcare bills and reduces strain on health care industry (for countries that have universal health care). I hear this reasoning made a lot, and it's hard to say 100% for certain for every single case since I dont know every single person's situation. However, I just don't want it to continue to be an excuse for lots of people to hide behind. Although, for a few, it could just be ignorance - that they dont realize its cheaper, but that's why its important to share that knowledge. \n\n2. I also hope you are not implying we should tackle the intersectionality first and then veganism - why would we do that, when we could and should be focusing on all problems, also being non-vegan costs everyone more anyway due to how much the government subsidizes the animal industry. If we tackle animal agriculture we would also be doing vulnerable people that you mentioned a service, whilst doing a disservice by not addressing this issue. If you are not claiming that, then I apologize for possibly misunderstanding.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2641566878357364,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18913368291947563,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24515554580128796,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25929483938506903,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27949018376507295,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23794858054413204,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13545035393326543,"diet_1":-0.20265132308141406,"diet_2":-0.29181941267840256,"diet_3":-0.19964319913631737,"diet_4":-0.08995725577202762,"diet_5":-0.11936636753186274,"diet_6":-0.19561670203620452,"diet_8":-0.03833994511902953,"diet_9":-0.005705514423122319,"diet_10":-0.2576089888995436,"diet_11":-0.1787170232380963,"diet_13":-0.17077284580348837,"diet_14":-0.24932276598926523,"diet_17":-0.13805837396163648},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (for the second part of the comment, as it expresses an injunctive norm about the importance of addressing animal agriculture as a social issue).","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
