One of the biggest costs of owning a vehicle is depreciation - what this article is all about - and it's difficult to predict how much a given vehicle will depreciate, especially if it's a new type of vehicle with no track record.\n\nThe benefit of leasing is that it removes that uncertainty - you can chose to pay a predetermined fixed amount for depreciation (a lease payment basically IS depreciation, plus interest) rather than purchase the car and \"gamble\" on how much value your car will lose in the open market.\n\nSince that assumption of risk is worth something, you'd typically pay a premium for it, which is why many (myself included) tend to have the attitude that leasing is in general a bad deal. But in the specific case of electric vehicles, there have been a number of leasing deals that are very attractive.

They are very different cars. The C-Max drives more like a boosted Prius (you don't get full acceleration in EV mode, but it does get you most of the way before the engine kicks on), the Volt drives like a cheap Tesla. The Volt never turns the engine on with a full battery (with the exception of Engine maintenance and very cold temperatures), the C-Max ICE will automatically come on if you hit the throttle hard enough. The C-Max really does have a ton more interior room, though. MyFord Touch is absolutely terrible, so if you can get one with Sync 3 cheaply, that would be a good upgrade. I didn't notice any degradation, but I didn't have it too long, others have had fairly severe battery degradation and IIRC, it's rather hard to tell, there isn't a clear KWh meter on the car. The cargo situation is also probably worse than you think, look at one in person before you assume you can deal with it, though everybody's needs are different. I do think the Volt is quite superior in most ways, but the C-Max is an infinitely better family car for the rear seat alone. It stacks up well compared to a Prius/Prius V/Prius Prime, just don't expect mileage to be *quite* as good as the Prius with a depleted battery.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000277897347890151,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23619311006633945,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2039608497484543,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1350335900982221,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27261399799807706,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1618889185893962,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09588897437788546,"ev_1":-0.034539460907884255,"ev_2":-0.008208727079666764,"ev_3":-0.0030369725767135,"ev_4":-0.001471775666383716,"ev_5":-0.17959346746404967,"ev_6":-0.1930560021278462},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

With GPS in most modern cars the tech is there to track locations as well.

With fuel tax there is no direct transmission of that data, I buy gas and pay per mile based on that. \n\nI'm also not a fan of yearly inspections as they are currently implemented in most states here in the US. Other countries have dedicated government agencies that perform these inspections. That in my opinion removes the financial incentive to find a defect and charge for the repair of said defect.  I have personally seen lots of unnecessary failures by unscrupulous shops during the yearly inspections. I know one guy that would say 90% of the cars he inspected needed brake hoses and would fail the car for them.

Seems a bit like a free government handout paid for by taxpayers for no good reason...  California keeps upping their EV credits, and I wonder if that has more to do with Tesla being based in CA and receiving the majority of those credits, where the money will flow back into the CA economy.  Would that be the case if Tesla wasn't based in CA?  Hard to say.\n\nIf the tax credit were to be restarted for those who already hit their quota, would that mean companies that haven't hit their quota would get double credits until they hit their quota?  This is a lot of money on the line, and auto companies are most certainly timing it to maximize the credit, just like Tesla did when they sold 330,000 vehicles for the full credit and many more for partial credit.  (The quota is only 200,000)\n\nTiming is critical, and Tesla setup shop in states with some of the most powerful Democrats, California, New York, and Nevada where it's in those politicians best interest for their own states to push as much money to Tesla as possible, which is already valued at more than all major OEMs combined.

I bet nobody lost their job over this.\n\nExactly.  They still incentivize residential (and commerical) customers  to install solar today.  But they're seeking to charge only residential customers, not their commercial customers.  The reason, I believe, is because the commercial customers have way more at stake than $360-$420 a year, and so would have greater incentive to sue them for a breach of contract.  (I.e., they frauduently induced people to install solar, and now they want to charge them extra for it.)\n\n&gt;There are many ways to raise revenue without solar discriminatory charges:\n\n&gt;1) Lower electricity pricing during the day, raise it at night. Raise everybody's meter fee if kwh billing is no longer relevant.\n\nIn Texas the price of electricity often goes negative at night, because there is so much wind power.  There are many \"free nights and weekend\" electricity plans here now.\n\n&gt;2) Stop compensating exports at retail rates - Texas got no net-metering law.\n\nWith no net metering requirement, that already happens.  With my plan, I get \"full retail\" for the first 500 kWh exported, and half after that.  But I pay more per kWh than I get paid per kWh, so I don't know why they call it \"full retail\" at all. There's only a handful of electric companies that will buy back energy, so it's a buyer's market.\n\n&gt;3) Stop building utility-scale solar projects, Texas RPS is a joke anyway.\n\nNo comment.\n\n&gt;4) Focus on non-wires alternatives to reduce grid infrastructure spending\n\nSuch as?\n\n&gt;5) Implement residential demand charges on all customers\n\nThis would make sense, so they're not going to do it.\n\n&gt;The problem with solar-specific metering fees is they drive people towards the path of disconnection. Society as a whole has a vested interest in making the transition to renewables as cheaply as possible. Grid disconnection is the expensive way to do things, but you bet those solar customers will pay for it when batteries get cheap enough, if they feel discriminated against.\n\nTotally.  A lot of people are going to get a couple Powerwalls, and tell Oncor to get bent.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23667124664786135,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2631519747504381,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2200232775125901,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.36928798810649255,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.37586428186987175,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3027802795715743,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19040362040201822,"solar_1":-0.12919843175922097,"solar_2":-0.16227235838981832,"solar_3":-0.035558189071404435,"solar_4":-0.2462274965752537,"solar_5":-0.0075193926265152795,"solar_6":-0.0013020110394184787,"solar_7":-0.003441413806285709,"solar_8":-0.014778523946006317,"solar_9":-0.16610628969404692,"solar_10":-0.011729703129579624},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The just wired up the gateway and left wires to batteries coiled in the wall.. they gave him no timeline.. wtf","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001623342124124368,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19262017685581598,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18611887292889465,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23427855216323223,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24678103813939656,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2143469521479441,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0600325116829481,"solar_1":-0.016601152950897813,"solar_2":-0.01801503581615786,"solar_3":-0.18348100480757998,"solar_4":-0.2929448609550794,"solar_5":-0.008577266261757662,"solar_6":-0.16779590400620864,"solar_7":-0.007058036280795932,"solar_8":-0.007940686812313894,"solar_9":-0.1823434086838276,"solar_10":-0.21764429373723604},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.

When combining PV and batteries, care must be taken to never directly combine the DC buses. PV voltage is regulated by an MPPT algorithm and changes throughout the day based on irradiance levels and module temperature. \n\n&gt; Perhaps more importantly, batteries both accept power and provide power while PV panels only provide power. Erroneous attempts to “charge” a PV array could be both dangerous and damaging. Similarly, applying the incorrect DC voltage to a battery could also be both dangerous and damaging to the batteries. \n\nIf I assume that a complete idiot is designing a system, *any* sort of system with high voltages is quite dangerous.  Why, what if you were to try and put a 480V three phase inverter on a 240V two phase feed?  That would be very dangerous and quite damaging to the inverter!\n\nIt's also quite deceptive with regards to the \"single stage\" vs \"multi stage\" inverters - what matters is total round trip energy efficiency, not each inverter efficiency.  Plus, they seem to neglect that you're doing AC to DC to AC conversion with an AC coupled system anyway.  DC coupled, typically, you have one DC conversion stage from PV to battery voltage, and then a DC/AC conversion from battery voltage to grid.  AC coupled, you go from PV to AC, but then also AC/DC for battery charging, and DC/AC for using power out of the battery.\n\n... and why they assume that you have to couple each PV with each battery is just an artifact of how they've drawn their diagrams.  That's not how it would be done, in practice.  And then they draw silly conclusions from that:\n\n&gt;  For example, using five smaller battery packs rather than one large one will require five fire suppression systems and five air conditioning systems. This adds both significant up-front cost but also significant ongoing O&amp;M costs.\n\nBecause you can't, say, house a few different battery strings in a single room?\n\nThe paper has so many glaring errors and false assertions that the whole thing is utterly worthless.  It's the hack work of someone who doesn't know what they're talking about, and you shouldn't take anything from it other than \"This is complete rubbish, I should find someone who knows what they're actually talking about.\"","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00042821110885900754,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21537654125131667,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16114898552828244,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24544455014085084,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22363015483295065,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.016729927544171613,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20702775025783815,"solar_1":-0.13542344752446903,"solar_2":-0.020185671288345475,"solar_3":-0.05876540783779186,"solar_4":-0.05626833931516254,"solar_5":-0.004334261980451022,"solar_6":-0.28697877161903307,"solar_7":-0.01425752974076507,"solar_8":-0.015753421878495526,"solar_9":-0.029927851483215306,"solar_10":-0.2434395266075929,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.055346361051003136},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the first kind (machines that produce work with no energy input) are impossible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Second law of thermodynamics: In a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems increases. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the second kind (machines that spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work) are impossible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Third law of thermodynamics: The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.\\[2\\] With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses) the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we have this fossil fuel economy -- especially what concerns energy -- politicians are currently trying to steer this economy towards making things that offsets and \"pays for\" the physics and chemistry here considered laws and processes that has to do with the exchange of energy:\n\n&gt;**Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the first kind (machines that produce work with no energy input) are impossible.**\n\nThis is basically the chosen strategy what concerns wind and solar, where basically FOOD is paying for.\n\nBecause: #1 these things don't last forever. #2 the electricity cost from coal plants isn't the full story.\n\nThe good: #1 populated areas and cities, wind and solar with electric cars -- much better.\n\nThe bad: batteries and energy cells are likely to be just as dangerous explosive or flammable as oils.\n\nThe absurd: No batteries exist that allows a solar panel factory run on solar -- they all use coal -- but for the sake of contrarianism and exceptions there might be one, in a corner in the economy somewhere in the world due to circumstance, asking the question if all of these factorises can run on solar and how quick, under oath this is going to be, \"No, never!\".\n\nBeen paying attention to batteries, and it's depressing; completely unlikely to be able to cover the needs of energy intensive industries, you're likely better of creating oils from co2 capture.\n\nEdit: Last edit, and answering, \"why do you take it so far?\", because the planet is a thermodynamic system suspended in a gravity well with a moon, together orbiting a yellow sun. Even if we can somehow find a way to fix the \"chemical\" problem in the atmosphere and the \"threat of this imbalance\". Heat also needs to escape the atmosphere in form of infrared radiation, so at some point the waste energy would boil the planet, with or without planetary sunglasses. A laser is very hot and can be beamed into space, but more waste heat gets released than the energy beamed into space. A green planet is the option that doesn't require or invite technologically absurdities better employed outside a gravity well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Ok, so an example.\n\n[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-efficient-internal-combustion-engine](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-efficient-internal-combustion-engine)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore than 50% requires taking advantage f the thermodynamic system the engine is in, letting it cool for higher temperature difference. For efficient combustion process, and taking advantage that some parts are made to heat and maintain an ideal temperature in a small part of the engine.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine\\_efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_efficiency)\n\nUnderstand and know these things if you want to understand the part of physics most important to engineering.\n\nTalking about entropy doesn't do the same thing -- those working with this however tend to not understand electricity that well, so let's pass on that for now, as there are zero ways of generating electricity either by mechanical work or competing with nature on photosynthesis, or impact wind on a large scale with magnets/generators in the air.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010489089666710545,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13453723986943564,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17081430151283142,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27158670647410954,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28820670508403057,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.025385976497394342,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22028051808336435,"solar_1":-0.11253853858195839,"solar_2":-0.06006219779662308,"solar_3":-0.1388414454470052,"solar_4":-0.021404195841508974,"solar_5":-0.034105999727693244,"solar_6":-0.05481039403571725,"solar_7":-0.02984067357785373,"solar_8":-0.01370169632633386,"solar_9":-0.04239049762596636,"solar_10":-0.09043766004491344,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.2954641936783446},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Hydrogen is sourced one of two ways:\n\n* Separated on extraction of natural gas. For this source, use of hydrogen for transportation does not eliminate the production of greenhouse gases\n* Split from water. For this source, the energy recovery is quite low (given 1 kWh of electricity, the resultant hydrogen would propel a hydrogen fuel cell car much less distance than it would an equivalent battery electric vehicle).\n\nTaking as an example this solar powered hydrogen production: That electricity is currently used to produce hydrogen for fuel cell powered cars (electricity to hydrogen to fuel cell to electric motor to wheels, totals out to ~60% efficiency). Those same solar panels would generate a larger reduction in greenhouse gas emission if the electricity they produced was used to charge battery electric vehicles (~80% efficiency electricity to charger to electric motor to wheel). Or to remove other greenhouse-gas-producing electric sources from the grid.\n\nI pay attention to news about improvements in the efficiency of hydrogen production from water - for example, nuclear plants could be built to [produce hydrogen efficiently at high temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_electrolysis).

Did you read your links? The first one identifies 10b of \"subsidies\". US pump taxes **alone** generate 10x that much in tax revenue. And that's before we add up severance taxes, royalties, property taxes, income taxes, etc.\n\nThe oil industry is a **massive** net tax payer in the US. This is even more true in places like Europe where pump taxes are vastly higher.\n\nAnd most of them aren't even subsidies. \"Royalty Relief\" means the oil company **pays** a royalty. It's just lower than the author wants. The EESI paper says MLPs are available to O&amp;G but not to solar and wind. True, but solar and wind can structure as REITs which get the same tax treatment. So the playing field is level here.\n\nSame with the \"domestic manufacturing deduction\". It's just as available to domestically produced solar panels and wind turbines. If you import oil or solar panels you don't get it, if you produce domestically you do. Zero favoritism for oil vs. solar/wind here, so it's absolutely not an oil subsidy. If Tesla produced solar cells as promised at the Buffalo plant which cost NY taxpayers almost a billion dollars they would qualify for the domestic manufacturing deduction. The cheap Chinese cells they import instead, however, do not qualify.\n\nI could go on about stuff like the depletion allowance, which applies to mines that extract nickel or lithium for EV batteries just as much as to oil wells.

The common argument from hydrogen promoters is: \"If we have infinite green electricity, then who cares if 30-40% is lost in conversion?\" This argument only holds true if the cost of electricity is truly negligible, and given the rise of electrification, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon. It's becoming more likely that there will be a voracious appetite for electricity as decarbonization accelerates - which is why nations are desperately trying to find any carbon-free source of electricity, be it solar, wind, geothermal, or nuclear.\n\nYour argument fails to account for the fact that grid maintenance costs amount to around 11cents/kWh. This number would grow enormously if you had to triple the grid size to allow for battery storage during peak intermittent production. \n\nIf you use electrolyzers in remotely located solar farms you can use much more efficient pipelines/tankers etc to move energy to where it's needed. Before this decade is out, solar farms will produce intermittent electricity for less than 0.5cents/kWh. Even at 30% efficiency (although commercial electrolyzers of 90% efficiency go on sale next year) the costs are compelling when compared to the monster grid costs that come with full scale battery storage.\n\nFurthermore batteries (excluding flow cell batteries and the like) suffer from coupled energy and power density.  This means that beyond a certain number of hours (probably 10) batteries will not compete with hydrogen on cost because hydrogen storage costs scale so much better than battery energy density, which is necessarily coupled to power density. To store more hydrogen you just need a bigger tank, batteries require more of the whole battery assembly to increase storage.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.39510237623615013,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3222771714606516,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2863038288423212,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1738036309119275,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3358729810337796,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3025127087587741,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1730246534778619,"solar_1":-0.0944638873044512,"solar_2":-0.11124789963886733,"solar_3":-0.23973060956896258,"solar_4":-0.042099017556216055,"solar_5":-0.21933225711594181,"solar_6":-0.010662079805721683,"solar_7":-0.008136796444887295,"solar_8":-0.1089114047123682,"solar_9":-0.014483974208125971,"solar_10":-0.1856488557076664},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

IMO it’s important to do whatever small thing you can given your own personal limits and preferences.  No one of us has to do it all or be perfect in our choices.  It grows with time. \n\nIf you have children, teach them a better way to live by example and get them involved in community environmental projects.  Volunteer to help their school start a sustainability, compost, vegetable garden, or reforestation project on school grounds.  Encourage your children to challenge the dominant paradigm.  Get them outside and away from screens.  Feed them healthy food—organic if possible. If you don’t have children, help out the other adults in your life by mentoring their children.\n\nIf you have a car, well, you have many choices—more walking, biking, public transportation.  Buy an EV or a used Prius.  Work remote from home if that is an option. Consider whether you really need a car.  Unfortunately, some of us do.\n\nEat well.  Avoid meat.  Buy organic if you can.  Learn to cook. Do not patronize fast food restaurants.  Do not use plastic wrap or storage containers.  Buy in bulk and bring own containers.  Patronize local food co-op or farmers market.  At the farmers market, encourage local farmers not to use pesticides. (Local toxins are not preferable to imported toxins.) Glass jars (the kind traditionally used in canning) are your friend. \n\nIf you have a house and yard, reforest your yard with native trees or with native grasses or permaculture.  Grow your own food as is suitable for your area.  Avoid using chemicals in your home and yard.  Provide support for neighborhood wildlife—water, shelter, pollinator plant species.  Consider chickens, goats, bee hives.  Get rid of the lawn.  Consider a conservation easement. \n\nAll of your examples will inspire others to do the same. \n\nYour utility company may give you an option to pay a little more to obtain wind energy as opposed to coal or natural gas-produced energy.  Put up solar panels if that is an option. \n\nGet involved with your neighborhood association or municipality or place of worship and encourage sustainability or reforestation projects or the building of community gardens or creation of walking and biking paths.  All of these things are especially important in neglected and Vulnerable communities. Challenge further development with an eye to educating others about what a more livable community might look like.  Encourage local  government to measure, monitor, and post regular updates on such things as air and water quality, miles of walking/biking path, tree canopy, park acreage, greenhouse gas emissions, wetland acreage.  Encourage the creation of wildlife and natural area corridors.  There may be groups in your area who already do these things. Help local Audubon monitor bird species.\n\nLearn to consume less—many people have written on this topic. \n\nStart local but then consider getting involved in state and/or national politics. Challenge the dominant mythology about how humans relate to the natural environment. Vote and work to strengthen your state’s voting laws—especially vote by mail as has been done in Oregon for decades.  Fight all efforts to restrict voting.  Help get others to the polls.  Demand that the state legislature take immediate and actual steps to address climate change.  Find out which industries in your state are the biggest obstacles to change. Gotta know the enemy. \n\nContribute money/efforts to environmental organizations.  Contribute to groups involved in environmental litigation. Sign up for action alerts so you can more easily contact and influence your local politicians and agency officials—even if, especially if, you live in a red district.  \n\nBe as tolerant of others as you can—humans are resistant to change and are more likely to hear your message if they feel first heard and accepted.  (Of course, no tolerance for those peddling hate.)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004039758195479711,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3096273286888997,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22590926198919684,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23019900437446308,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.09028172740803105,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3400239521598439,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0660413327277638,"solar_1":-0.08026230709539005,"solar_2":-0.2448771157945265,"solar_3":-0.1181689987424761,"solar_4":-0.062013867818550616,"solar_5":-0.09129203841793501,"solar_6":-0.06012569780539647,"solar_7":-0.04962693183252279,"solar_8":-0.02989304458294623,"solar_9":-0.07319480040314374,"solar_10":-0.16831212092761738},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

I say this ... to demonstrate what you have to do when you don't have a car\n\nSo just so we're clear, and this is a common theme I've witnessed with guys in high school whose parents wouldn't let them drive, the people who oppose suburbia are the ones who couldn't/weren't allowed to drive. They feel like they don't have control, and I knew that feeling until I got my license later than my friends. \n\nBut we also had buses, uber and friends to transport us, so there were options. The sentiment is that they want to burn down the suburbs for us wealthy and capable privileged car drivers just so they don't feel left out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; Lamestream media\n\n\\&gt; Higher density housing reduces emissions, reduces traffic\n\nHigher density housing \\*in the suburbs\\* increases the number of people and therefore increases the traffic. That's just supply and demand. \n\n\\&gt; Dead racist rich dudes established suburbs\n\nAd hominem is a lazy politicized way to garner support.\n\n\\&gt; It's not about taking away anyone's single family housing, it's about giving people the option to up zone on their own property.\n\nKinda, sorta, but that's misleading. There's another variable not being mentioned here which is the ecological and traffic \\*\\*\\*carrying capacity\\*\\*\\*. You can't just up zone my suburb, Bethesda, and expect traffic to go down and water consumption to go down. You will inherently strain the education resources, which are packed beyond limit, strain the water resources which come from the Potomac river and desalination plant, strain the traffic efficiency which is particularly important as I remember them jammed during 9/11. My high school is building temporary classes in the parking lot to accommodate the influx of upzoners, reducing the quality of education for everyone in the most educated small town in the country. There isn't a network of public transit capable of reaching this area, and if there was, there would be noise pollution, crime and more traffic from slow busses. Worse than the transit noise pollution is the pollution from neighbors. I used to live in Brooklyn as well and the noise pollution from tall buildings was immeasurable and the windows were less insulated than the suburbs. If somebody built a mid level multi-family next to my suburban home, I would hear them making noise... all the time. The whole point of single family zoning is that you have peace and quiet.... and quiet. \n\nMoreover, I've done peer reviewed research about green buildings. The notion that high density housing is the \\*only\\* way to reduce emissions is misguided. You can also create a suburban home that uses extremely thick roof and wall assemblies to create air-tight insulated equations that meet passivhaus standards. Although single family zoning may have an undeniable upfront capital cost, they have the same if not more potential to reduce operational costs, especially when you factor in rooftop solar, which is not viable in dense cities. \n\nAnd before you say that everyone building solar is disingenuous due to silver and silicon constraints, just be aware that solar technology is evolving. In the 70s, 10% efficient panels were used. Now 20% is the standard. NASA uses 40% in space, and it will only become more economical as will double sided and perovskite panels. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, there are now solar panels that use zero silver, replacing it with copper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBatteries can be made with things other than lithium, such as concrete blocks and water to spin turbines with potential energy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoads can be made with permeable surfaces that don't ruin water runoff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConcrete can be replaced with hempcrete and wood piles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteel can be replaced with cross laminated timber.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlass can be replaced with recycled plastic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlastic can be replaced with fungi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a technological solution to everything that doesn't necessarily involve \"smart\" technology that demands lithium and rare earths. That is a common misconception popularized by \"don't look up\" and the technology of carbon capture. I'm not talking about carbon capture. I'm talking about building back \\*better\\* homes that use less energy, produce more energy, constructed with dumb building materials like wood, hemp and fungi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we just come out of a pandemic that ravaged the cities more than the suburbs as a function of density, ignoring the externality of targeted mask disinformation, the city is actually more prone to catastrophic pandemics than the suburbs, so advocating for more density during a pandemic is like... well, there's a historical precedent for that.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3905718263546948,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25870300821886616,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21730812303562105,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28499173762623764,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20448637008666992,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20124264428656993,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.25187988092269126,"solar_1":-0.1637677880597792,"solar_2":-0.22629486445445707,"solar_3":-0.09905180545877101,"solar_4":-0.10001989145530388,"solar_5":-0.17997860618440123,"solar_6":-0.030011449835001258,"solar_7":-0.105280041085886,"solar_8":-0.06855010982690146,"solar_9":-0.05507283930393214,"solar_10":-0.2717625408478189},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

When a biological imperature goes unfulfilled, it has consequences beyond the .69% of a creature's life that it would take fulfilling it.\n\nI bet you have some choice words for those that spay or neuter their pets, depriving them of their biological imperative! Eating meat is not a biological imperative for dogs. \n\n**[Biological imperative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_imperative)**: Biological imperatives are the needs of living organisms required to perpetuate their existence: to survive. Include the following hierarchy of logical imperatives for a living organism: survival, territorialism, competition, reproduction, quality of life-seeking, and group forming. Living organisms that do not attempt to follow or do not succeed in satisfying these imperatives are described as maladaptive; those that do are adaptive.\n\nEating meat is not required for survival, territorialism, competition, reproduction or group forming. You could include it under qualify of life-seeking only via the loosest possible interpretation of the meaning, and by that same token you would be forced to include essentially anything else the dog may want to do. The definition also does not imply that not being able to satisfy a biological imperative, even if one exists, will effect a specific individual negatively *except* that trait will make them less likely to pass on their genes.\n\nYou have yet to make the case that dogs spend their time thinking about the meat they could have had and that it degrades their quality of life.\n\n&gt; The dog's innate desire to eat meat signifies there is a nutritional component that is going unfulfilled. \n\nA human's innate desire to eat potato chips, twinkies and so on rather than healthy foods (take a look at obesity percentages in the US) signifies there is a nutritional component that is going unfulfilled. Hopefully you can see the ridiculousness of that argument now. The conclusion does not follow the premise.\n\n&gt; It doesn't matter what PETA says, vegetarian and vegan diets are not appropriate for dogs, and their health and well-being suffers.\n\nA blanket statement based on nothing, likely a veiled [appeal to nature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature). An appeal to nature is essentially an appeal to tradition: Because things have been this way for a long time, it is good and right that they should remain in that state. I hope I don't have to give you some examples of why this is not the case.\n\nThe food I give my dogs meets the AAFCO guidelines for canine nutrition. In addition to that, I supplement with several things including l-carnitine and taurine - it's unlikely they need it, but I do so to err on the safe side. Unless you have knowledge that canine nutritionists and AAFCO do not and can tell me straight up what specifically is missing from their diet, I have to assume you are pulling your \"facts\" from the orifice down south.\n\n&gt; What do you think would be the response if you asked the majority of the world's population: \"Do you think it's appropriate for a human to exert control of a dog's diet so that the dog must abstain from meat-eating?\", I think the result would be a resounding, \"No!\", regardless of how that country tends to treat dogs.\n\nBecause pure democracy (AKA mob justice) is the correct way to determine these things. Please. What percentage of people think we didn't land on the moon or that Iraq attacked the twin towers? I feel some sympathetic embarrassment just from watching you make this argument.\n\n&gt; And what about the precious animals that die for his food? What about their desires.\" Look, you can feed the dogs roadkill if you want, just feed them some goddamn meat, man.\n\nI have nothing against feeding them roadkill except the effects on their health of eating possibly rotten meat from an animal that may or may not have been healthy or infected with parasites.\n\nListen, I understand you feel strongly about this, and that something specifically about limiting an animals behavior based on my personal ethics offends you in a way that doing the same thing for other *just as selfish* reasons does not. But this is an emotional response, not a rational one. You have not made a rational argument so far - you've made appeals to emotion, baseless assertions and appeals to the natural. Those are not tools to change a rational person's mind.\n\nAs a final thought, I would point out that while my dogs may sacrifice something due to my sense of morality, they also gain considerably from that same sense of morality. They were all removed from circumstances *considerably* less pleasant than what they currently enjoy. Not only this, but I expend considerable resources (significantly more than average, I would surmise) toward ensuring their happiness and welfare as well as preparing for when they are older and require expensive medical attention.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0016670980645964544,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26392741915681284,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2834791401401162,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1363031773691777,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23462179472061226,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24516954286128465,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.018786658549894735,"diet_1":-0.20179484016261995,"diet_2":-0.08467616074873756,"diet_3":-0.2571348484425433,"diet_4":-0.024317052947784152,"diet_5":-0.021357925862200016,"diet_6":-0.01742744659956467,"diet_8":-0.012575894446248034,"diet_9":-0.01869360264390707,"diet_10":-0.013106784443759048,"diet_11":-0.1797399646602571,"diet_13":-0.007333579065743834,"diet_14":-0.19760028015783368,"diet_17":-0.21235861629247665},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Slaves in antiquity were considered property as well, and many of them also passed slavery onto their offspring. (hence the term \"freedman\" for former slaves freed by an emperor or other senior roman official)\n\nIn fact, I really am not aware of any significant differences between American slavery and slavery carried out by countless civilizations hundreds and indeed thousands of years before America or even Britain came into existence. I feel that the issue is that you are not familiar enough with older forms of slavery to realize just how similar, if not identical, they really are/were to more modern slavery.\n\nDon't take my word for it, though: wikipedia may not be an ideal source but it will point you in the right direction.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery#Chattel_slavery\n\nNote what it says? *\"Chattel slavery, so named because people are treated as the personal property, chattels, of an owner and are bought and sold as commodities, is the original form of slavery.\"*\n\nThen note what wikipedia says about the age of slavery at the introduction on the top of the page: *\"Slavery predates written records*\"\n\nChattel form is the original form of slavery and slavery predates written history, which is at least 5000 years old. Point being that chattel slavery is obviously not a novel concept, and most definitely not something that the Americans or somebody else came up with a few centuries ago.\n\nAnyway now that we've dealt with that issue I'm glad you separated your argument into premises and conclusion, it makes it far easier to understand my disagreement, if any.\n\nIt goes without saying that to have a true conclusion one must have true premises. So I will go through your premises and point out which I consider to be true (if they are subjective then of course my response is subjective)\n\n&gt; Ethical behavior is something we are to strive to and act in accordance with\n\nFair enough, I'd agree. Humans are generally motivated to not do things they consider unethical.\n\n&gt; Animals (both human and non-human) can experience  \n&gt; If animals can experience, then they can experience suffering\n\nI wouldn't dispute these either, obviously.\n  \n&gt; Torture is the act of deliberately inflicting severe pain and suffering upon another being.\n\nHere is when we run into a little problem. \"Another being\" is far, far too vague to serve as a definition for torture, in my opinion. Can ants experience suffering? Perhaps, perhaps not. But if they can, anyone who intentionally steps on an ant commits torture.\n\nMice can most definitely experience suffering. In this context, anyone who leaves out a mouse trap intending for mice to run into it and be caught is also committing torture.\n\nMy definition of torture is in line with that of wikipedia's, generally:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture\n\nWhich defines it as *\"practice or act of deliberately inflicting severe physical pain and possibly injury on a person*\". Wikipedia does acknowledge the existence of animal torture, but deals with it separately.\n\nAs for a legal definition,  the Criminal Code of my own country defines torture in s.296.1 in the following context, which implies that torture is only possible with regard to humans; *\"every person acting at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of an official, who inflicts torture on any other person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.\"*\n\n&gt; It is unethical to torture beings that can experience suffering\n\nI disagree with this premise for the same reason I disagree with the above premise; \"beings that can experience suffering\" being used instead of \"persons\" or \"humans.\"\n\nThis may seem pedantic to you, but in the case of a crime such as torture or murder, it is highly relevant. You are no doubt familiar with pro-life/anti-abortion protesters: they often claim that abortion is \"murder.\" But they fail to realize that murder is a specific crime relating to the intentional killing of a person; a fetus is not a person(in my country, at least) and therefore it cannot be murdered. Similarly, animals are not persons and cannot be murdered. Just as an animal cannot be murdered under the law, neither could it be tortured, which is something else that under conventional definitions can only happen to persons.\n\nAs I said before, in order for any of this to become conventionally accepted animals would have to be granted legal personhood, or at least widely believed to be \"persons\". In my estimation that is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future.\n\n&gt; If it is unethical to torture beings that can experience suffering, then it is unethical to torture humans\n\nUndisputed, though that doesn't really help. Either one of the two disputed premises are enough to make the conclusion not logically follow from my perspective, even though it does from your perspective.\n\nAs for \"sustainability\", I thought you might misunderstand the context in which I was using the word. I do not mean \"sustainably\" in terms of an activity that can be carried on indefinitely without damaging the environment: factory farming is clearly no such thing, especially with the current inadequate regulations concerning its pollution. As I said before, the best thing from a biodiversity/environmental point of view would be to kill all the domesticated animals, breed no more of them, and shut down all of the factory farms. Unfortunately as pointed out before this would result in humans simply switching to wild animals and more wild fish in their diet, and would do inestimable damage to our biodiversity as a result.\n\nWhat I meant was that the domesticated animal populations themselves can be indefinitely sustained: we will never run out of domesticated chickens or pigs, we will breed more as required. Wild animal populations, on the other hand, are not sustainable: we can't simply order up another 10 million polar bears to replace any that are killed in the wild.\n\nYour last few paragraphs rightly point out that we are talking about somewhat parallel issues, but allow me to put it this way:\n\nSay the purchase of an iPad results in the death of one polar bear. Polar bear being an example of an animal with a small, fragile population but with a very important role in biodiversity: losing the polar bear is relatively easy and if so its loss could not be repaired or mitigated.\n\nSay the purchase of a steak results in the death of a domesticated cow.\n\nWhich one of those two purchases results in *permanent*, irreparable damage to our biodiversity? To the environment as a whole? Clearly it is the one that results in the death of a wild animal. The cow's death may be inhumane ,it may be tragic, but it does not inflict permanent damage on the planet's biodiversity or ecosystem.\n\nIn other words, we can argue about the humaneness or inhumaneness of eating domesticated animals for another hundred years, there will always be more of them, yet if we do not act quickly many endangered species such as the polar bear may be lost in a matter of years or even months.\n\nAnd, as you pointed out, cloned or synthetic meat may make the domesticated animal argument obsolete anyway.

Since those environments were only populated relatively recently (for example, Paleo-Indian ancestors of Nunamiut are thought to have arrived in Alaska no earlier than 30,000 years ago), such diets represent recent adaptations rather than conditions that shaped human evolution during much of the Paleolithic. More generally, hunting and fishing tend to provide a higher percentage of energy in forager societies living at higher latitudes. Excluding cold-climate and equestrian foragers results in a diet structure of 52% plant calories, 26% hunting calories, and 22% fishing calories.\n\nI suppose the culture I originally read about was more of an outlier, as I think the percentage of plant-derived calories was very high.  They were African as well, which may mean these lower meat-plant ratios are more representative of how our ancestors ate.\n\nI don't know which of our sources is wrong, and I was not implying that hunter-gatherers were vegetarian.\n\nI do know in my area (the Mid-Atlantic region) that nuts would provided the highest ratio of calories consumed to calories expended, at least according to my Archaeology professor.  So, at least in my area, it is likely that Native American hunter gatherers got a great deal of their calories from nuts (or at least they should have been).

London has a million places to go; I spent a lot of time at Tibits and a great Indian place called Sagar that has a separate vegan menu. Glasgow was outstanding, especially Mono and 13th Note, and Edinburgh had some great places as well (Hendersons, David Bann). El Piano in York is fantastic. Acorn in Bath. Go down to Cardiff and eat at Ty Rosa, it's a vegan-friendly bed and breakfast I stayed at.

If you mess up on your way to veganism, don't be overwhelmed or sad. It's part of the process to make mistakes and be a bit lost at the beginning especially. Transitioning to veganism will take time, and that's not your fault.\n\nIf you feel misunderstood by family and friends about your decision, know that you are not alone or a weird or \"not a real man\" (something people will claim sometimes sadly).\n\nGoing vegan in a non vegan world is not always easy. It's definitely worth it, once you understand the hell animals go too so their bodies and byproducts end on our tables. But remember that you are an animal as well. Be kind to yourself too through the process, because you are already doing so much by choosing a more compassionate lifestyle.\n\nAs an end note: while veganism is great from an animal liberation perspective, and its also the better option for the environment in terms of food choices, and it has some health benefits, an overlooked factor in driving us to go vegan is human rights. In short, human rights violations and abuses are rampant in the animal agriculture industry, to the point where slaughterhouse work is considered a highly dangerous job due to high rates of injury and psychological malaise... Raises in drug and substance abuse, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, PTSD, domestic abuse, etc are common in communities where people have to do these job. And it's usually immigrant or impoverished communities who end up doing this physically and psychologically debilitating job that no one else wants to do, to boot.\nIf you are interested in reading more, here's an acti-veg masterpost: https://acti-veg.com/resources/sources/human-rights/\n\nAnd this eye opening short article by the late Virgil Butler, a former slaughterhouse worker turned vegan: https://cyberactivist.blogspot.com/2003/08/inside-mind-of-killer.html?m=1 \nReally insightful as to what our fellow humans go through in order for us to end up with a piece of chicken breast on our tables. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and lots of encouragement.

It's like saying 'well kamala helped support $1 billion of animal agricultural subsidies, so it suggests that she didn't help with vegan legislation - as that would make no sense.' They're different - if you separate it out, it's less confusing, because then it's actually sticking to the topic.\n\nThe issue isn't you disagreeing with me, it's you not wanting to do research that you get yourself confused to where I have to de-confuse you, simply because I did all the work in the research myself - that we never have an actual conversation. I'd love to see you get to that point - where you researched this enough to be able to come back to me with actual disagreements, rather than intentional confusion given as an excuse to be educated without having to put in the work.

I hate to say it, but you are causing your own problems, rather than them.\n\nAnd I already said not to pick on one measly example as saying that's the 'best', but there you go with not being able to actually hold a conversation, so yeah - I'm done here.\n\nOf course - if you don't listen to me and you don't do your research, no amount of explaining will ever change that mind of yours.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-8.856543475606789e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1626228268261779,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2655041602750619,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24059365565578142,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24088361150356113,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16974834642879666,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.00808579164246718,"diet_1":-0.00514958181399076,"diet_2":-0.0020537279936737227,"diet_3":-0.015090421583105732,"diet_4":-0.0040287584900700795,"diet_5":-0.002970504420469903,"diet_6":-0.001526198521484427,"diet_8":-0.0013369386239598195,"diet_9":-0.0015050056924034532,"diet_10":-0.006296675999086195,"diet_11":-0.0029204771259780196,"diet_13":-0.002497370238415897,"diet_14":-0.01290359922859352,"diet_17":-0.0007774040447354006},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.
