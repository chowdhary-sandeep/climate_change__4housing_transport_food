However, it must be taken over 5.5 years, so its actually slightly less than that. Typically another 30%.\n\nNorth Carolina Tax Credit is 35% of $4.50/W. However, it must be taken evenly over 5 years, with a 5 year carry over if you can't use it all. It can only be up to 50% of your tax liability each year.

Harder than it sounds to make this happen. \n\nPresident of a condo board in Vancouver here.  It took me about 3 years to enable our building for EVs.  While I don't personally use an EV (yet), I thought it would be crazy for someone to not get an EV because they can't plug it in. So I personally spearheaded the effort to make it happen. I was very surprised by how hard it was. There was plenty of help on technical stuff (like wiring and charging technology) and plenty of vendors looking to sell chargers but NOTHING on governance challenges. I tried the BC Government, City of Vancouver, property managers, BC Hydro (electricity supplier), and plenty of EV charging vendors. There was 0 help on permits required, bylaws, sample bylaws, parking spot rights, usage guidelines, what we can chargeback, and so on.  Nothing. Couldn't believe it. We even got a grant to help pay for level 2 chargers from the BC Gov and they still couldn't help with this stuff. Finally, I wrote bylaw changes and usage guidelines myself and we got it vetted by some legal experts. Then came the hardest part:  Approval from owners.  I had to get a 75% vote in favour!  Do you know how hard it is to convince 75% of regular people that EVs are not a fad?  Mind you, in our case, we were actually installing 4 level 2 chargers so we were asking Owner's to spend money. I spent countless hours preparing to pitch it and in the end, it passed by 4 votes.  Listen, I'm an electrical engineer, passionate about EVs, a career salesman, a consultant that deals with policy/legal docs, and president of the board.

This comes down to aerodynamics. A 20\" wheel will cause more of a disruption in airflow than an 18\" wheel. That's why Tesla (and others) uses aero covers on their wheels (Car &amp; Driver testing showed it gives about a 3% efficiency bonus at speed). The smaller the wheel, the more of the side profile of the wheel &amp; tire is perfectly flat (the tire is flat, the wheel is open: more tire = more flat area, less open area). Ideally, you'd have just a plain, solid sheet for the wheel, but obviously that's not idea for brake cooling.

Basically when you increase voltage you reduce resistance.  Resistance makes heat.  Heat is why we need larger wires.  Typically if you double the voltage you can run that over the same lines at the same amps.   Since a watt = amp x volts.  You get double the watts on the same wire.\n\nAs an aside, this is one of the reasons Tesla is moving to a 48 volt battery for accessories in the car vs the traditional 12 volt battery.  This allows them to use a smaller wire and reduce the cost of wiring a car which is expensive.  It is not super clear but basically a Tesla uses 5000 feet of wire in each model 3/Y.  So if you can reduce the gauge you can save significant money over the number of cars they produce.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2562784077386157,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2556440035258984,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23446705947147978,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18167700610744456,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30574014014534767,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20350111913513697,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05936128521958987,"ev_1":-0.003028650354584291,"ev_2":-0.0002639955600898247,"ev_3":-0.003498837032869536,"ev_4":-0.0006458327952714171,"ev_5":-0.0005101371158768112,"ev_6":-0.002256503226211256},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Here is an easy, slightly rough, way to calculate your solar power needs.\n\nAverage Efficiency solar modules= Divide your total annual kWh usage to get your PV sizing needed. For instance, let's say your monthly number of 2,300 was your annual total - I would divide it by 1.1 would recommend about 2,100W (2.1kW) to be installed. If you go with high efficiency you can divide by 1.25 - 1,850W (1.85kW). This tool need be adjusted if you angle is less than 30 degree or you're not facing due south.\n\nLet's just say that 2,300 is your peak and 650 is your minimum - and the average between the two perfectly represents your annual average: That's about 17,700kWh annually. 16,000 to 14,000 kW - an above average sizing, but not terribly so. Definitely above average due to your electric heating.\n\nIn reference to the roofing space not being able to meet your needs - that is a challenge many homeowners have (especially two story or complex roofs). I'd recommend going all of one or the other. If you split the two you will be charged more for engineering as two unique types of engineering will be needed. That'll only be a couple of thousand - but it is still a couple of thousand. Additionally, there are modules with a higher efficiency (SunPower) that can squeeze 15% more energy into the same space - 20% efficiency versus 18 (other quality product)/17 (SolarWorld)/15 (regular).\n\nRough costs on DIY vs Contractor: DIY you're still going to need engineering and permits. The power company might require the final grid connection be done by a licensed contractor. Also - you might not be eligible for the block grant - ($1.15/W grant) - not sure though. You are still eligible for the 30% Federal Tax Credit. Is this land a farm or a business by any chance? If so, you can depreciate another 20%...if not forget I said anything.\n\nMy rough guess is about $2/W to install DIY - so $28,000 to $32,000. A 16kW with a contractor will range from $3.75 to 4.25/W depending on product type (SunPower cost $.50/W more). So the out of pocket price range could be $52,500 to $68,000. Of course - you'll get a $16-18.4k block grant and 30% back - meaning your price will fall to $35k to $25k.\n\nThe system will pay for itself between 5-6 years'ish.\n\nIn reference to storage to manage when the grid goes down - unless you've got a gas line to the house - I'd recommend waiting a bit to see how Tesla affects the broader marketplace. Prices could drop 50% between now and late next year, I just don't know. Do complete your system BEFORE the end of 2016 as the 30% tax credit is scheduled to end 12/31/2016. That's a lot of money.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2551211327206693,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24181513653841719,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2741027781267962,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12992376203862444,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18287213214840015,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2701957077210421,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1704319901376342,"solar_1":-0.2619196768624562,"solar_2":-0.2339399615802127,"solar_3":-0.2943359831813609,"solar_4":-0.1837955802841457,"solar_5":-0.18199045967291264,"solar_6":-0.052568191190373356,"solar_7":-0.14891244624353325,"solar_8":-0.06416518090742947,"solar_9":-0.16330111054573823,"solar_10":-0.15903440482860073},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

This is the best possible result for you if you're in San Diego.  If your system is oriented differently than this, you will have slightly lower results.\n\nAccording to [pvwatts,](http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php) your system will produce 8,245kwh/year.  Valued at $1,348/year.  \n\nYour panels should be warrantied for 25 years, giving you total earnings of $33,700 over the lifetime of the system.  This is considering a 0% increase in electrical prices over 25 years.  As the price of electricity goes up, so will the value of the power you produce.\n\n[Your zip code](http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program?zipcode=92071) has several incentives available, Your solar installer should know which ones apply to you.  One of the biggest is the Federal Income Tax Credit of 30% of the total cost of your system.  I just read another post in reddit where they were quoted $3.33/watt in central California.  If that's true in SD, your cost would be about $16,783.20, with the Feds paying you back $5,035 at tax time.  If all my guesses are correct, you're paying $11,750 for your system which will produce $33,700 worth of electricity over its lifetime.  Again, with inflation, the amount you earn will also increase.\n\nI hope this helps.

There are large monetary and political interests behind this push.\n\n&gt; What would they gain from the \"doom and gloom\" news emanating from such a report?\n\nPower and money. Scientists supporting climate change fearmongering narrative are just naive people who fell prey to these demagogues.\n\n&gt; Are there any proofs behind those claims?\n\nPlenty of those. Plenty of research papers and also [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/9lzyc0/climate_scientists_are_struggling_to_find_the/e7aq45o/) nicely summarizes all failures of climate alarmists and plenty of debunks of their claims. But these are the webpages you need to know they exist and are probably blacklisted and/or censored by search engines because they are not part of the Apocalypse Now cult.\n\n&gt; Which sources do you guys trust? Are you certain they aren't influenced by politics and or personal gains like the others you claim are?\n\nAll information sources have something to gain in today's world, because they all run on *ka-ching*. The difference between the sources is validity, truthfulness. Many of those blacklisted as fake news by Google, Facebook, YouTube and others are news sources that are basically truth speakers, those that ask questions that are not asked by MSM and those that show things as it is unredacted (livestreams). It's easier to control through emotions and fear than truth...*\"Think of the children!\"*\n\n&gt; What do you guys think about the renewable energy boom? You seem to believe that man-made climate change does indeed exist (from the sub wiki, I believe), but I haven't seen a lot about wind power, solar power (both of which seem to be gaining quite a bit of traction) and nuclear power electricity. I feel it is quite a good thing for everyone, whether or not you believe global warming is an issue.\n\nThere would be no renewable energy boom, if it wasn't force fed to the masses through emotional manipulation. The technology is simply inadequate, too expensive and it really can't parry nuclear energy (and other conventional means). Every country that promised \"cheap green energy\" ended up with electrical bills much higher than on *old school power sources*. These renewable energy programmes also involve mandated house-metrics (hardware to \"accurately measure\" your power and heating consumption) and this opens up another can of worms called \"Microsoft Excel economy\" where they dynamically change and increase prices so as to squeeze every last penny out of the consumers for as little work (produced energy) as possible. So even if you try to spend less (as they marketed) and you gain noticable improvements, they will just increase prices to counter that so they earn the same. It is a very hypocritical system, because they won't lower the prices of kWh, if we start consuming more...works only one way.\n\n&gt; Also, how can an outside reader like me know that you're not yourselves driven by some political or economical agenda to dismiss global warming?\n\nI can outright tell you that I f'cking despise such people. Science for me personally is serious business and not something to be f'cked around with for political/economical reasons. And words matter. Leftists are usually people who spin around every word you say. They're not interested in objective truth, but being right.\n\nOther than that, you're taking my (our) word for it. It takes time to get to know who is who...sometimes with some you see it immediately, if you have a good bullsh't sensor. The main thing is that one has to be open and able to change their opinion if facts prove his point of view wrong.\n\n&gt; I know I'm doing my part, but I can't help feeling anxious and overwhelmed by these apocalyptic claims.\n\nWait until they Carbon Tax you...then you'll start feeling really anxious for a proper reason - how to afford paying bills or take your family on holidays.\n\n&gt; I believe in climate change, I believe in protecting the environment.\n\nAs do we. Earth's climate has always been changing and will keep changing in the future. We're here for a ride. Also, don't litter!

I am still working with Enphase on my troubleshooting and have been impressed with their level of concern after I sent an \"nice\" email with stats from my other electric monitoring apps.*\n\nI have 28 SunPower X22-360 panels on IQ7x inverters of which 12 panels face SW and 16 panels face SE all going to a IQ Combiner 3 box with a feed to my panel. They are mid branch feed, so no long strings and go through SolaDeck boxes with all terminals from the roof to my main breaker torqued to rated specs...Yes I'm a torque spec nut. I also currently have a Hioki Power Analyzer on my phases to try to get a better idea of whats going on too, but haven't had time to cross analyzer anything yet.\n\nI'm assuming I can't do \"inline\" pictures and the below is the best way to share pics on Reddit?\n\n[Enlighten Day Graph](https://lifewithmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enlighten.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[3rd Party Electricity Monitor Day Graph](https://lifewithmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sense-1024x380.png) @ 1sec logging intervals | *Some of the “roughness” in the production curve is related to the approximately 150 “Grid Events” reported via the Envoy. 300 logged, but I cut it in ½ because the set/clear is a single off/on of the inverter.*\n\n[3rd Party Electricity Monitor Drop out](https://lifewithmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sense2-1024x351.png)\n\n*The dip to 0 after 12pm I’m not sure what it was, but appears production stopped for approx. 7 seconds then started back up.

Very similar to an ES4 but without the external battery, more resilient parts, perhaps dual motors and a tiny bit more battery storage as long as weight allows for it.\n\nEDIT: I don't mind if it is not segway.

So I'm sure the problem is my inverter, but I can't figure out what it is so that I don't make the same mistake while purchasing a second inverter.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005176294119640564,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2784108823452698,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21013562939874975,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2185685516150865,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2240199285600768,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3425821032716914,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.027940388633093487,"solar_1":-0.06908171445441742,"solar_2":-0.18441227980414018,"solar_3":-0.22753614663811167,"solar_4":-0.25052803052434075,"solar_5":-0.12537539039853102,"solar_6":-0.06677710016568501,"solar_7":-0.013621672832717499,"solar_8":-0.005570926595585964,"solar_9":-0.15078791902854569,"solar_10":-0.25625957058944626},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

We'd just be replacing one environment hazard for another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe smartest approach for me would be a solid mix of nuclear and renewable energy that way we can achieve the 100% clean marker on a sooner date and not have such wild fluctuations when it comes to energy output. \n\nNuclear and renewables both should only be temporary until either renewables become effective and recyclable enough or until we develop more long term solutions like fusion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, not using nuclear is going to add many years of fossil fuel use, these are years we don't have.

We don't have time to be taking the safe road that would add many years of fossil fuel usage.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0034685711919640503,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16371393677626855,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1724559878529548,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12661548702386097,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3408723033918557,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2656588006688135,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16037504984285855,"solar_1":-0.10638865470638761,"solar_2":-0.19704799697850275,"solar_3":-0.06417895347686592,"solar_4":-0.01926407280479439,"solar_5":-0.15397578452999974,"solar_6":-0.0533066191613519,"solar_7":-0.06756085629725324,"solar_8":-0.10179336857436283,"solar_9":-0.007622229110324952,"solar_10":-0.11871676737299662,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.1766294603150657},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"The author is in favor of a mix of nuclear and renewable energy.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Most consumer products have an implied warranty of merchantability. This warranty makes the assumption that a good or product works for its intended purpose. It applies not just to new items, but for used items as well.  \n\nFitness\n\nThe warranty of fitness means a product is guaranteed for a specific purpose. This type of implied warranty is below the merchantability warranty. For example, if you tell a salesman you want a saw for cutting metal and it turns out it won’t cut through metal, you may return the item under the implied warranty of fitness.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005410819547250867,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27171269028724815,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14367900118779828,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28169737686024354,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14688271130336086,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24775357145118543,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.271811076921639,"solar_1":-0.2292434398338766,"solar_2":-0.12731119952271305,"solar_3":-0.15467001984688977,"solar_4":-0.20615303511416036,"solar_5":-0.0032112746509180092,"solar_6":-0.16181480937018927,"solar_7":-0.007329777822936497,"solar_8":-0.03515636666573604,"solar_9":-0.13659257055498875,"solar_10":-0.17403397651570332},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

In general, they are based on assumptions that say that renewable energies work 100% of the time (which is impossible because of the intermittency), or take 2 times the cost of decommissioning into account, not to mention aid for renewables, which are taken into account in the final price.\n\nThe full report of IPCC, [available here](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport.pdf), also specifies this p639:\n\n**Nuclear power can deliver low-carbon energy at scale (high confidence). Doing so will require improvements in managing construction of reactor designs that hold the promise of lower costs and broader use (medium confidence). At the same time, nuclear power continues to be affected by cost overruns, high upfront investment needs, challenges with final disposal of radioactive waste, and varying public acceptance and political support levels (high confidence)**. There are sufficient resources for substantially increasing nuclear deployment (medium confidence).\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n**Nuclear power costs vary substantially across countries (high confidence). First-of-a-kind projects under construction in Northern America and Europe have been marked by delays and costs overruns (Berthelemy and Rangel 2015). Construction times have exceeded 13–15 years and cost has surpassed three to four times initial budget estimates (IEA 2020j). In contrast, most of the recent projects in Eastern Asia (with construction starts from 2012) were implemented within five to six years (IAEA 2021). In addition to region-specific factors, future nuclear costs will depend on the ability to benefit from the accumulated experience in controlling the main drivers of cost.** These cost drivers fall into four categories: design maturity; project management; regulatory stability and predictability; and multi-unit and series effects (NEA 2020). With lessons learned from first-of-a-kind projects, **the cost of electricity for new builds are expected to be in the range of USD42–102 MWh–1** **depending on the region** (IEA 2020j).\n\n**Lifetime extensions are significantly cheaper than new builds and cost competitive with other low-carbon technologies.**\n\nThe overnight cost of lifetime extensions is estimated in the range of USD390–630 kWe–1 for Europe and North America, and the LCOE in the range of USD30–36 MWh–1 for extensions of 10–20 years (IEA 2020j).\n\nCost-cutting opportunities, such as design standardisation and innovations in construction approaches, are expected to make SMRs competitive against large reactors by 2040 (Rubio and Tricot 2016) (medium confidence). As SMRs are under development, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the construction costs. Vendors have estimated first-of-a-kind LCOEs at USD131–190 MWh–1. Effects of learning for nth-of-a-kind SMR are anticipated to reduce the firstof-a-kind LCOE by 19–32%.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n**Nuclear energy is found to be favourable regarding land occupation (Cheng and Hammond 2017; Luderer et  al. 2019) and ecological impacts (Brook and Bradshaw 2015; Gibon et  al. 2017). Similarly, bulk material requirements per  unit of energy produced are low (e.g., aluminum, copper, iron, rare earth metals) (Vidal et al. 2013; Luderer et  al. 2019)**. Water-intensive inland nuclear power plants may contribute to localised water stress and competition for water uses. The choice of cooling systems (closed-loop instead of oncethrough) can significantly moderate withdrawal rates of freshwater (Meldrum et al. 2013; Fricko et al. 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Jin et al. 2019). Reactors situated on the seashore are not affected by water scarcity issues (Abousahl et al. 2021). Lifecycle analysis (LCA) studies suggest that the overall impacts on human health (in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs)) from the normal operation of nuclear power plants are substantially lower than those caused by fossil fuel technologies and are comparable to renewable energy sources (Treyer et al. 2014; Gibon et al. 2017).\n\n**Nuclear power continues to suffer from limited public and political support in some countries (high confidence). Public support for nuclear energy is consistently lower than for renewable energy and natural gas, and in many countries as low as support for energy from coal and oil (Corner et al. 2011; Pampel 2011; Hobman and Ashworth 2013).** The major nuclear accidents (i.e., Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima) decreased public support (Poortinga et  al. 2013; Bird et al. 2014). The public remains concerned about the safety risks of nuclear power plants and radioactive materials (Pampel 2011; Bird  et  al. 2014; Tsujikawa et  al. 2016). At the same time, some groups see nuclear energy as a reliable energy source, beneficial for the economy and helpful in climate change mitigation. **Public support for nuclear energy is higher when people are concerned about energy security, including concerns about the availability of energy and high energy prices (Groot et  al. 2013; Gupta et  al. 2019b), and when they expect local benefit (Wang et  al. 2020c). Public support also increases when trust in managing bodies is higher (de Groot and Steg 2011). Similarly, transparent and participative decision-making processes enhance perceived procedural fairness and public support (Sjoberg 2004).**\n\nBecause of the sheer scale of the investment required (individual projects can exceed USD10 billion in value), nearly 90% of nuclear power plants under construction are run by state-owned or controlled companies, with governments assuming significant part of the risks and costs. For countries that choose nuclear power in their energy portfolio, stable political conditions and support, clear regulatory regimes, and adequate financial framework are crucial for successful and efficient implementation.**Many countries have adopted technology-specific policies for low-carbon energy courses, and these policies influence the competitiveness of nuclear power. For example, feed-in-tariffs and feed-in premiums for renewables widely applied in the EU (Kitzing et al. 2012) or renewable portfolio standards in the USA (Barbose et al. 2016) impact wholesale electricity price (leading occasionally to low or even negative prices), which affects the revenues of existing nuclear and other plants (Bruninx et al. 2013; Newbery et al. 2018; Lesser 2019).**\n\n**Nuclear power’s long-term viability may hinge on demonstrating to the public and investors that there is a long-term solution to spent nuclear fuel. Evidence from countries steadily progressing towards first final disposals – Finland, Sweden and France – suggests that broad political support, coherent nuclear waste policies, and a wellmanaged, consensus-based decision-making process are critical for accelerating this process** (Metlay 2016). Proliferation concerns surrounding nuclear power are related to fuel cycle (i.e., uranium enrichment and spent fuel processing). These processes are implemented in a  very limited number of countries following strict national and internationals norms and rules, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines, treaties and conventions. Most of the countries that might introduce nuclear power in the future for their climate change mitigation benefits do not envision developing their own full fuel cycle, significantly reducing any risks that might be linked to proliferation (IAEA 2014, 2019).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0037666050096352897,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2241623218587187,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22458756744023656,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04423415785034498,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29514359682798386,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24832860004923082,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22602810446793833,"solar_1":-0.13595070336798898,"solar_2":-0.2903753174375123,"solar_3":-0.3104597528193456,"solar_4":-0.14713806903758572,"solar_5":-0.01709134738788028,"solar_6":-0.010214848395359391,"solar_7":-0.007594857085981251,"solar_8":-0.048228477411309235,"solar_9":-0.09563578000127393,"solar_10":-0.31760563320952073},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Living in a smaller home with high thermal mass and eating from local multicultural farms (or your garden) will do more than solar panels and EVs to make you greener, and won’t destroy habitat or encourage slavery elsewhere on the globe. In fact, EVs are less efficient than the polluters they replace. Using thousands of pounds of car to move a hundred (or few hundred) pounds of human flesh and goods is extremely inefficient. Making that vehicle thousands of pounds heavier is less efficient and damages roads and surfaces faster, meaning more highly polluting concrete and road work. If you really want to go green, get durable shoes and a bicycle. Otherwise, bragging about your high tech consumer goods is virtue signaling without embodying the virtues.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1861037106012788,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1245693527162075,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15808619065937302,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17338903636438951,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31886217880678486,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.011138149886392057,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.004686073341872543,"solar_1":-0.15463744406808513,"solar_2":-0.14591177986398693,"solar_3":-0.06649444132999507,"solar_4":-0.05118905391350381,"solar_5":-0.06008667211790453,"solar_6":-0.12651233857225938,"solar_7":-0.016402684943993034,"solar_8":-0.04955324523204278,"solar_9":-0.02258951356616734,"solar_10":-0.265122062772673,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.0510583835033079},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

But from my modelling, that would save me about $1500/yr so would only just break even over about 7-10 years before taking into account the ~6% interest is loose on the 12-15k is have to take from my home loan offset account to pay for it upfront.

If you want to be generous (and why would you be generous if it will cost you money?) and you want to say 20 years then fine, you do you. \n\nWhat is the cost to remove the array? How many years of electrical savings is that? What is the warranty on the inverter? Most inverter warranties are 10 years so if the inverter goes down there is that cost. If it is my own solar array I would know how it was doing, what its history was etc. If I am buying a house with an older solar array I am probably not trusting it as much as if I purchased it and was familiar with it. One service call can eat a whole year of savings (depending on utility costs etc). \n\n\nIf I am looking at a house with solar and it is a buyers market I am not valuing it at all no matter the age. I am telling my realtor I don't care about it at all and just pricing the house itself. That is just good negotiating. If it is a sellers market and I have. solar array on my house I will try to get as much extra for it as possible.

I wouldn't want to tell someone, \"you can't be a true feminist if you don't practice veganism,\" or \"you can't be a true vegan if you don't practice feminism.\" If you are only one, so be it. \n\nMany of the \"original\" feminists ate and used animal products such as leather, meat, and dairy. I wouldn't want to suggest that they are somehow lesser feminists, or that they overlooked an issue critical to their identity as feminists. They were brilliant and true *feminists*, but they were not *vegans*. \n\nI don't think feminism *mandates* veganism. Feminism, according to wikipedia, is about equal political, social, and economic rights between women and men. Feminism does not mandate a particular viewpoint on animals. \n\nI do think feminism and veganism are highly *compatible*, in that both express concern for beings traditionally seen as less deserving of certain protections. However, I definitely think a true feminist can be a non-vegan, and a true vegan can be a non-feminist. \n\nI also think there are too many sensitive and contentious issues involved. If someone is vegan, does that mean they *have* to be pro-choice, because that's the typical feminist view? Or if someone is vegan, does that mean they *have* to be pro-life, because of the protection for lesser beings? If someone is pro-life, then does that mean they can't be a vegan, because they clearly aren't a feminist? \n\nIt's also possible to simply take these arguments way too far. Is a feminist wearing leather shoes, not a feminist? Is a feminist who sets ant traps, not a feminist? Is a feminist who lives in a house, which probably displaced all manner of animals, not a feminist? \n\nI think it's fine to try to convert a feminist to veganism, as long as you don't make them feel like they're less worthy as feminists because they aren't vegan. We shouldn't disqualify worthy people from being recognized and given the honor of being feminists or vegans, simply because they aren't both.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0016816583617279928,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11621263469332917,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17030840842748263,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11967939045280218,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2833429219608661,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.04644386345546536,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.041416547377593815,"diet_1":-0.02472525805690869,"diet_2":-0.005567081780706455,"diet_3":-0.018851064017023116,"diet_4":-0.00302334716070618,"diet_5":-0.0086489921395696,"diet_6":-0.005219037917413516,"diet_8":-0.0017165077042591292,"diet_9":-0.0012676268355183613,"diet_10":-0.024183563700110728,"diet_11":-0.0021449589670131295,"diet_13":-0.014983444916045604,"diet_14":-0.019742860818951158,"diet_17":-0.013577829908778464},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

There are two disadvantages to a vegan diet: social pressure from others to eat animals or them randomly arguing with you and convenience. \n\nIt improves overall health though, so if you’re into fitness, it’s also important to remember that a diet lower in cholesterol and saturated fat is great for heart health (rather than just building muscle).
