Pretty crazy to penalize EV owners to the tune of $200, regardless of actual miles driven and vehicle weight - the two most important factors in actual road wear.\n\nTo answer your question, I would suggest you buy/lease now, while the $5K incentive is still active.

Norway's population is 5.3 million.  CA is 40 million.    Norway is also a fairly wealthy nation per capita across most of its population.\n\nSecond, keep in mind that current EV production is supply constrained, so there's limited quantities to go around across the planet.  Norway gives much greater subsidization for the purchase of BEVs than California does, and gasoline prices in Europe are even higher than California.  The key metric you need to look at is the difference in price between electricity and gasoline/diesel.  Norway's difference is higher, making it cheaper to run on electricity.\n\nThird, as a result of that subsidization and energy price difference, it creates higher demand for EVs in Norway, allowing OEMs to price their vehicles higher there, making it more lucrative for them to send that nation more supply.  A larger proportion of the world's limited EV supply (vs population) is being shipped and sold in Norway.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAs to how high the tax should be... it should be high enough to dissuade people from buying ICEs and to generate enough demand to outpace supply.  Something that only studies can determine, may need to be adjusted early on, and may have regional impacts.  Further, there should be a well defined schedule of annual tax increases, so that customer understand that the tax burden will only get worse over time, so the longer they hold out, the more it'll cost them.  \n\nThere's of course the question of the regressive nature of the tax, but there are solutions for that through the use of lower tax rates on lower income earners (less money taken out of their paychecks) or through the use of rebate checks being issued multiple times per year for lower income earners.  \n\n\nAs we know, EVs aren't the best solution to reducing emissions.  Getting people to drive fewer miles and buy fewer cars is by far the best solution.  An EV may generate 40%-50% of the emissions of a gas car over its full lifecycle.  An e-bike may generate 5-10%.  A regular bike may generate 1%.  Public transit will also significantly reduce emissions more than an EV, especially if it's electrified.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0011782717483583838,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08843849183733568,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26629772625339404,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20655310630146373,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.320069436250634,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23504719955880482,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.30025399654793244,"ev_1":-0.11550444408767327,"ev_2":-0.24653971143076583,"ev_3":-0.08311640987674764,"ev_4":-0.1452171104926189,"ev_5":-0.003526170208109155,"ev_6":-0.0563370732331047},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

So a lot of small gas stations were replaced by huge ones.\n\nThis seems pretty inconvenient if everyone is going to a couple of stations. Road trips are even worse, literally everyone is going to have to fill up at the same Loves or Buckees regardless of whether or not they are out of gas because there isn't more gas for 200+ miles? I never said that they will be left stranded, I am saying that the current situation for EVs (where chargers are not well distributed enough as would be convenient road trips such that you have to think ahead rather than stopping when you really need to) will be flipped on it's head, AND you can't charge an ICE at home, so it becomes very inconvenient to have to drive 5-10 miles every time you want to fill up your tank (assuming you live in a city, could be much further if you live rurally). \n\nThis will further exacerbate the decline of ICEVs and isn't really talked about much.\n\n>If demand for gas goes down maybe stations will only rehab a % of their tanks rather than all of them.\n\nYou are acting like gas stations are all owned by conglomerates, they aren't, 60% are small businesses that own only 1 store. Supply and Demand don't always equal out in the real world (especially geographically), this isn't an economics class and it isn't a perfect market, and it is going to be worse for the people who most often drive gas cars (rural truck drivers). Just look at EVs now, simple supply and demand would say we need a lot more charging infrastructure, but it is taking a lot longer than it should to get built because only Tesla has gotten their head out of their ass to actually realize how many DCFCs are needed and where to put them (on busy highways, not just in the middle of cities), companies and individuals often don't make moves that would appear to be economically optimal for the overall society.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0009352958877570927,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06489612445511739,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20204243311377762,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26331062616939055,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.188951224254296,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14882790552290787,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2047854705597274,"ev_1":-0.1277710071290605,"ev_2":-0.10098716531259318,"ev_3":-0.09059900108412876,"ev_4":-0.08198703665742274,"ev_5":-0.015107390373790016,"ev_6":-0.10159934214830296},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

You could probably do even better. \n\nStorage adds significant expense, so by needing less storage your system will cost less. You can \"store\" energy in ways other than batteries, too. Instead of running a well/water pump whenever you turn on a faucet you could pump a lot of water during the day whenever you have sun into an elevated tank. \n\nI think downsizing the dwelling to make solar more affordable is a good idea. Some of the most efficient heat pumps available are also the smallest, they're generally good for under 1000 sq ft. COPs of up to 6 are available, so you get 6 units of heat out for 1 unit of electricity to run it. You can also get heat pump water heaters.\n\nLED lights are cheap and easily available now. Get a laptop instead of a desktop PC, they use very little power. \n\nIf you can eliminate the need for AC power at all you can save a ton of money. Inverters cost are much as the panels themselves. Solar panels output DC. Filter that into a consistent voltage with a MPPT controller and store it in a battery.

You'll note how the cost of intermittency increases the more solar power is added (or wind, for that matter).\n\n&gt;You can look at Germany, which has high solar energy, and low decreasing nuclear energy.\n\nYes.  Their residential electricity prices are the second or third highest in Europe and they are building coal plants like mad.\n\n&gt;Again, factoring out the cost of taxes, Germany's price for electricity isn't that much higher than America's.\n\nHa!  Germany's residential electricity prices ($0.36/kWh) are **triple** the U.S. average ($0.12/kWh).  That's particularly notable since Germany can offload their surplus to neighboring countries and has to buy baseload power from those same neighbors.  All the while, their lignite consumption remains unchanged.\n\n&gt;Nuclear power in America is highly subsidized.\n\nYes, it is.  Of course an anti-nuclear group like the Union of Concerned Scientists hasn't bothered to tell the whole story.  Subsidies per kWh produced are very small for nuclear [compared to solar and wind](http://environmentblog.ncpa.org/which-energy-source-receives-the-largest-subsidy/):\n\nNuclear: $0.0031\n\nGeothermal: $0.0125\n\nSolar: $0.9680\n      \nWind: $0.0525\n\nWhat's more, most of the subsidy was for the purpose of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons.  Next generation reactors don't produce much plutonium at all, so no such subsidy is likely.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure I fully buy that:\n\nThat's fine.  This subreddit is a great place to disagree about such things.  I'm happy to delve into the methodologies of both claims, if you like.\n\n\n&gt;Well that's why the statement has a qualifier: we have 200 years of uranium left assuming the same usage and price.\n\nWith that qualifier, your original point is moot.  Further down your comment, you accuse me of assuming renewables won't get better, but here you are doing the same thing regarding fission.  Old Gen II reactors that have been online for 30-40 years are dinosaurs compared to what is being built now, and the research into Gen IV, especially from China and India, is tremendous.  I'll explain in a minute why I actually didn't assume no progress in renewables, though.\n\n&gt;Given that you're not convinced that renewables are the way to go...\n\nTo be clear, I think renewables have a place.  Solar makes a lot of sense in areas with lots of sun and a clear relationship between peaking demand and peak sunlight.  Wind makes a lot of sense in areas that have the right wind profile.  Neither (or both together) are anywhere near sufficient to replace fossil fuel production.\n\n\n&gt;then uranium is literally the only other viable choice. \n\nNo.  Thorium is thrice as abundant as uranium is and is just as fertile as U-238.\n\n&gt;Demand for uranium will only increase under your model; \n\nThen you don't understand my model.  My model includes breeders replacing current technology over the coming decades.  Of the uranium mined for nuclear reactors in the past, only about 1% of it (mostly U-235) has been consumed.  That means there is 99 times as much fertile U-238 sitting around, waiting to be used as a fuel.  That's just what's sitting there, without mining any more. \n\n&gt;...the price of uranium will sky rocket.\n\nNot in the context of what I just described.  Even if breeders take longer to replace conventional reactors than I anticipate, the amount of feasibly extractable uranium from seawater is far greater than the amount on land.\n\n&gt;I don't see how breeder reactors solve the problem. \n\nThey run on existing nuclear waste.  As I said above, there is about 99 times as much fuel already mined and waiting to be used as we have consumed in all our civilian and military uses since the 1940s.\n\n&gt;The waste from breeder reactors is more radio-active than the waste from reactors that use uranium; sure, the volume of the waste is decreased by a factor of 50, but it has the same radioactivity.\n\nYou already pointed out the main advantage: the amount of resultant waste is tiny compared to existing waste streams.  Two other things you should know as well:\n\n- Much of the \"waste\" is actually useful in radio-medicine and for things like nuclear batteries for deep space probes.\n\n- Because it is a \"hotter\" waste, it decays to the point of harmlessness within a couple of hundred years, as opposed to the 10,000 years or more of current nuclear waste.\n\n&gt;but it's suspicious to claim a technology like fusion will be ready to carry us into the future, based on the assumption that it will improve and become viable, but then ignore all of the existing research pointing towards making renewables viable;\n\nYou'll note, though, that I never assumed progress in renewables will stop.  In fact, I assumed the exact opposite: that the technology will develop to the point where it is near-free.  My point was that even under such a scenario of rapidly developing renewable technology, the problems of solar and wind being diffuse and intermittent don't go away.  We will get no more sun per square meter than we do today, and the winds won't blow more consistently.\n\n&gt;For example, most evaluations of cost for renewables in terms of intermittency stem from the use of salts as a storage mechanism.\n\nNo, only solar thermal.  Molten salt isn't a viable means of storing electrons.\n\nBut you are correct to start talking about storage.  The only way to make intermittent sources of energy viable for regular consumption is to store them.  Some of the methodologies, both proposed and already in practice, are:\n\n- molten salt (only for solar thermal)\n\n- compressed air\n\n- pumped hydro\n\n- flywheels\n\n- hydrogen\n\n- batteries\n\nOf those, only two have been deployed for uses outside the lab: \n\n- molten salt on solar thermal installations\n\n- pumped hydro for high demand industrial uses that can't afford any outage\n\nSolar thermal is more costly than solar PV, so the former hasn't seen that much use.  Pumped hydro works great, is simple, and has a good track record.  The problem there is that it's quite expensive (although cheaper than the alternatives) and requires siting near mountains.  (There are two reservoirs, one high and one low, the provide the potential energy required for storage.)\n\nOf the remaining options, compressed air is inefficient because air heats while compressed, then that heat is lost through the walls of whatever contains the compressed walls.  Flywheels are very expensive because they rely on magnetic levitation and near-vacuum conditions.  Electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen is very inefficient, and hydrogen is notoriously leaky, even through the walls of stainless steel containers.  Despite all the hubbub around Tesla's new battery factory, those batteries are still made for mobile applications.

However, I do think veganism is morally superior. I think it's all about taking steps to built a utopian world, and eating no meat or other animal products is much better than eating an omnivorous diet. I also think many vegans are naturally more environmentally conscious than the average ignorant meat eater. They also tend to oppose violence of all kinds, being wasteful, etc, in my experience.\nPersonally, I do not take issue with impoverished people not eating vegan.. There is nothing wrong with that. For me, it's about encouraging those who are capable, and of course, not forgetting about the issue of poverty and it's serious implications. \nI know that the world seems like a terrible place. I mean, it kind of is. We've destroyed eco systems, thrown of the balance of nature, ruined our planet, tortured humans and animals alike.. The list goes on. As a vegan, I do not only care about ending animal suffering and slaughter, I try to consume as little as possible, I recycle, I'm looking into composting in my apartment. I carpool, walk, take the bus as much as I can. I don't waste food. I shower infrequently and use very little soap. If I ever have the money, I will have a house with solar panels. I still have so much more to do, but I still know that as a vegan, I'm doing a hell of a lot more than other people.. for animals, humans, and the planet, that's a fact.\nLastly, I just wanted to point out that while there are so many horrible aspects of our world and there is probably little to no hope left, I believe in a world with a sustainable population, no animal cruelty, no waste, no violence, no poverty.

I know it has come with a huge price tag, but personally, I'm not having children, I'm eating vegan, I'm limiting my wasteful consumption, being as green as I can, being kind, volunteering, writing, painting, studying, and I will never stop striving to be better.

The utility programs come at a premium, so they seem to sell hard on the idea of \"green but at a lower, predictable cost.\"\n\nTypical of the solar industry, I've seen numbers from 25% to as high as 40% from analyses of homes suitable for distributed solar.

I will assume 1kWh, you will see how important that number really is. \n\nTake that number and double it, that is your capacity factor for day without sunlight. If you calculated 1kWh, then you are looking at 2kWh worth of pure battery storage, excluding losses. \n\nIf you assume 75% conversion efficiency of a simple true AC inverter, then 2kW/0.75 = 2.6kWh of battery to supply your load and lossy inverter. (you can cut down losses to only 10% with square wave inverter, but electronics tend not to last with the harsh AC square wave form)\n\nIf you buy Lead Acid batteries, you do not want them to discharge more then 50%, so 2.6kWh is now 2.6*2, 5.2kWh of battery. This is not including losses in the wires and such which will have impact on the next line. \n\nIf you do a 12V system, you are looking at 433Ah worth of storage. If you do a 24V system then 216Ah.\n\nTo charge the battery, you will need to put extra 30% charge because of charging/chemestry losses, so 5.2kWh/.7 = 7.4kWh worth of solar. \n\nTo charge the battery in 1hr, you would need about 7.5kW system. Perhaps you charge it in 5 hrs and you are looking at about 1.5kW worth of PV panels.    \n\nMy assumptions are old because I have not done this in a while, so I am sure somone will pipe in to correct them. The calculation logic and building in reserve is correct. The biggest mistake you can make is to have too small battery reserve. It is nearly impossible to match a new battery with an old one.

If you have cash, pay in cash. This is almost always the best returns for a system.\n\n2. If you can take out a loan or home equity etc...do this at the lowest rate possible and this is your second best return.\n\n3. If you can not do any of those (bad credit, borrowing too much already, can not use tax credits) begin to look down the path of leasing/PPA.\n\nI go through this **every day** with customers over and over hearing different things and wondering what is best, and here is the easiest way I can explain it (I think):\n\n1. If you have a good site and live in a good pro-solar area (easy to interconnect, net metering, etc..) you are likely a good candidate for solar.\n\n2. If you are a good candidate for solar you NEED to go out and get **at least** three different quotes from **different installers** in your area. If you have not done this, you are just asking to screw yourself and be pissed later.\n\n3. After doing this THEN look at your options. Not just a cursory look, but an in-depth analysis. What  are you monthly payments for each scenario? What is your leftover bill for each scenario? What is guarunteed? What is not? What equiptment etc...Make as many comparisons as you can to get an idea of what is going on. Some quotes will focus on Day 1 savings...some will focus on long term savings.\n\nPeople always forget that the model works because solar works. The way that you finance it is just a way to get the equiptment in your hands. If you lease, purchase or do a PPA, SOMEONE IS PAYING FOR THAT SYSTEM.\n\nDo you think a company, like solar city, just goes around doing systems for the hell of it? No, they do it to make money. And they make a lot of money of leases.\n\nNow, some people hear leases and think \"wow that is free solar! I Want the free solar!\" just pause and think for a minute. Is there anything free in this world? No.\n\nSo, a PPA or lease is just the company owning things and trying to finance on the \"back end\". So, the reason that purchasing is great in a lot of cases is because there are people in the world that are better at finacning than places like solar city.\n\nIt makes a hell of a lot more sense, in most cases, to just buy the equiptment and finance it. That way the person installing is good at installing and the place you finance can get you a good deal on finance. \n\nVery similar to going car shopping. If someone said to you, \"The ONLY WAY to drive is to lease a car! People that buy are crazy!\"\n\nNo, people that buy are looking for long term investment and people that lease are looking at short term etc..\n\n**The point is: You need way more information than this to make a decision. You need multiple quotes of each option type (lease,purchase,finance) and you need to sit down and study through and ask questions about how each one is different and THEN make your decision**\n\nEdit: Things to consider for your particular situation..\n\n1. Moving in 5-6 years\n&gt; This is a pretty straighforward one all together. If someone is about to sell in a year or two, I tell them to hold off because installing and selling that quickly is just more work than potentially worth. Since you are planning on moving longer, it is not so bad. A lease, while technically easy to transfer in theory, is awful in practice. Imagine coming to buy a home and the seller says \"oh yeah by the way we signed up for this 20 year deal so you will have to take over the next 15 years of that contract\" That will not go well. You will very very likely have to reduce your home value by the lease amount or buy out your lease for the cash option. If you purchase, you can sell it as a \"my home comes with free electricity\" and it actually increases the home value. There are two big studies that back this up as well. (Chicago institute and berkley) \n2. Maintenance and leasing\n&gt; This is one of the biggest ones I see pop up and is usually because someone selling leasing said \"You do not want to purchase because if something goes wrong,  you are on the hook! We take care of everything\". First of all, maintainence is nearly non-existent. You literally just monitor your system and if it is not performing up to standard you can work to diagose an issue. While I think pretending like maintenence or work is never needed is a bit extreme, pretending like you will be screwed if you purchase is a joke. As an example, all of the equiptment we use has 25 year warranties and we do repairs and maintainence **for free** all the time for customers who installed in the past.\n3. Getting showed up with \"better technology\"\n&gt;This is a less common question but still pops up a lot. The biggest thing here is: You need to make your decision based on now. So, calculate out what it would cost, what your savings be etc... Does that make sense? Is it a good number? Okay now buy. Imagine a week down the road, solar cost cuts in half and systems are wayyy cheaper. Did you get screwed? Well, on one level yes because  you could have gotten it cheaper if you waited. But, on the other, were you making the best decision you could in the current moment? As in, were you getting savings? Because if so, you still made a good decision. You can not be **frozen** all the time in ANY market. Imagine cell phones. Why would anyone buy a cell phone if literally every year a new one comes out? In other words, yes that can always happen. But if you made a decision that saved you money versus the utility, you still made a good decision, even if it gets better with time and technology.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.22317002713551423,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21988945091585693,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3888760404349137,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.15463871633959814,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10631834575175958,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2417499942646496,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.30210106503606465,"solar_1":-0.21471375560470793,"solar_2":-0.21207355270103456,"solar_3":-0.2754399968665287,"solar_4":-0.09382909288928101,"solar_5":-0.2319972668386375,"solar_6":-0.13979420957861002,"solar_7":-0.06684019103526932,"solar_8":-0.07711683302039526,"solar_9":-0.033439527337151276,"solar_10":-0.2843175014158125},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Like someone else touched on, it is a safety requirement that inverters do not ‘island’ or continue to operate in the absence of an electrical grid. This is to prevent the possibility of backfeeding electrical equipment that is being serviced, thus running the risk of electrocuting someone.

It's much larger than an ordinary car battery, close to the size of the entire car, and it's permanently installed inside it. There's no practical way to carry a spare with you, nor any way to change out the battery (without a major expensive auto shop job). There has been some talk of designing vehicles supporting battery swapping, but these are in very early stages of development, see e.g. [this article](https://electrek.co/2017/09/15/tesla-new-battery-swap-technology-to-deploy-trailer/). And solar panels are too heavy, their power yield does not justify lugging them around.\n\nAs others have said, you normally depend on level 3 chargers (fast chargers) when doing long trips. If you're in a location where there are no fast chargers, you can either wait until later to charge (if you have enough battery), or get by with a slower charging solution, like a level 2 charger (J-1772 charger, or a 240 V outlet) or a level 1 charger (regular 120 V wall outlet). As a rule of thumb, a fast charger will charge a battery in 30-60 min, a level 2 charger in about 6-8 hours (suitable for overnight), and a level 1 charger in about 24-36 hours (last resort). All three types are marked on [Plugshare](https://www.plugshare.com/). If you're ever in really desperate straits, you can probably just park at an L2 charger (which are common) and walk/taxi to a nearby hotel to stay the night.\n\nKeep in mind that typically, you will not charge your car to 100% and drive it till it reaches 0% - you typically charge to somewhere between 80% and 90%, and drive until somewhere between 10% and 20% (because charging slows down as it approaches 100%, and also to avoid long-term degradation of the battery). For this reason, your charging stations need to be about 25% closer than the EPA range of your vehicle would suggest. Additionally, EPA range reflects fairly conservative driving (around 65 mph / 105 kph), and if you drive faster you will need to plan to charge more often (conversely, if you drive slower, you will be able to go farther - EVs are highly efficient at low speeds like 25-45 mph). Finally, be aware that if you're not charging the car for an extended period, vampire drain will discharge it at about 1% of battery per day.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002736808499318973,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07687600654292055,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.47486282760898274,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.03694634325802326,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2939801269997933,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20351323457330553,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2912596544871728,"solar_1":-0.0056004454697055435,"solar_2":-0.015136512402629402,"solar_3":-0.021123555163891677,"solar_4":-0.0035162731522480803,"solar_5":-0.001363418825349072,"solar_6":-0.0015324062236080256,"solar_7":-0.003914133109598576,"solar_8":-0.0014298221825204867,"solar_9":-0.017617786568735028,"solar_10":-0.05401383141967623},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

Adding to the system will involve further permitting and inspections, but depending on how long between when the system is installed, and when they plan on moving in, it might be worth it.\n\nSubsidies are changing on Jan 1st, 2020.  Right now, the ITC credit is 30% of the value of the system.  Next year, it'll be 26%.  Still pretty nice, but a bit of a difference.  For a $20,000 system, its the difference between $6,000 and $5,200.  My firm is just going to lower prices to make sure customers don't feel the pinch.\n\nAnother piece of the puzzle is home value.  When you add the panels to your home, your property values go up.    Instead of paying the electric company every month for electricity, you now have your own power company.  When I got the panels installed on my house, I refinanced a few months later, and the appraiser gave me an additional $20,000 on a system that cost $22,000.  I was able to borrow at this increased value.  As an additional bump, in Texas, there are no property taxes on the increased value of your home due to solar power.  \n\n\nI'd say get them now.  You get a small increase from the ITC, and after the new year, you stop paying the electric company that monthly bill, and the value of the panels will be greater, due to the increased price overall.\n\nTo look up all the available laws and subsides for solar in your area, here is the  [https://www.dsireusa.org/](https://www.dsireusa.org/)  website.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19865860790014267,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2426297147046713,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21476660191200964,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3082673891903185,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2615688057539728,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.03186387939301009,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12213812650103743,"solar_1":-0.1925965818794919,"solar_2":-0.20918914629046548,"solar_3":-0.04661612207625391,"solar_4":-0.10753994584239568,"solar_5":-0.008217094096229024,"solar_6":-0.011146098237683569,"solar_7":-0.033200387776256925,"solar_8":-0.02991171577491483,"solar_9":-0.022450715325462056,"solar_10":-0.19937116436888877},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

The credit is 'captured' in the install year and its tax implication is not dependent on whether the tax code applies for new installations or not.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005865614220965654,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14499482558460058,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2435763948414428,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3495500087738037,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23857521238425483,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30378252144699047,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19333716706993678,"solar_1":-0.0604189242051992,"solar_2":-0.001810141858489563,"solar_3":-0.0017459493731924642,"solar_4":-0.07571140413589698,"solar_5":-0.0005485166038852185,"solar_6":-0.0005945799202891067,"solar_7":-0.0015278496187723551,"solar_8":-0.002873577041706691,"solar_9":-0.02272264678807308,"solar_10":-0.004697600350482389},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

It's borderline /r/redneckengineering\n\n4\\*4400/1300=13.54\n\nSo you're expecting a 4kw system to generate 17.6 kwh in a day, and at 1300w cooling you get 13.54 hours of cooling.\n\nYour spreadsheet shows 13.32 though. A rounding error from your conversion to joules and back to watts? I don't see why all the math is necessary though, the bottom line is you chill some water/brine with 17.6kw, then transfer that stored energy to a room at a particular rate (wattage).  Inefficiencies are yet to be applied though, you will lose some going from solar to an AC freezer, but I suspect it will be *very* inefficient trying to move the cooling into the room (radiator and fan?).\n\nBut it's a fun idea for off grid solar with AC at night. Since water has such a high heat capacity it can be a decent thermal 'battery'.  Of course the ideal solution would be a big rack of lithium batteries and an efficient heat-pump AC, but expensive.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3424263129647605,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21950241206832288,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3055807076607886,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22727121971547604,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29419396734403624,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2331961645997191,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2275711359337656,"solar_1":-0.27257418337130185,"solar_2":-0.2269191333067258,"solar_3":-0.326293202230954,"solar_4":-0.2908930481594306,"solar_5":-0.26921496175994736,"solar_6":-0.04138432104204402,"solar_7":-0.26992319027582806,"solar_8":-0.04014084163513742,"solar_9":-0.17956524278017902,"solar_10":-0.3553793177833647},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes, this text references a shared belief among off-grid solar communities about the feasibility and economic viability of certain solar projects based on available resources and individual circumstances.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Author is working on solar panels so we can assume she is somewhat biased against the competition. Furthermore, your claim that it is on par or worse than gas is ridiculous. Even in your source, highest estimate for nuclear is 200, and gas is 400+ g/kWh. Most sources put nuclear bellow 50. \n\nO, about reserves, you basically confirmed what I said. Per your source:\n\n&gt;**Using 0.005% ore, nuclear has higher carbon emissions than gas** \n\nand you are giving me that most of reserves are nearly 2 orders of magnitude better.\n\nFurthermore, in your source, it says \n\n&gt;Nuclear fuel preparation begins with the mining of uranium containing ores, followed by the crushing of the ore then extraction of the uranium from the powdered ore chemically. All three stages take a lot of energy, most of which comes from fossil fuels. \n\nI'm gonna go and say that this takes a lot of energy, which is becoming cleaner and cleaner, which lowers carbon footprint of nuclear. Interestingly, the more nuclear you have in the mix, the cleaner it probably gets.\n\nIf we look trough other sources, you know, using google, its even better than this. It seams that vast majority of sources would put nuclear as low carbon. And, going for the easiest of all sources, wiki (which in this instance properly puts its own source), nuclear is in worst case scenario at 110 (which might be true, but also probably isn't), and gas is in best case scenario at 410. That is huge difference and is not really comparable. And if we go for median values, it goes strait to low carbon.\n\nSo, I concede that nuclear is in most likelihood not as low as I thought, but is also not nearly as bad when it comes to carbon emissions as gas, and is still in all likelihood, LOW CARBON.\n\nAlso, I'm not much of a fan of nuclear, it has really big safety concerns, i.e. if you want to operate it safely, it will cost you a lot. But if we are talking about climate change, it is a lot better solution then gas and coal.\n\nAnd now, looking further, I wind [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_energy_sources#/media/File:Life-cycle_greenhouse_gas_emissions_from_Vattenfall_Nordic_Nuclear_Power_Plants.png) interesting. Its taken from this source:\n\n[https://portal.environdec.com/api/api/v1/EPDLibrary/Files/8371d0c5-faa0-47e9-aafd-61fdd1b0dc81/Data](https://portal.environdec.com/api/api/v1/EPDLibrary/Files/8371d0c5-faa0-47e9-aafd-61fdd1b0dc81/Data)\n\nIt seams that production of fuel (i.e. Uranium) was already calculated (first 4 bars), and it is not as nearly as bad as your source claims it to be, and it also has decommission calculated in. Puts it on really low side of things, right back at renewables. And its from real life nuclear plants.\n\nTo end this, I can find you easily sources that claims that EVs are worse than ICE for environment, just as you can find sources claiming nuclear carbon footprint is not low carbon. Neither are true.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.12214780516060841,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18314004388111746,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.294507250989816,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24111568271168315,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2965586928952363,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20226675916714734,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19536527122060457,"solar_1":-0.07996679178160869,"solar_2":-0.27332042144959295,"solar_3":-0.0286630809359028,"solar_4":-0.008525863311888315,"solar_5":-0.04036978570130416,"solar_6":-0.02851590292186262,"solar_7":-0.03852839988862389,"solar_8":-0.009555146480359464,"solar_9":-0.011478839569058152,"solar_10":-0.09053093050822646},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (injunctive norm: \"it is still in all likelihood, LOW CARBON\").","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (the author acknowledges the low carbon potential of nuclear but expresses concerns about its production process and safety, indicating a preference for solar despite recognizing its limitations)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear\n\n(The text mentions various sources and their conclusions about carbon emissions of nuclear and EVs, but it does not explicitly describe any specific behaviors or prevalence.)","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

The government is dishing out loan money like it's water. They fully funded Tesla's factory, \n\nIt was a bit of a mess a few years ago where lots of startups saw it as a cash grab, but those days are over.\n\nIt’s also not unusual to take a loan for constructing a factory. Besides, Tesla has already repaid their loan. Offering incentives to build factories is quite common, it’s not like Austin didn’t offer something to Tesla.\n\n\n&gt;\tNo one is claiming they'll be junk cars. In fact, I've been surprised at how little I've seen people mention the topic of Chinese quality.\n\nYou and I understand this, but there are plenty of people that assume this will be like the last time “the Chinese” tried to enter the market.\n\n\n&gt;\tYou think Polestar was the test? Maybe in the US. In Europe, it's Tesla, who's exporting BY FAR the most Chinese built EVs.\n\nFor branding? Yes, polestar was a test. Geely learned a lot with volvo and have been experimenting. The others will be using it as a case study. I would argue that Tesla is not seen as a Chinese brand in Europe.\n\n\n&gt;\tThis is a major manufacturing industry in the West that does a lot to support the middle class and high wages. China's auto wages are about a fifth of the West's, and their labor protections are crap. \n\nI mean, VW China has existed since 1985.\n\nI would hope that the Chinese brands establish local factories in Europe.\n\n\n&gt;\tChina has a high CO2 g/kWh of energy produced due to their overreliance on coal. \n\nAnd due to their recent power shortage they are accelerating their use of coal, which is super crappy.\n\nBut those are overall Chinese numbers, factories will have different numbers depending on where they are and what they do. Gigs Shanghai, for example, has solar panels on the roof. China is also the largest producer of wind power. They should do more, like all of us.\n\n\n&gt;\tNow we want to rationalize moving a huge chunk of one of the world's very largest manufacturing industries (and one of the highest users of energy) to China? Are you effing kidding me?\n\nI don’t think we’re rationalizing it. People buy VW despite the emissions scandal, why? Because it’s a good product and the management is different. I expect the same will be true for Chinese manufacturers. The people making BEVs are not the same people building coal power plants and if the product is good and the management isn’t bad, I expect most Europeans will judge them on the product.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.027173345248835783,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09749766516008548,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18245910437801413,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2508259365955989,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18144242968599672,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19019609359424255,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.14739155763527378,"solar_1":-0.10652401945858292,"solar_2":-0.10155738275394317,"solar_3":-0.07192471608626268,"solar_4":-0.06976321832371468,"solar_5":-0.058349691600597,"solar_6":-0.1602784392501538,"solar_7":-0.020626845205697464,"solar_8":-0.019639817336307413,"solar_9":-0.0326705421903597,"solar_10":-0.1080468492715833},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Crazy expensive.\n\nIf you're actually using 2 kW, it will run for an hour.. or 1.6 hours in the sun (3 hours with the extra batteries, 4.8 hours in the sun).  If you're using 800 W or less, it will run indefinitely while the sun is strong, and 2.5 hours once the sun goes down (7.5 hours with the extra batteries).  That can't hold up against a gas generator in price or endurance, but if your needs are more modest, it might be \"enough\".\n\nA much more feasible option is to plug your load into your EV, like the upcoming F-150 Lightning.  The battery size is as-yet undisclosed, but estimates are around 115 kWh usable capacity, and it has an outlet in the truck bed.  Fully charged, that will run a 2 kW load for over two days, or an 800 W load for almost a week.  Of course you have to leave enough charge to get back out to a charger, so actual usable capacity is going to be a lot less.\n\nAnd there's no good way to recharge an EV from solar.

When the power returns the UPS will automatically recharge the internal battery.\n\nNow if you have EXTENDED power outages.

This is quite a bit more than you use, so you might want to size down a bit, unless you anticipate increasing your usage (e.g. you are planning to have kids, buy an EV, etc). If it's between 13kW and 16kW, 13 certainly seems sufficient.\n\nKeep in mind that without 1:1 net metering, timing is everything. For example if you use the vast majority of your power at night, then a large solar system won't do you much good, and you'd be better off putting your money into higher battery storage. If most of your usage is during the day, then lots of battery storage is less important, but you still need some since everyone uses some amount of power at night.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001439041031214098,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10367439769590873,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2012013633175158,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.034238304321964584,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2882231019992446,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2611855222892925,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06407516682520509,"solar_1":-0.223899663445917,"solar_2":-0.13827729812538941,"solar_3":-0.07319903235475067,"solar_4":-0.09014435716624923,"solar_5":-0.1186832958462777,"solar_6":-0.0015298054010296862,"solar_7":-0.0029090614843880758,"solar_8":-0.009226787752898721,"solar_9":-0.23121839609539252,"solar_10":-0.22384083395202956},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

It is not just about the treatment of the animals! There are so many benefits you can gain from becoming vegan! I am studying to become a dietitian I can to this lifestyle for ethical reasons as well as health reasons. Reducing your consumption of dairy products and meat radically reduces cancer risks! In addition to this I think many of us can say that you will feel better physically and moraly. I am with you on having a tight budget! However I feel so healthy and happy that I was ok just eating what I could afford at first! Now I have become very savvy on knowing where to get affordable organic fruits and vegetables. You know what its alot cheaper than you think! Bananas and potatoes are not expensive and they can be delicious! I think you should put the difficulty of your situation aside and look at it this way, it WILL benefit your heath, it will change your outlook on food systems and treatment of animals, and you will find that it is possible on any budget you just need to have some integrity! Go for it. Having good health and saving the lives of animals is more important that having a diverse diet.

I WOULD eat the meat if I had too. Does that mean I'm not a vegan? Fucking no. \n\nThis is the answer. I agree with you. So why hesitate to answer?\n\nYou're not really listening to what the problem is. I don't assert the question disproves veganism. What I assume is that you can answer the question without disproving veganism. That's the entire point of my argument-- that no matter how you answer the question, it shouldn't somehow negatively impact your veganism overall, unless there is actually a problem with your reasons for being vegan.\n\nNow, I do think you presented something that doesn't logically hold up. But to get there, I have to address some problems. First, as I've said previously, the question (in the hands of someone trying to have a reasonable discussion) is about what is morally okay, not about whether you're strong enough to follow your morals. Just because I might keep the cash in a wallet I found doesn't mean I think it's right; it just means I'm weak.\n\nI have also already said that I would eat the cow, no problem. So for you to throw that at me is kind of silly at this point.\n\nBut what you said that doesn't make sense is that you think they're your equals, but that you are morally okay with killing them in this situation. I would certainly resort to cannibalism, but I would not resort to overpowering someone and killing them. Presumably, in situations like Donner's Pass, either consent was given-- eg \"we'll cast lots and whoever loses will consent to being killed and eaten\"-- or else the weakest died first, and was eaten after death. This is consistent with treatment of equals. Even if it didn't go down that way in real life, my moral view is that if it went that way, I find it morally acceptable; however, if one person overpowered another and killed him in order to exert his will, it was morally unacceptable. This is from the standpoint that each individual has the right to determine whether he gives up his own life or not, which I consider an important right under my system of ethics.\n\nBut your answer is confusing. Either you are ignoring the question and saying what equates to \"I might take the money out of the wallet and not give it back if it were like $2000, no one can resist that!\" which is not what I'm talking about-- presumably you would be ethically opposed to taking the money regardless of how strong you are. If you're simply saying \"I would abandon my ethical principles in this situation and eat the cow\" then as I already said, you're saying things that aren't useful to any discussion. (And it's understandable why you have such strong negative feelings towards the question-- if you can't answer it in a useful way, no wonder you don't like it.)\n\nBut if you're saying \"it's okay to eat the cow for survival\" then I accuse you of having inconsistent ethical views that need to be thought through better, if you also believe cows are your equals. If one of you has to die, and you are equals, how do you justify substituting your life for the cow's, without consent?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000710130829247646,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2222673051674083,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.29869826361642887,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2950771581904585,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3064166668520486,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21154005567792283,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.27526511455322256,"diet_1":-0.0279756443778183,"diet_2":-0.2522929970985879,"diet_3":-0.08179475659138309,"diet_4":-0.03198149284990563,"diet_5":-0.055091976211915354,"diet_6":-0.031579817304495224,"diet_8":-0.06333496581022899,"diet_9":-0.02981000122963451,"diet_10":-0.04345128020966058,"diet_11":-0.1005545722043621,"diet_13":-0.02115356382758667,"diet_14":-0.06847699466046339,"diet_17":-0.02599166403866434},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I'm pretty sure most people try to not believe or not think about the awfulness of the industry to distract themselves from the fact their ethics are weak and they won't sacrifice the weak (in the sense that they can get food that's just as good but it requires effort) pleasure their tastebuds provide them to do what's objectively better for everyone. I used to be like that, I think it's a normal human coping mechanism. It's annoying but the effective method of converting people to our \"belief\" is being nice and being an example. I've \"converted\" some people to veganism and made others reduce their animal products consumption by showing that you can't only survive on a plant based diet, but you can also thrive on it.

Having a bonding experience is part of treating them fairly. It’s a win win.
