"comment": "In my experience, you will only cover basic electrical (not much on commercial or utility scale requirements). You will learn almost nothing about best practices for roofing. You will only learn misinformation about insurance and financial planning (solar helps the roof, solar adds $20 to property value for every annual $1 saved), and you won't get into the tax codes that really make the industry tick, beyond the 30% tax credit.\n\nYou'll basically learn design, and alot of that design information will be wrong or not cost-effective. You'll get hands on experience with DC-side wiring, which is odd, because for a residential-focused jobsite, micro-inverters are a much better choice. You'll learn a bit about off-grid, but nothing about how to expand those skills into today's market. \n\nYou'll graduate, and then realize nobody is hiring non-qualified persons full-time, even if they have a certificate that does not even make them an electrician. You could try starting your own install business, but the master electrician or roofer who instead got into solar a year ago will clean your clock on the open market. \n\nThe school itself might not even make it. Some of the schools have had over half the attendees paid for by Uncle Sam, and that budget is shrinking.\n\nSo anyway, saving your money for a do it yourself project is a much, much, much better way of getting into the market.",

Most of the batteries are limited to less than 100 miles on a full charge, and take hours to recharge. Tesla Motors has done an awesome job making a long range battery powered electric vehicle, but it comes at a high price (about $80k), and it still comes with a very long recharge.\n\nSo on the other hand, fuel cell cars could come at a much lower price, with more range than most battery electrics, and without the high recharge time.\n\nI know there's more to it, and the natural gas thing is a big part, but is a fuel cell not a significantly better option than fossil fuel at this point in time?",

"comment": "That's part of why there's so much anticipation for the Model 3 - when paired with a more fleshed-out Supercharger network, it can be a full ICE replacement vehicle at competitive cost.\n\nLower capacity EVs like the Nissan LEAF work great in commuter applications, but even with quick charging aren't especially convenient for trips exceeding 2x vehicle range. That's why they're best suited for urban/suburban driving as part of a multi-vehicle garage; use the commuter EV for the 95% of trips where it makes sense to do so, and use a gas vehicle or high-capacity EV for longer trips.\n\nAs cell pricing drops further, high-capacity 200 mile EVs will be price-competitive with plug-in hybrids, which will move to 40-80 mile electric-only ranges. Inexpensive vehicles will probably remain gas-only or low-capacity EV-only.",

"comment": "&gt; With that logic, I could state that Star Trek is the best TV show ever, because if you've ever been to a Star Trek convention, you'd know that. I can't believe someone even bothered to post something like that.\n\nIf you don't believe the survey of the published literature, and if you don't find those suppsed hords of \"skeptical\" scientists at conferences, where else would they be hiding?\n\n&gt; How much of that \"science,\" was based on empirical data? \n\nAll of it of course. And yes it is falsifiable. You have a hypothesis, that of no anthropogenic contribution, and then you show that it cannot be upheld once you look at the data.\n\nYou would know that if you had bothered to read those studies. Did you read any of the them? Probably not, right? As a scientist, I'm really tired of people who keep dissing the science without ever having read a scientific paper. \n\n&gt; I haven't seen any empirical evidence AT ALL, which backs up the feedbacks\n\nHere's a few to start with:\n\n* Observed warming is significantly above that 1 degree\n* [Tropospheric water content is rising](http://blogs.voanews.com/science-world/2014/07/28/rising-levels-of-human-caused-water-vapor-in-troposphere-will-intensify-climate-change-projections/)\n* [Permafrost is melting](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22549-arctic-permafrost-is-melting-faster-than-predicted.html)\n\nThe only thing where you've got some reason for doubt is albedo, in particular when connected to clouds. We do have albedo measurements, but it is hard to separate different effects such as ice and clouds from each other, and there is still large uncertainty attached to over cloud feedback. However, [even there, measurements point towards a slight positive feedback](http://www.skepticalscience.com/clouds-negative-feedback.htm). Your claim that these things \"haven't been tested\" look rather silly in the face of the hundreds of published papers on the topic.\n\n&gt; Personally, I want to see money invested into LFTR's, tidal energy, and geothermal energy. Unlike solar and wind, these technologies would be consistent and reliable.\n\nSee, that's where people like you get very, very unbelievable. Tidal energy will always be an absolute fringe thing because there are only a tiny number of locations where it would be worth it, and then it will always be expensive due to the small numbers. And then of course there is the \"transmission\" issue that you were talking about: do you really htink that tidal at the coast would beat small decentralized wind and solar power? \n\nSame for geothermal: there is admittedly huge potential overall but the actual number of places where you exploit this potential fully is small. And then there's the little issue of geothermal drilling having the tendency to inducing earthquakes.\n\nEither way, I think those are all great ivestments, but it's silly to wait for those fringe tehcniques to happen one day if we *already* have cheap alternatives that work today.\n\n&gt; To me, an ideal, short term solution would be to invest in nuclear in the same way that we're investing in wind and solar.\n\nHow much do you actually think is invested in solar and wind? It's not that much! And nuclear is getting very healthy funding [worth many billions, in the form of regulatory oversight budget, tax credits, liability protection and so on and so on](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-T-Z/USA--Nuclear-Power-Policy/). Research funding is also very strong, the US has been pouring billions into the national ignition facility.\n\nIn fact, numbers show that since the DOE's inception in 1978, of the overall energy R&amp;D funding more than twice as much went into nuclear than all renewables combined: 38% vs. 17%. Even in the period 2005 to 2014 nuclear trumped renewables by $11B to just $7.8B. [You can check that here (PDF warning)](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS22858.pdf).",

They're leading because they have the highest energy density and very low cost per kWh.\n\n[Here's a chart comparing energy density of the batteries in different electric cars](http://i.imgur.com/htq8Fi1.png)\n\nTesla is head and shoulders above the competition. There's no one else even close.\n\nIf recent announcements are to be believed, they do not lead in the cost/kWh anymore. But they're definitely in the running (most good sources peg their pack level cost to be $200-$250/kwh), and with the Gigafactory going up they're going to be able to drop those costs even further.\n\nBy the way, this is not to say that Tesla will lead in the FUTURE. But I do think it's fair to say that they're leading in the electric car industry right now, with LG chem coming in a close second.",

According to [the solar calculator I used](http://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-information/start-here/offgrid-calculator) (just the first one randomly from a google search, no idea how reliable) It indicated 65 panels @ 200 watts each. \n \nSo your comment about batteries had me curious, I assumed all systems needed the battery bank to be able to use power when not collecting. So a battery bank and inverter, or Tesla Powerwall type thing that has them combined would be necessary. Is that correct? Sorry for all the newb questions. I'm excited about the potential here but I don't know all the ins and outs. Everyone's feedback is very appreciated.",

I am irritated every time I need to explicitly switch on, then switch into \"ready to drive mode\" on my Focus EV.   And a power button that glows blue constantly in your peripheral vision is a terrible idea.\n\nI admit that the instinct to reach for a physical volume control for the radio is strong.   So GM has put in a simplified audio control;  it looks like push to toggle on, and a dial for volume, and three buttons that might be Phone, Source and Mute.\n\nI disagree with the need for the climate controls to be done with a big temperature dial and physical function selectors;  these are infrequently changed settings and would be ideal for integration into the touchscreen.   So maybe that just represents a separation between a GM/Delphi subsystem and the LG subsystem.\n\nWhy not a column-mounted \"gearshift\" ?  A big illuminated lever takes up a ton of space and has no physical connection to the drivetrain, so there's no reason to have it there for D/N/R/P.   Even Nissan found a way to minimize its size.\n\nI noticed steering-wheel mounted buttons that look different from the Cadillac ELR's regen control paddles.   I wonder what they are for ?",

That is what the claim was. They are making it within the price range of the high end model S. Therefore it is a competitor. I don't understand the issue with my title when they are 100% trying to compete in the same price range.",

"comment": "600 ft. lbs is actually NOT massive for an electric motor, even for an economy car like a Leaf or Bolt.\n\nMath time!\n\nLets take a very average Nissan Leaf for example. The Leaf is limited to about 100mph top speed, where the electric motor is running at 10,000 RPM. That means that for ever MPH, the motor is turning at ~100 RPM. For example, at 15 MPH the motor is turning at 1500 RPM.\n\nNow the Nissan Leaf motor is rated at ~107 hp (80kW), and can put out its rated power at (or actually below, but it doesn't to prevent massive burnouts and broken driveshafts) 27MPH/2700 RPM. Converting HP at a given RPM to torque is straightforward, a calculator for both SI and freedom units can be found here: http://ncalculators.com/electrical/horsepower-to-torque-calculator.htm\n\nUsing the calculator, a motor producing 107HP @ 2700 RPM is running ~190 lbft of torque. If the Leaf's ECU let you run max power at, lets say, 1000 RPM (10 MPH), it would put out tire-shredding 560 lbft of torque, and at 5MPH it would put out a stump pulling 1100+ lbft of torque (which would rapidly break the rest of the drivetrain). Note there is a lower RPM limit where synchronous DC motors like the ones in a Leaf are not capable of producing maximum power, but that should be below 500RPM in all automotive examples.\n\n\nEdit: Updated based on real-world Leaf data.",

In 40 of the 50 US states, there are literally fewer than 10,000 total EVs on the road -- that's everything sold since the 2000s. The big auto companies think component prices will be right for EVs to go mainstream in 2-3 years... not today. That's why there's dozens and dozens of BEV models planned for 2-3 years out. And they're right about it being too soon; normal people can't afford $35-55K new cars. As you so insightfully point out, they will have the existing infrastructure and the capital to quickly roll out whatever dealer amenities they need once there are customers to use them.",

EVs, on the other hand, can get both great \"mileage\" (even better than Prius from a fuel cost perspective), and competitive (Bolt, i3, Model 3) or exemplary performance (Tesla Model S).\n\nI agree that low gas prices have hurt hybrid and EV sales, but EVs are both more efficient AND higher performance than many hybrids, which both makes them more desirable as a package, but also broadens the market that would consider them considerably vs a hybrid.",

Virtually 100% in an hour.\n\nSo, if we stopped to eat, it would be basically full. We didn't do too many HUGE days, so that worked great with minimal gas.\n\n&gt;True about it possibly working for OP...I'm hoping there are more EVs with an EV-only range of 80 or 100+ miles soon to help cover that middle ground.\n\nI'm sure as batteries get cheaper, PHEVs will get more and more range. With the REx Hold Mode enabled like originally designed, the i3 works great to maximize electric usage, even for people in areas with less-than-ideal charging infrastructure.\n\n&gt;We do road trips with the X too, although so far none as far as your longer trip. Typically 800 or 1000, and we've done them four or five times so far. I didn't count it in my list because it's more in the \"seldom\" category OP was describing.\n\nYeah, for many trips, a Model S/X is going to be even better. More range, faster charging, more infrastructure usually (though gas is still more ubiquitous in some areas). I'm not suggesting the i3 is better for trips than the Teslas, but it could work really well for people who still like the safety net of gas, not to mention you can get them for as little as ~$17k right now with low miles.",

Tesla, not so much. \n\nI think Tesla and Elon are great and I am a fan (though not a fan boy) but people sometimes lose sight of how relatively minuscule the EV market actually is currently. The traditional manufacturers will take time to switch over manufacturing to EVs. Some of them, like VAG, are in the process of doing so, and when they do, they will undoubtedly produce more EVs than Tesla because, that’s what they do and what they’ve been doing for many decades.\n\nAnd, wtf is car “soul”. Come on, did Elon really say that? Was he smoking again?  To claim that people don’t feel anything for other manufacturers cars is just preposterous when so many millions are sold. And as for EVs, are you telling me that all those i3, Leaf, e-golf owners don’t like their cars?",

Lack of benefit, the singular benefit is faster refueling, but that's not nearly as significant of an issue as it's made out to be.  Home charging of BEVs is incredibly convenient. \n\nNo,  I don't think it'll take off for light vehicles (in the US).  BEVs have taken that market.

Interesting choice.",

The Autocar article they cite refers to the upcoming revision of the original CLAR (launched in 2015).\n\nThe original CLAR, which was not developed as a shared platform, will get a major revision this year. Then we can talk of a shared platform:\n\n&gt; Furthermore, it looks like BMW has big plans with its current platforms for the years to come. According to Froehlich, the CLAR platform, on which all rear-wheel drive cars are built today, will get a serious upgrade in 2021.\n\n&gt;In 2021 we will update the CLAR architecture with a new central floor that can house higher density batteries. This will permit our plug-in hybrids to travel 80, 100 to 120 km in full-electric mode as well as allowing us to install a larger fuel tank than we have in our current plug-in hybrids,” he said.\n\n[Source](https://www.bmwblog.com/2020/01/06/bmw-clar-platform-to-get-important-update-in-2021/)\n\nThe iX3 has compromised trunk space compared to the X3. Precisely because it’s a converted ICE platform.",

"comment": "Lol. But the cost of a gas station is less than $30,000? I don’t think this is founded on information that’s justified by historical trends. This article also doesn’t acknowledge that if an EV owner has access to charge at home they will do so. I haven’t used a supercharger since August. They’re so focused on the charging being equivalent to that of the cost of gas but don’t acknowledge that the price of charging is a large motivator in the trend of EV adoption nor do they acknowledge the energy density that goes into an EV battery when compared to that of gasoline. You’re talking the equivalent energy of 2.5 gallons of gas in a 75 kWh EV battery. Which is why EV’s are rated at 100+ mpg on an MPG scale. \n\nTLDR; this is unsubstantiated.",

"comment": "Translation:\n\nVolkswagen will not be able to bring affordable modern small cars with purely electric drives to market until later than originally envisaged. To achieve this, the Wolfsburg-based company is pushing ahead with a new platform and, in particular, a new production process for e-car batteries in large series.\n\nSpiegel reports that the company hopes this will give it \"significant competitive advantages\" over rivals such as Tesla. A so-called dry coating is said to reduce energy consumption in the production of battery cells by 30 percent. The cost of electric cars is expected to drop by several hundred euros per vehicle as a result. Sebastian Wolf, board member of VW's battery subsidiary PowerCo, told the news magazine. He spoke of a \"gamechanger\" for the global battery industry.\n\nThe new method is viable, he said, as confirmed by internal tests. PowerCo will therefore continue to invest in the process and initially install a pilot line in a laboratory near Salzgitter. VW is currently building its first of several announced battery \"gigafactories\" in the Lower Saxony city.\n\nVW has been researching the new process with partners since 2020, and it should now be applied to millions of battery cells by early 2027, Spiegel reports. In contrast to the wet coating of battery electrodes commonly used to date, the energy-intensive drying process will no longer be necessary in the future. The project costs to date have amounted to around 40 million euros, and are likely to be \"considerably higher in the future.\"\n\nThe traction battery is the most expensive component of electric cars. This is due in particular to the number of individual, expensive batteries in it required for high ranges. These currently come mainly from the factories of Asian companies that dominate the market. Volkswagen also wants to cut costs by building its own plants in Europe and beyond. In doing so, the Group is relying on a standard cell that is to be used in as many of the Group's models as possible and thus bring economies of scale.\n\nIn addition to the Gigafactory in Salzgitter, which is scheduled to start in 2025, comparable plants are planned in Sagunto, Spain, and St. Thomas, Canada. In Europe alone, Volkswagen plans to build six such production facilities in order to make itself less dependent on suppliers in its electric car offensive.",

There was a large self-driving car bubble that included companies that made none of their own vehicles whatsoever. Tesla got a big bonus out of that because the argument was also that it was vertically integrated where they also produced the vehicle themselves and had a fleet out collecting data at a much more rapid pace which would supposedly mean that it could build better models with so much more data. This was a much larger bubble than EVs were as most actual EV output was and still is by Chinese automakers making actual EV products.",

"comment": "Nothing current offhand.  Most of the sources I know are 1) larger commercial / military applications and 2) the companies involved have gone bankrupt, largely driven by the much more rapid cost reductions in solar PV.  The basic designs I've seen are typically in the ~4 kW range, e.g., [Infinia](http://fixyt.com/watch?v=rzhzeA4VRSc) (one of the bankrupt companies).\n\nEven the recently Tonopah, NV, solar thermal plant represents at least a temporary end-of-the-line.  Google invested in the project, but has withdrawn given the greater economic efficiencies of solar PV over solar thermal.  Mind that the plant is a central tower / steam turbine design, not a Stirling-cycle design, but much the same principle holds.\n\nRegards Stirling:  it's more complex and has more moving parts.  You _might_ be able to come up with a design, if you wanted to do your own engineering work, based on a solar trough design which concentrated on a central pipe (the trough will handle the vertical alignment challenge, the pipe the horizontal tracking), and run your generator elsewhere.\n\nOne of the intrinsic advantages of solar thermal designs is that they _can_ (but need not necessarily) include an energy storage capability -- if you have a reservoir in which you can store heat, this may offer from hours to days of generating capacity even when the sun isn't shining.   Again for the small grid-connected residential application, this is likely not feasible, but for a larger, off-grid, or remote location, is a consideration.\n\nI'll also add:  I'm very partial to the Stirling engine from a conceptual and philosophical perspective:  it's an amazing invention which, with modifications in design, can make use of almost any thermal differential.  It's fully independent of heat source (so you could, say, run your Stirling engine on solar heat, stored heat, or fuel-fed heat sources whether biomass or fossil).  That said, I'm not sure it's a good large-scale solution (steam or gas turbines are also highly efficient).  Still, phenomenally interesting.",

"comment": "Yes indeed, I'm sure we both agree it's a great idea. I'm fully in favor of solar panel clad highrise buildings and actively advocating it on a regular basis. What I was attempting to explain is why this is a massive uphill battle. It's not about what is a good or bad idea in my opinion or yours for that matter. It's about who gets to make these decisions and the factors that go into their choices.  \n\nEDIT: Indeed, discussing this with my wife, an architectural professional here in Taiwan, we came to see that this is indeed a very, very significant topic. \n\nNow, first, it's worth pointing out that she, my wife, was aware of many examples where buildings are, in fact, already clad in solar panels. There are many examples in New York but certainly in Europe as well. It's not like nobody ever thought of it before. \n\nBut as for the mainstream of tall vertical structures, it's true that we're talking about a tiny, tiny minority even if you have hundreds of individual examples around the globe. That still does not make it common at all. \n\nWere it to become common, though  --there are very deep implication in that. It would, be a kind of evidence of progression into a socialist built-environment. It's key to remember that there never was a Capitalist Revolution. Capitalism was not brought into existence by the heroic efforts of guys with great beards and neither was socialism. Feudalism fell very slowly and capitalism took a long time to take it's place. There was no clear defining line where this was feudalism and this is capitalism. And indeed, many of the core features of feudalism never went anywhere. The notion of women as property, for instance, isn't capitalist, it's feudalist.Capitalism doesn't seem to address it very clearly but it doesn't originate there so why should it? It's just a leftover tradition from what went before. \n\nAnd so the same thing can happen in a transition to socialism. You don't see it at first. There is no red and yellow hammer and sickle flying over the white house. If you ask anyone involved they will all say they have no idea what you're talking about. And yet, solar panels on the sides of tall buildings are very much a kind of evidence of a different kind of future where scarcity is beginning to get the boot. \n\nMoreover, it's very much the analogy of a tree or a blade of grass. Right? A tall stem rising above the earth that captures the sun's energy. That's how grasses work right? Isn't it true that the global caloric food chain begins with the annual plants which track their energy from the sun? And isn't it true that aside from human culture there is no money used in those caloric transactions which are taking place all around us all the time and form the basis of life on this planet? Isn't that true? Isn't that sharing?",

"comment": "Walmart’s Walton Family Threatens America’s Renewable Energy Future\n\nBy Anastasia Pantsios, Oct 16th, 2014\n\n[Editor's note: I was contacted by Daphne David Moore, communications director of The Walton Family Foundation, denying that the foundation ever donated to ALEC. After I provided the source showing The Walton Family Foundation as a Chairman level sponsor of ALEC's 2011 annual meeting, Moore stated: \"The foundation was not a sponsor. A grant was considered, but not made.\" When asked if the foundation ever asked ALEC to retract the mistake, Moore said \"No.\"]\n\nAlthough Walmart has installed more solar power capacity than any other U.S. company, its owners, the Walton family, have invested millions in groups that are fighting to limit the development of solar power, according to a new report from the nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR).\n\nThe Waltons claim to have a deep commitment to sustainability, but their support for anti-solar initiatives tells a different story.\n\nThe report, How The Walton Family Is Threatening Our Clean Energy Future, resolves the contradiction by pointing to the multibillionaires’ main motivation: profit.\n\nAccording to the report, “The Walton family—majority owners of Walmart—are impeding America’s transition to a clean energy future. At a time when more than 500,000 households and businesses are generating their own solar electricity, and the U.S. solar industry is employing 143,000 people, the Waltons are funding nearly two dozen organizations working to roll back renewable energy policies, while a Walton-owned company is pushing for regulations aimed at hindering the growth of rooftop solar power.”\n\nAs solar energy generation has spread across the country, traditional fossil fuel-based utilities have been campaigning to weaken state policies that encourage the growth of clean energy, including solar. \n\nThey’ve especially taken aim at anything that would bolster the spread of rooftop solar installations, which threatens their profits. \n\nThey’ve been backed by anti-environment groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), Americans for Prosperity and American Enterprise Institute. \n\nThe Waltons have donated more than $4.5 million to more than 20 such groups, including all three of those. \n\nThe study also found that the bulk of Walmart’s and the Waltons’ contributions to individual politicians favor those who oppose legislation reducing energy pollution to address climate change.\n\nALEC’s list of sponsors for its 2011 annual meeting shows The Walton Family Foundation as a Chairman level sponsor, an estimated donation of $50,000, the sponsorship cost for that level in 2010.\n\nThe anti-renewables groups have had some successes in rolling back the energy future in Ohio and Arizona. \n\nArizona, for instance, gave the state’s largest utility, APS, the right to charge a fee to homes with rooftop solar. \n\nSince then, according to the ILSO study, rooftop solar installations are declining, and so is the number of jobs in the solar industry.\n\nWhat’s Walmart’s dog in this fight? \n\nLet the report explain:\n\n“A Walton-owned solar company, First Solar, was instrumental in helping APS win in Arizona, backing the utility even as the rest of the solar industry joined environmental and consumer groups in opposing the new fees. First Solar builds solar arrays for utilities and, as such, stands to benefit if households are blocked from generating their own electricity, even if it means slowing the overall growth of solar.”\n\nFirst Solar instigated a proceeding at the World Health Organization that could force several states to repeal solar incentives that encourage job creation there. \n\nFirst Solar does most of its manufacturing in Malaysia, minimizing its contribution to U.S. job creation.\n\nThe report tears the veil off the corporate sleight of hand known as “greenwashing,” where a company publicly touts its environmentally friendly initiatives while acting against environmental interests behind the scenes.\n\n“The Waltons claim to have a deep commitment to sustainability, but their support for anti-solar initiatives tells a different story,” said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher at ILSR and author of the new report. “The Waltons are investing in efforts that both undercut clean energy and prevent average Americans from benefitting economically from solar power.”\n\nIn addition to highlighting the extent of the Waltons’ campaign against rooftop and small solar installations to protect their own investment in utility-scale arrays, ISLR found that since Walmart began its environmental public relations campaign in 2005, its self-reported greenhouse gas emissions have grown 14 percent. \n\nThe company pledged to go 100 percent renewable but it’s going in the wrong direction. \n\nThe share of its energy generated by wind and solar has actually dropped and now stands at three percent.\n\n“Rooftop solar offers an enormous opportunity to accelerate the transition to renewable power, broaden the ownership of electricity generation and create tens of thousands of good jobs,” says the report. “We can’t let the Waltons snatch that future from us.”\n\nhttp://www.popularresistance.org/walmarts-walton-family-threatens-americas-renewable-energy-future/",

"comment": "Well as you can see you would have to design for lowest insulation day (usually winter solstice), upsize so that it can run PEAK load AND charge at the same time, and even then you need to plan for multiple cloudy days.    The 10kwh power wall is designed for backup, meaning occasional use NOT daily cycling.    The 7kwh powerwall that comes out latter is for daily cycling.   \n\nFor a $5k installation you are not going to take a typical home off grid.   That wouldn't even pay for a powerwall and inverter with installation, much less ANY solar.    A typical home that with AC is going to require a massive solar installation.   Most off grid systems do not have any AC, heat is other energy source, and still have quite a fuel bill for the generator.",

You only have 1 roof after all :P\n\nAs for loans, that seems like high rate. Not sure where you are, but everything seems a little pricey here. I'm in NY where [NYSERDA will guarantee low interest loans (3-4%)](http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Programs/Home-Performance-With-ENERGY-STAR/Low-Interest-Loans) and installations typically run in the ~$3/W range or lower and w/Canadian Solar panels (which are inexpensive but good - I think Solar City uses them almost exclusively now) you might be able to get a lower price.\n\nObviously I have no idea of your setup though and there could be any number of additional costs.",

Just connect up the wires of any wall wart with 12dc output - with an amp rating below your solar charge controller - into the terminals of your controller (parallel). Maybe add a diode on the positive lead of the wall wart just in case the particular wall wart you're using doesn't have this feature inside it. I did this with a solar stereo: had solar panels and a wall wart both screwed into the solar controller.",

On the first chapters there is one interesting part that covers this:\n\n\"Equipment operated when the solar panels are producing power is the most efficient use of solar energy. That’s because the power does not need to be stored in the batteries. The round-trip efficiency is reduced to 80%-95% when stored and used later.\"\n\nNote that the whole book is only about off-grid installations with batteries setups. Maybe someone with more experience wants to explain that.",

Are the batteries isolated from the electronics?\n\nOnce you wire in anything to the building it needs a permit.\n\nThe correct and efficient way to do what you are trying to do is to use a bimodal inverter and Not a transfer switch.    \nThis has the added capabilities of saving on your utility bill if you have net metering it can save more.   \nThe bimodal inverter will do the charging as well and can do it at a much better rate.   A battery monitor with temperature sensors and shunts would help the management as well.   \nFor batteries that don't cycle much you would be better off with VRLA AGM but not Gell, that have long shelf life.    Batteries designed to cycle more will lose more in a day and need constant topping off.",

I would also check to make sure your racking is flashed.\n\nI'd go with the cheapest $/W once I was assured of the above items.\nBut I can't really comment on whats best for you without the importance of aesthetics, your financial tolerance for risk vs. reward, longevity of the sunpower installer, your electric rate, your production rate, and your subsidy rate. \n\nMy general thoughts are that if you get a quick payback due to heavy subsidies, going with the best installer with the best warranty is best. If your payback is kicking on out past 10 years, then cheaper is better. But its okay to pay for aesthetics.",

"comment": "When installing Residential Solar panels, the overall footprint should be kept down to make the cell blend in with its surroundings as much as reasonably possible, and reduce the chances of theft of the cell itself. Commercial projects are built in areas that are accessible to the average person. This results in a smaller device that is built with a lower profile.\nCommercial [Solar Panels]( http://solarbay.com.au/) are usually installed in bulk. The main priority is the efficiency. As, commercial systems are typically used for flat surfacing, which can, in turn, reduce the project time by several weeks. \n[Commercial Solar]( http://solarbay.com.au/commercial-solar/) panels differ in one other major way.

Batteries and pretty much everything else in greenhouse.  Maybe subpanel in cabin or wherever else wanted.  Feed 120vac out of greenhouse, back to and through pole barn to 1. 120vac circuit from greenhouse to 4.  120vac circuit to and through cabin to 6. and 7.  Use voltage drop calculator to size wire.

Fewer and fewer companies do site visits before a sale, because we can get to 95% without it, and it costs money.  \n\nThen ask them to come  up with a proposal.  Then listen to them.  They'll tell you most the information you need to make a judgement.  Most proposals will be fairly apples to apples, but if you've got something like limited roof space, you might see a company use high-wattage panels to make the best use of space (i.e. greater watt density).  \n\n*Your key elements to keep an eye on:*   \n* Gross price  \n* rebates and local incentives.  \n* contract price.  \n* production in kWH (the unit of energy your utility sells yoru father)  \n* production to consumption ratio - i.e. how much of your bill your roof can eliminate.  anywhere from 30% to 100% is the range, and many many factors affect this.  \n* Payment method.  Cash is always king.  Financed deals where you take out a loan are okay, because you're 'owning' it, but you still take on a debt, but if your dad's finances are fairly stable and 'good', this won't be a major hit.  Stay away from Leases, imho.  Those are essentially 'rent-to-own' arrangements that will have you paying a final value somewhere 3x or 4x the cash price.  and you don't get to own it.    \n* Manufacturer warranties (should all be about the same, they're all pretty 'normalized').  \n* Installer Warranties - and how long have they been in business.  can they be around in 15 years.  are they fly-by-night solar, solid solar players, or do they have a solid foundation of roofing/electrical/construction experience to rely on while they just do solar when it comes along.  2, and 3, are alright, beware very new solar installers to some degree, though we were all new once.",

"comment": "Thanks, so to be SMART it must be interconnected with the grid.  The separate meter is an interesting option.  It says here: https://www.mass.gov/guides/net-metering-guide \"You may have a qualifying facility (QF) and a net metering facility on the same parcel of land but they must be wholly separate from each other. The QF and the net metering facility cannot share an interconnection point or a meter.\"\n\nSo... install a second meter and I would only get wholesale rates for any excess on that system.  Add in a battery to smooth it out.  Then move a bunch of loads (like the EV cars, stove, etc.) to that meter/system.  If I use more there in the winter I could apply the net metering credits from my SREC system to that one.\n\nBut that sounds crazy convoluted and a pain to even think about wiring.",

With SolarEdge the optimizers regulate each panel as if it was its own unit. \n\nThe backup power outlet SMA is a gimmick and people rarely use them. How often does your power actually go out? You don’t want to buy a system based on a device you may use 3 times in your whole life. If you need backup power in an outage, get a generator. \n\nLook into [this](https://krannich.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SolarEdge-Benefits.pdf) and make your decision based on how much power you want to produce. SMA has had a lot of arc fault issues and I’d never put one on my house. \n\nSource: worked for Sunpower and SolarEdge as a technician, 5 years in the Solar industry.",

No one involved wanted to agressivly attack this cancer at that time and instead tried to hollistically treat the problem.  Now the planet might just go the way of Steve Jobs.  I'm afraid that in the next 50-100 years we *are* fucked.  I have faith in technology and there *might* be a way to solve this problem but my EV and solar panels aren't gonna do it alone.",

"comment": "It's not scalable, so even if you're willing to pay more for the always on glow of nuclear, it MUCH harder to export and ramp up to the scale we need to rapidly roll it out. It's not just about building X amount of nuclear power plants, you'd spend a couple decades training the among of personal you need to ramp up the industry to output anything like those levels. Even if you mass produced all the parts with global standardization, you still need to assemble them on site with all kinds of land testing and risk assessment. It's nothing like mass producing solar panels in a factory and exporting them all over the world. A small solar array can be color coded for morons and exported all over the world. Nuclear can't do that. There is no Nuclear for Dummies.\n\nBasically we have to limit ourselves to ideas that can be rapidly rolled out and some easy characteristics to look for are, can it be mass produced in a factory, can it be built all over the world, are their export limitations. Solar panels, wind turbines and batteries fit the model of what can be rapidly rolled out.\n\nNuclear isn't the worst idea, but I would rather settle on renewable with some lithium storage and peaker gas plants until energy storage replaces them. Nuclear doesn't really have as much potential and long term value in it's current form, maybe fusion will change that someday, but it's not really going to be a commercial product in the next 20 years so it's mostly off the table. \n\nTo me nuclear is a dead end investment, but you could be in a situation where you have no better option I suppose.",

I know there’s a bit to do to make it safe, eg installing a DC - DC 12c step down regulator, fuses etc but it begs the question, why can’t you buy purpose built electrical heaters that are driven directly from solar panels?  Seems crazy that such a device is not available given the millions of solar panels that are now ‘unusable’, or ‘coming of age’, as they’re not on the Australian CEC approved solar times list..those that aren’t from Australia, this means that you can’t legally install them onto your roof.\n\nYep I’m from Australia.\n\nEdit: spelling, grammar",

Therefore, it behooves folks to get the panel upgraded when the solar is installed, so that they're prepared for battery storage when the cost makes sense (whether that's because of more rapid net metering phase out or shifting time of use, cost decline curve of battery storage, etc).",

More, they work better higher up - if you're driving in a major urban area, you'll be in shade most of the time.\n\nFinally, like everything else, solar panels are more effective at scale.  It makes more sense to have a few, huge banks of solar panels with a couple of full-time solar panel maintenance people than to have everyone own tiny solar power panels.\n\nWouldn't it be more logical to remove those puny solar panels from the car and put them on a roof somewhere with a huge bank of other solar panels, and simply recharge this car from the mains?",

"comment": "For us, purchasing was the best option. Option was to lease at $89 a month and the system would never be ours. To buy, it only added about $63 a month to our mortgage, so I went the purchase route. We also get the tax break, and purchase price of the system is exempt from the property taxes. All around, seemed like a better option to buy vs lease, especially because we plan on being in the home for a while. \nI didn’t like being forced to go with SunPower especially when the builder is pretty much up charging the solar system just like every other upgrade on the house. So you have an already expensive system with an additional builder markup. I feel like if we are forced to get solar, we should be able to shop around for our home that we intend to buy. I do see the other side of the coin though, if I was to go with another company and my house fell out of escrow, the builder would then need to go back to the company I chose and get the system installed or have SunPower finish the job. So I get why they go with one company and have a standard system and build for all the homes. \nOverall, I’m happy that I chose to purchase. I haven’t been able to use it yet as I am waiting for the PTO.",

"comment": "&gt; Oh I know batteries currently only pay for themselves with peaker plants. But the prices are dropping all the time. If you look here\n\nFor sure, but even at the rate they are dropping it still puts nuclear at a far cheaper pricepoint for baseload for decades to come.\n\nInstalling a few TWh of battery capacity would bankrupt any government.\n\n&gt;They are saying wind +zinc power storage will completely transform current generation norms.\n\nYup, and when those start getting mass produced at a competitive price then I'll believe it. Until then it's another battery technology that promised the world but never left the lab.\n\n&gt;There was a study done to show that you only need 12hrs of battery storage in the USA, with 100% renewables.\n\nYeah, most of these are hypothetical and run off of napkin mathematics based on national consumption &amp; generation.\n\nYou can't just move energy from LA to NYC during winter time. That's not how electricity works. And even if we're talking shorter distances building high voltage transmitters is fucking expensive too.\n\nAnd that's the problem. If you want to run at 100% renewable you need to have hydro power nearby or spend a fuck-ton of money going from 60-&gt;100%\n\nHence why myself, and practically any smart person that has studied this, says that using nuclear to generate 30-50% base load energy and then using renewables for the rest is the absolute best way to go about it.\n\n&gt;EV adoption is becoming mandatory almost everywhere. \n\nNot really. EVs accounted for less than 3% of all cars sold in 2019, and in 2020 it's still going to be under 4% - and that number includes hybrids.\n\n&gt;Re Tesla - This sort of thing will happen as it is advantageous to use your cars power during the evening expensive electricity rate and recharge during the cheap night electricity period. EG you automatically make money if you set it up correctly.\n\nYeah, you make money ... only if you ignore the wear &amp; tear that charging &amp; discharging your battery has on it.\n\nIf a new battery pack costs $20,000 then it's sure as shit not worth it.\n\n&gt;The million mile battery is around the corner, and even current Tesla batteries show very little degradation. It is actually on the Tesla forums if you look, lots of owners are very excited about leasing and or using their batteries to save money. Especially the urbanite who only travels 1000 miles a year. They will generally be dead before their Tesla battery wears out!\n\nYeah, and that 1 million miles is going to drop off a cliff once the grid starts charging and discharging your car every day. That's the same as driving your car and charging it again and again, every day.\n\nAlso, you're forgetting one thing: In this fantasy land of yours where we are at 100% renewable energy. Where does this excessive amount of electricity during the night come from?\n\nI'm assuming that we've built out a ton of solar, but that generates exactly 0 during night time. So now we're left with wind - but wind also generates the least amount of energy during night time.\n\nAnd you now have 300-400 million EVs in the US that have discharged in the evening that now all need charging - or at least a large portion of them.\n\nSee the thing about using non-dedicated batteries is that they are also used for other things. So when people wake up in the morning they expect there to be juice in the car.\n\nReality is that it simply won't work on a mass scale. It's a great idea, in theory, but it doesn't hold as soon as you start going a bit deeper into it.\n\nBill Gates has said the exact same thing: If we don't switch our coal &amp; gas over to nuclear &amp; renewables, then we are going to have a future of renewables + coal &amp; gas, at least up until 2075.\n\nThat effectively means we have surrendered to mass global warming.",

"comment": "&gt; 750 kwh per month in an all electric house is not especially high. Remember this is heating season now so if you lived in a \"typical\" house you'd have a gas bill which would include the fuel you used for domestic hot water heating, space heating, clothes drying, cooking. That gas bill in December might be $75-250/month depending on your home's size and your lifestyle.\n\nYes, this is very true. I guess the point of this post was to gauge whether our solar system and our electricity usage is \"typical.\"\n\n&gt; As for the existing solar PV system, you do not mention the system's total capacity or date of install or whether there is any winter time shading that might further reduce the system's generation during the time of year when there's the least solar energy available.\n\nThis is a new development and was built in 2015, which is when the solar panels went up. Again, due to paperwork issues, SunPower is not willing to tell me any information about my setup and I don't have any physical documents that describe what setup I have :/\n\nBut my best estimate is that it is a 2-3 kW system, assuming 8 panels at 300 kW.",

"comment": "&gt; You compared death by acute radiation syndrome to death by falling off a fucking roof.\n\nYep.  There were none of the first, including according to your source, and there were some of the second.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Again, if you consider falling off a roof to be a death from solar power, then why would you not consider deaths from people needing to evacuate from an irradiated area?\n\nBecause the area isn't actually irradiated.  Standing inside the outer edge of the containment building, you're exposed to less radiation than you are standing on bedrock in NYC.  It's 95 vs 140-ish bequerels.\n\nAs I already said, I consider that to be a set of 1533 deaths attributable to panicing local government ignoring their own safety plans.\n\n.\n\n&gt; &gt; Actually, I'm comparing all non-weapon nuclear deaths. Primary, secondary, and ancillary.\n&gt;\n&gt; No you're fucking not. You literally denied that my stat of 1368 deaths was in any way related to Fukushima.\n\nSo far, the only source you gave said the correct number was zero.\n\nThe 1368 comes from something called \"the Fukushima disaster,\" and when you look it up, they're talking about the tidal wave.\n\nFeel free to give an attributable source.  The last two you tried said you were wrong, and you didn't admit that.\n\n.\n\n&gt; I'll literally quote it again:\n&gt;\n&gt; As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis\n\nSo, let me get this straight.\n\nThe government and the doctors say one.\n\nThe united nations says zero.\n\nThe world health organization says zero.\n\nAnalyzing the media by undefined says 1368, and if you actually read the entire text, you catch the important bit ***\"This paper reports the number of people who died due to the worsening of illness due to the evacuation caused by the nuclear accident from the earthquake-related deaths, by asking each local government to check condolence money application documents\"***\n\nThey're talking about people who were already sick, and died because a government's forced panic evacuation took them away from a hospital they needed.\n\nAnd that's half a 9/11.  That's a genuine tragedy.  That's more people than my highschool.  It makes me sick to my stomach.\n\nHowever, if the mayor had followed the plan the engineers wrote years before, nobody would have died.\n\nI do not dispute that the evacuation killed thousands.  Actually, the number I believe in for that is the WHO's, which is quite a bit higher.\n\nHowever, ***I also believe that the evacuation should not have happened.***  More importantly, the people who planned for this years ahead of time were clear: no evacuation should happen under these circumstances.\n\nMaybe you don't agree with me; that's fine.\n\nBut can you at least understand how I might disagree whose fault those deaths were?\n\n.\n\n&gt; [citation needed] \n\nYou've spent this whole time refusing to give proper evidence, and ignoring that the handful of citations you do give all say you're incorrect.\n\nI wish you'd admit that when it happened.  I think you probably can't actually see the pattern.\n\nI hope you understand that with your constant swearing and insults, and your refusal to admit when your own evidence is wrong, you don't really deserve to get to ask for evidence.  I don't think you do, though\n\n.\n\n&gt; Because it seems to me you once again have proven your complete inability to read.\n\nSure thing, slugger.  Just keep punching",

Plus, I need to save up a lot of net metering credits for winter 😁\n\nThe other reasons for getting batteries is having more coverage if there is a significant power outage, having whole home back up, and not putting as much strain on the grid. The grid gets a lot of energy from solar during the day. I’d love to see utility companies create virtual power plant programs for people with solar and batteries (with incentives to make buying batteries more affordable) so they can access energy from solar during peak times and avoid starting up other types of power plants.",

"comment": "I found out that the reason was I was hanging out/talking with the wrong people. Try finding a/some local organization(s) specifically working on the issues you are worried about. When I started doing this, I started meeting people who had been working hard to fight these problems for years or even decades. They had a lot of practical skills, friendly relationships with our local politicians who loan our organizations useful but expensive equipment, sent people to come and pick up the supplies and any waste when our events are over. There's a roadmap of all the work the organizations have done, another one reaching into the future, and I've now been with them long enough to see the physically changes in our community as the organizations I work with keep improving things that will help generations to come be more sustainable than the generations before us.\n\nIt's stupid easy for people to sit around bitching online that \"nothing is getting done!\" and \"It's hopeless why even bother?!\" type crap which creates an echo-chamber that people start believing. That belief gives them the \"comfort\" that they can just sit back and be lazy, and there's not really much you can do for them, other than maybe act as an example of another solution. Getting out of the echo-chamber, avoiding people who used to bully and attack me for saying we should do something to help the planet, and instead making a point of getting my hands dirty with other dedicated people, has shown me just how few people can make a massive, lasting difference. \n\nMore recently I started helping with the r/PlaneteerHandbook project which is intended to help guide people from the less effective methods of environmentalism (sadly this includes recycling, since much of it ends up in landfills or burned instead of recycled), and towards more effective but lesser known solutions like improving your homes insulation (even a set of curtains can have a *lasting* impact!), switching to plant-based products instead of grass-fed which is even worse for the planet than factory farmed. \n\nTo help make things even easier, we've started creating directories for charities that help promote better water security or [fight for safer cycling spaces](https://sites.google.com/view/planeteerhandbook/community/transit-and-energy/transit/bikes/bike-advocacy-groups), installers for solar panels or [high efficiency heat pumps](https://sites.google.com/view/planeteerhandbook/consume-responsibly/gas-free/high-efficiency-heat-pumps) which use about 25% less energy than A/Cs or heaters, minus the harmful gases usually spewed out by both. When you spend day after day seeing the thousands of companies and organizations giving hundreds or thousands of creating and effective solutions, it's kinda hard to be depressed or feel like \"no one cares\" any more.\n\nMy suggestion since you are so young is try to join a group at least once a month, maybe see if there's one at your school, if you are still in school, or talk to your teachers, and they may know people, resources, jobs, internships, etc. that would help you out. Try to avoid anima products as much as possible, and if you travel by car, try carpooling, cycling, or using public transit like buses. [This page helps break up which personal choices will have the biggest impacts](https://sites.google.com/view/planeteerhandbook/personal), vs which are almost a waste of effort by comparison. \n\nYou may also find [this Job Finder page](https://sites.google.com/view/planeteerhandbook/personal/job-finder) helpful, as it also includes some sections with Training Camps (action camps for environmentalists wanting to learn practical skills), Paid Training, Certification Programs &amp; Job Training, which we keep updating as we find new resources.",

He did not provide details on the substance of the probe.\r  \n\r\r  \nJinko, which is based in Shanghai, has a solar panel factory in Jacksonville, Florida, and a sales and operations office in San Francisco.\r  \n\r  \nThe company is one of few global solar manufacturers that have set up domestic production in recent years.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection is a division of DHS.\r  \n\r  \nJinko shares slid 8% on Tuesday after the raid in Florida was reported by several local news outlets.

You'd just be paying a small fee for delivery charges for each kWh you're pulling from the grid for the extra energy on top of the energy straight from the panels.\n\nSo if you can fully \"charge on solar\" during the day if you WFH or whatever, you'll save pennies, yes.

"comment": "part of the issue is the search for a base load energy alternative to replace coal fired generators that are aging fast and need to be replaced. Solar and wind require significant real estate and cannot operate around the clock unless combined with battery storage. \n\n3rd generation Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) are safer than existing plants, and can generate gigawatts and operate 24/7. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) can be factory built and transported and assembled onsite, and used to produce process heat or electricity for off grid and/or dedicated applications, e.g., crypto mining, data center operations, desalination, etc. they are super versatile. \n\nLast point is that every nuclear superpower had to be able to produce weapons grade materials, so nuclear energy is necessary for national security.

The credit has been a boon to solar installers giving the homeowner a false sense of getting something in return. A solution is to allow the cost to be reflected in the property tax, giving the homeowner a reduction in their income tax.",

"comment": "All this in-fighting is getting a bit tiring now. All these people who are joining /r/vegan and complaining when people post vegan-related issues, seriously stfu. Veganism is the abstinence of products that cause animal suffering. So, when someone has a go at you for eating honey, instead of crying about it why don't you take 5 minutes to understand why honey is NOT vegan. Vegans are not extremists. Indeed, most vegans will use plastics or drive cars, which require the use of oil - a substance made from dead animals from millions of years ago. But we recognise that this is not a vegan issue as the use of oil has no relation to animal suffering despite utilising dead animals. If oil came out of cows udders, vegans wouldn't think twice about not using it.\n\nSimilarly though, I think vegans are too quick to throw out the label 'vegan' whenever they see someone following a loosely vegan diet. Even the most die-hard vegans have rejoiced at Bill Clinton's reluctant acceptance that he is following a vegan diet, when in reality he is certainly not a vegan (leather, wool etc.) and eats turkey once a year too.",

Just because hunting can be better than factory farming(though debatable since hunted animals sometimes dont instantly die and can suffer), doesnt mean that you should do it.\n\nYour body doesnt need meat. So why eating meat? As you said \"for cultural reasons\". Well culture has always been the excuse for the biggest injustices in history. From women rights to slavery. I think you should challenge and rethink everything you are doing and why you are doing it.\n\nFor example are you a christian because you really believe in the Bible and its God or are you a christian because you were brought up as one and never really thought about it? Same deal goes with eating meat, throwing garbage on the pavement, slapping women, masturbating with your finger up your ass, shaving your hair and wearing crocs.\n\nChallenge everything you do, everything you think you are. And think why do you do it and whether you should do something else instead. If you dont know about something, research about it. You have access to the internet. There is little excuse for ignorance.\n\nNow let me be clear. Not all animal killing is unethical IMO. If you had no other choice and lived in the woods, you could kill animals for food. But you arent. You live in a first world country, near a supermarket that has literally everything you could ever need. So you can choose exactly what your diet is and cover your body's needs with vegan alternatives.",

I resent living with my current roommates because theyve deliberately broken all of our agreements as far as energy conservation and cleanliness goes, and despite 4 occasions of me complaining about food being left out on the kitchen counter for days at a time, they refuse to change. The fridge is filled with their moldy rotten leftovers from months ago that i finally had enough of and threw all two kitchen garbage bags worth of it away myself (i dont use the fridge, i either eat at work or eat cold food the day i buy it). SO as you can imagine, we don't get along. i don't talk to them, i say hi when i enter the apartment, and thats it. i just keep my head down and do what i gotta do till the lease ends. \n\nAlso, they KNOW i'm vegan, because for the first month we were in the apartment they were all on board and were like \"Yay we're vegan, this is so rad\" (UCLA students). it lasted 1 week for them. They were in it to lose weight (facepalm) and not for the lifestyle. \n\nSo anyways, my birthday was coming up. 2 weeks before my birthday i block them from being able to see my birthday on Facebook because i didn't want them to have some thing where they pretend like we're all best friends and we go hang out. I just wanted to hunker down, relax, and enjoy the day off from work. \n\nSure enough, right before i'm about to go to bed, they knock on my door and have this gigantic chocolate cake and are singing the most awkward happy birthday with the most disgustingly fake smiles i've ever witnessed. but i tell you what, i ate about half that cake myself. I was not going to waste whatever precious life was ruined to make that cake, regardless of how bad i think milk and dairy tastes/smells. cake wasn't even that good.",

"comment": "Haven't bothered to read the previous answers so hopefully I'm not repeating anything too bad. Most of these answers you can find by doing your own research which I would recommend but since you asked on here I want to give my two cents worth. \n\n1. Not sure what the general position is but I'm sure that it revolves around treating animals with respect, not abusing them, not caging them, not using them for our entertainment, not eating them, not breeding them, not breeding them for food, not hunting them for their products, etc. \n\n2. The animals on those farms would finally be able to run free. There might be some issues at first because of the semi-domestication but their species would survive and adapt. We breed millions of cows, chickens, pigs, etc. I'm positive they wouldn't go extinct. \n\n3. You wouldn't want to eat a naturally occurring dead animal because of the high risk of illness. Also naturally dead animals in the wild get their energy transferred in other ways that are beneficial to us. Vultures eat them and plants take in their nutrients. \n\n4. I would agree with your friends. Animals can't speak for themselves. How do you know it wants you to murder it and eat it?! Unless your instincts are so raw that you feel the need to pounce on a cow and rip it to shreds with your bare hands and eat it raw, then it's really not necessary. \n\n5. Education does need to be more present in those debates. It's far beyond just a philosophical ethical debate. There is tons of science to back up the vegan diet. Almost all the food related documentaries on Netflix right now explain how a raw vegan diet is the best diet ever for everyone. Once again, I recommend doing your own research. \n\n6. If we replaced the meat industry with more agriculture then more people would get fed and for cheaper too. It's actually an improvement. Also most Asians are vegan due to religious affiliations and it wasn't until Westernization that they started eating meat so taking away meat really wouldn't exclude much from their diets. I don't know if you knew this but we go to Africa and teach them agriculture, not how to hunt. If we continue this trend then Africa too will be well fed.",

I think I liked both of those cheeses but I remember one turning into a liquid when I baked it. I think it was follow your heart.\n\nSecond, does anyone have any vegan cookie recipes I can make for Christmas that's not \"weird\" - IE: no rice flour, anything fancy and health food like. I want to stick to the basics. I found a naturally vegan Russian Tea Cake Cookie recipe on Betty Crocker's website but I'd like more ideas. \n\nThird, I'm trying to make these cookies mostly from scratch but has anyone had any success making the sugar cookies from a box (for example, Betty Crocker, if it's vegan) and replacing the eggs it calls for with like bananas?\n\nThanks.",

Like the birthday I cooked too, people enjoyed my spring rolls until they found out they were vegans. And due to that I apparently wrecked the whole Norwegian economy and is a terrorist. I was on local TV mentioning veganism and had people yell stuff after me in the streets. \n\nThat really depends on your job, I live in Stavanger and the whole oil crisis thingy have made people lose jobs or forced them to take less hours to keep them, so we are not that rich here anymore u.u Especially not us who don't have any fancy jobs.",

There would be chemicals which act as inhibitors during or after the introduction of damaging stimuli, like the way opiates work in every single animal that feels pain, unlike the oyster, which uses them for signaling purposes and not inhibition purposes\n2. They would have some sort of physical reaction to being damaged, ie, moving away, secreting something, etc\n3. They would have to possess a brain (or **multisynaptic ganglia**, *which has never been observed*, in any species, alive or extinct)\n4. Nocioceptors that report in some form or fashion to a centralized body, like a neocortex or equivalent structure\n5. You would have to site a study which shows that they have different *behavioral* actions that differentiate between damaging, neutral, and favorable conditions, for example, an ant will try and groom its legs if you place pain killers on it, acid or it, or touch it, indicating a non-differentiation between the favorability of external conditions\n\nSome of these are sufficient in and of themselves, others are necessary but not sufficient,and in total these are just a couple of examples that would make me reconsider my position, but since you won't find any of them (because I have looked for them), you'd be better off just accepting that you were wrong, since it seems this quote by Christopher Cox seems to apply to you:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; When I became a vegan, I didn’t draw an X through everything marked “Animalia” on the tree of life. And when I pick out my dinner, I don’t ask myself: What do I have to do to remain a vegan? I ask myself: ***What is the right choice in this situation?*** Eating ethically is not a purity pissing contest, and the more vegans or vegetarians pretend that it is, the more their diets start to resemble mere fashion—and thus risk being dismissed as such. Emerson wrote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of *little minds*.”",

"comment": "Bill Maher has had many vegan animal rights activists on his show during the years, from Moby to Ingrid Newkirk. In the past, he made a controversial video about Canada Goose, and more recently made a controversial video about the Coronavirus and the Wuhan wet markets where he was called racist for using the term \"China Virus\". He makes a lot of great claims for veganism, but often blurs the lines between social politics where he supports one cause at the expense of another group, and finally, he has some dicey views on vaccinations which shouldn't be ignored.  \n\n\nIt seems that Bill Maher himself eats meat, but he does go out of his way to support veganism on his platform. I've been vegan for 4 years so, in this video, I thought I would give my take on how good Bill Maher is for veganism. I'm really proud of this video and will be doing more videos just like this as a series, so if you know of another celebrity, chef, YouTuber, or activist who I should do one on next please let me know in the comments of this video. I'd love to know your thoughts on how I could improve this video and subscribe if you'd like to help!",

I stick with soy because I think it’s the best one nutritionally (please correct me if I’m wrong haha), but for ice cream/sweet drinks where I don’t care about nutrition anyway, I would absolutely prefer oat milk over any other milk, including dairy!",

He was as speciesist as any other carnist and the only thing notable thing about him was his personality and his eagerness to get involved with wildlife. The irony of course being a respectable amount of the wildlife he would have saved, rehabilitated and then exploited for money in his zoo, would have been in harm's way because of the negative effects humanity has on nature with their current lifestyle choices.

I have a very severe medical condition that I was born with and makes it incredibly difficult to gain weight (Lupus and Marfans Syndrome). Unfortunately, doctors always try and pin my weight on veganism even though I've been severely underweight my entire life and if you look at my growth curve, nothing has changed. Honestly I wouldn't even mention veganism as long as your dietary panels are fine. It can make doctors overlook other issues since (from my experience) then pin everything on veganism once you say the word.\n\nAlso, my panels often come back as being significantly better than others with my condition. One time my doctor praised me and asked what my secret to such good results are. The second I mentioned the word veganism I got a lecture about long-term health issues even though I had been vegan for 12 years by that point and they had just praised my panels.",

Your husband is an abusive philanderer, but you care more about his health than the suffering of the animals. You should continue your plant-based diet for your own health, but get the h*ll away from the abuser. Don't try to work things out with him. It will only get worse.\n\nEdit: I *know*.

"comment": "From a pure health perspective I'm talking. Ethics is a different matter. Take a fur coat for example, it is far less ethical than a vegan coat yet the utility of it is not necessarily better. Eating chicken that isn't ultra processed is quite good from a heath perspective and I'm simply saying that the notion that meat eaters are blasting all vegan products as unhealthy is real and pretty dumb but this sub does a similar thing for animal products. I think the ethics of the matter is the way to make arguments against animal products because from a health perspective because if you're eating vegan junk food it is not really more healthy than non vegan junk food.\n\nVeganism can help you get a healthier diet but chicken and broccoli is taking way less years off your life than vegan chicken nuggets.",

"comment": "So it assumes that morals are very personal, and what we consider right or wrong is perspective. \n\nThere are definitely grey areas to veganism, especially with dairy and eggs. When it comes to animal flesh, there is really one consistency. Killing and consuming an innocent and helpless creature is wrong, regardless of who it's for. \n\nI'm not talking about tribes or remote locations. I am assuming this individual lives in a 1st world country with access to alternatives. If so, then paying for slaughter, tortured, or rape of any individual is wrong.",

I thought that was a pretty negative perception and generalization to make of someone you just met,   but now, looking at some of the comments of people on this sub, she has good reason to assume I am a judgy vegan instead of a friendly one.\n\nFact is, if you act closed off and refuse to engage with people whom you start seeing as beneath you or morally inferior, you're shutting out  85-90% of the global population---instead of welcoming that population to join veganism.",

But in our part of the world where it is we screw up the most. It's not never eat any animals again (at least for me). But please start treating them like feeling and thinking living beings. Any old religion has had the highest of thoughts when it came to animals. There were respected and well cared for in most cases. It's once we put a human face in the sky where shit started to spiral downwards in a nature respecting kind of way. That has to change imo",
