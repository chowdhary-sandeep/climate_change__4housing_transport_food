The point of the bill seems to be to stop subsidizing rich buyers, rather than making it even more helpful to middle-income buyers.\n\nI understand why they might want to stop helping out rich buyers, but if their goal is to get more EVs in the state, they should subsidize everyone's EV purchase. If I were to put on my paranoia hat, I'd suspect that ICE luxury car dealers in the state are tired of losing sales to Tesla, so they're backing this effort to try to return to equal footing.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20213244272029732,"1.1.1_stance":-0.058578336194022994,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26289570131802226,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23289496212853322,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16590594756082233,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.31539880433784123,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3210866044076586,"ev_1":-0.10109559226662188,"ev_2":-0.2695718840559464,"ev_3":-0.009265847627830226,"ev_4":-0.014975213250484861,"ev_5":-0.008134807932947297,"ev_6":-0.0562248176720459},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

When I spoke of oil being \"subsidized and entrenched\" I meant to include any and all benefits the industry receives through its close ties to government. \n\nIf that was your intent, then so be it.  If we are going to discuss the benefits received in that direction (government to oil companies), would it not be fair to discuss the benefits provided not only in the other direction, but from cheap energy as a whole to society at large?\n\n&gt;I think the generally accepted definition agrees with my position here. \n\nInsofar as your position is coincident with your links, I disagree.\n\n&gt;It's only you who's sought to restrict the discussion to your narrow definition of subsidy.\n\nNo.  The definition of subsidy is really quite clear.  I'm sorry you feel compelled to bend it to suit your needs.  Here is the first line of the definition you provided:\n\n\"A subsidy is a form of financial or in kind support extended to an economic sector...\"\n\nThe links you provided early tried to call a subsidy a lack of a tax.  The two are **not** the same.\n\nAs I have said, though, if you would like to talk about the larger relationship between companies and government and society, let us do so.\n\n&gt;Again, I think I've been quite clear on what I meant all along, so I'm not sure what you mean here.\n\nYou opened with \"subsidy,\" which is different that what you meant, but if you would like to move past that, I'm all for it.\n\n&gt;The point remains that there's much more to the cost of oil consumption than is reflected in the price at the pump, and those costs are overwhelmingly socialized.\n\nOK.  Let's agree on that point.  Is it your position that there is a much greater benefit to society as a whole than is reflected in the price at the pump?\n\n&gt;But for the specific case of automobiles used by ordinary consumers, **if** using electricity in lieu of gasoline can achieve those same benefits with fewer negative externalities, isn't that a good thing?\n\nSure.  At present, it can't though, so I am not sure why you identify EVs in particular.  Surely you won't ignore the huge subsidies that EVs and hybrids enjoy at present that enable them to be on the road at all?\n\n&gt;No, I don't think I'd say that.\n\nGood.

No worries.\n\nI personally think that we should use the correct tool for the job, not try to use one tool for every purpose.  I live in a house with 4 adults (well, two old adults and two young ones), and we have three automobiles and a motorcycle.  We have, oh, hell, 6 bicycles I think, because the kids out grow some, and I have both a regular bicycle and a recumbent for myself.  Oh, and a folding bike that I bought second hand to take in the camper.  \n\nWe live a pretty active lifestyle, or at least we used to before I had to work all the damn time.  Going and doing, camping, caving, water sports, riding bicycles, sailing, etc. all require gear, and fairly often I have to pull a utility trailer of some sort.  Also, I've had a 4 wheel drive vehicle of some sort since about 1984 and would not know what to do without one.  I go so many places with bad roads or across muddy dirt fields, etc. that I have to have it, or I'd constantly be stuck somewhere.\n\nOn the other hand, our daily driver these days is the Nissan Leaf.  It's small, quick, smooth and lots of fun to drive.  I plug it in at night, and have plenty of juice to do the vast majority of our running about the next day, unless we're doing something like going to the lake, or going camping.  It is used for well over half of the miles I or my wife drive.  It costs me about $10 per month in electricity.\n\nWould I have it for my only vehicle?  No, because it is not suited for all purposes that I need a vehicle to perform.  But, it's the perfect \"other car\" that gets used all the time.  \n\nON the subject of whether I would pay $100 thousand for a Tesla...  only if I were rich enough that I didn't mind spending $100K on a car.  It's a top end luxury sports car, and one that doesn't appeal to everyone.  Some people like to hear and feel the roar of the engine, and I fully understand that.  Generally speaking, if I were rich, I would probably have a whole warehouse full of vehicles, from huge trucks to an insane top end bike to an old-school muscle car, and yes, a slick, powerful electric Tesla.  Since I'm not rich, I can't justify the extra money that a Tesla costs, any more than I can justify spending $100,000 on a top end gas powered sports car. \n\nSince you're one who seems to like the idea of hearing the engine sing, a Tesla might not be a good choice for you, and that's okay.  Notice that I didn't tell you what a horrible person you are for not lusting after the Tesla?  I just pointed out that it was not a golf-cart with a 30 mile range.  It's a luxury electric rocket with lots of power and speed.  My Leaf isn't a rocket, but it's got more acceleration than my Jeep does (to your comment about taking off at a red light).\n\nStill, it seems that many people who are not taken in by the climate armegeddon scare stories tend to be opposed to all things that the other side is proposing as good.  They (maybe you? I'm not sure) hate the very idea of an electric car, a solar panel, a wind turbine, bicycling at any point, etc.  I'm not sure why that is.  I can enjoy a bicycle for what it is, and still like riding a massive Harley.  I don't have to hate bicycles because they don't sound like thunder when they go by.\n\nAgain, instead of embracing a single tool for all purposes, learn to appreciate each tool for its designed purpose. You might not like to ride bicycles at all.  No skin off my nose.  I'm not forcing you to.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00017837601020194901,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15362479630268808,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2583921839867208,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.028800990898162127,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.6096382141113281,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20807701629886663,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11713181823142804,"ev_1":-0.17118937480248597,"ev_2":-0.014469100763866058,"ev_3":-0.01500940546975471,"ev_4":-0.004763916551989193,"ev_5":-0.08314485746324338,"ev_6":-0.03975614194496302},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It was cost and complexity, period. GM expected to build thousands of EV-1's. At the end, GM couldn't sell them as parts as simple as brake pads were not available as the supplier stopped making them when the volume didn't show up. It was economics. \n\nAt the 1998 Detroit auto show, GM showed a bunch of prototype EV-1 derivatives, including fuel cell powered concepts and hybrids. No one at GM wanted to kill it, and the Gen II was optimisticly released with more range.\n\nBut no one cared. (Rounding down from 800 people over 3 years in the largest car market in NA).\n\nProblem with that stupid \"Who Killed...\" video is that it's wildly inaccurate but people want to believe it, even as GM is releasing a batch of EV's.\n\nAnd since I was at GM when the Tesla Roadster was developed, no one thought soldering together a thousand laptop batteries was a good idea. The battery management and thermal management systems were crude or non-existent. It was a gutsy move, but it paid off. Li-Ion was still in it's infancy for scalability back then.

It seems *likely*, though afaik it hasn't been confirmed, that other carmakers will also offer a J-1772 to NACS adapter for their own NACS-based EVs (which they'll make starting in 2025), since without it nearly every public level 2 charger in the country would be unusable for those cars, since every non-Tesla level 2 charger has a J-1772 plug.\n\nThat said, if you get an EV with an especially large battery, you may find yourself constrained with the 32A limit on most J-1772 chargers. Longer range Teslas support up to 48A, and I believe the F-150 Lightning supports up to 80A. But unless you're *sure* you're going to get a giant-battery EV truck or the like, a 60A circuit is really all you'll possibly need.

The market, which includes the impacts of competition and the general state of the economy, will dictate their ability to continue their growth rate.  This isn't just a matter of whether they can produce more cars, they have loads of cash to build more factories.  It's a question of whether they can find the buyers for them at prices that are profitable.\n\nAs we know, their production growth guidance for 2023 was only 31% higher than 2022.  That suggested their annualized production growth rate wouldn't increase at all in 2023, when compared to their Q4 '22 production rate.  Also remember that for the past 11 years, their growth was almost uninhibited by other brands, who were all producing a tiny number of EVs and using a tiny amount of the available global cell production capacity and raw materials.  Some OEMs have already begun to scale, and others are soon to follow in a big way as numerous battery plants are scheduled to come online.  That'll drive fierce competition for raw materials.  We now have two companies, Toyota and Stellantis, (Stellantis being one of the front runners for largest EV producing auto groups) suggesting there isn't enough raw materials to replace ICEV production with BEVs.\n\nTesla's been heavily reliant on Chinese LFP cell imports to grow their US production rates over the past couple of years.  Now with the next tax credit policies, and this administrations clear intent to stymie Chinese entry into the US, Tesla's become completely reliant on their ability to grow cell production within the US going forward.  I feel it's only a matter of time before Europe begins cracking down on China as well... and Tesla's European sales are even more heavily reliant on Chinese produced vehicle imports, cell imports, and parts imports.\n\nTesla is priced like a high growth company, with the expectations that they will meet their guidance.  Yet, people still explode in surprise when they report a record quarter.  Let's put it this way, they didn't guide to simply report record quarters.  They guided for every subsequent year to grow their annual production record by 50%, which requires continued quarterly growth in every quarter.  Failing that, the company's value will fall.\n\nLike I said, they're already starting to fall behind on their claims of 50% average growth every year through 2030.  No company can accurately predict that far into the future.  The fact that Tesla made such extraordinary claims... namely that they will own 25% of the entire global light duty new vehicle market within the next 7 years should be setting off 100% of onlookers' BS meters.  That 25% is compared to their 2023 guidance of only 2.25% of the market.  To do so would require multiple major OEMs not just going bankrupt... but literally failing and shutting down operations.  It also means Tesla would have to out grow new up and comers like BYD and many other rapid growth auto companies.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003618548435042612,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3920815733109986,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.02847937618692716,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.02738645641754071,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.09015670915444692,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2892030582804189,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.005360796113109245,"ev_1":-0.005125163702662879,"ev_2":-0.0013218529832859833,"ev_3":-0.000474804585489134,"ev_4":-0.0007486828011072552,"ev_5":-0.0009285040772131955,"ev_6":-0.0016539114027788553},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Massively improve the efficiency of the house to lower bills, including\n\n2. Replace the gas-powered water heater, clothes dryer (and clothes washer? Not sure) with electric, and (longer term) the car with electric, and thus have zero gas, and an entirely electric powered house. Then\n\n3. Install rooftop solar to eliminate those bills.\n\nI'm just starting out on my adventure into all of this, totally fascinated by it, can't read enough. I've just been to [this](http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php) awesome site which estimates I could potentially generate 12,365kWh/yr (34/day) from the SW-facing back half of my 1100sqft foam roof using fixed panels, 9931 (27/dy) from the NE-facing front half. [edit: solarcity estimated 1st year production of 9607kWh. Dunno which roof half or how much coverage that was for].\n\nI've just gone to pge.com and played around with all their data tools and our average daily electric energy usage over the last two years is 9.84kWh, to the tune of $1.39/day. Gas is 1.16 \"therms\", $1.34, total therefore $2.73/day.\n\nSo, my questions (sorry that this is a bit of a brain dump!):\n\nA. Assuming we convert to electric and improve the energy efficiency of the house such that we've got an average daily consumption of (e.g.) 13kWh (I don't know if this is unachievably low, or easily achievable &amp; I should aim lower), with a winter high of 25kWh (again, dunno if too high or low), is it reasonable to assume that this can be covered with 'a few' solar panels on the roof? I know the calculator says I should be able to generate 34kWh/day using fixed panels on the SW-facing half of my 1100sqft roof, but in reality, what would a solar installer be likely to recommend?\n\nB. There seem to be a number of energy incentives available in California. Is it a prudent long-term move to go 'all in' with this stuff, e.g. solar water heater (or electric powered by panels), fully switch to electric from gas, double glaze windows, seal fireplaces, insulate power outlets, all this stuff?\n\nC. We have a foam roof (an old crappy one, and soon a new uncrappy one). It seems not all solar companies work on foam roofs (e.g. solarcity). Do you envision this being a problem, or something I'll have to factor my plans around, or simply \"...but some companies do, go with one of them, the end\"?\n\nD. My big remaining zone of confusion (after spending all today learning about my power use and likely solar generating potential), is regarding solar company contracts. From what I saw of the solarcity proposal, we'd be locked in for 20 years, $0 down, we pay $0.15/kWh which will never increase more than 2.9%/yr. What I've just realised is that we're paying for the power the solar produces, and that rate will rise. At 2.9%/pa for 20 years we'd end up paying $0.26/kWh. But we get a cheque for anything we sell to the grid above what we use right? I'm not sure if I feel like we dodged a bullet with being bound SolarCity for 20 years while panel &amp; other costs plummet and their efficiencies shoot up, house-powering batteries come on the market and plummet in price, etc., all while we're lumbered with this contract.... or if it's a good deal where we do no work, they deal with all the hassle, we pay less than we would to PG&amp;E &amp; it goes up less than they do, and any efficiency savings we make result in a bigger cheque. Although I wonder how long those cheques will last, given PG&amp;E will be broke if everyone does the same thing... Sorry D is a completely unstructured ramble. I'm kinda getting my head around generation vs usage maths - simple enough I suppose - but the contract / setup options is boggling my mind a bit.\n\nAnyway - cheers in advance to anyone who can shed any light (ha!) or opinions on anything here!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.28276891509691876,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28629185087951414,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23557489445423568,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23764850143640312,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32833778858169893,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.36463421117344336,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10208164824871346,"solar_1":-0.22111930384169712,"solar_2":-0.26934400035326994,"solar_3":-0.2134339132891796,"solar_4":-0.05693587653852252,"solar_5":-0.05488785639068829,"solar_6":-0.26356728260324613,"solar_7":-0.01926273477575524,"solar_8":-0.04948328083507956,"solar_9":-0.18077371122567784,"solar_10":-0.3577369016480234},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro: The author expresses a clear intention to install solar panels on their roof and is excited about the potential energy generation.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The median sales price of a San Fran home is 1.2 million... but they use a $10k solar array as a reference. I imagine the median sales price of a solar array is at least twice that. But mortgage financing mitigates that issue.\n\nCan this policy really be replicated in other cities which have substantially lower electric rates and lack mortgage financing options? Not to say that San Fran shouldn't be a leader on this, but its an impossible policy to replicate across most of the USA at this time. Ultimately, this obstruction can be traced back to the subprime mortgage crisis, which kicked PACE financing out of the residential market.\n\nFinally, you get into commerce clause issues. Might city-level mandates result in electric rate hikes across state lines? I'd argue yes if I were a utility on a multi-state grid.\n\nPolicy continues to be the primary driver of the solar industry. Solar designers need to keep that in mind.

Second, anyone who expresses ROI as a time period is a total idiot. The formula for ROI is net profit / cost of investment. That number is expressed as a percentage. Note that ROI completely ignores time and there is no way that number can be expressed as a unit of time.  Do not take financial advice from people who use terms incorrectly, [like this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/solar/comments/9g0nkx/i_cant_make_a_financial_case_for_solar_at_235watt/e61xiw8/).\n\nThird, the calculation for internal rate of return requires consideration of the life of the project. If you are only calculating IRR on 14 years, that’s too short. Conservatively, most photovoltaic systems have a life of 20 years.  You could also realistically use 25 years as the life if you just want to be moderate on the estimates.\n\nFourth, you need to calculate the IRR and payback period based upon the out-of-pocket cost, which is the cost after the federal tax credit. \n\nFifth, you have to remember that the IRR of the photovoltaic system is an after tax percentage. So, if you were to invest the money in the stock market instead and say you’d get 9% return, you’d then have to pay the federal capital gains tax (15% or 20%, I believe) on those gains. As I understand, Florida doesn’t have any capital gains tax, so no need to consider state taxes, but I could be wrong on that. In this case, the 8% on the solar is better than the 9% on the stock market.\n\nSixth, note that the IRR is practically risk free. That hypothetical 9% on the stock market is full of risk. \n\nSeventh, you're not considering grid saturation.  In Hawaii, California, and probably some other states, new photovoltaic systems cannot access the best net metering program while older systems do.  Basically, the older systems were installed under great net metering agreements. Then suddenly, without warning, the utility regulators closed those signups and forced new systems to be under less favorable programs or not connect to the grid at all.  If your home is under the older and better program, the photovoltaic system is worth much more. Florida hasn't changed their net metering, but eventually it will.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00038053688816338155,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09715480607592183,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.34226312056496694,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3314313056306698,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06626570791869124,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2550715662694656,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.019344480397800606,"solar_1":-0.15389517009698317,"solar_2":-0.018061682301777182,"solar_3":-0.18517623057899377,"solar_4":-0.24722460817186706,"solar_5":-0.003938342554950698,"solar_6":-0.004512200826866319,"solar_7":-0.00472539179221106,"solar_8":-0.0010644078871943445,"solar_9":-0.05291530461060271,"solar_10":-0.20505481582150745},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It's complicated, but basics really isn't.\n\nYou mention lots of things that make it worse while disagreeing with nothing except wanting to understand SPECIFIC events with unusual activity, and its mostly due to UNCERTAINTY and  INSTABILITY:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\\_thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_thermodynamics)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Hadley Circulation can be considered as a heat engine.\\[4\\] The Hadley circulation is identified with rising of warm and moist air in the equatorial region with the descent of colder air in the subtropics corresponding to a thermally driven direct circulation, with consequent net production of kinetic energy. The thermodynamic efficiency of the Hadley system, considered as a heat engine, has been relatively constant over the 1979\\~2010 period, averaging 2.6%. Over the same interval, the power generated by the Hadley regime has risen at an average rate of about 0.54 TW per yr; this reflects an increase in energy input to the system consistent with the observed trend in the tropical sea surface temperatures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I was saying was that the polar vortex was part of a larger engine that is happening due to less algae, forests and rain thereof. If you want to understand any of these things, \"it's CO2!!!!\", \"No, it's Methane!!\", \"Yes! Greenhouse gases explains everything!!!!\" and so on won't get you there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Need to put in this to send it in the correct direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreenhouse gases do heat the atmosphere, but it's thermal and fluid dynamics of the system where one considers thermal exchange higher in the atmosphere, where equatorial heat and lack of vegetation coupled with much agriculture land and lack of forests in place like the US -- perhaps not even roadside in most cases. So Greenhouse gasses is one thing, but the actual effect of this on the global climate is a much stronger heat engine driven by lack of rain and increased equatorial temperatures and ocean temperatures -- where the latter reacts much slower than weather. This is a good as explanation of any that hinges on the more fundamental and larger principles at play rather than finding a set of numbers that explain everything as detailed and specific changes and causes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut with Storms in the US and this polar vortex thing, where aerosols from planes hides the symptoms, it's more like, \"Oh my god!!!! We've built a weather and climate machine aimed at North America!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty much, \"forget everything about physics until before 1905\", where relativity started distracting nerds from getting hot over work. And it's important enough to make, what was it, DARPA that funded a project to look into if consciousness could be explained as a thermodynamic system, but then you have this thing about quantum electro dynamics that makes all the nerds distracted from getting hot for work. Thermodynmics is more relevant for physics in, let' say, a cosmological body like a planet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut because, geoengineering, or anything that doesn't deal with the basis for economy -- shit that grows or come out of the ground.\n\nThere is a sideways attempt across -- laws of thermodynamics, and of information and physics.\n\nSo the physics of this thermodynamic system would be more reliable if you scientifically did thermodynamics on top of weather models, these things are variable within a limit. And then you now how big of a LARGE temperature difference you have to do work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for Climate rather than Environment, to do something positive for the GLOBAL thermodynamic system.\n\nForget recycling, actually probably, stop; and plant trees rather than lawns. And underground transport becomes a good investment -- how far from city centre can you park and get there faster, underground, doesn't work outside cities --, and oils from these trees could state-wide at least locally end plastic for bags and wrappings, even if re-packaging that recycling is better; and community fields rather than forests/parks, so if you want to sit under a tree or in a bush, that is everywhere else. Rather than solar panels : light reflecting surfaces for the -- perhaps -- tropic trees -- to more arctic under warmer conditions, for upside down seasons, at least moonlit. That's being very specific and sharp within what can be done and is a sharp line for thermodynamics -- globally. Because mirrors can be done for a city more easy than solar panels. Almost as if those that understand these things during Victorian times didn't mind building big looking at London. They make seals that work well in space, so mini-tubes in sewage systems work  in many places.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Dungeons &amp; Dragons, this is wicked, because you can do anything plastic with Resin --:-- even better, as you are in this part of the economy with Resin from trees: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea-formaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea-formaldehyde), and you can compress and burn it, likewise you can circulate swimming pools in California quite often and recycle the water, if and only if, algae is grown with a mix that doesn't smell frequently, it puts in the oil and energy sector ::: It is like treating thermodynamics as king with the economic basics and the global economy. And recycling sewage gives you you nitrogen and methane. Hanging gardens can be quite optimal, as you can make transparent materials good enough with cleaning,\n\nLike going all out steam-punk on a big city, by focusing sunlight between buildings rather than roads, it cleans the air and heated air comes in from below, and you have a heat engine in buildings. But it's also -- a call for sanity -- technological absurdities doesn't do this :: it's also forgetting economic value-add. Circulation of goods and services is the guarantee for growth along with energy and material input. So if subsidies goes to prices on the basics, and taxes are done with respect to the source, mining or farming, there is energy from \"green garbage\". So all in all can just move up a few floors and build a forest floor in the largest cities as road-building infrastructure projects, and you're better of with the slow path above ground in forest paths. So wealthy city centres that gave up roads a while back can consider this.\n\nSo steam turbines are great, but for populated areas it's heat recovery and much smaller versions of these combustion power plants:\n\n&gt;EMULSIFIED FUELS  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Emulsification with water offers means of utilising fuels with very high viscosities, e.g. refinery residues. The fuel-in-water emulsion facilitates the handling of these fuels almost in the same manner as conventional HFOs. Thesefuels can be of importance because of theirfavourable price.\n\n[http://cdn.wartsila.com/docs/default-source/Power-Plants-documents/reference-documents/brochures/liquid-fuel-power-plants-2014.pdf](http://cdn.wartsila.com/docs/default-source/Power-Plants-documents/reference-documents/brochures/liquid-fuel-power-plants-2014.pdf)\n\nSo back again to economy, usefulness and efficiency of vegetables oils and resin. So compressed shopping bags from fibres and resin goes to steam turbine plants, as there are maintenance and durability concerns with combustion --:-- safety and scale for steam turbines. Doesn't take much for a city block mostly being about broken drive shafts in vibration and sound isolated basements in buildings of large cities. Nobody wants steam boiler accidents to be possible near them, so right and wrong size matters, and for cities scale works in many smaller parts, but more co2 so why not have something grown where the air is more saturated, and deal with circulation correctly. These things run on anything, but the cheapest and simplest sustainable way of running them isn't anything -- even if garbage works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould perhaps put this into larger article to make context, as these is good for steam:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/azkhrw/oil\\_lipids\\_and\\_carbohydrates\\_emulsion\\_into\\_paste/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/azkhrw/oil_lipids_and_carbohydrates_emulsion_into_paste/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/energy/power-generation/steam-turbines/d-r-steam-turbines.html](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/energy/power-generation/steam-turbines/d-r-steam-turbines.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo comparing the two, steam turbines seems to start at 10 MW, while combustion engines stop at 20MW.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis de-railed slightly, but it's on-topic as for exploring what thermodynamics mean to the economy, the climate problem isn't a quantum mechanical problem, due to electricity, it's thermodynamics and mechanical work.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010003275237977505,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14567531448542467,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.38397883872191113,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11934887742002805,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3759292732353233,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21112372535595103,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1597829265956534,"solar_1":-0.10764604353347267,"solar_2":-0.1555719064027509,"solar_3":-0.23248693587143926,"solar_4":-0.12451110179972602,"solar_5":-0.11293658617564231,"solar_6":-0.034499352957936935,"solar_7":-0.06514344664174132,"solar_8":-0.022652101532003144,"solar_9":-0.04872427777270616,"solar_10":-0.23070771275986338},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other: (The author does not directly reference a specific group with a personal relationship in the text.)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States.\n\n**This is NASA with its Jekyll and Hyde, at once giving us straight and  optimistic truth while at the same time will offering up scurrilous  lies to advance the climate change agenda. The whole of the “global  warming” movement began in 1988 with staged hearings wherein James  Hansen, then head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, warned Congress that the planet was warming, and that Armageddon was around the corner.**\n\n**The planet is warming, slightly, but that’s not a problem. Hansen surely knows this, as does Michael Mann and Al Gore.** Yet we are  continually confronted with a scare-a-thon, warned that we only got a  few years before the coasts are inundated by rising oceans, forests are  turning to deserts, species are going extinct. In the year 2000, climate  “scientist” David Viner said snowfall would soon be a thing of the past. He still employed at East Anglia, no shame attached to his stupid remark regarding snow. In July, 2009, my favorite Royal Clown, Prince Charles, said we had but 96 months to stave off “irretrievable climate  and ecosystem collapse, and all that goes with it.” I can do math. 96 months from 7/09 was July of 2017. We’re still here. More importantly, that jackass is still in line to be king, not that we need kings.\n\n**But the larger point is that every prediction that climate alarmists  have made has been shown by scientific evidence to be not just wrong,  but wildly off the mark,** ***and it does not matter.*** **They merely go on to new predictions of doom. Being a climate scientist means never having to say** ***“Oops! Got that one wrong.”***\n\nI did not mean to write all of that, as I sat down with a different person in mind, a man who wrote a little red book that had a profound impact on me. It was not Chairman Mao, but rather Jacques Ellul, and the book was not one of sayings, but a discussion of [“Propaganda.”](https://monoskop.org/images/4/44/Ellul_Jacques_Propaganda_The_Formation_of_Mens_Attitudes.pdf)\n\nI read the book, I think, in or around the year 2000. I remember picking it up in the Tattered Cover book store on a trip to Denver around that time. I immediately dove into it, absorbing as much as I could, and wondering why the man was allowed to divulge so many trade secrets. He spoke openly about methods and means of indoctrination and brainwashing.\n\nIt’s not hard to understand how the naked unvarnished truth can stand  right out in the open in a culture like ours, one in which reading is  reserved to a few, and most of that being a process of self-indoctrination, or advancement of more propaganda. So Ellul’s book does no harm to the state of the state. It’s inside knowledge that no one fears divulging, as so few are capable of reading and ingesting it.\n\nBut to finally get to my point, **I was wondering why the climate alarmists are so shameless in promotion of lies that are easily seen to  be lies. They have no fear of being shown to be wrong. It does not matter. They can make any outrageous statement they feel like making, as David Viner and Prince Charles did, as Al Gore and Michael Mann routinely do, without any blowback. They live in a no-fear all-lies-all-the-time environment. What’s up with that?**\n\nEllul was forthright in his exposition of the nature of propaganda,  elucidating the various types and purposes. I won’t go into it other than page 70 … \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“The … great distinction within the general phenomenon of propaganda is the distinction between propaganda of agitation and propaganda of integration.” Agitation propaganda (agitprop) is led by parties seeking to destroy the established order. All revolutionary movements have been nourished by agitptop.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The climate change agenda is extremely effective on governments, but  hardly felt by the bulk of humankind, as we can all look out our window  and see little or no change. Yet the topic is pursued with relentless zeal, one lie after another masquerading as science in banner headlines.  This is a matter of great concern. The climatic change agenda is serious business meant to do great harm, and its promoters, while not zealots in private, are in public lying and meaning for the lies to have a large and immediate impact. It is a large and well-coordinated agitprop campaign. As such it must have an underlying agenda that seeks real change.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We do not talk to say something, but to obtain a certain effect,” said Goebbels. All of the lies about climate are hitting home with an agenda taking shape, cap and trade, reduction of the use of fossil fuels, boondoggle technologies like solar panels and windmills, the latter a real thing and not just something to tilt at.\n\nBut it is interesting in this regard in that it is a massive failure.  There is no reduction in the amount of CO2 we are putting in the atmosphere. That is not a danger, and the alarmists must know this. **The U.S., because we are switching from coal to natural gas, actually leads the way in reduction of CO2 emissions, but we could reduce those emissions to zero and it would not counter what China and India are doing. So reduction of emissions of CO2 is not on the agenda, and no one cares about that anyway, at least no one in the climate alarmist  movement.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what are they up to, these revolutionary zealots? We can only guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve been researching their various hoaxes for years now, and they  all seem, in various ways, to have a common objective. Erlich’s *Population Bomb* proved to be wrong, as did Rachel Carson’s *Silent Spring*. Both sought fundamental changes in public policy regarding humans and our tendency to reproduce when food is abundant. Other hoaxes, such as  AIDS, are more matter of fact – wanting us to stop having so much sex,  or at least limit it to recreation and away from reproduction. The  movement to get women out of their nurturing role and into the rat race  with the rest of us can be seen as anti-reproduction. The ridiculous cost of higher education has the same effect as well – it is frightfully  expensive to have kids!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is that what climate change is about? Too many people? Too much food?  If so, then it can only be aimed in a couple of places, the ones still largely undeveloped, Africa and large parts of South America. (India and China will go their own way, no matter any treaties or “accords” they sign onto.) They want our black and brown friends to be tripping over solar panels and building big ugly unreliable windmills. That way they,  unlike us, will not enjoy the prosperity that fossil fuels bring to our lives.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The essence of climate change alarmism is, then, if I am anywhere close to being right, a movement to limit the development of our darker-skinned neighbors to the south. Maybe it is just coincidence that  it affects people of color the most, but it is also not hard to impugn  racism on the movement as a whole.***","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.011733900134762129,"1.1.1_stance":-0.056687634283055864,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18583796590128693,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12768182220558325,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3597038799954305,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.0017346862199095388,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20474839308784515,"solar_1":-0.10570529687330414,"solar_2":-0.06467517679854795,"solar_3":-0.06530851834242081,"solar_4":-0.17527464791055536,"solar_5":-0.08795322505201028,"solar_6":-0.10959249385632575,"solar_7":-0.15693133839279957,"solar_8":-0.08668149407943322,"solar_9":-0.07626562760000549,"solar_10":-0.23627837152985193,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.08766404027119279},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I ordered my system at the end of June, and I was assigned a project manager at the beginning of this month. In the intervening time, there were some mistakes on my utility interconnect form that I had to call Tesla about a few times until they corrected it. If you have questions, you can call them, but they very rarely contact you. If you're willing to deal with less communication, it can be a good deal. But I know some people are annoyed by it.\n\nAs far as common pitfalls:\n\n- Buy, don't lease. Tesla is offering rental systems in some states now, but it's almost always better to buy. And then you don't have to deal with transferring the contract if you move.\n- Financing is available from third parties, and the rates aren't bad (4-6%), but make sure you understand the full cost of financing. My loan was done by Tesla through Mosaic, and before I asked to place a down payment the total cost of financing over 10 years on a $23,500 system was about $5,000.\n- Make sure you read about and understand the Federal Tax Credit and any state incentives you may qualify for. The FTC is non-refundable, so you need to owe an equivalent amount in income tax before you can claim all of it (if you work a regular job, you're probably good, but some people think they qualify and then find out tax time they can't claim the full amount).\n- If your state has renewable energy credits (RECs) for solar, Tesla will make you an offer to buy the rights to your credits for an up-front discount. This is generally not worth taking the discount, as it 1) lowers the amount you can claim for the FTC and 2) is generally lower than what you can collect by selling the RECs yourself over the life of the system. The discount will be applied by default, you need to call Tesla and ask if you want to remove it.\n- Read and understand your state's laws about net metering and how that affects your system requirements and the need for Powerwalls. If you have full net metering, you won't need as big of a system, and it makes Powerwalls less of a cost-saving measure.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0035670279758051038,"1.1.1_stance":-0.31778102991062596,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17804216061070957,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21972712386112567,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2135503166991043,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.256609817576485,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13117860242103538,"solar_1":-0.2577291070555195,"solar_2":-0.13065421958430246,"solar_3":-0.052250658430542295,"solar_4":-0.08627199565509948,"solar_5":-0.0014411522352020256,"solar_6":-0.2744806582680515,"solar_7":-0.10325479129230992,"solar_8":-0.04700055091168526,"solar_9":-0.041670529207550544,"solar_10":-0.24455220299904118},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I don't know where this $79 comes from.\n\nThe first rule of solar is to monitor and cut consumption as it doesn't fix bad power habits. LED lights, efficient AC, etc. before you size a system. Batteries can help offset peak usage but will drain fast with AC running. EV's will need to be charged from the grid. A model 3 battery is about 7 Powerwalls worth of energy for context if charging from empty (which isn't common).\n\nSolar doesn't mean you can just use energy whenever and not get a bill. Many people think solar just makes a bill go away but are unaware when they are using grid and when they aren't. \n\nFor instance, depending on what power plan you are on, you will want to send as much power for credit as you can during semi peak ($.30/kwh) (basically daytime) then charge EV's 12a-6a ($.20/kwh) vs charging them with solar power. \n\nHappy to answer any questions.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0019400118229289849,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29178864251511455,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26194663057068035,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09457111544907093,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34418789868606847,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17548049584134398,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05084130895556882,"solar_1":-0.22257484687472806,"solar_2":-0.11538412108833047,"solar_3":-0.003240904068661621,"solar_4":-0.05575879904002553,"solar_5":-0.0017897710567922331,"solar_6":-0.0003653059720818419,"solar_7":-0.006231750730269899,"solar_8":-0.0010637336151072911,"solar_9":-0.08392716380088434,"solar_10":-0.10705104346076648},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

That may be common knowledge, but I just learnt recently. Look out for some other sauces that use it.  Fortunately it's usually steak sauces, but a few times I've found recipes that are vegan except for worcestershire. It's really easy to make it though, without anchovies. \n\nRefried beans are traditionally made with lard. A lot of American brands still do, but there's usually one marked vegetarian that's kosher. Most brands in Canada use vegetable oil, but I always check--I finally found one at Metro the other day. \n\nSugar! White sugar is often made by filtering through charred bones (brown sugar and molasses are byproducts, so they're suspect too). I bought raw sugar for a while (really expensive though), but I guess it's not *as* common as I had heard. In Canada, Redpath and Lantic advertise being free of bone char. Just look into any brand before you buy it. I only buy vegan sugar, but I don't worry as much about the source of sugar in stuff people make me. Fortunately (maybe??) most soft drinks are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup (hfcp), which is kosher. \n\nCasein is a milk protein and for some reason pops up in a lot of nondairy cheeses. It sucks, but you have to check your veggie cheeses for milk. Go veggie brand has casein. Daiya is safe. \n\nOn the bright side, oreos and fudgeos are vegan!\n\nE; gelatin! Jello is out, of course. A lot of gummy candies also have gelatin.

The 99% source that I used to have to link to is showing a dead page right now - hopefully that's temporary.\n\nHowever, you can look at a variety of sources and get at least close to the answer.\n\nhttps://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/factory-farm-nation-2015-edition\n\n&gt; The number of broiler chickens on factory farms rose nearly 80 percent from 1997 to 2012, to more than 1 billion.\n\nThat means that at any given moment, there are 1 billion broiler chickens in a factory farm (1.05 billion as of 2015, to be more exact).\n\nhttp://www.upc-online.org/chickens/chickensbro.html\nhttp://www.ansc.purdue.edu/faen/poultry%20facts.html\nhttps://www.boell.de/en/meat-atlas\n\nThe first states 9 billion chickens, the second 8 billion chickens, and the third about 8.2 billion (25.2 chickens per person in the US, 3.25 million people) are killed each year for consumption.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler\nhttps://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/d146f197-7140-439a-bc1e-83356d3c4f69/Petition-NCC-Slaughter-Age-Chickens.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\nhttps://extension.psu.edu/modern-meat-chicken-industry\n\nThese three sources shed light on the average age meat chickens are slaughtered at. There is a range, but let's go with 6.5 weeks. That's the average age per the USDA document for the most recent date available (the trend shows they are reaching slaughter faster as time progresses, so I believe 6.5 weeks is a reasonable and conservative number to use).\n\nIf there are more than 1.05 billion at any given moment and a 6.5 week turnover, with 52 weeks in a year that gives us over 8.4 billion chickens each year that spend their life on a factory farm. And that's based on largely out of date information - factory farms are taking over our meat supply. Every year they hold a larger percentage than the year before.\n\nSo at the absolute least, 93.3% of all chickens are raised on factory farms based on available data. But given my use of conservative estimates, the number could easily and likely is much higher than that. There is no financial incentive to raise chickens on a \"family\" farm - even factory farm owners barely break even. And as the other commenter said, the shear numbers would be impossible to raise humanely.\n\nOne thing I can say with confidence - if you don't know how the chicken you're eating was raised, it's coming from a factory farm. Even \"pasture-raised\" or \"free-range\" isn't a guarantee, but if the chicken you're eating isn't one you saw on a farm yourself or the place you're eating it at doesn't have their \"humane\" advertisements plastered everywhere and you're not paying extra for it, I can assure you you are supporting the factory farming industry.\n\nYou can check out the documentary Food. Inc if you're interested in more info on the chicken industry. It's not a \"vegan\" documentary.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2854318706522463,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0486419215388878,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.09383913688213852,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17844196381142433,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.37223812444986054,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16496004957067692,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13691474124789238,"diet_1":-0.08430963277587011,"diet_2":-0.1218081166032057,"diet_3":-0.10958497128639699,"diet_4":-0.060003925703212245,"diet_5":-0.06403377056509878,"diet_6":-0.0247303097864157,"diet_8":-0.020688527533517725,"diet_9":-0.01902078093068364,"diet_10":-0.063407968928027,"diet_11":-0.20717216409569592,"diet_13":-0.238755280248976,"diet_14":-0.08096471514338709,"diet_17":-0.01594121498783352},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

So nice. \nUntil I have the time and money to sort out making my own oat milk, I’m pretty happy with it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0009269987931475043,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18698883492254914,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.30737889028740883,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0960405891140302,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24298837995948552,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23840801429067282,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16992676652929126,"diet_1":-0.00196095112793652,"diet_2":-0.0006255126087732302,"diet_3":-0.005975094285834833,"diet_4":-0.001366138415808867,"diet_5":-0.00014258651208365336,"diet_6":-0.021262352170500282,"diet_8":-0.0002076450715928028,"diet_9":-0.03666162112483562,"diet_10":-0.1762186586856842,"diet_11":-0.0049531357605398325,"diet_13":-0.0004761466965040502,"diet_14":-0.06620437361198128,"diet_17":-0.0001380965816982401},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

So why is it immoral? Reasons for veganism vary, but it could be fair to say that the reason generally, is because it causes unnecessary suffering. So then what if an animal doesn’t suffer, is it still immoral? \n\nWe don’t know for sure if oysters suffer, but that is true of all beings and things, given that suffering is a subjective experience. It can’t and never will be ‘proven’ in others. So then we have to make reasonable assumptions as to what does and doesn’t suffer. If we are to err on the side of caution and assume that oysters do suffer, why wouldn’t we also assume that plants suffer? Perhaps fungi suffer? We have to come up with some criteria in order to make an educated assumption as to whether or not something suffers. The fact that an organism is labelled as an animal isn’t indicative of wether or not it suffers, that’s not part of the criteria for classification.\n\nIn determining wether or not something suffers, I would ask what is the utility in feeling pain? What does pain do? I can’t say for sure, but I’ll have a crack. I’d say it creates a response to negative stimuli, yet that is not the whole picture. We have mechanisms to respond to negative stimuli without pain being necessary, such as reflexively lifting your hand from a hot surface before feeling pain. So I would also add that pain being part of our experience, and then changing our behaviour in the future to avoid that which may hurt us, is part of its use. This would require the formation of memories, and the ability to act differently in the future based on experience.\n\nOften in these discussions about pain people focus on mechanisms, such as a nervous system. I think that whilst it may be indicative of he capacity to feel pain, it assumes that other mechanisms for experiencing pain haven’t evolved in other organisms. That’s why I try to think about why we feel pain and what the use of it is.\n\nI can’t say for sure what does and doesn’t feel pain. But if you assume that some things do and some things don’t suffer, what’s your framework for making that distinction? \n\nThe reason that some vegans opt to eat oysters is because they have made a framework for making the distinction as to wether or not something suffers, and they believe oysters do not. If you eat plants, and assume they don’t feel pain, then what’s lead you to that conclusion? Can the reasons as to why you believe that plants don’t suffer also be true of oysters?\n\nNothing wrong with erring on the side of caution, but ones framework may imply that there is no caution. If you believe that plants do not suffer, you clearly have a framework for making distinctions about what does and doesn’t feel pain, but what’s behind that framework? What are the reasons to assume something does or doesn’t suffer?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1964602736683494,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15511310711062692,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1828301000104522,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19180522488369975,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23616514174153458,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23235755159071042,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.174968380536707,"diet_1":-0.09131763282736453,"diet_2":-0.19745861031510117,"diet_3":-0.07251032653668214,"diet_4":-0.04641605390840908,"diet_5":-0.08160537762837805,"diet_6":-0.045273712378643624,"diet_8":-0.1437240143047044,"diet_9":-0.04117293332334763,"diet_10":-0.2532817915610697,"diet_11":-0.09686634907363138,"diet_13":-0.05788819294927331,"diet_14":-0.05595852486895699,"diet_17":-0.03782179675181396},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

This was an adjustment with my [now] fiancé when I went vegan and he would pick things up for me. He’d be like “yeah it’s vegan I checked” then there would be something like honey or powdered milk or whatever. It’s definitely improved with time. I’ve pointed out and showed him how to look at labels properly and he now surprises me with vegan treats and checks when ordering out.\n\nAnd I think that’s the main thing - is he actually trying or did he legitimately forget? Does he understand why you’re vegan? If he legitimately forgot I’d be concerned versus an oversight. Either way I’d have a conversation with him and be honest about how you feel. Express your own needs without pointing the finger. If he can’t accommodate those needs then only you can decide what you’re willing to deal with. We shouldn’t assume the worst about our partners but that doesn’t mean we can’t express our needs and ask to have them met. On one hand, he did go out of his way to get you a gift, so he was thinking about you. The reason he didn’t get you vegan chocolates - something extremely important to you - is the hurtful part. This is what makes me think that maaaaaybeeee he just doesn’t get how important it is to you. \n\nNot making excuses but most people don’t check if something is vegan before buying. As I see it there are a few possibilities.\n\n1. He legitimately forgot you were vegan.\n2. It was a momentary oversight \n3.

But your guess of what veganism looks like is as good as mine, so we all can have our own viewpoints - and that's ok to agree to disagree! We can come together to make those realizations.\n\nVenus fly traps have memory - so they distinguish between what's food and what's not. They don't have eyes, but since every single sense we have boils down to touch, they use feeling for their 'vision'. Feel free to google this.\n\nI've made chicken from the whole chicken. It's not hard to look at the inside and see nuggets there. Steak is just a cut of meat - nothing changes. They might not look this way on the outside, but that's because people are eating what's inside, which does look more like those animal products you mention. But that's besides the point - animals might not be harmed, but they're exploited in the process of faux animal products. If you want to cherry pick the VS's definition all day, go right ahead. Just leave me out of it. An animal had to exist for you to copy-paste it into plants. You're turning plants into animals - that's not 'promoting the development of animal-free alternatives' if you're promoting the normalization of eating animals through plants!\n\nI already explained the rest - so feel free to read my previous comment.\n\nI don't believe you need to eat meat to survive as a vegan, because there's something called foraging. Hunting and gathering by be as old as time, but gathering was a major part of that, if not the major source of calories and nutrients, because hunting is a strenuous activity where you wear yourself out and require a lot of resources to perform and enjoy the labors of it.\n\nNot sure what's wrong with my example of the special olympics and why you think that's what you wanted me to bring up. You can make a competition out of just about anything and it be a sport. Even chess is considered a sport - you don't need legs for that. You don't even need arms either.

They have to confront the fact that they are supporting cruelty and torture, and most people in modern society don’t think they should ever have to be uncomfortable.\n\n> It’s hilarious because they would call vegans snowflakes, etc. but we are the ones who have watched the videos of cruelty and are choosing to go against the grain of society and deal with stupid accusations and stupid non-arguments. They are the ones who can’t handle the hardship of having to look at themselves and accept that they are purposely choosing to support violence because it hurts their feelings, so they lash out like children.\n\nAll of what you said applies not only to those who do not claim to be vegan but also who claim to be or virtue signal themselves as \"vegans\" even as they contribute to or participate in the violent abuse and killing of nonhuman animals.  Indeed, any time vegans point out the pernicious hypocrisy of these plant-based dieting speciesists and animal abusers masquerading as \"vegans\", they get a lot of hate and are often called \"purists\", \"snowflakes\", and other names.  \n\nThese fake \"vegans\" undermine the movement by sowing disinformation, uncertainty, and doubt amongst not only non-vegans but also within the vegan community itself. I have developed a taxonomy of different groups of these animal abusers that are classified by their narrative:\n\n**Class 1: Non-Sentientists**\n\nOyster boys - people who claim that bivalves are not sentient and eating them is \"vegan\".\n\nPescatarians - people who claim that fish are not sentient and eating them is \"vegan\".\n\nEntomophagists - people who claim that insects are not sentient and eating them is \"vegan\".\n\n**Class 2: Plant-based Dieting Speciesists**\n\nThis class is pernicious to the vegan movement as they are plant-based dieters who masquerade as \"vegans\" while at the same time happily fund the violent killing of innocent animals to feed certain animals that they keep in captivity on basis of species. These people make comments like the ones paraphrased below that just highlights their speciesism and their non-veganism:\n\n*Innocent animals would have been abused/killed by someone else anyway to feed my cat so I might as well abuse and kill innocent animals myself to feed the cat and still call myself vegan!*\n\n*I happily purchase animal products from slaughterhouses to feed my pet animal but I am still vegan because I don't consume the animal products!*\n\n*My cat is a carnivore and I love my cat. I will gladly kill innocent lambs and piglets every year to feed my cat and keep her happy. I'm still vegan!!*\n\n*My dog is so friendly and loves me so much. But she hates the plant-based foods. So it pains me to purchase animal products from slaughterhouses that violently kill innocent animals. But I consider myself to be a vegan!!*\n\n*My senior dog requires a medical prescription of 100 bloody goat carcasses every year to survive. I am okay with beheading 100 goats every year to keep my dog alive and I'm still think I'm vegan!*\n\n*I never allow any animal products to be brought into my house by anyone because my house is a vegan house. I make an exception for myself when I purchase animal products and bring it into my house to feed my cat.*\n\n**Class 3: WhatAboutIsts**\n\nThis class comprises of apologist vegans who use whataboutism to defend the above two classes even if they themselves do not believe that the two classes are vegan.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16671148860085339,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20917039020784547,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18433470950202643,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04586460680393878,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38915962403739524,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26087398275951135,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.14396069114710375,"diet_1":-0.2475724530994133,"diet_2":-0.18400220393100564,"diet_3":-0.06725975736714342,"diet_4":-0.14402878248559622,"diet_5":-0.06602395444437034,"diet_6":-0.21072814844713625,"diet_8":-0.04900668553940098,"diet_9":-0.0799896312916341,"diet_10":-0.03272213890813873,"diet_11":-0.22210089494015506,"diet_13":-0.10619582133210986,"diet_14":-0.060940212200738884,"diet_17":-0.05689095946397174,"1.1.1_stance_lack_recheck":-0.08692401747248368},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
