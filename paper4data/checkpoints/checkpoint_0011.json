A Honda Civic is 179 inches long and weighs 2,750 pounds, but gets 28 MPG city and 36 MPG highway. The Volt's gasoline fuel economy is *significantly* better, especially given that it weighs 38% more than a Civic. It sounds like we agree that the Volt's hybrid architecture might be responsible for that. I'd have to disagree with you about the Prius being the appropriate comparison to the Volt's gas-only fuel economy, but not all that strongly given that (except for the plug-in model) the Prius ultimately derives all of its power from gasoline.\n\nAs for total ownership costs, the Volt is currently much more expensive than equivalent ICE vehicles, at least if you buy it rather than lease it. That Honda Civic has a \"true value\" of $18,500 on Edmunds, compared to $33,500 for a Volt. A lot of people subtract the $7,500 federal tax credit from the prices of all EVs. But the reality is more complicated, because it's a *credit* and not a *refund*, and a lot of people wind up not getting all $7,500. \n\nBut even if you did get the whole credit back, the Volt's net price would be $26,000 vs. $18,500 for the Civic. That's $7,500. The article's author saved $1,100 in a year of Volt driving. But he drove 21,000 miles, compared to the average vehicle being driven 13,000 miles. Reset the author's savings to the averages, and it's a savings of about $680 a year. That's an 11-year payback. At which point the battery will need to be replaced ...\n\nAny fuel savings on a Volt needs to be offset by the battery replacement cost, which either the owner will pay directly if they hang onto the car, or indirectly if they sell it. There is the lease issue, because a lot of EVs are carrying heavy lease subsidies, *especially* when you consider the battery replacement issue. It's hard, and in fact well-nigh impossible, to untangle these factors with any precision, but I think it's safe to say that a Volt is still going to be more expensive to own than the equivalent ICE car.\n\nI think this is true of just about every EV. Oddly enough, it's not true with the EV that I bought a year ago, but that was a special case. I snagged a Think City (a product of Ford's spun-off EV unit from the 1990s) out of a Chapter 11 fire sale. Paid $16,000 -- the sticker was $36,000 -- and my tax situation made me eligible for the whole credit, so my net cost was $8,500. But there were only a couple dozen people who got that deal, so I'd never parade it as anything but my good luck. One other general statement I'd make is that, if I were going to acquire an EV apart from that sweetheart deal I found, I'd almost certainly lease one for the reasons I mentioned above.\n\nIn any case, when it comes to cost comparisons, I insist on separating operating costs from everything else, because unlike trying to untangle lease subsidies and tax credits, operating costs can be nailed to the cross. To me, operating costs include fuel, battery replacement (generally 5 cents a mile for a 24 kW battery), the 1-cent per mile savings from the lack of oil changes, tranny work, and exhaust work (on pure EVs), and any use tax/gas tax differentials. (Battery replacement could be argued either way, but I'd include it as an operating cost and then take note that the lease subsidy has offset it. Others might consider that too arcane an approach, and I wouldn't blame them. Another way to skin the cat would be fuel-to-fuel, plus any state use taxes imposed on EVs.)\n\nI've done those numbers for my car, and they work out to a savings of 14% (12 cents a mile for the EV vs. 14 cents a mile for the equivalent gas car -- and since I own my EV, I think it's appropriate for me to include battery replacement cost, and avoided tranny and exhaust maintenance, and avoided oil changes). In comparing operating costs, I insist on an apples-to-apples comparison. I'm not going to compare my Think City to my Ram pickup truck. I'm going to compare it to a Scion iQ, which is the same size and weight. In the case of a dual-fuel Volt, you can compare the Volt to itself.\n\nBack to the \"cooking\" issue. To say that numbers were \"cooked\" implies an intent to cook them, or a blind eye to obvious facts. I do think many EV owners turn a blind eye to the facts, but whether those facts are \"obvious\" is another issue. That I've had to take this many words to lay out the facts would suggest that they're not as obvious to everyone else as they are to me, now that I've studied them so closely. So, it would be better if I say that many EV owners have a mistaken belief in exaggerated savings.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005291043635224923,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12596468209662817,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17610319927741822,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13185716979205608,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3056576528243485,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2027603952748987,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2640473141800612,"ev_1":-0.1733937868684391,"ev_2":-0.29458602845802356,"ev_3":-0.22573253653650993,"ev_4":-0.07080401952650088,"ev_5":-0.07604370849003317,"ev_6":-0.19602414915837513},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

But I'll cover some major position stocks I've had over the years outside of 401(k) and IRA holdings.  Most of my non-401(k) investment dollars are in renewable energy, save an S&amp;P index fund which is my only exposure to crappy companies I hate, but I have that as a hedge against the big positions I take.\n\nOnce upon a time I bought a bunch of Ballard and Plug shares.  That was back in about 2001, when I thought hydrogen fuel cells were going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I lost a lot of money back then.  Totally sucked.\n\nSince that time, though, I bought a ton of APPL at $83 long before the split, in circa 2006 when the market was crashing and everything was going nuts.  Sold it all at $450 or thereabouts.  That was a huge payday.  Some might say I'm dumb, because I sold before the split and dividend, and I'd have even more money if I'd held a position in it.  But I sold my shares when I started to fall out of love with their products.  (See, I base all my principal investment decisions on principles.)  I moved a lot of that money mostly to Toyota about the time their stock fell due to the \"runaway accelerator\" problem.  I had a Toyota Prius at the time, had experienced the runaway accelerator phenomenon, and knew it was no different than other cars with anti-lock brakes.\n  \nI sold Toyota when I found out the new crop of Lexus hybrids (like the RC) weren't going to come in plug-in versions and right about the time the Camry got down graded by Consumer Reports.  It's gone up a lot since then, but I don't care.  When I sold my Prius and went all electric, there was no room left for Toyota.  (It's funny, because I actually have a position in Ford which I really shouldn't because I only drive electric cars, but go figure.)  \n\nNow much of that money that grew 540% in APPL and another 150% or so in Toyota is mostly in TSLA, where it will stay whether the stock goes up to $290 again, or falls to $100 again, at least until someone makes a car I'd rather buy than another Tesla.\n\nI'll be surprised if I don't realize another 500+% return on TSLA, like I did with APPL.\n\nI think that there's going to be enough people who will understand the implications of the stationary storage announcement that will be made on April 30th that I don't really see the stock ever dipping below $200 again.  Unless the Model X winds up being a heap of poop, in which case TSLA will be in big trouble.\n\nReally, the threat of an earthquake on the Hayward fault is the only danger of TSLA having problems in the next few years that really matters.\n\nMy best guess is that the commercial storage opportunities for the batteries may actually be a bigger revenue stream than the cars, in the very near future.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.15060231918996522,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24390795255248085,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2260138098107083,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24363982123874497,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16607817207573225,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24458763174224907,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08636150819559892,"ev_1":-0.20288746918553993,"ev_2":-0.1820519509223383,"ev_3":-0.15229725835767263,"ev_4":-0.13384828192647547,"ev_5":-0.268184428413709,"ev_6":-0.19919615782176456},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Alarmism of any sort tends to produce short-sighted policy. Elected officials will often choose a bandaid to shut up a vocal group rather than implement a reasoned, long-term solution. Our history of policy choices reflects this.\n\n&gt;Yes, they rule out the extremely dangerous ones, but the others ones are still pretty gosh darn dangerous.\n\nI guess it's all a matter of perspective. I happen to think that the remaining scenarios may indeed be dangerous, but we have other dangers that deserve at least as much attention.\n\n&gt;So by that paper, the 2.6° value that you showed in the other paper you linked would put sea level rise by the end of the 21st century at least over 1m, likely closer to 1.5m.\n\nNot quite. That value is for ECS, not TCR. It will take decades, perhaps centuries, to reach the \"equilibrium\" in ECS. TCR is the relevant metric in the time frame that includes the year 2100. Thus, SLR of more than 1 meter is highly unlikely by 2100.\n\n&gt;As this paper pointed out, the exposed assets due to this level of rise is in the tens of trillions of dollars.\n\nAs noted above, it will be well after 2100 before many of those assets are at risk. How many of those tens of $trillions in assets will be worth that much that far in the future? Simple adaptation by not building below a given elevation would be sufficient to protect the majority of viable assets.\n\nThat's actually a good segue into something we haven't yet discussed: mitigation by other means and adaptation. We have many possible ways to reduce warming aside from focusing on emissions. We have many more ways to adapt to anticipated changes. So it's a little disingenuous for some people (I'm not necessarily counting you in this) to suggest that we must limit emissions to protect assets. \n\n&gt;This report from the Met Office also goes into great deal about the impact of these kinds of temperature increases on crop yields.\n\nYes, I've seen it. It naively assumes that crops will remain in the same zones they are currently grown in. In fact, northern lands become arable under warming scenarios and we handle yields by planting crops in the right places according to their requirements.\n\n&gt;The Stern Review goes into extreme depth on potential economic damage as a result of AGW.\n\nThe Stern Review, too, was deeply flawed. Read Richard Tol and others on its inappropriate use of discount rates (among its other flaws).\n\nLet me interject something here. You are throwing some old news at me. I hope you don't think I haven't been down these paths many times. I have. A flawed 11 year old report just isn't compelling, especially since it was never updated to correct its problems. This is further compounded by the fact that TCR and ECS have been revised downwards since its publication, meaning that its impacts are necessarily overstated.\n\n&gt;Even if all these values are based on higher temperature estimates, it simply moves the dates back when they would occur.\n\nNope. More time before impact means more time for mitigation and adaptation, not to mention the further diminishing net present value that more time produces.\n\n&gt;I am not, but much of that policy has little to do with climate change. \n\nHow do you arrive at the conclusion that all the solar/wind subsidies and boondoggles, all the EV tax credits, all of the ethanol mandates, etc., etc. have little to do with climate change?\n\n&gt;No I wasn't. I was merely asking if you had. Sorry for the confusion. It is hard to express tone through text.\n\nFair enough.\n\n&gt;Yes, but simple regulations could solve that problem with relative ease.\n\nHow likely is China to enact regulations? How much will regulations impact pricing of end product?\n\n&gt;Nuclear is on the very bottom along with wind and solar...\n\nCorrect. In fact, if memory serves, wind are solar are still an order of magnitude higher than nuclear. I'm happy to be corrected on this. So we have zero carbon nuclear, the safest power source in terms of power actually produced, and the one that isn't intermittent, being entirely neglected by policy favored by those who claim to care the most. (This is one of those things that makes thinking people suspicious of ENGOs in the first place, not to mention the officials they help elect.)\n\n&gt;I have. Both have a carbon footprint due to the energy costs of manufacturing them, but even if the source of that energy is (let's say) a coal plant, their footprint is still dramatically lower than other sources.\n\nThat depends very much on where you locate them. Solar panels made in China (high coal input) and placed in regions with low insolation (New England, most of Germany), will barely break even in terms of carbon budget, if at all. It's yet another example of bad climate change policy.\n\n&gt;The energy that is put in to make and power them has a carbon footprint, but still lower than standard cars because typical power plants are more efficient than standard cars.\n\nNot quite. The embodied carbon in an EV is about 2/3rds higher than a similar ICE vehicle. It will take a great deal of driving to make up that deficit, even if that car is charged entirely by nuclear or solar power. In regions that rely primarily on coal, they will probably never cover the deficit, despite the higher efficiency, because:\n\n- oil, being a hydrocarbon, releases about half as much carbon per unit of energy compared to coal.\n\n- there are transmission and distribution losses associated with moving electricity around.\n\n- batteries, despite their high efficiency, are not perfectly efficient.\n\nSo here's another example of poor policy. Federal subsidies are the same for buyers in regions dominated by coal power plants as they are for those in areas with lots of nuclear and/or renewables. The net impact on climate of those in coal regions? Practically zero. This is the problem with policy that tries to pick winners. \n\n&gt;If you have a better source that would be nice.\n\nThat one captures the concept just as well as any other. And you are correct, it is countries that allow unchecked particulate emissions that represent the most fatalities. So when we talk about restricted fossil fuels for reasons beyond climate change, we need to note that not all emissions are the same. Emissions from the burning of natural gas, for example, are cleaner than scrubbed coal, and scrubbed coal is cleaner than unscrubbed coal.\n\n&gt;banning coal once other energy sources can take up the reins and eventually just purging them entirely.\n\nSure, once the newer sources become close to price parity. \n\n&gt;Have programs in place to re-train workers in the fossil fuel industries to allow them to continue work.\n\nThat opens a whole conversation on the nature of work and the impact automation will have in coming years. We are likely to see a lot of displacement, and not just in fossil fuels. Probably a better topic for another day.\n\n&gt;Get rid of a ton of the subsidies for car companies...\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n&gt;change them to encourage EV production\n\nMaybe. I still think PRT systems are more efficient overall and should receive at least as much encouragement as EVs.\n\n&gt;and get rid of the weird rules in place that prevent companies like Tesla from even selling cars in some states. \n\nI hesitate here because you are talking about federal regulations trouncing states' ability to self govern. I would say let the courts do their thing first. I also think it's important for citizens in each state to participate in change, not making it all about federal processes.\n\n&gt;At the same time, help car companies to make far more efficient engines during the transition phase.\n\nThis may be unnecessary and maybe even counterproductive. If batteries can come down in price fairly quickly, there isn't much need. If they don't, more efficient combustion engines will actually prolong the transition as the present cost to the consumer for fuel is lower. Again, though, I think PRT systems need a fair shake.\n\n&gt;Encourage programs against deforestation\n\nThese exist in developed nations. In fact, there are more trees in the U.S. today than there were 100 years ago. If you are referring to developing countries, that's a tough sell. Personally, I think the best approach is to encourage economic development in poorer countries so that they will follow all the developed nations in taking better care of their own environments.\n\n&gt;Cows are a decent chunk of US GHG emissions. Encouraging people to not eat beef would also help.\n\nI'll list this one under \"a bridge too far.\" Cows eat things that people can't, and when used in a \"mob grazing\" approach actually help sequester carbon in topsoils. Watch Alan Savory's TED talk for more information on this.\n\n&gt;I just want to make it abundantly clear that the maximum values for temperature and CO2 increases by the end of 2100 you gave do not rule out dangers by any means.\n\nThere are always dangers. The fact is, though, that by ruling out the two most impactful scenarios, we have now put climate change in the same category as many other potential dangers, all of which require resources to mitigate. \n\n&gt;They just push the date back a decade or two.\n\nActually, they remove some dangers entirely. Other are pushed back a decade or two. Others, centuries. The more time inserted between now and when a danger is likely, the more change for mitigation and adaptation, the lesser the present value of the danger, and the more rational our response.\n\n(end part 1)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0024562671897001565,"1.1.1_stance":-0.346560441444608,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.01784620271064341,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.013371555755535761,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23620466840306367,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2711258922645967,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01580014249824065,"ev_1":-0.14014624222971525,"ev_2":-0.14697505856572837,"ev_3":-0.08978905590484593,"ev_4":-0.05897627144367258,"ev_5":-0.09284755680636654,"ev_6":-0.05749255021783265},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I can easily imagine dozens of charging points.\n\nYeah, I think long term that very well may happen, and it'd be great!

Places where people will be happy to take a break.\n\nSo I'm biased by my own trips, but the places where I'm happy to take a break when I'm going through Ohio and other states on my 720-mile annual Christmas trip are (i) as close to the highways as possible and (ii) has a bathroom. Once or twice, (iii) has fast food is a nice bonus, and once or twice I need (iv) gas. I don't *want* to take a break longer than necessary.\n\nFor that trip, Tesla's online trip planner gives 2½ hours of charge time, plus the time to detour *to* the chargers that I mentioned above, with a 100D or LR Model 3; that'd be an increase of around 1:45 relative to what I do in a gas car. A Better Route Planner gives a bit over 1½ hours charge time, and a little under an hour of extra time compared to ICE. Add an hour to any of those numbers for a 75D or SR Model 3. I realize that's a hard case for a BEV and I'm on the extreme end of the curve there, but the shorter range options are just flat out and even the long range one is barely in \"viable\" territory. It only remains there if I can be pretty assured of having little to no charger wait, and getting a full 120 kW charge. \"Viable\" here means \"I would (probably) accept taking a BEV instead of rent an ICE car for the trip.\" Add any significant break to the trip and it becomes an overnight drive, and that puts me easily into \"I'm definitely going to rent an ICE\" territory.

This is while leaving in the renewable energy surcharge which is currently 6.4 cents per kwh and declining.\n\nRoughly 20% (\\~1.2 cents) will go away in 2022, and roughly 40% (\\~2.4 cents) by 2027.\n\nIn addition much of the grid fees are relatively fixed costs, so if people switched to electric vehicles and power consumption went up, grid fees would increase, but by less than the increase in power consumption.\n\nOverall tomorrow germany could lower electricity prices for chargers by \\~20% if they felt like it, and \\~25% by 2022.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-8.260555235513796e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09177049043189527,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.06452969213326772,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.033066686863700546,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.35991067625332107,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22699289325565608,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17492998900221815,"ev_1":-0.00193290216824001,"ev_2":-0.005842179386187733,"ev_3":-0.1662451415953304,"ev_4":-0.00027094355755252764,"ev_5":-0.00015248849619335184,"ev_6":-0.00048619661780927953},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (no possessive reference to a specific group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

They do not account for battery production, or vehicle production at all for gas or electric vehicles.  So if you are going to come up with new numbers you would need to reduce the hybrid mpg as well to account for their production.\n\nAlso if you read the rest of the FAQ section you quoted it goes on to say\n\n&gt; the global warming emissions benefits of driving on electricity far outweigh the emissions costs of vehicle manufacturing; most EVs “pay back” their production emissions within one or two years of driving, a period that will shorten as electricity grids get cleaner.\n\nSo even though EV's tend to have higher production emissions it would seem it's a small amount that can be made up for in a year or two.  You are creating new mpg numbers without any proper calculation, and only accounting for EV production, not hybrid or gas vehicle production, so it's still an incorrect comparison.\n\nAnd yes, the absolute best hybrid is better than some electric cars (but not better than the best electric cars), and more importantly the average electric car is better than the average hybrid, even in West Virginia;  All the data from the link supports this fact but you keep trying to pick specific comparisons to make a hybrid the cleaner choice.\n\nI'm being argumentative because I *don't agree* with what you posted and  we're on a forum which is a very fitting place to be argumentative.

The Renault Zoe recently started using some of the most state of the art battery cells - NCM712 with 265 Wh/kg (just 14 shy of the highest ever put into a freely available product). But after assembling them into a pack, this drops down to only 168 Wh/kg. Which is still a great figure - the Tesla Model 3 gets 8 Wh/kg less, for example.\n\nBut if you can now get LFP at 160-ish Wh/kg? And where NCM is flammable, LFP is not? And it costs less? And it degrades more slowly? It's a no-brainer. It's also why Tesla is switching the Model 3 to LFP in China, where they can get this kind of battery.\n\nAssuming the volumetric density is competitive, so that it doesn't end up running into space problems in the kind of small car I am interested in, I would definitely want to buy a car with cell-to-pack LFP. Unfortunately this development comes now, just after the big manufacturers that finally decided to actively participate in the EV Bonanza at scale (VW, PSA, etc) commited to a full product cycle on NCM, which will probably run until at least 2024.

If you use an Ionity station, you need to start a charging session before inserting the cable into the car.

And since everything is vertically integrated, the car can communicate with the station. Thereby bypassing the need for App or RFID. \n\nWhat the rest of the industry is struggling with, is doing what Tesla does, hence ISO 15118 - specifically plug and charge. \n\nThat's why I believe no automaker wants to use Tesla's proprietary way of communicating, because Tesla too will become ISO 15118 compliant. \n\nAnd since OEMs are yet to implement this ISO standard, there's no distinguishing between cars yet.

The wait time has since grown to around 2 to 3 years. Car companies are having problems meeting demand right now for both ICE and EVs.\n\n&gt;EV sales are not that high compared to ICE cars and EV penetration is only 2% at best. Only 1% in the world.\n\nIn 2021, according to the[IEA there was 6.6 million plugin vehicles sold compared to 66.7 million of all passenger vehicles sold world wide](https://www.iea.org/news/global-electric-car-sales-have-continued-their-strong-growth-in-2022-after-breaking-records-last-year). When we are talking about marketshare of passenger vehicles, EVs have 10% of the market in 2021.\n\nCurrent forecast based on existing sales show that over 10 million plugins will likely be sold with estimates pointing to around [85 million total passenger vehicles in 2022](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-05/global-car-sales-seen-below-pre-pandemic-level-for-fourth-year). That would put would plugin vehicles at just under 12% marketshare for 2022.  \n\n\n&gt;And it seems like all EV manufacturers are still increasing prices on EVs. At the beginning of 2022 Tesla Model 3 LR was $48K.\n\nTesla is a more of a luxury vehicle but looking at other EVs the prices did go up as well. Long term they are set to go down as prices of batteries drop year after year thanks to economies of scale. However, with demand outstripping supply by so much, it's understandable that car companies aren't going to drop their prices in such a market. A lot of dealerships have been adding an extra $2,000 to $10,000 to the MSRP of vehicles for both EVs and ICE just because they can with demand being so high. There needs to be much more supply before car companies start competing on price.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008811324757213393,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12545505087534062,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1638317747295538,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24517024433162055,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06416279418398385,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22616696972698827,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.043879138790847115,"ev_1":-0.08577801438513906,"ev_2":-0.2157797416051229,"ev_3":-0.0031131419576316452,"ev_4":-0.008405509471534364,"ev_5":-0.024225613138696644,"ev_6":-0.033010656142626736},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

In coalition with others, CALSEIA is helping organize rallies and press events in different locations throughout the state. We need bodies at these events! From company presidents to office staff, everyone should come! See details below and RSVP! \nPetition Signatures: Through CALSEIA's network, some grassroots organizers, and our coalition partners, we have set the goal of collecting 100,000 petition signatures in support of NEM. You can help us reach this goal by (let us know you are taking action on this):\nSign the petition yourself, and then forward to your family and friends. Every signature counts. \nAsk your staff or co-workers to sign the petition. \nAsk your customers to sign the petition. \nVIP/Coalition Letters: We need everybody who knows anybody to call everyone they know. What relationships do you have with local elected officials or other local organizations (i.e. chambers, churches, etc.)? Call them now and urge them to use their influence. If they have a personal relationship with a CPUC Commissioner, they should call them directly. If they don't, ask them to send a letter to the CPUC, or pass a resolution in support of strong NEM. The key is to get influential people throughout the state joining us in calling for protecting NEM.

Carbon taxes, building codes, efficiency standards, cap-and-trade systems, subsidies for newly developed industries, feed-in-tariffs, ending subsidies for fossil fuels, etc. are all things that you can push for.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3006185988583259,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3540032711570391,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16664850144394072,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1758051641906301,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28728302008010526,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19369732634842443,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.001219299650983885,"solar_1":-0.0011658170745552827,"solar_2":-0.19722826755911863,"solar_3":-0.0004535824021634956,"solar_4":-0.00041282150292924297,"solar_5":-0.00045606298954226077,"solar_6":-0.00014132169114115337,"solar_7":-0.0002888368908315897,"solar_8":-0.0002945304683332021,"solar_9":-0.0006491776439361274,"solar_10":-0.0022549753994098864},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (implicitly expresses a desire for more solar options and policies)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

We will have to find a different type of fuel or a different way to power our assets. This is not just another cost-cutting exercise. It’s far from that. It’s an existential exercise, where we as a company need to set ourselves apart,” Soren Toft, Maersk’s chief operating officer, told the Financial Times. \n\n&gt;Maersk’s target, although distant, is one of the most ambitious from a global industrial group promising to end carbon emissions altogether. Container ships carry about 80 per cent of global trade and currently use bunker fuel, a residue from crude oil that is cheaper but dirtier than petrol and diesel, which means they contribute about 3 per cent of the world’s emissions. \n\n&gt;Maersk is not pushing one technology — ideas such as biofuels, hydrogen, electricity or even wind or solar power have been mooted — but is stressing the urgency as most vessels have a life of 20-25 years, meaning that viable solutions need to be found soon.\n\n&gt;“To reach the target by 2050, in the next 10 years we need some big breakthroughs,” Mr Toft said. \n\n&gt;One challenge will be that container ships often need to travel several thousand kilometres at a stretch, appearing to rule out solutions open to other types of transport such as electric cars and lorries. \n\n&gt;Maersk currently emits about 36m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in greenhouse gases, with container ships accounting for about 98 per cent of the group total. Mr Toft said the company had been able to keep emissions stable for a decade despite significant growth, meaning that on a per container basis carbon emissions had fallen by 46 per cent since 2007. \n\n&gt;Container shipping has long been in the sights of environmentalists due to the dirty nature of bunker fuel but the industry has often resisted more radical change, arguing it could disrupt global trade or make it more expensive. Regulations coming in 2020 will cut the high levels of sulphur in bunker fuel and the International Maritime Organization, the UN regulator, has agreed that emissions should be cut in half by 2050 but Mr Toft and others argue that more is needed. \n\n&gt;“We’ve been able to absorb the last 10 years’ growth without adding to CO2 emissions. It’s a good starting point but it’s not enough . . . Not just governments and countries, but also companies and industries need to make a change. The maritime industry and Maersk need to take their responsibility,” he added. \n\n&gt;Maersk is aiming to meet its target without buying carbon offsets. “If you buy offsets, you are basically delaying the pain. What you are doing is buying yourself an excuse and hoping that the money you pay goes to good uses, but you are not tackling the issue at its core,” Mr Toft said.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008742122784800207,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29826766389853054,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1468640398234129,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1359261374385733,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24212914248427195,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2075680326242576,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2834685620650698,"solar_1":-0.00937739808493158,"solar_2":-0.2661495521650338,"solar_3":-0.06405782198938444,"solar_4":-0.016765573348190326,"solar_5":-0.003329123904525962,"solar_6":-0.0010367637132731033,"solar_7":-0.0007553228848943642,"solar_8":-0.004885672526143026,"solar_9":-0.08943518849264365,"solar_10":-0.01795720799418632,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.15563950466603274},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neutral/mixed.

The switch there is just a manual one for when I am off shore. \n\n\nThere are some inverters that can do it all but the real gain of the charge controller is it can do MPPT charging off the solar panels.

If you’re in California and on the fence on solar, you need to get a system installed ASAP or else the economics and logic around solar get even worse next year.\n\nThe utilities here have long argued that Solar kills their profits.  Also, since Solar is primarily purchased by wealthier households, they argue that solar disproportionately shifts the burden of subsidizing low income housing and disadvantaged folks onto the utility.  The utilities really hate having all this residential equipment that isn’t helping pay for their overall infrastructure.\n\nSo what the utilities want the state to do is make it so the energy you generate and send back to the grid is worth much less than the energy you take from the grid as the sun sets.

You save money, great for the environment, anything helps.  \n\nHowever, I would advocate for a larger system, one that hits your 24-30 kwh/day average.  \n\nFirst, there's the tax credits to think about. If you install by the end of next year, the federal government helps considerably.  Second, economies of scale. A 8 kw system won't cost you nearly double that of a 4 kw system. A lot of costs (design, permits, labor) are essentially fixed, so doing a partial system now and a partial system later could cost you more overall.\n\nI've been doing this long enough to see many people add on to their systems, and it's often a hassle. Utilities change requirements, matching equipment isn't always available, and installers go out of business fairly frequently.  What's your time worth to deal with this once vs redoing all the same steps a few years from now?\n\nWith your situation, you can likely do some things to increase your direct-from-solar portion of your usage. Running the dishwasher, doing laundry, and starting your AC during daylight hours can help shift your load. \n\nWith an 8 cent buyback differnce, I probably wouldn't do a battery just yet unless your goal is more environmental than saving money. \n\nWhen it comes to SunPower, yes they are expensive.  They are also the best panels you can get with the best warranty, hands down.  That being said, I would only do their DC panels since they've screwed up several tries at AC panels with build in micro-inverters.

If you're working from home or have someone at home that's using AC in the summer during peak production, it may still have a lot of value at a smaller system size. Just may not be enough value. We're not planning to move for 20+ years, so it will still be a value overall.

When something on the grid goes wrong (called a fault), the system feeds into it.  The inertia of 1000's of connected synchronous generators keeps the system together until the automatic control systems can jump in and adjust operating conditions. Wind, Solar and Battery (called Inverter Based Resources or IBR), simply do not have the inertia, or mass.  As well, these devices can only contribute 10-30% 'more' when called upon, assuming there is more sun or wind or battery to contribute.  Proponents of IBR will claim their devices can react quicker, however there are no current markets for these services and none of this means anything if there is no wind and a cloudy day, such as a few weeks ago and the Canadian wildfires.   \n\n\\#2 -  IBR's do not behave like conventional synchronous generators found in coal, nuclear, gas and hydro.  These machines have very well defined operating characteristics.  The protection systems used to very quickly isolate faults from the system in order to maintain stability are designed to operate on a system that is based on synchronous machines.  IBR's are unable to produce these same operating characteristics, thus the protection systems may not be able to see all types of faults in multiple operating scenarios.  Faults that are not promptly cleared from the system can cause instability and lead to blackouts.  \n\nThe problem has become so bad that the governing authority for North America (NERC) has put out multiple strongly worded reports on the dangers of continuing in this direction without a number of changes.\n\nThe grid operates on a delicate balance of supply and demand- instantaneously.  IBR's are intermittent and can quickly go from 100% output to something much less.  Obviously no sun = no solar and no wind = no wind generation.  IBR proponents will point to battery storage.  The sheer amount of battery storage required is not economically justifiable.  Lithium batteries are also subject to thermal runaway which causes fires that cannot be effectively extinguished.   \n\nOur grid now teeters on the limits of stability.  When stability is lost, large scale blackouts can occur.  It can take days to weeks for a grid to fully recover from a complete blackout.  \n\nIf you feel like digging into it, here is a NERC report about problems in Texas last year.  There are about 10 such reports from other areas of the country.  \n\n[https://www.nerc.com/comm/RSTC\\_Reliability\\_Guidelines/NERC\\_2022\\_Odessa\\_Disturbance\\_Report%20(1).pdf](https://www.nerc.com/comm/RSTC_Reliability_Guidelines/NERC_2022_Odessa_Disturbance_Report%20(1).pdf)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004169323025659348,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2988463747315109,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2738706221183141,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30170675206399006,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20097828177430138,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.035111168787504234,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23873410044082752,"solar_1":-0.017524782107405674,"solar_2":-0.05397272591411214,"solar_3":-0.10906364086198557,"solar_4":-0.02059849336971335,"solar_5":-0.01743053335424823,"solar_6":-0.008626896754625099,"solar_7":-0.004172798903406753,"solar_8":-0.005366076291466015,"solar_9":-0.03957106795200005,"solar_10":-0.22660713880264222,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.13423664080134282},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

However, my concern lies with the approach some sales representatives take.  \nMany of us are familiar with aggressive sales strategies, reminiscent of scenes from \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" Unfortunately, this isn't far from what I've experienced with a majority of door-to-door solar salespeople. Their primary focus seems to be on closing deals and earning commissions, rather than genuinely helping customers find the best solar solutions for their needs.  \nIt's also worth noting the unsettling trend of solar companies vanishing after just a few years in business. This is particularly troubling given that realizing the full value of solar panels—a process that can take 10 to 20 years—depends on the longevity and reliability of the provider.  \nThe internet is awash with stories of customers, especially the elderly and uninformed, who have been misled or outright exploited by such companies. This is a red flag for anyone considering solar energy solutions.  \nMy advice? Take the initiative to conduct thorough research. Explore different options, compare reviews, and seek out reputable companies that demonstrate a commitment to their customers and products over the long haul.

If you have a single cell failure on a modular battery you can get a similar capacity battery and swap a module.\n\nI don't know about the bolt battery, but I rewired a volt battery for my solar array and that can be repaired too.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007574040694938352,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1117744407686511,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.05401001137858847,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17218421609868528,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16553272161669005,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19403687313766416,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.004194905981421471,"solar_1":-0.1843238674892285,"solar_2":-0.18509578324543932,"solar_3":-0.17664879433142586,"solar_4":-0.09668454998586264,"solar_5":-0.002005012015918813,"solar_6":-0.04482052690946148,"solar_7":-0.16678695960721512,"solar_8":-0.19089656958385604,"solar_9":-0.04468869703373457,"solar_10":-0.10324513227654582},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (for modular batteries)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present (observed group behavior: \"I rewired a volt battery for my solar array\")","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (the author is discussing manufacturers and batteries in general, not referring to a specific personal group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

So the scientific literature is clearly in favor of moderately drinking alcohol for health benefits (obviously binge drinking will still be detrimental). Incidentally, similar results are found in caffeine consumption (coffee and tea).

I used to be hardline anti-consumption (this was before I was vegan, actually), but eventually I realized that I was just being a tightwad and that, despite the fact that I thought that I somehow knew that drugs were objectively bad, I didn't actually ever have any good reason to think that.

What I do want to address is how we can regulate our identities as vegans in a way that preserves feelings of camaraderie with our fellow human beings as well as empower us to grow and better ourselves as responsible citizens and stewards of this world.'\n\nI like this. But I always end up with this dilemma:\nI have an omni friend/person with me. They ask a question, sometimes out of profound interest, sometimes with \"meh\" amount of interest.\n\nQuestions lead to arguments. Arguments lead me to try my best to counter them. In the end, the vegan stereotype is fulfilled. Maybe its my mistake, maybe its not.\n\nSo I wonder - is it better than creating slight amount of awareness BUT solidify the arrogant vegan stereotype or be the most respecting vegan ever and create almost close to 0 awareness. We all think here that veganism is the best thing to do for almost anyone anywhere.

The benefits to society, economies, and the environment are numerous and far outweigh the cost. We need international cooperation to urgently reduce methane emissions as much as possible this decade” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP.\n\n>The need for action is urgent. Human-caused methane emissions are increasing faster than any time since record keeping began in the 1980s. Despite a COVID-19 induced economic slowdown in 2020 that prevented another record year for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the amount of methane in the atmosphere shot up to record levels according to data recently released by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA ).\n\n>This is a concern because methane is a an extremely powerful greenhouse gas, responsible for about 30 per cent of warming since pre-industrial times. The good news is that unlike CO2 which stays in the atmosphere for 100s of years, methane starts breaking down quickly, with most of it gone after a decade. This means cutting methane emissions now can rapidly reduce the rate of warming in the near-term.\n\n>The report notes that most human-caused methane emissions come from three sectors: fossil fuels, waste, and agriculture. In the fossil fuel sector, oil and gas extraction, processing, and distribution account for 23 per cent, and coal mining accounts for 12 per cent of emissions. In the waste sector, landfills and wastewater make up about 20 per cent of emissions. In the agricultural sector, livestock emissions from manure and enteric fermentation represent roughly 32 per cent, and rice cultivation 8 per cent of emissions.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.037216813613781596,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2040535304778146,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2783334107919,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06544419645797461,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13719442974550589,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16182866256863465,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04847831599181518,"diet_1":-0.30833930237495866,"diet_2":-0.031122617505995247,"diet_3":-0.09512395289632297,"diet_4":-0.006369669539708411,"diet_5":-0.11898653784010094,"diet_6":-0.06857683058236337,"diet_8":-0.0022903223580215126,"diet_9":-0.002979476448672358,"diet_10":-0.010609029760720054,"diet_11":-0.032563268895804263,"diet_13":-0.015755022992379963,"diet_14":-0.0788865188175502,"diet_17":-0.00632817604249188},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (in favor of reducing methane emissions, specifically from agriculture, but expressing disappointment about the focus on crop yields instead of considering veganism or vegetarianism as a solution)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present (contains statistics: 'roughly 32%' and 'represent')","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other: (The text does not contain any possessive indicators showing a personal relationship with the author's coworkers, family, friends, local community, neighbors, online community, other Reddit user, or partner/spouse.)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.
