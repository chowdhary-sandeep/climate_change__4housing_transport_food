This is what GM would be producing if they were serious about EVs.",

"comment": "This question is probably specific to Southern California. I'm leaning towards leasing panels from SolarCity. I have Southern California Edison (SCE). I'm on the Home &amp; Electric Vehicle Plan (TOU-D-TEV) plan. My understanding is that you sell back to SCE based on the rate at the time you have produce surplus electricity. However, I am having trouble finding the exact rates at which they buy the electricity back.\n\nFor example, during on-peak when I am likely to have a surplus, do they buy the electricity at the tier 1 rate? Do they buy it at the tier 1 rate until you hit the 130% threshold for the month? for the day? And then anything above that, they pay the tier 2 rate? In practice, do you often make it to tier 2? \n\nThey want to install a pretty big system that they project to make 10000 kWh. I use about 17000 kWh a year, but 10000 kWh is during super off peak. So that would be way more than my on peak and even on + off peak needs. Is that OK because I can sell the electricity back to SCE?\n\nThanks for any help!",

So, if you live in Arizona, and the daily temperatures are 100F and higher during the summer, the battery pack will see very high operating temperatures, and degrade much faster than one that never saw those temperatures.\n\nNot having liquid cooling on the battery pack was a cost and weight savings measure.  It was a trade-off, as all design decisions are.",

"comment": "Loans will be at fixed rates. They won't change for your business's poor planning; it's just not how banks and investments typically work.\n\nHowever, government incentives and power purchase agreements can and do allow for various price differences depending on non-weather related factors that could be beneficial. Namely, these changes take place as seasonal rates, peak demand rates, and annually increasing/decreasing incentive rate premiums. \n\nSeasonal rates and peak demand rates are part of PPAs (power purchase agreements). Not all PPAs will include compensation for grid demand. If they do, they'll usually have clear increases in high demand seasons and hours of the day broken down into a schedule.\n\nGovernment incentives usually provide a $/KWH premium on top of the retail rate that decreases/increases over the course of a few years. These can get real creative, so they're all over the place from being beneficial to solar growth to being downright insulting.\n\nAnyway, you say if the big banks got behind us, we could solve climate change quickly? Well, you're right. The only issue is that big banks only back things that are economically viable. Solar is still a bit of a longshot -- who knows if those Chinese-made Kyocera panels are *really* going to be covered by their warranty for 25 years? Who knows if they'll still provide that output? If solar spreads quickly and continues to get cheaper, will electricity rates go down so much that older installations are no longer viable versus newer installations?\n\nThere are lots of risks. We're getting closer technology-wise to reduce those risks. The tremendous growth in the solar industry backs this up, but it's still difficult to make the numbers work. Probably the biggest boost in growth has come from government incentives like tax credits to reduce the financial risk. In fact, the boost has been so big that there are huge waiting lists just to get a slice of that pie.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, business plans have to make sense to banks. The numbers have to make sense. Variances should be accounted for clearly in writing before you hit the bank. Risks need to be addressed, and finally you have to get in line with thousands of others that have already been down this road. It isn't easy to be a \"solar farmer\" by any stretch of the imagination, but it is doable.",

The latter bit is a [selling point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oOVqUInA6w), and it's likely that you'll basically [never need to even plug in](https://pluglesspower.com/) so you'll never have to worry about forgetting to charge.\n\nThe only question in my mind is how likely it will be that manufacturers will make 900+ mile BEVs",

"comment": "While I agree with your statements, you should also consider the impact coal has on our electric rate structures, which force solar into a subsidy market to begin with.\n\nLikewise, coal immensely benefits from public funding of the electric grid itself. If the public didn't fund the electric grid at all, everyone would be installing solar on their roofs as it would be an extremely cost-effective option for power generationon on micro-grids.\n\nCoal has been necessary for our overall quality of life to date, but the resulting infrastructure greatly benefits coal today. Similarly, USSR natural gas infrastructure largely benefits Russian nat gas today. If you're in Russia, you could claim a renewable energy subsidy is not cost-effective compared to buying Russian natural gas, but that's largely because of the public money previously invested in those pipelines. \n\nThose infrastrucutre numbers never make it into subsidy analysis, but they're easy to calculate at a very high level.Take the cost of grid build out and multiply by the % of energy portfolio standard of the technologies which use that infrastrucutre. In this manner, coal has a tremendous fiscal advantage over solar, which is compounded when you also factor in the political advantages the established power generation technologies have at the public utility commission level regarding electric rate structure.\n\nI think those historical advantages provide coal an immensely uneven benefit, more so than what the solar tax credits counter balance. If we hacked down all the power lines and eliminated all energy subsidies, we'd rapidly convert to solar. While that might seem unrealistic, there was more distributed wind as a proportion of all electric power generation in rural areas before the Rural Electrification Act of 1935 vs. after. The build out of the electric grid itself promotes fossil fuel consumption over distributed renewable generation.\n\nCoal got off the ground as an energy technology in part because of a tax on alcohol in the 1850s. It's not \"bad\" to use subsidies to drive superior energy technologies to market. In fact, it's necessary to overcome the infrastructure advantages of inferior pre-existing  energy technologies.",

They've done several costly revisions on the pack design and assembly plant that produces them, and only assemble 2-3 dozen packs a day. That's not high enough volume to see much cost savings from suppliers.\n\nThe only way the battery's going to get cheaper is if they get a sweetheart deal from LG Chem like GM did. Nissan's other half, Renault, already works with them on a few EVs. Maybe they'll make the next-gen Leaf packs instead of buying cells from AESC, which Nissan is trying to sell its stake in.",

Even if we discard the loaded headline he admits that in most places EV is already cleaner than gasoline.\n\nOne mistake I see many people make is they measure coal as a percentage of grid power which is disingenuous because it ignores that local solar installs wouldn't count as a source of grid power and are difficult to measure in that statistic.\n\nNext Coal in the US makes up under 30% of the grid power but he instead provided the statistic of coal power for the entire worlds electricity because the developing world uses more of it moving that figure to 40%.\n\nThe problem with that is EV's are also less common in those countries that tend to rely more heavily on coal. It's a subtle but important sleight of hand. \n\nAdditionally for an EV purchased today it would also be disingenuous to estimate the amount of coal it will use to charge based on grid power statistics from last year. In order to measure that accurately you would have to make projections on what percentage of grid power will be coal based over the next 5 or 10 yhears and use that figure instead.\n\nAgain, another subtle but important sleight of hand you see constantly perpetuated by people perpetuating the \"coal burner\" myth.\n\nIn places like California where EV's are among the most common they produced only 6.4% of electricity from coal in 2014. One of the coal plants was retired in October of 2014 meaning that percentage is likely even lower for 2015 and will be very low by the time people are charging EVs purchased today in 2020.\n\nThe article is FUD with a headline designed to allow people with dated views to continue to cling to them.",

BEVs with gasoline-like range such as Teslas have their entire floors made of cells so it's the pot calling the kettle black.

It only identifies an issue with people dismissing ideas without considering them. This is not the case here.\n\n\"Bearing children causes harm\" - And this is where the first problem appears with this theory which completely nullifies it.\n\nI'll adress just **one aspect**, there are plenty of papers on this and if we want to get philosophical, noone can judge the value of a person as their existence cannot be valued. I'm sorry to be blunt, but I'll hold side with our most valued philosophers on this one.\n\nWhile all children may contribute or contribute less to society, the logic is completely flawed. Your choice to not have children might result in Einstein or Nicola Tesla not being born, Elon Musk not existing, Martin Luther King not giving his speech or Al Gore not bringing much needed light on Global Warming etc. One day, someone might be born who cures cancer or saves us all from global warming, or at least, is that missing piece of the puzzle that makes it a reality.\n\nAre you willing to risk sacrificing a possible savior, a major contributor, progress of man kind, to reduce the environmental impact of children, what is worth more, what are the risks? Or how about only children who are less likely to make a contribution, like poor people? How about you influence someone to not have a child which ultimately reduce earth into a lifeless planet, because he was the key to save us from an astroid, and we wouldn't find out about it because this person wouldn't be born until year 3000. Extraordinary people who can reach the masses might perhaps might be a factor to consider?\n\nIf you take action and make a mistake, you gain knowledge out of the failure. If you choose to do nothing, if you reduce your options, less knowledge is obtained. More brains = more knowledge, we may not work well together but we are a global civilization which benefit and suffer together. Our civilization will evolve faster the more people we have. But! Perhaps we wouldn't have electricity today if we had a lower population hundreds of years ago. And even if we wouldn't, would that be a bad thing? Are you the judge? What are we aiming for here?\n\n**TLDR;** A mans ability to contribute to the world cannot be judged solely by their CO2 emissions. Should such a flawed theory be taken seriously when you decide if you want to bring life into this world?\n\nHell no.",

On the top of my head the 2 reasons why Tesla went the \"plenty of small cylindrical cells\" way instead of a few huge cells are :\n\n* cooling which allows better performance (charging and delivering power) and durability (cells working at a controlled temperature have a longer lifespan).\n* security, by physically separating cells with coolant and control units they can isolate failures. Even catastrophic failure of one cell can be contained long enough to make the difference between an explosion and a slow burn.",

"comment": "I’m glad you bring up the average total rate. PGE have two different metrics they like to use to show their rates favorably over time. \n\nThe first is had by blending all the tiers together into an average rate. This tracks favorably over time because they used to have four tiers and now have three. Even though the third tier is astronomical, it is blended down by the current 21c and 28c tiers 1 and 2. This method is further faulty because it ignores the continued reduction of baseline allowances, which enable you to buy your first xxx amount of power at the tier 1 rate. That number keeps being reduced, thereby neutering the value of this metric. \n\nThe second, and I think the one you are referencing, is had by simply taking the average rate paid per kWh each year. This could be even more flawed for a few reasons. \n1. Residential rates climb faster than commercial, and baselines have shrunk for resi faster than for commercial. \n2. This blended cost of power also includes CARE customers, and people with baseline exceptions (e.g., all electric heat). These numbers skew in PGE’s favor. \n3. Solar customers who still have a net consumption artificially pull this number down. Typically these customers are buying power from the cheapest kWh pools, as they tend to make plenty of power during peak times. \n4. Non-by-passable customer charges are higher now than ever, and should be considered as part of the cost of energy. PGE is finding creative ways to hide their profits outside of the consumption profile, and accounting for that in metrics like these is only fair. \n\nYour house sounds like a solid candidate for solar. There’s never been a better time to buy. Good luck!",

This will be achieved by increasing the number of dedicated HEV, PHEV, BEV, and FCEV models and by generalizing the availability of HEV, PHEV and/or BEV options to all its models.\n\nAs a result, **the number of models developed without an electrified version will be zero**.\n\n**Toyota will accelerate the popularization of BEVs with more than 10 BEV models to be available worldwide by the early 2020s, starting in China**, before entering other markets―the gradual introduction to Japan, India, United States and Europe is expected.\n\nThe FCEV line-up will be expanded for both passenger and commercial vehicles in the 2020s.\n\nThe HEV line-up will also grow, thanks to the further development of the Toyota Hybrid System II (featured in the current-generation Prius and other models); the introduction of a more powerful version in some models; and the development of simpler hybrid systems in select models, as appropriate, to meet various customer needs.\n\n\nToyota also aims to expand its PHEV line-up in the 2020s.",

Tesla switched to PM motors because the rare earth stuff is cheap, if it turns out the rare earth stuff is expensive they'll just use induction. If the rare earth stuff becomes expensive they'll just switch to induction motors. It's not going to make EVs impossible and it's not the end of EVs.",

People have trouble seeing what is in their best interests not to see.     \n\nPlus, making awesome EVs and making ad copy for them would directly attack their cash cows, the pickups and SUVs.    They're fine with the EV-defined-as-econobox, limited in appeal to the \"eco-minded\" budget shopper who is content with the Leaf or Prius.    That's a manageable market segment that gives them some green cred and also provides \"proof\" that the EV market is just only so big.    They couldn't make or advertise the Model 3 in volume, because it screws up the whole structure.    \n\nI can't wait for what the Model Y is going to do.     I'm eager to see the pickup also (probably moreso), but the \"conventional wisdom\" will no doubt be loudly unanimous in predicting that no one will want it, right up until the demand \"no one saw coming\" shakes up the market.",

I'll look for the link later (as well as the post that was here) but there was a loosely related graph of what gas needs to be versus $/kWh when talking about the value proposition.\n\nIIRC where we're at now gas needs to be under $2.75/gal. US price right now is $2.50/gal, and California is $3.70 (another 'duh' of why there's so many EVs here). Not as simple as just the price of fuel, but pretty much all points are improving.",

"comment": "Update: I got a Clarity EV.\nA week after I put the deposit down, the dealer found out they were getting 2 in. I was about to cancel it and get a Tesla (way more money) or an i3. After thinking about how it still made financial sense for the Clarity, I went through with it and the rest went smoothly. Apparently the several people in front of me on the waitlist backed out or passed. \n\nSo the secret is managing expectations. Put deposits down in a few places if you are looking for a Clarity or other less common model. Unfortunately you likely won't have the ability to test drive.\n\nSmall surprise: the Clarity Electric has a sizable bump in the trunk. This is a little disappointing considering the engine bay is half empty, but has no provision for a frunk. \n\nOtherwise I'm fully enjoying my new car now!",

Not every vehicle needs to be perfectly optimized for storage for a given length. Literally every car would be some variation of a minivan if that were the case.\n\nAs to the charging socket location, this is the same as Tesla, VW, and many others. Nothing wrong with this location. Learn how to back in. This isn't some fundamental design flaw because of CLAR.\n\nVery few care about the center tunnel.

"comment": "&gt;It would be dirt cheap to implement and would be a good solution for large numbers of PHEV commuters. 8 hours on L1 should get most of them a full charge for the ride home, and you could have 4-6 of them in lieu of a single L2 charger. Nobody likes having to go out at lunch to move their car around, so by making it take the full workday to charge you're still getting the same result without relying on people to take turns on the charger..\n\nI've been saying for a while that more plugs pulling less power each is a better solution for workplace parking/charging than having 4-6 plugs that can all pull 7Kw and can charge a Bolt from empty before the end of the day.  Even with a long range BEV, nobody is going to complain about \"only\" being able to gain 40-50 miles of range during the workday (at L1 speeds) or \\~80+ miles at slow L2 speeds.  Especially if it's free like a lot of workplace chargers are.  Even if like you said, it's just a bunch of 120v 3 prong outlets and a bring your own EVSE policy.",

I'm all for swapping out a battery after 300-500,000 miles but by that time the rest of the car probably needs to be swapped too.\n\nHot swapping batteries is purely a workaround for there not being adequate charging infrastructure. Simply putting up a few chargers completely negates the need for hot swapping stations. And charging stations are far cheaper to build and maintain.",

There's quite a bit of hilly terrain (and quite a bit of slopes to match of course though I think it's more coming back than going there). I've used ABRP to do some hypothetical trips in EVs and it seems like unless it's ideal conditions I'd need to make a minimum of 2 20-40 minute charge stops along that route with most EVs except a Tesla long range, which would require 1 15ish minute stop (even in winter)!. In winter, the 2 stop turns into 3 stops and turns it into an 8 hour drive most likely. (In an ICE, The trip is about 4.5 hours no stops).  \n\n\nI can't really justify an EV right now (apartment living...but hopefully in a couple of years I'll own a home...hopefully with a garage). So the decision to purchase an EV probably won't be made till then, but will battery capacity in winter be large enough by then to make it just one (15-20 min) stop for most EVs? I make the trip often enough (and in winter especially) that it's hard to justify the inconvenience unless it's a model I can't afford (Tesla long range).",

They have $7.6 BILLION dollars in NOLs alone which is figured into the income/loss number. They had loss generating activities in the US way longer and at a bigger scale than they ever did internationally. They also scored another $1 billion in R&amp;D credits which will drop their income tax down significantly for the provision for income tax calculation at the bottom of that page. \n\nA example of differences that is pretty simple to explain is depreciation. For foreign assets, you have to use the straight line method which is basically the slowest way to depreciate capital assets. For domestically held assets you can depreciate 100% of most assets in the first year. It’s things like this that make 10-Q/K’s disingenuous when it comes to corporate taxes and news articles love to grab for headlines.",

Because NACS can operate with, effectively, CCS communication protocols over the Tesla plug, it makes adding Tesla support to their pedestals relatively easy and cost-effective.\n\nBecause NACS is, again, working with CCS protocols, it means Tesla have finally been able to offer a practical adapter to their customers.  It also makes it practical for Tesla to deploy the \"Magic Dock\" device at their own Supercharger stations to support CCS-1 cars.\n\nWe should all be very happy that Tesla is making NACS happen.  It should be apparent that CCS Type 1 and Tesla/NACS connectors are going to co-exist for a long time.  The way forward is to make them inter-operate as much as possible, and that's exactly what Tesla have been doing.",

"comment": "\"Critical and rare metals — which include lithium, copper, uranium, gold, and so-called rare earth elements (REEs) — are prized for their electronic and magnetic properties and play a crucial role in the production of modern electronics. They are important for everything from smartphones and batteries to advanced weapons systems. Rare metals are especially vital for renewable energy technologies, such as electric cars and solar panels. For example, a single Tesla vehicle requires about 15 pounds, or a bowling ball’s worth, of lithium, and thin, cheap solar panels need tellurium, one of the rarest elements on Earth.\" From Stanford University.",

I've heard the figure 27% efficiency authoritatively mentioned for real world cars driving on actual roads. under best circumstances. It is more efficient to run a thermal coal plant that makes the electricty to change the EV. The thermal coal plant can eat out 33% efficiency in turning chemical power into electrical power, a regular natural gas plant can achieve 43% and a combined cycle natural gas turbine plant can do almost 60%.\n\nEVs are ultimately cheaper energy wise.",

"comment": "Korean brands have mediocre gas/petrol powertrains, so they shifted away from them early on (a good decision I think) so they gained a lead on EVs. This is something Chinese brands have done with good success as well.\n\nHowever Hyundai-Kia isn't without their faults. My cousin Tucson PHEV had its transmission die on him 3 months in ownership. In Canada, there were 3 separate cases of Hyundai denying warranty claims on HV battery packs, which highly questions why the Koreans might not be upfront on \"making profits\" on EVs when they don't honor their long warranties they love to sell on.\n\nP.S. it wasn't me who downvoted you, and I'm already eating them from either you or similar EV fanboys triggered on this post already.",

"comment": "I agree that replacing the energy system is a change similar in scale to a change to veganism.\n\nHowever, a switch of energy systems accomplishes far more in the long run, even if veganism could do more in the short.  And global warming is all about the long term.\n\nReplacing meat with plants isn't a \"replacement\".  Plants already exist and already can do everything meat can.  It would be like saying \"replacing cars with trains\" or similar.  Meat is a luxury product, it isn't replaced, it is done without.\n\n&gt;I'm not convinced that it's significantly easier to change large corporations than to change a lot of people.\n\nIn order to change corps, you have to pass a law, in order to pass a law, you have to get politicians elected.  In order to do that, you need the support of the people.\n\nGetting everyone to go vegan in today's world is a task that is far harder than inventing green energy, especially while I, and those like me, continue to live.\n\nAnd, I will repeat myself here in saying that global warming is very much a long term problem.  We didn't get here through twenty years of emissions, we got here by two hundred years of emissions, and here isn't very bad either, it's a generation or two down the line where things only start to get really bad.\n\n&gt;Then you discount the actual energy and it's source which is used in the production of crops for feed.\n\nWhich can be replaced by solar power just as cars and coal can be.\n\nAnd crops get there energy from the sun as well, and absorb CO2 while they are at it.\n\nMethane breaks down over 20 years, it isn't going to contribute significantly to global warming.  The real issue with methane is if the stores in the arctic start to boil out.\n\n&gt;but unsupported by the general public\n\nAs is veganism...\n\n&gt;It all boiled down to some sort of ethics from utility \n\nSelfish ethics.  Ethical actions are good for you because they are good for society, and society is designed in a way to be good for you and everyone else in it.  \n\nActions that hurt cows do not hurt society, and do not hurt you, so society has no reason to deem them unethical.\n\nWith lots of added complexity, because there is no such thing as a blanket statement with any ethics related situation.\n\n&gt;In general, ethics emerge from the intrinsic worth of sentient beings.\n\nAgain, I'd like to remind you that if we start using the \"most people agree!\" argument, veganism can be just as discredited.\n\n&gt;something is good because it's good for someone. Something is bad because it's bad for someone.\n\nThe good book is the good book because the good book says it's good.\n\n&gt;The problem is that all arguments for eating meat discounts the animal perspective to some degree.\n\nMy view discounts the views of everyone except for me, and asks the question \"in the absence of all moral systems, of all good and bad, why should one act moral?\"\n\nBecause, in reality, there is no good and bad.  No evil, no bad guys, nothing.  No shining beacons of morality to look up to.  No good books that speak truth.  So you have to ask \"why\", and come up with a cohesive answer, otherwise, all you are doing is saying \"it's good because I have been told so\".  Which is unacceptable to me.",

No matter how I slice it and dice it, it just seems too impractical, it has the energy density for long range travel and quick refueling but it basically has nothing else. Weak performance, expensive cars(although thats because of the current scale), stupid expensive infrastructure, to produce a decent amount of it quickly you need another fuel(natural gas) otherwise you're going to need a lot of  electricity which if you want to produce it with lets say solar you're going to need a lot of solar panels. Whos going to pay for all that?  Everything about these things is expensive. People think BEVs are impractical because they're expensive...  They've come down in price significantly and there's promise the prices of batteries will continue to plummet.",

But it looks like the net metering credit is continuing at decreasing rates over the next 4 years.\n\nIt's a complex topic about true costs of transmission and distribution. One thing is certain, the final $0.026/kWh will be below the true, burdened costs for utility generated power. So the buyer (utility) will be getting a bargain.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if this spawns more creative solutions on both sides - peak management, storage, etc.",

"comment": "Buying batteries to go \"off-grid\" completely or just to have as a backup is a tough question. \n\nThe cheapest option is lead acid batteries (kind of like car batteries but are called deep cycle meaning they last longer) and they take up a lot of room, they require maintenance (depending on type you buy) and you have to watch how they charge and stored. If they are too hot or cold they wont work as well. If you use them to much (discharge) it affects their life and how you charge them affects their life (charge cycles). THEN you have to figure out how many you need to keep your house powered up. No power at night so it has to supply 100% of the power at night and on days with no sun so you have to factor in them lasting at least a couple of days to be sure. Depending on how big your house is and what you want powered will determine how many batteries you will need.\n\nSo the above is general stuff about batteries and if you get a good charge controller and setup them up right at the beginning they should be fine for a few years before you may have to start replacing some. \n\nAs for the Tesla power pack, first off I am a big Tesla and Elon Musk fan but FOR ME I would not buy a Tesla power pack because I know that I can build a power pack of the same size or bigger for cheaper. There are already schematics online on how to do it but I do have a Electrical Engineering degree so for me its possible. For the non-EE I think the easy of use and their look makes them a good idea if you want a fast simple setup and don't mind dropping some cash on it. \n\nSince you already have solar panels setup you can look into getting a power wall or two and having them as a backup option. \n\nBe warned that some grid-tied systems (solar and utility power) are setup that when the grid goes down (power line down, etc...) that the solar setup as gets disconnected because the guys fixing the grid do not want power on the line when they are fixing it so its a safety thing. Just be on the look out for this and be aware that you may need to get a manual or automatic \"transfer\" switch that allows you to disconnect the grid and use the solar/batteries when the grid goes down. \n\nTL;DR: If you are not EE DIY then Power packs are fine, batteries are a whole other setup and add more complexity to the whole system and may not be needed/worth it if you got a good grid.",

The link above it for the bill itself to track its status.\n\nOf key notes within, Section 183:\n&gt; (1) A CUSTOMER PARTICIPATING IN A NET METERING PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION BEFORE THE  EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION MAY ELECT TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SERVICE UNDER THE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THAT PROGRAM FOR UP TO 10 YEARS FROM THE  DATE OF ENROLLMENT.\n\n&gt; (2) SUBSECTION (1) DOES NOT APPLY TO AN INCREASE IN THE\n8 GENERATION CAPACITY OF THE CUSTOMER'S ELIGIBLE  ELECTRIC GENERATOR  BEYOND THE CAPACITY ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION.\n\nThis is the 10 year grandfathering mentioned and you cannot increase your capacity.  \n\nThe middle of page 78 appears to have the worst language:\n&gt; The credit per kilowatt hour for kilowatt hours delivered into the utility's distribution system shall be either of the following:\n\n&gt; (a) The monthly average real-time locational marginal price\nfor energy at the commercial pricing node within the electric  utility's distribution service territory, or for net metering DISTRIBUTED GENERATION customers on a time-based rate schedule, the monthly average real-time locational marginal price for energy at the commercial pricing node within the electric utility's distribution service territory during the time-of-use pricing period.\n\n&gt; (b) The electric utility's or alternative electric supplier's power supply component, **EXCLUDING TRANSMISSION CHARGES**, of the full retail rate during the billing period or time-of-use pricing period.\n\nThis means they will not credit you for about half the bill (the delivery charge).\n\nThere's much more, but I haven't digested it all, nor do I think I can.\n\nFor reference, here's the link to SB437, it's sister bill:\nhttp://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(o5gksckfkhaz14zpqwcr5dwh))/mileg.aspx?page=shortlinkdisplay&amp;docname=2015-SB-0437\n\n437 contains the harsher language describing the fee on page 15\n&gt; (16) IN DETERMINING AN ELECTRIC UTILITY'S RATES UNDER THIS\nSECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL &lt;&lt;BY DECEMBER 1, 2017,&gt;&gt; ESTABLISH A **NONDISCRIMINATORY, FAIR, AND EQUITABLE** GRID CHARGE TO APPLY TO CUSTOMERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A NET METERING OR DISTRIBUTED GENERATION PROGRAM UNDER THE CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY WASTE REDUCTION ACT, 2008 PA 295, 18 MCL 460.1001 TO 460.1211, AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AMENDATORY ACT THAT ADDED SECTION 6T. THE GRID CHARGE SHALL ENSURE RECOVERY OF THE CUSTOMERS' ALLOCATED COST-BASED SHARE OF ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTRIC UTILITY'S DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, TRANSMISSION COSTS, AND FIXED GENERATION CAPACITY COSTS.\n\nNONDISCRIMINATORY, FAIR, AND EQUITABLE usually means *to the utility* and not the customer.  $25-50 fees have been foisted in other states which can be up to 50% of their old bills.  It basically says we get to pay for EVERY CHARGE the utility incurs, which usually translates to fees to track the fees.\n\nThis is bad news for solar.  I doubt the house will do much to change it.",

"comment": "not sure what you mean about the cost.   \nYou would have to have an inverter someplace either a central efficient one or a bunch of less efficient distributed ones.   \nThe SolarEdge solution is a system, effectively distributing the MPPT to each module while leaving the inverter central where it can be most efficient and tie into a backup source like the powerwall (StorEdge solution).   However using SolarEdge also allows expansion latter as you can use ANY of the solaredge optimizers on a string allowing mixing many different solar modules.   Something that would be very difficult with a string.",

"comment": "sure Tesla CAN make a grid tie inverter.   But there is little cynergy in a motor controller with highly variable frequency optimized on motor effeciency and a grid tie inverter with fixed input voltage, and tons of safety and regulations.   The teams working on the two (motor controller and grid tie inverter) will have vastly different goals, constraints, and regulations.\n\nThe DC/DC converters?  are you talking about the distributed MPPT optimizers with SafeDC and many other trademark/patents from SolarEdge.   \n\nLowering the profile of the PV modules reduces cooling which reduces production.  Irregular shaped panels, has been tried and failed.   Module to module wiring through the side is done by some as well and also a boondoggle.  They might come out with something great, but unlikely to happen any time soon and without lots of patent license, and fees. \n\nNot sure why having another inverter in the powerwall helps with anything other than adding cost.",

I bought my 2nd hand with 42000km on it.\n\nWe have solar panels too but very rarely charge it here due to no adjacent garage. \n\nA 10kW installation should provide plenty during the day in the afternoon and a bit in the evening if you charge with a granny charger.\n\nToo bad you can't prioritise the Zoe over the battery as that will be the most efficient (but so what, it's RE).\n\nNot sure what else to say, we haven't had any problems sofar. The GOM is a bit annoying though due to its pessimism. Mine going to get v25 BMS upgrade next week and I hope it fixes that. \n\nBuy the dongle to get some cool readouts with the CanZE app. \n\nThe Renault ZOE Owners Club facebook group is commendable too.",

But it makes for the moments of genuine discussion more enjoyable, negative fake internet points be damned!  \n\n\nPersonally, I love bacon...a lot, but I still try to care about the environment (saving water, solar power, etc), so the factory farming argument is more effective on me.  \n\nI was actually eat less meat now due to a vegan who introduced me to ordering from local farms for MUCH better quality and tastier meat for around the same price.  It tastes better, but inconvenient to get, so I end up rationing it out.  \n\nWhile I will always be a meat eater, my overall contribution to the suffering of animals has been greatly reduced and isn't that the goal?",

"comment": "No actually. An individual impacts other individuals and then they impact others in their social networks and the economy.\n\nIf you’re looking for one person or a handful of people to fix climate change you’ll be waiting a long time. The more we as individuals discuss what we can do and demonstrate to others that others are doing these things the more people will take up habits.\n\nAnd I didn’t say recycling alone would be enough or that solar panels would be. It’s easier to change a small habit than a big one and easier to change one thing at a time.\n\nSo if I recycle maybe after a few months it becomes routine. Then maybe I decide to cut one single use product out of my life (disposable razors, plastic straws, disposable silverware, etc) Then I carpool two days a week. Maybe I cut the amount of meat I eat in half.\n\nWhile I’m doing these things I talk to family and friends. (I’ve got my sister switched off disposable razors, recycling, etc)\n\nBy making those changes and sharing them with others I am normalizing the behavior changes that I’ve made.\n\nThis way I’m contributing. Nothing I do on my own could be enough but by talking about it and sharing things I’m helping others to take small actions.\n\nIf I sit up at night wishing for someone to come fix everything that has less of an impact than taking these actions.\n\nIf I do environmentally friendly things I’m at least contributing something, however miniscule.",

Whether it be them living next to a building that blocks their sunlight or a home being surrounded by tall trees.  Seems like this could lead to the installation of inefficient solar panels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf they are trying to reduce carbon emissions... then just increase the tax that energy companies have to pay if they are using carbon fuels (thus increasing energy costs).  This way, consumers can make more efficient decisions on whether or not solar makes sense for their new home.  This idea seems almost as bad as the Cash for Clunkers the government put into place many years ago to help stimulate the sale of new cars.  Government at its finest.",

It's a pure sales meter that is separate from my consumption meter.\n\nRe: the 9.63 generation being swell and right on a 9.9 system, that is what I was looking to confirm. The generator program in my area limits to 10Kw nameplate but I've seen other people around me hitting the full 10Kw during these days. I guess they played a little fast and loose with the rules some how as they have more panels (ie, nameplate is 10 but really it's likely 11).\n\nThanks for clarifying. It's disappointing as I think I likely would have put up higher wattage panels if I knew it was an option. The price difference between 300 and 325 doesn't seem to be very big and it would have helped with payoff.",

"comment": "Why don’t you read the facts presented and form an opinion. \n\nThe effect of CO2 warming debunked !!\n\n\nThe “war on carbon” is derived from sheer stupidity, arrogance and scientific illiteracy\nThe extreme alarmism of climate change lunatics — best personified by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ insistence that humanity will be destroyed in 12 years if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels — is all based on nothing but fearmongering media propaganda and faked science. (The IPCC and NOAA both routinely fudge temperature data to try to create a warming “trend” where none exists.)\nIt’s all a massive, coordinated fraud, and the mainstream media deliberately lies to the public about climate change to push anti-free market schemes that would destroy the U.S. economy while transferring literally trillions of dollars into the pockets of wealthy globalists as part of a “carbon tax” scheme.\nYet carbon isn’t the problem at all. And the “war on carbon” is a stupid, senseless policy created by idiots, given that humans are carbon-based lifeforms, meaning that any “war on carbon” is a war on humanity.\n\n\nScarcely a day goes by without us being warned of coastal inundation by rising seas due to global warming.\nWhy on earth do we attribute any heating of the oceans to carbon dioxide, when there is a far more obvious culprit, and when such a straightforward examination of the thermodynamics render it impossible.\n\nCarbon dioxide, we are told, traps heat that has been irradiated by the oceans, and this warms the oceans and melts the polar ice caps. While this seems a plausible proposition at first glance, when one actually examines it closely a major flaw emerges.\nIn a nutshell, water takes a lot of energy to heat up, and air doesn’t contain much. In fact, on a volume/volume basis, the ratio of heat capacities is about 3300 to 1. This means that to heat 1 litre of water by 1˚C it would take 3300 litres of air that was 2˚C hotter, or 1 litre of air that was about 3300˚C hotter!\nThis shouldn’t surprise anyone. If you ran a cold bath and then tried to heat it by putting a dozen heaters in the room, does anyone believe that the water would ever get hot?\nThe problem gets even stickier when you consider the size of the ocean. Basically, there is too much water and not enough air.\nThe ocean contains a colossal 1,500,000,000,000,000,000,000 litres of water! To heat it, even by a small amount, takes a staggering amount of energy. To heat it by a mere 1˚C, for example, an astonishing 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules of energy are required.\nLet’s put this amount of energy in perspective. If we all turned off all our appliances and went and lived in caves, and then devoted every coal, nuclear, gas, hydro, wind and solar power plant to just heating the ocean, it would take a breathtaking 32,000 years to heat the ocean by just this 1˚C!\nIn short, our influence on our climate, even if we really tried, is miniscule!\nSo it makes sense to ask the question – if the ocean were to be heated by ‘greenhouse warming’ of the atmosphere, how hot would the air have to get? If the entire ocean is heated by 1˚C, how much would the air have to be heated by to contain enough heat to do the job?\nWell, unfortunately for every ton of water there is only a kilogram of air. Taking into account the relative heat capacities and absolute masses, we arrive at the astonishing figure of 4,000˚C.\nThat is, if we wanted to heat the entire ocean by 1˚C, and wanted to do it by heating the air above it, we’d have to heat the air to about 4,000˚C hotter than the water.\nAnd another problem is that air sits on top of water – how would hot air heat deep into the ocean? Even if the surface warmed, the warm water would just sit on top of the cold water.\nThus, if the ocean were being heated by ‘greenhouse heating’ of the air, we would see a system with enormous thermal lag – for the ocean to be only slightly warmer, the land would have to be substantially warmer, and the air much, much warmer (to create the temperature gradient that would facilitate the transfer of heat from the air to the water).\nTherefore any measurable warmth in the ocean would be accompanied by a huge and obvious anomaly in the air temperatures, and we would not have to bother looking at ocean temperatures at all.\nSo if the air doesn’t contain enough energy to heat the oceans or melt the ice caps, what does?\nThe earth is tilted on its axis, and this gives us our seasons. When the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, we have more direct sunlight and more of it (longer days). When it is tilted away from the sun, we have less direct sunlight and less of it (shorter days).\nThe direct result of this is that in summer it is hot and in winter it is cold. In winter we run the heaters in our cars, and in summer the air conditioners. In winter the polar caps freeze over and in summer 60-70% of them melt (about ten million square kilometres). In summer the water is warmer and winter it is cooler (ask any surfer).\nAll of these changes are directly determined by the amount of sunlight that we get. When the clouds clear and bathe us in sunlight, we don’t take off our jumper because of ‘greenhouse heating’ of the atmosphere, but because of the direct heat caused by the sunlight on our body. The sun’s influence is direct, obvious, and instantaneous.\nIf the enormous influence of the sun on our climate is so obvious, then, by what act of madness do we look at a variation of a fraction of a percent in any of these variables, and not look to the sun as the cause?\nWhy on earth (pun intended) do we attribute any heating of the oceans to carbon dioxide, when there is a far more obvious culprit, and when such a straightforward examination of the thermodynamics render it impossible.\n\nDr. Mark Imisides is an industrial chemist with extensive experience in the chemical industry, encompassing manufacturing, laboratory management, analysis, waste management, dangerous goods and household chemistry.

We are not grid tied so this is going directly into charging our (quite substantial) battery bank.  When it is really hot in the summer of course, the opposite happens, such is the nature of a PV panel.\n\nEdit: in particular the times I notice this happen is when it is a really cold winter day, with mostly clear sky but some clouds.  The highest spikes in power seem to directly coincide with when the sun is right at the edge of some cloud cover, I don't understand why this happens but I observe it regularly during the winter months.",

I mean OP's system is around U$ 16.000,00 and in my currency would be around R$ 88.000,00. And that's a lot of money.\n\nMost of the solar inverters and pv modules here are imported, so I'm a bit curious about it.",

"comment": "Speaking as a Solar Installer in GA:\n\nThe order of operation in your scenario:\n\n1. Reroof — huge pain for you (homeowner) to take off solar after it’s been installed. You push the ROI so much farther down the line due to take down and reinstall. We charge per panel for take down and often need to repurchase the racking materials. Not recommended.\n\n2. Install solar with panels, not solar shingles — they just aren’t really what they claim to be.... yet. Who knows what 20 years will bring, but for now, you just can’t beat 325-355 Watts/panel of cold hard production. \n\n\nStay away from Tesla, they are all about branding and zero customer service. We choose not to install Tesla POWERWALL even due to popular branding because it’s just not worth the hassle of trying to get on the phone with them if anything goes wrong. If you have a problem, you don’t want to be waiting 1-2hrs on hold. Been there. \n\nJinko solar, Trina solar, Canadian solar, Q CELLs, all great panels. Sun power is baller too, but meh on elevated price. If it’s a Tier 1 company and their warranty is insurance backed, really you have the pick of the litter. \n\nIf you want batteries now or in future, Generac PWR Cell all the way. Super reliable customer support, bombproof product, and easily expandable battery bank. Our customers Couldn’t be happier, and during the hurricanes in GA earlier this year, not one PWR CELL backup customer gave us a call. \n\nIf you only want PV, Enphase or AP systems micros are a great way to go. IMO, AP systems monitoring is more comprehensive and the customer support is excellent. \n\nAvoid SolarEdge like the plague. Terrible terrible terrible customer support for their constantly breaking products. We don’t sell that equipment for a reason... it causes headaches for the customer and loss of revenue for us. Not worth it.",

"comment": "On Saturday, August 14, 2021 Germany was close to a widespread Blackout, reports EIKE - (Europäisches Institut für Klima &amp; Energie)\n\nThe electricity supply was so critical that several industrial companies had their power supply interrupted.\n\nMore German media, including ′′ Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ′′ (FAZ), reported:\n\nSolar cells went black when the sun went down\nOn the evening of August 14, the production of renewable energy fell sharply. Electric production could no longer follow the consumption. Early in the evening, the need was about 50 gigawatts. \n\nThe solar power was still over 30 gigawatts in the afternoon, but it fell to only 3 gigawatt. All available reserves were put in. However, the effect of pumping plants and coal power plants at maximum load was not sufficient. There wasn't enough electric imports either.\n\nAn interruption was done just before noon. 20.00. \n\nNet operators then suspended power supply to several energy consuming industries without warning. For example, the aluminum company was trimmed in Essen without power. The outage lasted over an hour. Now the emergency crisis was solved. But still the power grid couldn't stabilize. In order to prevent an unplanned power outage, several industries were interrupted on short notice. This lasted over an hour. Finally it was possible to stabilize the power grid.\n\nOne might be happy that the crisis occurred on a Saturday night, writes the ′′ Blackout News ′′ portal. An ordinary everyday life, where significantly several industrial companies operate, a Blackout would hardly have been avoided.\n\nDie Bundesnetzagentur, responsible for ensuring the power supply, explained that it is normal operating procedure with disconnecting different industries, when there is not enough power. In short, new times in Germany.\n\nTherefore, German politicians have decided to allocate an area of 2 % of the country to solar cells. This is equivalent to an area the size of all of Zealand, which must be laid out in a solar desert.\n\n➖➖\n\nUnreliable power is unreliable.\n\nCivilization requires reliable power.\n\nFrom gas stations to traffic lights to hospitals, the damage caused by power outages is unacceptable.\n\n• Philip Ngai\n\n[Britain Saved by Coal - At Huge Cost](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/pjl24f/britain_saved_by_coal_at_huge_cost/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

No he makes Maybe 100-200.00. Rest goes towards, insurance, shop rental, repair subscription services payroll, utilities, business licenses, and a ton of other expenses.  I get it, I said f that I’ll do it myself, that’s how I became a gear head.  Well turns out I spent about the same in tool And power tool acquisitions.\n\nThis is like part sales man saying, oh ya my cousin Vito will do the install for an extra 200.00.  \n\nHaving said that 40k for a 8.37 kw system is on the high side, unless there are other add ons you aren’t mentioning.  Like MPUs, insulation, And other back ups.\n\nI can also tell you, that 40k probably includes 0 out of pocket financing with 0.99 or 1.99 low interest payment.  Here is what they don’t tell you.  Those financing companies charge all their interest up front via dealer fees.  And it can be as high as 25 percent of the total job.  So 10k of that 40k is going to their financing partner.  Which is a totally separate entity then the solar installer, or the solar rep you’re talking too.  But here is where it gets interesting.  You don’t have to pay for those dealer fees.  You can just opt for a higher interest loan, with no prepayment penalties.  But it turns out that the monthly payment wise, a 40k loan with 0.99 percent interest is less than a 30k loan with 4.99 percent interest.  \n\nBut even with the 25 percent.  If it’s just solar, with no electrical box upgrade needed, no other non solar extras added.  You should be getting quotes between 25 to 33k depending of whether you’re taking their low apr financing, or financing it yourself.  Before tax credit ofc.\n\nThat’s assuming you want to deal with a reputable installer, that will be around 10+ years from now, is highly reviewed, and can be counted upon in case of warranties etc in the future.  Or you can deal with these guys, who barely registered their business in April of 2020.  And again their whole company premise  consist of everyone in the solar industry is scammers.  Except them ofc they’re the only non scammers in the whole solar world.\n\nhttps://secure.utah.gov/bes/displayDetails.html",

"comment": "I am in PA and the electric cost here is about $0.06 per kWh for Generation and another $0.08 per kWh for transmission for a total of about $0.14 per kWh on my electric bill.  Through net metering with my residential PV solar I save the full $0.14 for what I produce and use in a given year.  However, if I overproduce more than I use, on the anniversary date the utility will only pay me for the generation portion (the $0.06 per kWh)\n\nMake sure you know what the utility will actually pay you for power that you generate. My guess is that it’s not $0.18 per kWh but something less.  Using your estimates at $0.18 is a 6 year return on investment (ROI).   At $0.06 it’s a 17 year ROI which to me would not be a good investment",

"comment": "You are not 100% correct from what I have been told by Tesla during my search.  The Powerwall will power your house from the battery and then once it reaches a certain threshold you may send power into the battery from the solar array. I forget what the percent was but I am thinking it was 60% or around that mark.  You are then limited to the inverter capacity of the battery.\n\nThe Enphase Encharge has 12 microinverters in each battery that harmonize to create a mini grid when off grid. It is possible to feed solar to the batteries no matter the batteries charge level. The Enphase system can also harmonize with the microinverters on the roof if your have the right setup allowing to drastically increase power production during daylight hours. \n \nI myself have an Enphase system with 2 Encharge batteries.  I have 24 microinverters in my Encharge batteries and 41 of the inverters on the roof can harmonize during daylight hours.  This means that unless it’s fairly cloudy or dark that I rarely tap my batteries and enter the evening with a fully charged battery bank.\n\nI don’t believe wither system to be superior rather they have different technology. That said, the Enphase solution was right for me. During day light hours I can run the aircon and charge my EV off solar production alone and enter the evening with full storage. That said the Enphase batteries are more costly and have both a smaller storage capacity and inverter output than the power wall…. When it’s dark.\n\nSo when it’s dark I can only support a lot of 7.68kwh with the inverters in the Encharge batteries but when it’s sunny…. I can support a much bigger load.  Even with the increased cost the additional production made Enphase more economical for my needs. I would have needed a lot more power walls to achieve the same result.",

This is a good example. Thanks.  \n\n\nThe bit about segmenting the arrays to beat the size limits is pretty nasty too. In finance it is called, \"Structuring\" and it is a separate offense.   \nI do wonder why gigantic parking lots are not required to have, at minimum, a plan for an eventual solar array. You have to have a drainage plan for them and some traffic flow layout and an agreement as to how they feed into the streets adjacent. So there are already plenty of regulatory hands on the ball.

PPAs on the residential scale are a ripoff in general, but even more so here as electricity is cheap, we don’t pay time of use, and we have access to third party energy producers through the marketplace ([PA Power Switch](https://www.papowerswitch.com/)). That 2.9% escalator will outpace the market from your utility and you’ll likely end up paying more than you would from the grid. A PPA will also make your home much harder to sell as the buyer will need to assume the contract. Your best bet is to take out a HELOC or personal loan to cover the cost if you can’t afford paying cash. Another thing to remember is that because Trinity owns the system THEY get to claim the 26% federal tax credit AND keep the SRECs your system generates. You get the feel good of having solar panels with none of the benefits that come with it. Read about Trinity a bit and you’ll see they’re bad news.

Let's assume at a particular moment in time there is a voltage on L1 from inverter. Does current go from L1 into Load through line A, from there to neutral and back to the transformer? Does it then give push voltage to primary of transformer, before returning to inverter through B and L2?\n\nDoes it drop 120V through the load and again 120V through the transformer?\n\nWhen there's a voltage on L1 is there a voltage on line A from transformer? Or on line B?\n\nIF anyone got a clue, thanks..",

"comment": "Probably sourced from Facebook.  As for the rationale behind the claim... There is none.  \n\nSolar rays hit an object, impart energy and that energy is slowly radiated away into space as infra-red.  The atmosphere slows rate that radiation is escaping the earth.  Too little atmosphere and we freeze.  Too much and we cook.  Tinker with the chemistry of the atmosphere and we change it's insulative properties. \n\nIt's irrelevant what the solar rays hit as long as It's under the atmosphere... the process is the same.  At best you could argue that solar panels are pulling some of the energy away as electricity that would otherwise have been radiated away.\n\nEdit: Before anyone points it out, I'm aware that different colours reflect light differently.",

"comment": "Keep in mind that using your battery will degrade the total storage capacity over time.  So make sure cycling your battery daily is economically beneficial to you.  \n\n If the cost of power from the grid is very high AND you do not get much value for any solar export during the day (assuming the solar array output exceeds your household usage), then storing that solar power and using it later in the day can increase your energy savings.  (Commonly referred to as time-of-use arbitrage).  \n\nYou should also check to see if your local utility has any opt-in demand response or VPP programs where they pay you directly for access to your stored energy.  Depending on where you live this can be quite lucrative.",

"comment": "So, my decisions were actually based on environmental and then welfare. I think the welfare aspect grew over time. This is when I was a vegetarian  but because I learned how egg and dairy is really. It much different I had to make the shift. But I’ll say this…\n\nJust like being vegan, there’s a lot of ways to do it so long as there’s a following of the basic tenet. Environmentalism isn’t conservationism, that’s one aspect of it. \n\nEnvironmentalism can be conservationist, which tend to be the wealthier national park type focused Patagonia wearing racialized white peoples that essentially give environmentalism its criticism of being out of touch. \n\nBut it also comes in the form of justice, technological innovation etc. Justice can focus often on the human impact. Innovation is around market based solutions to energy and waste. \n\nI don’t call myself an environmentalist despite being in the field because I hate labels but many people wouldn’t consider me one because I’m pro-nuclear energy and I don’t think Solar panels are all that great as a main source of energy and have many environmental and ethical drawbacks. \n\nBut I don’t care. Because to engage with environmental topics means looking at everything including your preconceived notions with a critical lens opposed to ideological. For me, veganism isn’t ideological as it is logical. I don’t agree that there’s one way to be anything and perhaps these people think that they can be environmentalists and still consume CAFO products. They either haven’t engaged with it critically or choose to disregard it.\n\nEnvironmentalism is a vague term and can mean a lot of things to many people. I’d also say not everyone that is vegan is by default an environmentalist or more environmentally effective than a non-vegan environmentalist.",

That way the excess solar can be saved in the battery during the day, and then at night we can use those solar electrons stored in the EV's batteries. This is important to my because my province's electrical grid has a lot of coal, and I want to reduce my CO2, hence use of the grid.\n\nIt's early days for bi-directional charging, but it's coming.\n\nMore to your question: I think both EV and PHEV are GREAT options: anything that reduces emissions is a good thing.\n\nBut I'd go EV if only for no oil changes, no gas, no brake pads (or hardly ever, I read.)",

"comment": "Here are tips for finding the best solar system installers;\n\n1. Get quotes from several installers. Contact at least 3 local solar panel companies for detailed proposals for your home. Compare costs, warranties, equipment brands, incentives, timelines, etc.  \n\n2.  Verify licenses and insurance. Verify they have a valid Ohio state license and liability/workers' compensation insurance. Protects you if a problem arises.\n3.   \nAsk about their experience. How long have they been installing solar in your area? How many installs locally? More is better.\n4.   \nCheck reviews and referrals. Look for online customer reviews. Ask for references. Speak to past clients about their experiences.\n5.   \nLook for quality equipment. Good solar modules and inverters from top brands will maximize your solar production. Ask what brands they use.\n6.   \nUnderstand the warranties. Solar panels and inverters should have 10- to 25-year manufacturer warranties. Your solar contractor should give you a workmanship warranty too.\n7.   \nCheck if they handle permits/incentives. Installers should handle permits and incentives. Make sure to verify.\n8.   \nConsider local contractors. Local companies may provide better service and support. Bigger isn't always better.  \nWhen seeking a trustworthy solar contractor, choose one who:  \n— Has at least 5 years of solar expertise  \n— Has employed their own NABCEP-certified professionals  \n— Has glowing customer reviews and testimonials  \n— Has an office near you  \nOn average, small local PV installers have more positive reviews for their service.",

Feel free to comment here if you have any questions, feel you’ve been taken advantage of, want a status update. I have access to all accounts. For any concerned, installation needs to be approved and “contracts” are agreements and can be cancelled any point up to installation. After the initial agreement you’ll receive a final design that gets submitted for permitting.  If you think your signature is forged please reply. We use docusign and all signatures are monitored and can be pulled to verify. Sales can obtain some bad apples so I can’t say it hasn’t happened before but 99% of the time it’s misunderstanding and miscommunication.  Happy to help.",

The days may have been similar, but you could be looking at 2% of panel degradation and 3% from a few extra clouds in the sky (and clouds can even cut both ways because sometimes clouds can focus the sun rays (yes, there is some weird phenomena like that that someone smarter than me could explain)).",

But you will have to find a source of B12 and possibly D if you go vegan.\n\nI eat really well, usually 15 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day, but I still suffer from depression. I think there is a limit as to how much of a mental change a diet can provide. Except that while it will relieve feelings of guilt, it might contribute to your depression when you are continually confronted with the 95-98% of the population who doesn't give a sh*t and chooses otherwise or even revels in it. Witness the bacon meme here, for all these people who consider themselves to be progressive.",

This all started a couple years ago and I had tried everything, but nothing was working. I decided to experiment with meat + the low-GI diet and it all cleared up. At first I just thought it was a coincidence, but as soon as I removed the meat the pustules returned. So I added the meat again and they went away. I did this cycle a few times over a three month period and realized that without the meat the pustules will eventually return. So now I am at a loss.",

If you have a cholesterol problem, it might be best to stay away (even though cholesterol can only be mitigated so much by diet alone). But if you're a vegan and coconut is literally your only source of saturated fat and you're not eating it every day, I don't see the problem. You're still eating less saturated fat than an omnivore who is trying to control his/her cholesterol by replacing fatty meats with lean meats.",

I'd much rather you keep doing whatever advocacy you're involved in than quit because you aren't vegan yet.\n\nThat being said, it's a lot harder to empathize with the plight of animals when you're eating them. I say this as someone who did *not* become a vegan for the animals. It was primarily about health and the environment, and largely due to marrying into a family with quite a few vegans. It wasn't until after I gave up meat and the like that I actually found animal rights to be a very compelling cause. Before that, I just wasn't emotionally prepared to consider them in a meaningful way.\n\nSo can you call yourself a supporter of animal rights? Why not find out whether it feels different to you? Go vegan for a month. Take stock. Do you feel differently about animal rights? How do you feel about the work you did when you ate animals? Make an informed decision. Then decide what you want to call yourself.",

"comment": "&gt; Plants cannot experience that\n\nWell, that's an assumption we make. We know nothing of the emotional lives of plants. Their method of converting sunlight into cell energy is completely different from animals' method of converting calories into energy, yet they still convert one form of energy into another. Is it so hard to imagine that the chemical reactions that stimulate emotion in animals could also occur in plants, but like photosynthesis it just looks completely different from what we're familiar with? Plants contain hormones just like us...\n\nMy point is not to argue that plants may feel pain and suffering and therefore it is bad to eat plants, my point is that to say we definitely know that plants are incapable of perception or feeling in the same way animals are is not based in logic or science - we simply do not know. Vegans don't like to acknowledge this, but arguing to the contrary is the same a an omnivore claiming that a cow cannot feel love. We simply don't know, but if we can expand our capacity for empathy and humility a little bit, we can imagine that they do.\n\nIt makes the topic of eating compassionately a little more complicated, and you can begin to see how fruitarianism as an ethical choice begins to play out.",

I've always really loved vegan ice cream products ever since I tried them, especially tofutti cuties.  Never had vegan creamers but almond or soymilk goes just fine in my coffee.  When I first went vegan, the cheese substitutes available to me were all shit, so I just learned to make things without cheese.  I like Daiya though, and I also love cashew cheese sauce and nooch, but most things I make aren't really cheesy type things.  You'll be just fine without it.  The cows won't be fine if we keep eating and drinking their milk",

I think it's fair to give them a chance, as in talk to them about is a few times and give them a few weeks to let it sink in, because we all need a little time to open up to veganism. But if she is truly stupid enough to believe that, and mean enough to act like that, then she is a poisonous person. You need to surround yourself with positive people who won't starve you at their wedding.\nIf you don't feel comfortable talking to her about this, just send her either earthlings or that \"glass walls\" peta video (which is much shorter) and say \"don't talk shit about me about this until you watch this video and learn wtf you are talking about\"",

It was definitely more of a commitment to be vegan a couple hundred years ago, say like tolstoy or shelley.

"comment": "You don't need to have special food as a vegan, a lot of the ingredients vegans use in their food is just stuff that people who aren't vegan would still eat. The only thing I can really think of, is that if your family is big on dairy milk, you'll want to start buying some soy milk or something instead.\n\nThe 'what to make' section on that site is really nice, but you don't always need to eat like that. Half of the time I feel like I'm just tossing some veggies in a pan to have with some rice(which is very cheap). I'd recommend as you start this journey that you track what you eat for the first few weeks to see what kind of nutrients you're getting on a daily basis. Not only will that help you cover your ground &amp; set the tone for what you should be eating, but it will also put your mind at ease to know that you're still getting all the nutrients you need.",

Policing other vegans from your higher horse because you need everyone to know you are the veganest vegan to ever vegan and even the image of a fake meat product disgusts you. Congrats, you are going to alienate 10x more people from veganism with your insufferable self righteousness that has absolutely no moral or logical base than any of us will ever be able to convert. You give us all a bad reputation, and I seriously, genuinely hope you aren’t like that most of the time because I’m not joking, you WILL alienate almost every person you talk to from veganism.",

I asked whether you'd go vegan if things were presented another way.  You're here giving vegans advice on how the reality of the situation should be presented, but if you're not vegan and would never go vegan no matter what is said to you, what position are you in to tell us what it takes for someone to realize going vegan is the right thing to do?  People like you aren't the target audience.  The reality is you just want everyone to be quiet about the reality of what you're causing, because your feelings are more important than your victims.  \n\nBy the way, your victims wouldn't see you any better than slaves would see their owners.",
