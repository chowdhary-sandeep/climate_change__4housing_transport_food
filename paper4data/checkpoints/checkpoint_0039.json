I took the time to answer in the first place because you seemed sincere.\n\n&gt;I am assuming by your answers that you are more middle of the road type of person on this subject, \n\nCorrect.  Some have called me a \"lukewarmer.\"  I simply try to take in as much of the whole picture as I can and strip away the politics, inasmuch as that's possible.\n\n&gt;...so what do you think would be possible solutions to our current CC problems and why?\n\nI'm glad you asked, honestly.  It's something I've given a lot of thought to.  That doesn't mean I have it all figured it out or that I don't have blind spots, but what follows is my considered opinion.\n\nFirst, and perhaps most importantly, we all need to take a deep breath.  The question of \"what should we do?\" often gets knee-jerk responses, which normally result in opposing knee-jerk responses.  I think we need to simply breath and think this thing through.\n\nNext, I think we need to recognize that potential solutions to climate change and potential solutions to peak oil/coal/gas have some overlap.  Those are worth looking at.\n\nAfter that, we need to not pretend that we have unlimited financial resources.  Everything we do will cost money, and once we choose to spend that money, we don't get to have that money to spend again.  We therefore need to get the most out of our money.\n\nI will assume here that most people want to maintain some semblance of modern society.  I know there are a few who think we need to revert back to a low-energy way of life.  I respect that viewpoint, and I wish those who wish to so live the best of luck.  I don't think most people want to live that way, and I believe that modernity has done more good than harm for humans, so I would like to have that persist for future generations.\n\nWith those caveats, let me revert back to bullet points for my recommendations:\n\n- While solar and wind are great for certain places at certain times, I do not believe they should be *the* general prescription for our energy needs.  Even very concerned climate scientists like Jim Hansen and Kerry Emanuel [agree on this point](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/).  Solar is great for hot, sunny places like Phoenix.  I think everyone there should consider rooftop solar, especially businesses.  I think there are places where wind makes sense too; however, both solar and wind are diffuse and intermittent.  They are simply not suitable replacements for coal- or gas-generated electricity.  \n\n- We would do well to electrify transportation as much as possible, but recognize that this will probably take a couple of decades.  I think this should be high priority since oil will peak much sooner than natural gas or coal.  I used to be critical of electric vehicles (EVs) and still am to some degree, but I will admit that they are approaching affordability.  If battery storage can continue to improve, I think they may become viable replacements for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars without subsidies.\n\n- Related to the previous, I think the densest urban areas really ought to implement [SkyTran](http://www.skytran.net/) or something like it.  Tel Aviv, Israel is building a test section.  Some places in the U.S. have considered it, but haven't yet committed.\n\n- I think current-level nuclear technology should be replacing retiring coal plants.  Natural gas plants are cheap to build and quite efficient when run in a combined cycle configuration, but I think fuel costs for those plants can only go up.  We still have very cheap natural gas because of all the money that was invested in exploration and production over the last decade.  That money has largely dried up, though, so natural gas plants won't have the cost advantage forever.\n\n- I think we really need to devote some resourced to exploring advanced nuclear options.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences has dusted off the work the U.S. did at Oak Ridge National labs 50 years ago and now has 400 scientists working on building two test Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTRs) by 2020.  (LFTRs are a type of Molten Salt Reactor, or MSR, if you run into that term elsewhere.)  They expect to have commercial reactors rolling off the line within a decade after their test reactors come online.  There are some other approaches to advanced nuclear as well, some of them fusion, that might be worth considering.\n\n- Large transportation ships should be allowed to have small nuclear reactors onboard.  Currently only military ships (and one Russian icebreaker that I'm aware of) are nuclear.  With some forethought, I think we could put sufficient safety protocols in place to allow for civilian ships to have nuclear reactors as well.\n\n- A good many environmentalists and peak oilers support many of my suggestions, but think the process should be goosed along by international treaties and carbon taxes.  In my opinion, neither are good ideas, nor likely to be widely adopted.  The former always break down into issues of reparations with developing nations demanding money from developed nations and developed nations not-so-subtly bringing up aid programs.  The latter (a carbon tax) is extremely regressive.  I've heard people say that the tax revenue would be simply be redistributed, but there are lots of problems with that idea, too.\n\n- Finally, I think we have a duty to help developing nations develop.  I have yet to see any evidence that a nation can develop without massively increasing its energy consumption, so I think we need to stop telling poorer countries that their only energy options are wind and solar.  They need the cheapest energy they can get.  I think we can get nuclear cheap enough and safe enough to do the job, but I don't think we should block financing for coal or natural gas plants at the present time.\n\nI know there are a few items that have slipped my mind because it's getting late and I'm forgetful even when well rested, but I think you get the shape of what I recommend.  I have considered the questions of nuclear waste and sufficient nuclear fuel sources and the other issues people bring up when I talk about nuclear power, so I can address those if you see those as hang-ups to my recommendations, but I think I've gone deep enough for tonight.\n\nKudos to you for asking hard questions and considering answers with an open mind.

And we are commenting on an article about experts telling the USPS that this is a bad idea.  And the USPS is run by a corrupt stooge at the moment, not an expert on anything to do with this.\n\nUSPS estimates have suggested it will cost 3.4 billion to shift the USPS to EV and 2.5 billion to buy the EV trucks.  But the Oshkosh deal for 90% gas trucks is thought to be worth up to 6 billion.  Those numbers look pretty similar, but then the EVs go on to have less maintenance and energy and environmental cost - which the USPS did not mention in their impact statement, which is pretty weird, but they are being run by a corrupt stooge after all.  And we have already covered how most USPS trucks could charge off of very simple, low-power plugs that cost hundreds of dollars to install and can serve multiple trucks, which is not a lot of money compared to the savings for vehicles that run day after day.

It was the car of last resort that we only took if we needed the extra space or needed two vehicles at once (an increasing rarity in the pandemic.)\n\nAfter a 1700 mile road trip in the Leaf (we knew what a bad idea that was- that was part of the adventure!) we realized there was no reason to have a gas car any more, and thanks to Carpocalypse shortages, sold the 4 year old Honda SUV for almost what we paid new for it in 2017 and bought a VW ID4. The extra space and CCS charging made it a much better road tripper than the Leaf (but to be fair, an Amish buggy would be a better report tripper than a Leaf!)\n\nI find no real downside to having two EVs in house with L2 charging available. It's rare that both cars need to charge at the same time (just like you rarely ever needed to gas two gas cars at the same time), and the extremely rare occasions both cars are low, we take turns or one can use L1 or grab a quick charge at the Walmart EA station 5 miles away. \n\nThe difference between two EVs and one EV and one gas car is *never* stopping for gas or an oil change instead of stopping half as often! 😁\n\nAs far as the \"tandem\" problem, I don't have that issue, but my EVSE only reaches the left stall in my driveway, so we do need to occasionally juggle cars. If/when it bugs me enough, moving the EVSE to where it can reach either car will be a one time hassle/expense. I still don't ever see a need for upgrading my electrical service to charge two cars at once (and if I do, I'd probably just use a set of paired EVSEs that split power rather than add a second 50A circuit.)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20169906228113008,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1786590296154221,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1904841759240646,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2981107649800833,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2359174407111263,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2784158737866584,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17996010351149985,"ev_1":-0.13285231614358095,"ev_2":-0.2180524969522379,"ev_3":-0.1604375937967052,"ev_4":-0.22486530081368983,"ev_5":-0.2900592130449283,"ev_6":-0.2287880196329658},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

But this is an example of a [perfect solution fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy). \n\n*If I can't be treat every person 100% the way they wanted to be treated, I may as well go rape females every day, stab grandmas during robberies and shoot up schools... am I right? Why bother trying to treat people better if I can't please everybody to their most desired... may as well just fuck everybody over!*\n\nI can't be a 100% good person, so why try? This is the logic this statement follows. It's fallacious. It's a **garbage argument** to not go vegan, the same way someone might claim, *\"well cars use gas, and they will always pollute the environment... so why drive a hybrid? I may as well drive a gas guzzler!\"* Shit doesn't have to be 100% perfect to create a positive effect, or rather, low the negative affects.\n\n_______________\n\n&gt; \"You step on insects and your gastric juices kill bacteria as well. You are still a killer.\"\n\n1. Sure. But again, this is simply a perfect solution fallacy... it's also [false equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence) because it's no damn accident or mistake when you buy meat from a super-market and support the animal cruelty and environmental inefficiency - unless you're actively ripping apart ants or what-not: **different contexts**; not comparably situations\n\n2. We can't control our stomach killing bacteria. Furthermore, if the bacteria it's killing is harmful - why is this wrong? Veganism isn't about folding up to self-defense or survival... if harmful bacteria is going to harm you, then take meds if you choose to, to kill the harmful bacteria. Finally... [bacteria are not sentient beings](http://www.animal-ethics.org/beings-conscious/). To our scientific knowledge - they cannot suffer.\n\n____\n\n&gt; \"Climate change is an unfortunate cost of modernization. You can't do much by going vegan. We are going extinct anyway but not in my lifetime.\"\n\nAnd you can't do much of anything on such a small scale. So why do anything then? Why live? What's the point?\n\nHonestly this argument is such garbage on so many levels I could write an essay on it, but my mind might explode before I finish it.\n\nYet again - it's a perfect solution fallacy. Yes, modernization is going to have a sector of shitty environmental care, but that **doesn't mean it's justified to maximize it**.\n\nFurthermore - one person can make a difference going vegan... finally, it's a movement for fuck sakes! It's a collective effort. Sure, a $5 donation might not do much, but will $5,000,000? What if 1 million people decided not to make a $5 donation because they believed it wasn't going to do anything?\n\n____________________\n\n&gt; \"If you really love the environment, you will have to stop drinking coffee too because it uses a lot of freshwater in its production process. And then you cannot use gas-powered anything. Even your house.\"\n\nWell firstly, I don't drink coffee. But the last part... a-fucking-gain... **perfect solution fallacy**. Can't use gas because this and that... sure - it's optimal to use solar power or none-at-all, it's optimal to cut down on your energy use... but how does this dismiss veganism at all? How does this point say, *\"you shouldn't vegan\"*? Their reasoning is because veganism doesn't fix all the environmental problems, hence why it's yet again, another perfect solution fallacy. \n\n*\"Veganism doesn't fix all the environmental problems so I may as well just treat the planet like my personal garbage can\"*\n\n______________________\n\n&gt; \"The health benefit for going vegan is not substantial for the amount of effort it takes and the hate it gets. I can eat a little meat with a lot of veges, workout regularly and my health will still be in good shape.\"\n\nSure... but I'm not a selfish. I actually care about animals and the environment - **which are undeniably better off under veganism**.\n____________________\n\n&gt; \"If everybody goes vegan, you will have to grow a lot of vegetables and it will clear a lot of forests and lands. That's not good for the environment.\"\n\nThe ignorance is strong within this rebut! \n\nOkay. So... I made an answer on [beef and land usage](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3nczwp/i_need_help_understanding_this_article_someone/cvmwwd6), you may want to check that out. It's in that post. It's simply not true that we'd use more land if we were all vegans... fun fact: the average meat eaters [needs 18 times more land](http://www.earthsave.org/pdf/ofof2006.pdf) to obtain all their food, per year, than a vegan does... yes, **18 times more**.\n\n______\n\nI can break down an argument more, but it's overwhelming when there are 6 to touch on, so perhaps they might appear to be a bit sloppy.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2712378356321624,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24224794548975473,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11974033035880784,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20579286980522743,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38609606194666624,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32229360172372984,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07464828249209556,"solar_1":-0.10895016408557917,"solar_2":-0.10152357714027256,"solar_3":-0.08897720959549246,"solar_4":-0.0574800433200534,"solar_5":-0.11973419007131895,"solar_6":-0.04810493563676914,"solar_7":-0.07134390038246116,"solar_8":-0.027805483543438,"solar_9":-0.046904461723642044,"solar_10":-0.24451760058066158},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.\n\nThis text expresses personal opinions and individual actions, not shared expectations among a social group.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Orbital flywheels such as the space station featured in 2001 A Space Odyssey could provide storage at planetary levels. \n\nAll kinds of things are possible and eventually will almost certainly come to pass. The issue is that we have to deal with the real politics of today where there is vast amounts of money concentrated in the hands of those who derive their power from scarcity. Waiting patiently for those parties to invest in large-scale storage will mean waiting for time periods that would be measured in centuries. \n\nThat's why batteries are topical. Batteries are hot because, like rooftop solar and also like the internet, they allow change to take place at the edges of the system rather than at the center. Sure there are better more efficient and promising mega-scale solutions which seem much simpler, cleaner and promising than batteries but they don't scale down to the local individual level to the point where individuals with very limited salaries and small-scale use cases can make them happen. \n\nBatteries are a lousy solution but they're one of the only ones that scales small enough conveniently to make a difference. It's not that they're a good idea, it's more that they're the only idea small and convenient enough. \n\nHowever, there is another possibility for distributed storage that hasn't really caught on yet and I'm working on it myself and sharing my results openly. I'll be publishing them here soon but I've already shared them a bit on Facebook and through e-mail which is small scale solar thermal storage for household heating and cooling. \n\nI've been doing experiments with calcium nitrate and potassium nitrate brines for solar thermal storage in a two hundred gallon tank which is primarily filled with gravel. This is a far cheaper solution for storing heat than using electric batteries. There are many solutions to distributed energy which have not even entered the public's imagination yet.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.012868575751781464,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25202910376549315,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2372012685418295,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2735230492543694,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2608202111368569,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32867354018988426,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23316482868606717,"solar_1":-0.0718948385980682,"solar_2":-0.20338048640002454,"solar_3":-0.10997724389269906,"solar_4":-0.03962099363570146,"solar_5":-0.04296526890427036,"solar_6":-0.07080381597976763,"solar_7":-0.06085738501375696,"solar_8":-0.021776234863204187,"solar_9":-0.014162678627961611,"solar_10":-0.12215444261278208},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

You should see a number of installers pop up beyond the national chains. I recommend starting with local companies as they are often more interested in cultivating a reputation and not just getting you to sign as quickly as possible. Some national chains may not even come to your site until you have at least signed a first level agreement.\n\nOnce you start to see companies that look interesting after clicking on their sites, another way to filter or screen is to look for reviews. If the site doesn't already show some or link you to some, look for their links to FB/Google+. And you can always search for the on [Solar Reviews](http://www.solarreviews.com/). You could even start there by entering your zip code and looking for those with the more active reviews (count and currency).\n\nIf you are more looking for a starting point to collect information without the sales effort, there are a number of sites that provide very basic and broad information that also generate leads for solar installers. Their goal will still be to get you to provide information so you can \"get a quote\", but there is no pressure.  Solar Reviews has some basic information. As do [EnergySage](https://www.energysage.com/solar/), [Understand Solar](https://understandsolar.com/start/), and others. I'm not recommending any one of them, and I caution that they are very \"generic\" and may not always be strictly up to date especially regarding state policies, etc. And Energy Sage has some reviews as well, but it seems a lot less active/popular than the others.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.21493121182235578,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06004196020924155,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19956534971509926,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04704970493912697,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30615110818155244,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2131446689354741,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20140146762908748,"solar_1":-0.0044023986799099175,"solar_2":-0.007746285911707673,"solar_3":-0.000306669391648029,"solar_4":-0.0012969580535961238,"solar_5":-0.0002889336368146663,"solar_6":-0.050614183698358774,"solar_7":-0.0030117344116054787,"solar_8":-0.0005193187049978102,"solar_9":-0.0005742323119193316,"solar_10":-0.0020346895908005536},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The cost of the damage to all three homes was covered by each of their homeowners insurance policies.  (However, as a result of this incident in San Antonio, it appears as though some of the insurance companies may be altering their policies towards the exclusion of solar damage, and/or increasing the cost of coverage of solar.)\n  In all three cases, some of the modules survived undamaged.  I believe one of the systems was completely replaced despite some of the modules being intact, but the other two homes received replacements to just the modules that were damaged.  All three cases required us to remove the entire array and to reinstall them after each of the new roofs had been installed.\n  In the past we have had to perform this same operation of \"tear-down and rebuild\" from hail damage to roofs, where the arrays remained completely intact.  From my experience, these types of incidents are extremely rare, and it is even more unlikely for the modules to be damaged.  \n\nFor the most part, I would say that the systems are more than likely to withstand all but the most catastrophic hail storms.  \n\n(I am waiting for a colleague to email me the images of the modules from this storm and I will post them a little later.)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010843536595833332,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19373913750409882,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15971392194830125,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2538991268298695,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.0325149935204081,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27903757152299435,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013416021965288868,"solar_1":-0.22734067598260785,"solar_2":-0.040844015153804016,"solar_3":-0.061590993903034054,"solar_4":-0.10522079456920135,"solar_5":-0.08547669626326145,"solar_6":-0.10248811745744509,"solar_7":-0.07624780391536963,"solar_8":-0.11315499715298453,"solar_9":-0.059604266758896074,"solar_10":-0.1249552839435637},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

It contains blatant flaws anyone with experience in the field of engineering or energy systems could identify.  Many of their \"solutions\" are full of false assumptions and outlandish scenarios that would be catastrophic to the environment if implemented.  \n\nEven in that short list.  \n\n-Meltdowns don't happen with new reactor designs.  Even with all old designs factored in, nuclear prevents the most deaths out of any energy source.  Even wind and solar are more deadly.  \n\nDo you support hydroelectric? I certainly do.  \n\n-Tritium releases are harmless, radiation exposure from nuclear power plant tritium are orders of magnitude below any threshold deemed harmful.  You get more radiation from the \"organic banana\" in your morning smoothie than tritium leaking from nuclear plants.  \n\n-Uranium mines aren't \"abandoned\" they are properly decommissioned when they have reached their extractable limit.  The mining footprint for toxic minerals and REEs in renewables is far more devastating to the environment than uranium extraction.\n\n-mine-tailings, see above.  Cadmium, lead, chromium and other toxic minerals required for solar panels and wind turbines create more waste than the nuclear footprint.  \n\n-Radioactive waste is not a problem, it is actually a valuable resource.  I have explained this multiple times already.  \n\n-Any version of the proliferation argument is pretty much fossil fuel industry garbage.  This has been debunked many times.  Any nation state that wants to make nuclear weapons can do so without a reactor.  Handling nuclear materials is also under some of the strictest regulations and accountability measures in the world.  \nhttps://phys.org/news/2017-11-nuclear-energy-likelihood-proliferation.html\n\n-Confounding weapons tech with energy tech is the peak of dishonesty or ignorance.  Only someone with less than entry level knowledge of nuclear technologies would make that connection.  The stuff in weapons is of much higher enrichment than what is used in most reactors.  \n\nNuclear energy is actually the primary economic force in nuclear disarmament.  We recycle missiles to make clean energy.  \n\nAny more claims you need debunked?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0911495122127235,"1.1.1_stance":-0.31073433011867263,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17802092644737094,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2855183277719269,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23532033529521001,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.02822921352465831,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.012483378814067692,"solar_1":-0.06565811584514017,"solar_2":-0.05792916602510445,"solar_3":-0.020172636737697758,"solar_4":-0.019519054494594457,"solar_5":-0.003931878268000825,"solar_6":-0.016109230273286812,"solar_7":-0.032453715153678786,"solar_8":-0.007387000943102369,"solar_9":-0.10021125231287442,"solar_10":-0.04852242677588947},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Assuming the standard 25 year warranty, you'll have made an additional $19,992 on the 14.29 years remaining.  You can add in the $30 fee after 2027 to see how things change (though that fee may exist whether or not you have solar so maybe you'd consider it a wash).\n\nAnother back of the envelope calculation is  $84 * 12 is $1,007/yr. So if you are able to offset that, then your breakeven point is about 15 years and then you have another 10 years that you aren't paying $1,007/yr.\n\nAs others have mentioned, if you just want to make money, chances are, over 25 years, you'll do better in the stock market, particularly if you're buying now, during a downturn. \n\nAlso, as others have said, if you are looking at the 5 year horizon, it isn't going to make sense. Longer term, it might.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00019756253944554678,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06044452667902078,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20334798800596976,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.5423931437088294,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2638007070719488,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18327156395805608,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.020558602462794322,"solar_1":-0.17259778276679935,"solar_2":-0.2080210354129548,"solar_3":-0.020930955416891567,"solar_4":-0.0853080442099719,"solar_5":-0.0060676352950395085,"solar_6":-0.002577027233201079,"solar_7":-0.006668274282371082,"solar_8":-0.1290200649655162,"solar_9":-0.07257447763227276,"solar_10":-0.038285552960587665},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

So, we have a design issue now, with forced shade.\n\n  This means that our peak panel generates 1.37 kWh and our weaker panels are closer to 482 kWh -- same day (so same nominal sun) --\n\nAnother issue, that you are raising, is whether they really have a static heliostat or its an advertising issue and not a reality.  They claim that the band will stay static -- in place -- throughout the day.  It will shift on the seasons time scale, but not daily.  So, I think the pre-conception that we all have that a heliostat needs a motor to sync with the sun may not be correct. If you aren't asking for a focus point you need a motor to move the mirror.  By giving up on a focus point, and accepting a band of light, you get a static band, rather than a moving point. \n\nIf they are right about this, than an eleven dollar mirror, bent to a convex facing parabola will throw a solar panels worth of light back to the array and spread it over three or four panels.  That light will be delivered all through the day.  So, it should be a measurable change in the entire arrays output.

YOU HAVE to get batteries to make it worthwhile, which makes it almost impossible to get any kind of ROI.

Spend your money on home efficiency upgrades (insulation, windows, more efficient air conditioning, appliances, whole house fan, etc.) Get your electricity usage as low as possible. If you don't like the fluctuation in monthly bills, contact the utility and get on one of their cost smoothing payment plans. Instead of $300 Summer bills and $120 bills the rest of the year. You will pay somewhere in the middle year-round which is easier to budget for and doesn't seem like such a hit when summer rolls around. \n\nPeople are still doing solar under NEM 3, but I think it's a mistake and they will never see the return on investment they get promised by any of the solar reps.\n\nAnd DO NOT DO A PPA OR LEASE!!!

And there’s a pyramid on steps to take first starting with low hanging fruit and moving onward. Essentially, you want to start with a home energy audit and ideally a blower test to understand how leaky your home is, then you take care of the easy things like going 100% LED on your lighting, caulking, door seals, before working on your envelop including air sealing your attic. When appliances go out, replace them with electric EnergyStar replacements. And for your dryer and water heater, replace them with heat pump options. Don’t forget to claim those fancy irs credits and enjoy lower bills, a more comfortable home, and a better picture of what your true home energy demands are if your home is efficient. https://arrowelec.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/2010-conservation-pyramidsm.jpg","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2998040334789407,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2889446246698423,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18128701002682293,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19079994528240335,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24626087155182527,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.013205943638846898,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17568386357743293,"solar_1":-0.21323515815081948,"solar_2":-0.2070336922976693,"solar_3":-0.0068228741123069385,"solar_4":-0.016437694286044763,"solar_5":-0.0013650294325392072,"solar_6":-0.006750738516226799,"solar_7":-0.03371623345447006,"solar_8":-0.005134937375260051,"solar_9":-0.034891627178391595,"solar_10":-0.09004611715014714},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Newsflash: you can be vegan and never consume soy. Ever. Soy is not the devil, but it's not the innocent lamb some of you make it out to be. I would be very wary if \"processed\" soy is a part of your daily diet. Here is why:\n\n1) 93% of the soy grown in the USA is Monsanto GMO / roundup ready (as per wikipedia), so if it is not labelled organic it's GMO. GMO crops work by placing genes into the soy that provide a resistance to Monstano's roundup herbicide. The farmers then just have to regularly drench the crops in roundup to kill all competing weeds and increase yields. \n\nRoundup is one of the most toxic things out there, for people, as well as wild animals and the environment. If you buy GMO soy you are supporting these practices and eating food that surely contains traces of roundup on it. I haven't even mentioned the controversial aspects of eating the GMO foods themselves.\n\n2) Un-fermented soy products such as soy milk, soy protein, soy protein isolate, etc. are modern inventions. They have only been widely consumed by people in recent times. We did not evolve eating food like this, and there is no body of historical data showing safe consumption over generations. These are NOT natural foods. They are often created using chemical processes.\n\n4) There is also controversy around soy estrogens. Most of the comments here are along the lines of \"ha ha I haven't grown a third breast therefore it's completely safe! LOL.\" Sorry to interject with rational thought, but just because you aren't mutated or dead doesn't mean something is safe for you. Going back to my previous point, I do not think that studies that monitor a high consumption of these phytoestrogens over a human lifetime have been properly done, since these foods are so new. Keep in mind that most studies out there today on soy do not factor in some misguided vegan consuming 4-5 servings a day of processed soy.\n\nThe only soy foods that I believe are safe to eat regularly are the traditional, fermented, Japanese soy products: tempeh, natto, miso, brewed soy sauce that come from 100% organically grown soy beans. The fermentation processes remove a lot of the estrogens in soy and thus makes it a lot safer to eat. These foods have been eaten for 100s of years and therefore are proven safe, and there are no chemical processes that enable their creation.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.14323452818657478,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17427277003788655,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21176570568150482,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23845793788321815,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22541850939341637,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1927414874723016,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17954634254402344,"diet_1":-0.19715101808952584,"diet_2":-0.22582885155040255,"diet_3":-0.1865137904528572,"diet_4":-0.16272091661682522,"diet_5":-0.0642501455367892,"diet_6":-0.06474194640376026,"diet_8":-0.03772318855044432,"diet_9":-0.057451997226356376,"diet_10":-0.11474028844652935,"diet_11":-0.15757604210375575,"diet_13":-0.02856137448300918,"diet_14":-0.2583807037898394,"diet_17":-0.12464120326074922},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

But a dairy cow (count in two dead calves) produces 24 000 litres of milk in a lifetime, which is more dairy based meals than the 500 kg of beef from one. A laying hen will produce about 450 eggs in a lifetime, versus a few kilograms of meat. Counting it as meals per death, vegetarianism is generally better than a meat based diet.\n\nCounting it in terms of C02 emissions shows the same conclusion. An Average American’s diet has a foodprint of around 2.5 t CO2e per person each year.  For the Vegetarian it’s 1.7 t CO2e and for the Vegan it is 1.5 t CO2e.  Each of these estimates includes emissions from food that is eaten, wasted by consumers and lost in the supply chain.\nhttp://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet\n\nAnd secondly, most vegetarians I know don't just sub in a block of cheese for meat at every meal. They're actively trying to reduce the amount of animal products they eat, but maybe still want to be able to go get a weekly pizza with friends or not worry about that 0,2% milk powder in potato chips.\n\nVegetarianism is a lot easier than veganism, yet still brings some benefit.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1677995294531646,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05847508090807553,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.4073751209512011,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2156767345308578,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20641634045623156,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2974518177505075,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05258259359591951,"diet_1":-0.20573665845936479,"diet_2":-0.14737401546502124,"diet_3":-0.030358486804554257,"diet_4":-0.11402954617364429,"diet_5":-0.2119385563864513,"diet_6":-0.07258183846417533,"diet_8":-0.00855880596282077,"diet_9":-0.01826547288146685,"diet_10":-0.16105857693403497,"diet_11":-0.10354963905774639,"diet_13":-0.01425173853446419,"diet_14":-0.16838039194893403,"diet_17":-0.00792930669801232},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The billboards stand at a giant 7.5m high and will target commuters travelling both northbound and southbound on the M5 near Birmingham. **Over the two week period the billboards are estimated to reach 1.6 million people**.\"](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us/media-centre/media-releases/massive-vegan-billboard-raises-awareness-dairy) \n\nPlus I found [this information about Americans](https://imagine-express.com/billboard-advertising-effective/) that explains: \"The most recent study about billboard advertising was published in 2009 and is called the Arbitron National In-Car Study. According to this study, billboard advertising was found to be effective on drivers. Here’s a few a few statistics the study reported:\n\n* 71% of Americans consciously look at billboard messages while driving and many learn about an event or restaurant they later attended.\n\n* 37% report looking at an outdoor ad each or most of the time they pass one.\n\n* 58% learned about an event or restaurant they were interested in attending by viewing a roadside billboard.\n\n* 56% of Americans mentioned a billboard they found funny in conversation\n\n* 26% noted a phone number written on a billboard and 28% noted a website address written on a billboard\"\n\nSo let us start with 1.6million people who drove past the ad, then assume that only 71% of them actually noticed and read it. **That would give us 1,136,000 people who are either annoyed or thinking about the message at least**.\n\nIf we go with the **idea that 28% will remember the website address and go check it out, that gives us 448,000 people from one billboard who potentially get to the website**. \n\n[\"Beyond Meat has not only **sold more than 25 million Beyond Burgers worldwide**—it’s poised to be the first company of its kind to go public and valued at half a billion dollars.\" and \"Beyond Meat products are now sold in over 32,000 grocery stores.\"](https://mercyforanimals.org/beyond-meat-has-sold-over-25-million-vegan) **Though obviously a lot of those buyers are going to be repeat customers, as well as some people who decide not to buy them again, so these numbers doesn't specifically correlate to 25,000,000 people trying vegan burgers**. However in my experience, one of the best ways to get someone genuinely interested or even excited about plant-based foods is to let them try the food, rather than show or tell them stuff that they might find upsetting. I've had people be extremely hostile when they found out that I was vegan, but after trying something like the beyond burger they not only calmed down- one went vegan, and the others have started to cut meat from their diets by eating more plant-based meats or even learning to make ethnic vegan foods, or veganize their childhood favorites. \n\nAt the same time, I feel like the billboards are an important part of the equation for people like me who needed MANY different little proddings before I decided to take the leap. There's also the added weight of how very public the billboard is, which (to me at least) says that the advertising company saw this and could have said no, but they found it acceptable enough to post publicly, which kinda adds at least a tiny bit more credibility to it than something like stickers or chalk messages.\n\nEdit: Added bold for the main numbers I estimated out.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.47644370794296265,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23337215837091208,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.08418008539433686,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20378795792411503,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23490875877796497,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2240723572049383,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04852416987220446,"diet_1":-0.12775187106987257,"diet_2":-0.026514161377917844,"diet_3":-0.13349703019998585,"diet_4":-0.235468576651443,"diet_5":-0.23646457369926221,"diet_6":-0.13236421479632354,"diet_8":-0.15420220497374496,"diet_9":-0.211167861319448,"diet_10":-0.04330190540727017,"diet_11":-0.1321839347806332,"diet_13":-0.14666867542493672,"diet_14":-0.13354758570641087,"diet_17":-0.10772801314772096},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.

Learn how to cook, boiled foods are your friend. I have a long story with my parents, mostly because I refused to eat meat at 14 and we raised all our meat, and I helped. I am ashamed to say I have kill many animals I never ate. I still ate fish and eggs, at that time. I understand your frustration. Learn how to cook so when you live by yourself you will have all the tools to be vegan. When we moved to a city, I stopped eating so much fish and my mother kindly agreed to make one pot of soup for me and one for the family every week as long as I agreed to  help. I am a master at soup now. At some point my mother would cry at the table, and i started eating in my room. For 4 years my mother never saw me eat, only 1/4 years I still lived with them. Now, when I go home, they buy me soy milk (they even know which one to buy) and my mother makes me some form of bean base vegetable soup, its refreshing. I am 22 now. However, every parent is different and I can imagine this being not okay in many homes, this is simply my story. My suggestion is to ask your parents to teach you how to cook, and express that you want to cook vegan meals. Boiling, frying, roasting is all the same, just with not animal products. This way they might agree, because they arent buying different food for you, they would be incorporating different meals into their diet, spending more time with you as well preparing you for the future.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0828221570700028,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19651522753678327,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22701651380833304,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19992428214886493,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1259302276885137,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.35049360502537785,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.33634648572878234,"diet_1":-0.25530823199536773,"diet_2":-0.21458900258254943,"diet_3":-0.15932728645070426,"diet_4":-0.20706057787290194,"diet_5":-0.17000986483322614,"diet_6":-0.09055643058381257,"diet_8":-0.01012642798680948,"diet_9":-0.2383391045150347,"diet_10":-0.24529484333390691,"diet_11":-0.056077882602645936,"diet_13":-0.2365005676912003,"diet_14":-0.1705314843106054,"diet_17":-0.21242402827994422},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Plant protein in general isn't as high quality for us as animal protein, plant proteins are much more often incomplete proteins which means more care needs to be taken to combine them to supply all of your essential amino acids. Plant proteins are typically less digestible than animal proteins. \n\nSure, you can eat rice and beans and survive. I'm eating 230g of protein a day right now on a 1,800 calorie diet though, 230g of protein is around 5,700 calories from rice and beans, and over 900g of carbs, it's also like 10lbs of food lol. Sure, that's an extreme example, I could add soy and other sources, but regardless it's a lot harder to hit my macro and calorie ranges with a vegan diet without using boatloads of protein powder.\n\nI'm not against it if someone wants to be vegetarian or vegan, but we evolved to have meat included in our diets.
