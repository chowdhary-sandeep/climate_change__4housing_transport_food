"comment": "The only way to make the car use less kWhrs is to make it lighter, smaller, and/or more aerodynamic. The Dual carbon battery promises greater energy density, so you can have more kWhrs for the same size and weight. So if there is a dual carbon battery made for the model S, it will almost certainly be greater than 85 kWhrs.\n\n\n[My home-built electric car](http://www.diyelectriccar.com/garage/cars/336) weighs only 2400 lbs, has only a 10 kWhr pack, consumes 240 Whr/mi, and can go 40 miles. The model S weighs 4647 lbs, uses an 85 kWhr pack, consumes 350 Whr/mi, and can go 250 miles. My car sucks compared to a model S, but mine is still more efficient simply because it weighs half as much. (also, mine only cost me $4000)",

EV, they will install a separate submeter just for your charging station (which can record usage and time of usage).  EV + Home, it sounds like they will change the meter that feeds your entire home with one that can record time-of-use.  \n\nBut, I'm not convinced the EV+Home is a good deal -- the peak daytime kWh rates are higher on the EV + Home plan than the residential schedule.  Sure, you get dirt cheap kWh at night ... but in daytime when you need airconditioning, it looks like it's about 9c/kWh for the generation charge on EV+Home, as opposed to about 6c/kWh for the generation charge on standard residential rates.\n\nYMMV obviously, but yes - it sounds like it's worth looking into the EV only rate schedule.  I'm going to call them later today and ask some questions.",

The rest are therefore charged with low power AC.\n\nProbably this will change as the SC network grows - maybe to 10% SC miles on average?\n\nIf 10% of total US vehicle miles are EV miles (300B of 3T, ~20M EVs on the road), and 10% of EV miles are charged with high power DC, then only 1% of total vehicle miles will be refueled by DC charging.\n\nRough numbers:\n\n50 kW DC can charge ~70 miles per 30 minutes.\n\n100 kW DC can charge ~140 miles per 30 minutes.\n\ngasoline vehicles can refuel ~300 miles in 5 minutes.\n\n100 kW DC is therefore ~12x as slow as gasoline refueling.\n\nWith these assumptions, there are roughly 90x as many gasoline miles being \"recharged\" as electric miles, and because EV charging is slower there would need to be about 7x as many gasoline resupply points as EV DC charging station points to handle similar capacities.",

If GM manages to get a competitor ready in time, every other big car company should be able to do that as well. It might be possible that Tesla loses it's edge in battery tech as soon as the big fishes smell the potential (happened already IMO). I don't see how Panasonic is the only possible supplier of batteries with a reasonable capacity/price ratio in the future. And I don't see them selling their technology to Tesla exclusively. How will the Gigafactory compete with Chinese factories, if the Chinese government decides to grab this market (as they did with solar)?",

But whatever, the Model 3 has the SuperCharger network and the Bolt does not. The Model 3 will be a car that can realistically take an occasional road trip while the Bolt would be a challenge to use for anything more than a town car with a great range.

"comment": "Even when I was trying to see a Zero S (electric motorcycle) in person, I couldn't. There is only one dealer of them in all of New England and they only have one Zero FX, a tiny dirt bike from 2012, which is before they upgraded the suspension, batteries, brakes, etc. It's a bike that has almost no resemblance to the look or performance of the current Zero sport bikes. If I wanted to buy an S sport bike, I'd have to buy it sight unseen. \n\nEven the salesman was kind of shitting on the one bike they had, saying it gets almost no miles to a charge and I should just buy a Triumph instead. They had one Zero poster on the wall in the entire store and it was of \"the new Zero, coming out in 2013\" and sun-bleached as hell. \n\nAs someone who already owns a Tesla, the whole thing was depressing. I feel bad for Zero. They make an objectively awesome bike (0-60 in 3.3 seconds, top speed 100mph, 200 city miles to a charge), they could probably be selling way more in New England if it wasn't for these cock-blocks. \n\nNever send an ICE salesman to do an EV salesman's job!",

Put simply, motorists are going to have a lot more copper in their cars.\n\n&gt; The Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt (both of which will be launched imminently) will be the first mass market EVs that can be driven 200 miles on a single charge — the minimum many commentators say is needed if cars solely powered by batteries are to go mainstream in the US.\n\n&gt; Their arrival marks an inflection point. Once EVs start matching conventional vehicles for convenience, the speed at which they become commonplace will depend primarily on price.\n\n&gt; At the moment batteries are the main obstacle. The packs needed to power a midsized car for 200 miles currently cost about $15,000. So the models that use them are more expensive than a $25,000 Toyota Camry — America’s top selling passenger car last year. The relative costs are even more prohibitive in the compact vehicle segment that dominates the European, Chinese and Indian markets. But we expect this disadvantage will narrow significantly over the next decade as battery costs halve.\n\n&gt; At BHP Billiton, our mid-case forecast sees dramatic growth in electric vehicles. Today, there are about 1.1bn light vehicles globally. About 1m of these are EVs. By 2035, we are likely to see about 140m EVs on the roads, or 8 per cent of the total fleet of 1.8bn.\n\n&gt; That should be a big boost in copper demand. Today’s conventional internal combustion engine cars contain about 20kg of copper. Hybrids use about 40kg. An average pure battery powered electric car requires about 80kg, four times the amount of a conventional vehicle. Most is spread across the wiring harness (roughly one quarter); the engine (roughly two-fifths) and the battery (roughly one-third).\n\n&gt; Building the EV fleet will use about 11m tonnes of copper. Subtract the amount that would have been used in the conventional vehicles ‘displaced’ by EVs, and that figure comes down to about 8.5m tonnes of genuine new demand — equivalent to more than a third of total global copper demand today. At current prices this would be worth about $38bn of a $100bn annual market.\n\n&gt; In comparison, that level of EV growth would displace about 2m barrels of oil demand per day in that year, worth about $37bn annually at today’s prices in a $1.8tn market.\n\n&gt; Long-term forecasting is not an exact science. At BHP we use scenario analysis to understand the range of plausible outcomes. For example, there is clear potential for EVs to use more copper than they do today as the class evolves. And it is worth noting that in our high case forecast, which assumes faster technological change and more policy support, the size of the EV fleet in 2035 is more than double what we incorporate in our mid case.",

However, it's going to change total energy consumption embodied in the final vehicle as well. Electrifying mining equipment is good, but it's still energy use and those batteries are going to be big. The scope of assessing all of that would be several publications worth of work itself.\n\nI feel confident that using current emissions with various pathways is proportional to the energy required over the lifetime. Batteries are energy intensive. \n\nRather than hunch let's go a step.\n\n[Source](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yelin_Deng/publication/316884465_Manufacturing_energy_analysis_of_lithium_ion_battery_pack_for_electric_vehicles/links/5a177572aca272df0808b3bb/Manufacturing-energy-analysis-of-lithium-ion-battery-pack-for-electric-vehicles.pdf?origin=publication_detail)\n\nA 24 kWh battery takes 89GJ primary to make. So a longer range vehicle it takes let's say 250 GJ.\n\n250GJ can make a lot of hydrogen. About 95,000 mi worth of hydrogen for a Mirai. \n\nYeah, even with manufacturing improvements I'm comfortable with the the idea the FCEV will only take slightly more emissions or energy compared to a BEV.",

The good thing is that they can increase production if they need to and their factory workers will have experience building that car so switching to full EV would be easy once there is enough demand for it. Right now VAG is using the profits from their ICE lineup to develop their EVs, so they need to get as many sales as possible, that means that they will have to build whatever the market demands and right now the market for EVs it's not large enough to justify a big reduction in production of ICE vehicles. EV demand will grow in the near future and VAG will keep increasing its production but we must remember that VAGs goal is to sell cars, for them the drivetrain is not really that improtant as long as they sell them, if the market wants EVs they will sell EVs, if the market wants hamster powered vehicles they will sell hamster powered vehicles.",

"comment": "The point didn't make sense, so OP suggested an alternative. The original point was that Tesla was selected over Leaf and Bolt because it was...larger? That isn't a top 3 reason. Then the person said Tesla should go with more \"traditional\" designs, undermining their previous point that Blackberry stuck with a traditional design (keyboard) and that was its undoing. \n\nIf it weren't for Musk's personality turning so many people off, it would be commonplace to accept that Tesla is to EVs what Apple is to smart phones. \n\n1. First mover advantage (even though neither Tesla nor Apple invented their categories, they were first to market with a widely-appealing product and were able to scale quickly). \n2. A sleek minimalist approach to design. Reduce parts wherever possible.\n3. Focus on ease of use. Automate as much as possible.\n4. Create a walled garden in both software and hardware. \n5. Pricing power and production efficiency result in industry-leading profit margins.\n6. The brand becomes identified with the industry even though both have less than 25% market share globally.",

These appliances run on electricity and [*move* heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSvn3UzbPGY), instead of creating it, and so can be three to five times more efficient than traditional gas or electrical resistance heaters. “For a lot of people, a heat pump is going to be their biggest personal impact,” said Sage Briscoe, the federal senior policy manager at Rewiring America, a clean-energy think tank. (Heat pumps have become so iconic that Rewiring America even has a [heat pump mascot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px24dAKSFKA).)...switching to a heat pump can save homeowners anywhere from $100 to $1,200 per year on heating bills and prevent anywhere from 1 to 8 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. For comparison, going vegan for an entire year saves about 1 metric ton of CO2 emissions....In some areas, it can be difficult to find a contractor trained and willing to install them; some homeowners report that contractors share misinformation about heat pumps, including that they don’t work in cold climates. (Modern heat pumps do work in cold climates, and can heat a home even when outdoor temperatures are down to [minus-31 degrees Fahrenheit](https://grist.org/housing/heat-pumps-do-work-in-the-cold-americans-just-dont-know-it-yet/).)\n\n&gt; **Electric Vehicles**\n\n&gt; **Rooftop solar** — the best choice for generating clean energy\n&gt;\n&gt; Tax credit available now: 30 percent of the cost of installation, no cap\n\nCheck out [Rewiring America's calculator](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator)",

"comment": "Assuming we are just talking about DC fast charging, EVs have a charging curve due to battery physics that take into account things like battery temperature, etc. Typically the fastest charging happens when the battery is at optimal temp (many EVs can be preconditioned when close to a charger to get it to optimal temp) and when the battery percent is lower. Depending on EV it will ramp down at varying rates when battery gets fuller but most of the time 80% is the sweet spot to stop as typically charge rate decreases rapidly after this and only slows further as you near 100%. Charging at 50% or 20% is fine but yes charging rate could be different depending on that EVs charge curve.",

I think the non-Performance version should be made much plusher and leave the stiffer setup for those who choose the Performance model.\n\nTo me right now this is a the weakest link in the Tesla brand, and especially with regards the Y, where comfort over sportiness would be sought by most customers. In the UK and Ireland our roads at times can be quite bumpy, so comfort is certainly wanted by many drivers. I may recommend another buy a Y, but the firm suspension would probably put me off buying one personally, and would certainly have me mention to them to first be sure they are ok with the firm suspension before they commit; to pay attention to this if they test drive one.",

PAL was developed a few years later in Europe to work with their 50 hz systems. The two standards are technically very similar, with PAL giving a very slightly better image because the engineers learned a few things from seeing where NTSC has weaknesses and addresses those. For example, to those of us in video, we joke that NTSC means \"Never Twice Same Color\"\n\nLikewise, NACS engineers no doubt looked at the ccs devices and learned their weaknesses then designed them out of their system, while designing a system that was easy to support on the north American power grid. \n\nTesla's goal was to have the charging network in place before the cars, so they mass manufactured the components and installed more charging stations with better customer experience than all other vendors combined in a very short time.",

OK, I did say that I didn't want to do any mods.... but these kits look like an idiot such as myself can go out and find someone who is slightly less of an idiot than me to do this install! :-)\n\nSeriously though, these kits really look like a much cheaper option than shelling-out for an Ioniq 5!! Especially since older Bolts and Leafs are pretty damn cheap  (or is the plural \"Leaves\"?). I'll have to compare these inverter kits to the EcoFlow 800 watt Alternator Charger that just came out and see what the pros and cons would be using them to charge my EcoFlow Delta Pro. Looks like the inverter kit would supply 20% more power, and be a bit cheaper than the Ecoflow AltCharger unit. \n\nThanks again!",

So a 7kW system will still be producing after 25 years, it will just be a 6kW system at that point.   Yes you could replace it at 20 years with a new one but if you owned it you most likely wouldn't.   \n\nThe sales people often do things like maintenance included.   Solar system maintenance is very low.  They often use pretty high electric power inflation rates (though so do some sales companies).\n\nThere have been some problems with them slow rolling the installs in some areas and not performing required electric upgrades (failing electric inspections).",

I did forget to post that the standard parking space is about 2 kW to 2.5 kW of solar panels.\n\nAssuming that all 1,000 spaces are clear, you could have an installed capacity (lower end estimate) of 2 MW (2,000 kW). A higher end estimate would be 2.5 MW (2,500 kW) of solar car ports.",

"comment": "Awesome response! Thank you for the thorough discussion of the issues involved. It seems to me like there is some math that I need to really think through before I can fully digest what you've said, but I'm happy to have the information.\n\nOne quick thing regarding the moving parts and complexity. It seems to me that a solar power plant (in my imagination) ought to have two parts: one which collects the light and one which converts the light in to usable electricity. I don't know much, but it seems to me that simple tools from geometric optics should be able to separate these two components. Some of the solar solar concentrator power plants have really cool obelisks that would fit in at Burning Man, these plants seem to neatly separate collection from conversion.\n\nDo you know of any people who are doing stuff where the PV part of the setup is far removed from the collector part?\n\nThe reason I ask is that I could imagine a theoretical scenario in which PV works really well but only at incredibly hot temperatures. If there were such a PV contraption then it ought to be housed in a \"black box\" which collects all the light and which remains at a high temperature. (Please pardon the ambiguity of the phrase black box, I'm not sure what else to say.)",

Have they really paid out $150 billion in solar subsidies, or does that include the federal tax credit?  Also, is that $150 billion the construction subsidy only?  Net metering is an ongoing subsidy.  Net metering with TOU rates can be a significant subsidy for solar owners.  \n\nFor example, my first year of having solar, I paid about $0.06/kwh for electricity I took from grid, which is less than half the retail rate here in California. \n\nBefore solar I was subsidizing poor/elderly about $1,000/year. Once I installed solar, that was reversed and I was instead being subsidized about $1,000/year by non-solar owners.  Does the utility company get $1,000 in benefits every year from my solar array?  Maybe, but I doubt it.\n\nAlso, part of the reason for pushback from utilities is for engineering reasons, not purely financial.",

"comment": "~~Just for the record, and in the interest of education, those are solar ARRAYS.\nA solar cell is the little block that makes up a panel. These have 72 cells per panel.\nA solar panel is a series of solar cells and there are 19 on the left array and 10 on the right array.\nA solar array is a series of solar panels, of which you have two of.~~ Just look at the comment below.\n\nNow as for some of your other points:\n\n&gt;How much energy do they produce?\n\nJust looking at this photo it is impossible to tell, but some things that may get you closer to that answer are: What is the rating of each of the panels? as /u/ButchDeal posted, you can look at the back of the panels. Talk to someone that has access to that area and try and snap a photo of the sticker on the back of the panels. There should be a rating there. Once you get this rating, in theory, you should be able to have a much better idea of how much they produce. **Lets *imagine* that they are 300 W panels** (They really could be anywhere from 100-350 or so).\n\n(Keep in mind this is a really basic breakdown and real world conditions are much different, solar is a science).\n\n1. **Panel Rating** Each panel, if under perfect conditions, would instantaiously produce 300 W of power. If you did that for an hour, that would be 300 W * 1 hour = 300 Wh = .3 kWh. kWh are the most common unit of measuring the power produced by a system. Now, that power is just for each panel, so you must multiply by the # of panels. \n\n As mentioned before it looks like you have 19 + 10 panels = 29 panels. So for each hour, ideally, you would be producing 29 hours * .3 kW = 8.7 kWh.\n\n2. **Sun hours in your area:**Now you need to figure out how many hours a day, on average, the sun shines at this amount. This is an important distinction and this discussion could go on for awhile. But just know this: just because it is sunny 12 hours or 8 hours a day does NOT mean that counts as 8 sun hours in solar generation. Yes, your panels will likely produce energy most of the time it is sunny, but it is not the same as \"full sun\". There are many different types of tools to figure this out, and charts etc based on your area. Lets just go with 5 sun hours a day.\n\n So 5 sun hours a day, 365 days a year for 29 panels at .3kW = 15,877 kWh/year. \n\n3. **Value of electricity:**Now, you would want to figure out \"What is that worth to the school?\" ....this gets into electricity prices...how much is electricity, per kWh, in your area? It could be as high as $.40/kWh and as low as $.03/kWh. This is important to figure out. Things like Time of use could change this, commercial vs. residential, commercial vs. ag, etc.. So it is important to find out FOR THIS SPECIFIC SITUATION what the actualy cost/kWh is from the energy utility company.\n\n Lets just say, you find out it is $.10/kWh.\n\n So now, every kWh that system produces, means your school has to buy 1 kWh less of energy, or $.10 less of $$.\n\n So, 15,877 * .1 = $1,587 of electricity each year. \n\n4. **Lifetime of system:**But how long will this baby last? 5 years? 10 years? 15 years? 25 years? Industry experts have differing opinions and technology varies. Assuming this is a high quality setup (looks pretty decent but not incredible) it should go 25 years, maybe a bit less or more.\n\n So, $1,587 * 25 = $39,693 of electrcitiy over the lifetime. \n\n5. **Time value of Money:** BUT WAIT: That is in TODAYS dollars. So the $$ you get later, will be worth less. So the $1,587 you get in year 10 is worth less than the $1,587 in year 1. \n\n6. **Escalation of utility prices and market predictions:** BUT WAIT: Electricty prices are also rising! So the price of a kWh from the utility in 10 years might be...$.20/kWh?...$.25/kWh?...etc.. \n\n7. **Financing, incentives,etc:** BUT WAIT: Was there any incentives or cost reductions available to the school? Was there any warranties to cover possible damage? Could they have put that money in an investment fund and gotten a good rate? Did they pay cash upfront or finance a system? etc...\n\n**TL;DR: I wanted to give you a breakdown of how solar calulations work. These are very basic and are just a introduction to the world of solar energy and finance. Project financing in the energy sector is especially interesting because of all of the variables at hand. People are always talking online about \"Is solar worth it\" or \"Solar is a scam!\" etc.. without having ANY idea how the actual costs and finances break down. Each site is different and each situation varies drastically from one another. There are constants but for the most part it is best to talk to a professional who is familiar in your area and knows what they are doing! Good luck in school and keep working hard!!**",

"comment": "You haven't really given us enough information to determine what tariffs.  Which part of Duke Energy Carolinas are you under; Duke Energy or Duke Energy Progress?  Whats the nameplate size is your system?  Are you split metered? What are your outputs?  There are customers which massive systems qualified for small generator status that can gain interconnection status and get paid about the same price as utilities charge. But If you are a homeowner with 15kw and lower everything changes and let me be very clear: Duke (or Duke Energy Progress) is likely paying them near squat.  Your options, if you are a home owner, are to go through NC Green Power and get paid by off-setters for RECS, or to put up with the only two options Duke has [Net Metering Rider or Small Customer Generation Riders](https://www.duke-energy.com/generate-your-own-power/nc-rate-options-tariffs.asp), or DEP's Sunsense and Small Generators [programs](https://www.progress-energy.com/carolinas/home/renewable-energy/index.page?).  \n\n\n\n\nNow that is all assuming you've met general Interconnection requirements, and self installs always run into this issue when its time for Duke/DEP or to approve turn-on, because Pre-approved contractors are very nearly always a prereq for these programs (sunsense).  If you are still not satisfied by the rate schedule's listed in the [SCG Rider](https://www.duke-energy.com/pdfs/NCRiderSCG.pdf) or other links, then you may want to just track one of those many projects with a system that you think is getting paid for their excess and ask them, or go to any number of legitimate installers throughout the state and ask them, since they'd be pretty stupid as providers to not understand how to get their customers the best payback deals.",

"comment": "$800/kwh is roughly the added costs for a Storedge and powerwall vs regular solaredge install.   There are cheaper battery backup solutions than the powerwall, such as an OutBack Flexpower1 (or2,3,4, or radian series).  My entire system installed was $12k, thats about 10kwh of storage and 3kw of pv.   so a $4/w pv system, installed two years ago when the average was about $3.60/w for grid tie.   \nSo I paid about $1200 extra for bimodal.   Considering I normally would use only half of the batteries (though could go to 80% if needed), that comes to $240/kwh of storage.   \nThat would be on the low end but you can get pretty reasonably fully installed systems for $400/kwh (usable kwh).\nWe have done off grid installs (more costly) at $600/kwh.",

"comment": "Hello, my local utility has a Community Solar Garden and they are spending ~$14K per 72 panel array for the concrete slab that it sits on. Does a concrete slab provide a clear benefit that justifies the cost? They are paying 40K each for the rest of the array including install. Is the slab worth 30% of the project cost? They are charging customers $420 per panel for 20 years of use.  They are subsidizing a big chunk of the cost from a renewable energy fund.\n\nI'm just thinking that doing something like footings would be much less expensive. If the per panel cost was reduced by 20% to $336 per panel then the payback time would be much more attractive.\n\nBut maybe the slab provides a much better base for such a long array? (2x36 Portrait) I would just like some expert opinions before I ask the utility about it. This is in MN where the ground freezes deep, we get wind and snow loads.\n\nThanks",

"comment": "&gt; ... but with paying line charges and no net metering its hard to make the financial case to do this.  ....  My guess is that my house creating power went cost the power companies a cent beyond lost revenue. \n\nIn New Zealand the situation is much clearer than in many jurisdictions, as we don't have 'power companies\".  We have (deep breath) generators, transpower, your local lines company, and your chosen retailer.  So one can pick apart how this works and, literally, follow the money.\n\nThe only entity that rooftop PV really affects is the lines company.  Their business is all about capital investment, and their costs do not change in the short or medium term depending on how much electricity is used.  Once they put a transformer in a kiosk in the street, or a wire in the ground or the air, it's there for fifty odd years.  Because all their costs are static, and because people want some sort of semblance of fairness of allocating costs, thee way they do it is to tot up what their costs are, divide it by the KWh used over the year, and divvy the costs out that way.  So the more power you use, the greater share of the line companies static costs you pay.  Most folks think that is fair.\n\nThe other important thing is that they have to build their distribution network for the peak demand, which is what drives the scale of investment required, even if the majority of the time the system is only used at 20% capacity.\n\nIf one has PV on the roof, one uses less electricity during the day, and thus less electricity KWh overall, but one's peak use, which is for households occurs in the evenings, is unchanged.  So your need for the infrastructure is unchanged, but you pay for less KWh, and so the lines company part of that KWh is less, so you pay less than your fair share of that cost.\n\nSo from the lines company perspective, you're underpaying, and thus your portion of the cost is then spread to other consumers.  The EA had a consultative paper out on this recently.\n\nAnd that is why net metering is unfair.  Its very popular in these parts, because solar folks do well out of it, but that doesn't make it fair.\n\nI'd really like a solar system to play with, but it turns out that I get much better returns on using less power.",

"comment": "First of all, I'm located outside of Bellingham, WA. I think location is a pretty important factor in solar stuff. :-)\n\n&gt;Any unexpected project issues after commissioning?\n\nNo issues at all.\n\n&gt;How has the array held up to snow/ice on the roof?\n\nMy array is ground-mounted. It doesn't snow much here, but sometimes I'll go out with a long-handled RV brush to clean the snow off if it's going to last a while and be sunny.\n\n&gt;Are you actively tracking your existing payback or do you trust the system well enough?\n\nI track everything to extreme detail... because I'm a geek like that. I've had my system for just over 3 years and I'm currently cashflow positive and will always be from now on.\n\n&gt;What would you do differently this time around?\n\nI just wish I had done it sooner!\n\n&gt;Do you feel like the array adds to your property value or the opposite?\n\nIt definitely adds to the value. My 12 kW array reduces the power bill from $2,000/year to $200/year, which gives that much more cash available for a mortgage payment or whatever. I recently had an appraisal done and they estimated, using several pages of discussion and calculations, that my system adds $25,000 to the value of my home.\n\n&gt;Are you thinking about battery retrofits?\n\nNot really. The power rarely goes out, and we have net metering in my state so the grid is basically one giant free battery. A $600 generator is way cheaper than a battery system.\n\n&gt;Any issues with debris, mold, or animal nesting \"under\" the array?\n\nMine's ground-mounted out in a field so this isn't an issue. The biggest problem is the grass under it growing too tall.\n\n&gt;Anyone ever experiment with using heat tape to melt snow off of the array?\n\nI thought about it but I don't think it would be worth the gains I'd get since the sun is so low in the winter (and around here, it's usually cloudy in the winter anyway).",

So, it can be done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFYI That kit is lying, 4000Wp (watt peak) really won't produce close 750kWh worth of energy a month. I am a solar installer and at a site were I installed 5.12kWp they only produced around 600kWh on a summer. Pretty sure the kit makes its claim with IDEAL conditions. It is very hard to get close to that number in general conditions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to know how to design a solar kit for your needs, you can PM. I will try to help you explore this issue intuitively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, depending on your roof I might be able to advice you on how to install the kit such that you can remove it when you want to move.",

"comment": "Right, it should get cheaper as this technology scales up.\n\nWhat's the thinking behind this $100/ton goal?  This is the first I've heard of it.\n\nFWIW, when I did a different back-of-envelope calculation on throwing some solar panels on my roof in... a not too sunny part of the world, the cost was about $1,500 (with incentives) to provide carbon-free energy equivalent to a ton of CO2/year from coal.\n\nSo over 15 years that meets the $100/ton number, but obviously needs to be much cheaper to make this a slam dunk.  :)",

It turned out to have a property where it would ramp down current consumption if the voltage sagged, but then would never ramp it up again.  So I ended up building a shunt regulator  and mosfet that would power cycle the phone when it realized current was being wasted through the shunt.\n\nOn the other hand, some amazon usb power banks seemed to lack that property so they could basically go right into a suitable panel.\n\nNot sure where a bluetooth headset stacks up, but, USB charging and solar panels should be a fun project for anyone who loves i/v curves =)",

"comment": "To quote Steve Jobs \"People don't know what they want until you show them\".   Cost will only be an issue if they make it an issue.    You can illustrate some simple math and break it down at cost per mile vs cost per unit energy.   Most EVs get 3.5-4 miles per KWH and will probably hit 5 fairly soon.   For $00.24  per KWH (which is expensive) you can go with 24 cents/4 miles = $0.06 per mile.    \n\n\n$12 for 4-5 gallons is pretty cheap.  $2.40 per gallon (its well over $4 where I live).  $2.40/37 miles = $0.06 per mile.    \n\n\nThe cost of an EV with very expensive electricity prices and very cheap gas is about the same.  However, I question those prices.  He could likely pay a lot for peak power when he is running his AC but he could charge his car for off peak prices which are drastically cheaper.  Arizona for example has time of use pricing which in the summer is 24 cents per KWH between 2pm and 8pm is 24 cents per KWH but off peak prices are 7 cents per KWH.   If your market has off peak prices its going to be a lot less.   \n\n\n7 cents per KWH and its less than 2 cents per mile of electricity.   If you can get your own solar panels on the roof net metering can bring you down drastically.  A 5KW system more or less produces the equivalent of 12-15 miles per hour of sunlight.   \n\n\nThe Lincoln has a cost on the order of the Tesla Model 3.  $40k-ish.  But over time the Tesla will cost a lot less to operate and likely less to maintain.   15,000 miles with cheap electricity is $300.  15,000 miles with cheap gas is $600 but expensive gas is $1200+.  There is also the free charging spots for the Tesla which will bring down the price an owner pays per mile drastically.   There isn't really any comparable free gasoline anywhere (some credit cards give gasoline as a reward but thats it).    \n\n\nIf given the new option of a Tesla Model 3 or Lincoln Hybrid, like most people, I would go with the Tesla.",

"comment": "Hydrogen infrastructure is much much more expensive than a grid. \n\nAll you have to do is lay more copper/aluminum wire and connect it to a generator somewhere. And there are A LOT of options for charging. Yes, you can charge out of that 10a circuit. It'll be slow but it's doable. Especially at night when everything is off. \n\nFor hydrogen, every part of the infrastructure is expensive. It'll probably cost 2-5x more than the current gasoline infrastructure. That, and it's dangerous. Hydrogen is more dangerous to handle than LNG for a variety of reasons. As soon as a hydrogen fueling station blows up and kills some kids, it's going to lose popularity very quickly. \n\nI suspect the reason why Japan is going after hydrogen isn't a practical reason. It's because Japan is a conservative country and the big wigs want to maintain control over the infrastructure. Hydrogen allows you to do that. EVs don't as you can always throw up some solar panels and charge your car if you have the oil companies.",

Obviously, the EV battery storage does not normally last long in extreme winter climates, however advancements here could be a great overall benefit for all. \n\nI have not really put a lot of thought into this idea as well, was more of a brainstorm idea I had while BBQing with him",

I really had to get pushy and call the city myself for updates. \nFinancing company is downright predatory\n Pushy about autopayment, no web access without it. I can't see my balance. Payments due 2 months after installation (just putting panels on your roof NOT a working system) \nInterest begins right away. I DIDNT NOTICE MY FIRST 5 PAYMENTS WERE 100% INTEREST\nI had to call to get a balance.\nNo quality control. No monitoring. After several emails about performance was told to read my contract. I sent back screen shots of equipment rating.\nThey promis annual minimums not actual equipment performance.\nMy system peaks 18% lower than rating. \nSunrun referred me to the manufacturer.\nManufacturer was helpful. Wish I had called them instead imof sunrun.\nNo array map created. Sunrun registered as the owner and me as a lease holder. \nWhen I cleared that up, panels not installed ideal angle for peak production and one panel has not reported for 3 months. \nI would have never known if I hadn't gotten nosey about quality control. \nTesla battery gives me real time productivity. Sunrun gives reports with 24 hour delay. No real-time monitoring of any kind(not in contract) \nWent up to roof to wash panels and found cracked and broken roof shingles. \nGot lucky when I last called. Spent half an hour on the phone. Sent pictures of everything. \nSunrun is just here for your money. \nNot helpful before during or after install. Clearly I'm unhappy overall with my experience. \nYOUR ON YOUR OWN AND IN THE DARK ABOUT EVERYTHING NOTNIN THE CONTRACT.\nPerformance, failure, monitoring, proper installation of equipment. Not in the contract, up to you to prove its not working.\nThey slap it on the roof and walk away with your money.\nEven the tax break selling point, when I asked the saleman\"cant speak to that, everyone's situation is different \"\nCan't even point me to the form I should google. I'm not asking for tax advice but its nice to known it is a refundable deduction meaning thats why sunrun is so happy yo take your money cause the government promises to put cash in your hand that the finance company demands within 18 months. \n\nI would never sign with them or refer them. \nGet three quotes from three installers. Go to the manufacturer and get a referral from them directly to an installer.\n\nI'm stuck spinning my wheels to get sunrun to honor warranties that are actually through the manufacturer.",

I absolutely love how much shade it gives in the back yard, but at the same time I know it kills my solar production.    Then sad thing is I even have a large 15.84kW system and that’s all I can get out of it right now due to the shade all morning to almost afternoon, and most of my panels being on the west side of the house.   \n\n\n\n\nWe plan to add on the house in the near future, and the tree will have to go, so just been enjoying it while I can.    At that point I think we’ll mostly be off the grid.     I don’t think it’ll be a drastic improvement in solar production, but I’m hoping it can add on another 10+- kWh a day.  I know it’d definitely help the Powerwalls charge faster in the morning, and would actually benefit us if we were to lose power from a storm.",

You can drill down through the document to find details.\n\n&gt; Model inputs are as follows: (1) time-dependent electricity produced from onshore and offshore wind turbines, wave devices, tidal turbines, rooftop PV, utility PV, CSP, and geothermal plants; (2) a hydropower plant peak \ndischarge rate (nameplate capacity), a hydropower mean recharge rate (from rainfall), and a hydropower annual average electricity output; (3) time-dependent geothermal heat and solar-thermal heat generation rates; (4) specifications of hot-water and chilled-water sensible-heat thermal energy storage (HW-STES and CW\u0002STES) (peak charge rate, peak discharge rate, peak storage capacity, and energy losses during charging and discharging); (5) specifications of underground thermal energy storage (UTES), including borehole, water pit, and aquifer storage; (6) specifications of ice storage (ICE); (7) specifications of electricity storage in pumped hydropower storage (PHS), phase-change materials coupled with concentrated solar power plants (CSP-PCM),and batteries (8) specifications of hydrogen electrolysis, compression, and storage equipment; (9) specifications of electric heat pumps for air and water heating and cooling; (10) specifications of a demand \nresponse system; (11) specifications of losses along short- and long-distance transmission and distribution lines; (12) time-dependent electricity, heat, cold, and hydrogen loads, and (13) scheduled and unscheduled maintenance downtimes for generators, storage, and transmission.\nCost inputs are also needed for electricity, heat, and cold generators and storage; transmission and distribution; \nand hydrogen water, electrolysis, compression, and storage. These costs include capital costs, technology \nlifetimes, fixed and variable O&amp;M costs; decommissioning costs, and a social discount rate.

For example: 1-800kwh are billed at $X 801-2000 kwh are billed at $y and 2001+kwh are billed at $Z\n\nMy point is, you don't need to offset everything, in fact I'm a believer that trying to get 100% offset is a contributing factor to the duck curve that makes utilities dislike rooftop solar, but that's a different conversation.\n\nI purposely sized my system to not cover 100% of my usage. It was a combination of available roof space, asthetics, and not wanting to rely as much on net metering. My power is pretty cheap in the lower tiers, so I get a better ROI by focusing on never being in the top tier, and ideally not being in thr middle tier.\n\nEven if your utility doesn't have a tiered system, and does time of use based billing, a lot of the same can be true, if you are able to offset some or all of your usage during more expensive TOU times, buying power from the utility at off peak rates isn't so bad.",

Most in the market use LFP (Lithium Ferro Phosphate), however, Tesla often use LNMC (Lithium Manganese Cobalt), citing its higher power density and lower weight. The weight of the Powerwall 3 would indicate the same chemistry, LNMC, coming in at just 130.18kg at 13.5kWh.The GivEnergy All in One, a 13.5kWh battery using LFP, comes in at a whopping 173kg. Meaning, even with an integrated inverter, the Powerwall 3 will be almost as energy dense as the Powerwall 2, which uses LNMC.",

Curry said in an interview that she has setup and used solar panels. And she described her consulting works as a way for businesses to create climate mitigation strategies.  So Curry is working with some personal belief that climate change is happening. That's in addition to her prior academic work. \n\nCurry has repeatedly said that she felt her position on climate change was hijacked by alarmists and when she disagreed with alarmists or critized their vision ... Well the rest is the history as published in that Nature article. \"Cliamte heretic\" was the title - - I mean, wow. From rising priestess to excommunicated. And all in Nature. The venom written was palpable. \n\nIronically, Watts (infamous for the climate \"denier\" website) also said in interview that he uses solar panels.\n\n Either folks like Watts and Curry are hypocrites, or climate alarmists have inaccruatly demonized them, or climate deniers, supposedly Curry and Watts, are OK with energy that gets them off the Dinosaur Juice.  I find the last option improbable but I'm not a denier so don't really know.",

I'm assuming future vehicles will have this capability as well.\n\nGiven the cost of Fords system ($6k or so), and Kia saying their system for the EV9 will be a similar cost to fords, getting a single powerwall seems like a much better choice as it's only a few thousand more after the tax incentive and you have a dedicated battery plus the ability to use the car battery as well in the future, potentially.",

I used a comparison website to figure out if the panels were a good fit for my needs before buying.\n\nJust make sure to check the condition and efficiency of the panels since their performance can vary a lot.

Mid term future I don't know who will still be making ICE for consumer cars but I imagine someone will be making ICE for rich people to park next to their horse barn.  \n\nForget people thinking they will buy ICE in the future.

Based on this, I would guess you either:\nA) can't fit enough panels to pay for your whole utility bill due to shade, roof space, etc.\nB) received an offer to lease (rent) these solar panels at a set rate ($ per month), which is slightly lower than your average monthly utility bill now\n\nCalculating what's necessary to help you make the best decision on this requires knowledge of how much energy you use, as well as the utility's rates and their payment system. Your utility bill provides nearly everything people selling solar would want to help you effectively. They really want these things not to be nosy, but so they're not just winging it and giving generic quotes to everyone.

"comment": "I think you're right on with your core point, which is that this needs to be a \"quiet movement\". I think that proselytizing will always risk alienation, and in the end preachers will just be talking to the converted because nobody else will be around. Just look at PETA - talk about an organization almost completely reviled by the mainstream.\n\nOn the other hand, I have to admit that being a quiet vegan is extremely disturbing to me sometimes. It's a fact that right now millions of animals are being mistreated. Isn't there more I can do? I feel a bit like I'm hiding Jews, and all my neighbors are going on about how great that Hitler guy is. I realize that this is a rather extreme analogy, but the situation's pretty heartbreaking. And I don't mean that I go around judging my friends constantly, that I think they're all horrible people for not being vegan. In fact, I unconsciously put their \"immorality\" out of my mind almost all the time, because I can't sit in judgement of them; I'm not that person and I know I'm not perfect either.\n\nBut still, most of my friends are smart people. They know what's going on. They know that meat comes from a factory. They know they're eating pain and suffering. They experience cognitive dissonance. It's just not an important enough issue for them to change their lifestyle. What does that say about them?",

I think some people come here looking for support. I have a pretty thick skin now. But when I first became vegan, having friends constantly dig on me got annoying and then frustrating...and eventually just saddening. I wish I had had more support. \n\nAs for complaining...people are of course going to want to vent from time to time. Venting to a normal omnivore doesn't usually go over well...so you go over to r/vegan. It's sometimes nice knowing that other people go through the same stuff you do. It isn't just you or just your friends. \n\nI bet if you go over to r/cycling, there will be a bunch of posts and comments about drivers.",

Does it mean I'm not holding true to my ethics there that I don't go out of my way to trap, alter, and release every feral cat I see?  Does it mean I'm not holding true to my ethics because I'm not always willing to take on a batch of foster kittens when asked? What about the people committed to making sure children don't go hungry who choose to occasionally see a movie instead of using that money to feed starving kids?  Maybe it simply means that a person has committed to making a difference for what they believe in, but has recognized their personal limits and what they can actually commit to as opposed to what would be ideal.  I know plenty of vegetarians who are very committed to making the difference that they feel they can.  Just because you don't have the energy to throw every starfish back into the ocean, doesn't mean you're a lesser or less seriously committed to the cause person for throwing back the ones you can in the course of a morning.  \n  \n  \nedit:fixed typo",

It's very romantic to imagine a world where everyone is vegan and everyone acknowledges the pain and suffering of animals but this is not likely to happen for some time.\nIt can sometimes be more productive to support these dairy farms that at least put the time in for their animals. Like you, many of the owners and workers are vegans and vegetarians who want to limit as much damage as they can with people who would otherwise buy mass produced dairy.\nBecause when it comes down to it, people will not listen to you if you tell them it is not necessary to eat meat and dairy. But if you provide them with steps towards a more ethical way of thinking, the result can be more productive in the long run",

"comment": "Sorry *if* there is someone throwing insults... slander is never justified. Mind you, you might just be seeing valid critique as an insult; I really don't know what's happened in the case in question.\n\n1; why do you think the way you do... human behavior is 50% genetic, 40% peer influence, &amp; 10% upbringing. I got those stats from psychologist Steven Pinker. I'm vegan because I care about preventing suffering &amp; promoting wellness... veganism is, without reasonable doubt, more ethical than omnivorism. \n\n2; Is there a moral difference between humans &amp; animals. Humans *are* animals. We're apes. The difference between a deer &amp; an adult human is only as meaningful as the difference between a mentally disabled adult person, with the mind of a young child, &amp; a regular adult person... animals typically used for products have minds on par with those of children, &amp; there ability to suffer is just like our's. Pain &amp; suffering is such a primitive instinct, the experience of it doesn't differ from one species to another, &amp; as biologist Richard Dawkins pointed out, it could be that animals like pigs or cows experience *more* pain than we do, because they don't have as advanced intellect as adult humans.\n\n3; In developed nations it's hard to believe anyone could afford meat but not lentils. Lentils are *very* cheap &amp; they're a *very* healthy, excellent source of protein. As for people who are in undeveloped nations, I don't say anything to them... there are children who will die unless they steal, somewhere on Earth, right now. Do I have to condone thievery? After all, they'll die unless they steal... sometimes, there are bad situations which are lose-lose. I don't condone killing animals for products, or thievery, but some people will die unless they do unethical things... that doesn't change my support of veganism &amp; animals rights.\n\n4; Large scale plant farming isn't as good as more sustainable farming, but it's *far* better than animal farming. Veganism is *far* more environmentally friendly than omnivorism writ large. Hey, big farms of any kind aren't great... I don't want the environment destroyed either. Being vegan is about the greenest thing anyone could do; let's move towards green tech too.",

"comment": "On the topic of nutritional deficiencies, the most scientifically valid arguments focus on three key nutrients: calcium, iron, and zinc. Also, there are conflicting reports on vitamin D, which is important in relation to bone health, relevant because there are also conflicting reports on whether vegans experience lower bone mineral density on areas other than the hip, as that region has consistently shown to be less dense in vegans (Smith, 2006). Vegans have a lower daily intake of calcium because of diet and more difficult absorption because of allelochemicals found in plants. Yet, osteoporosis is less common among vegans, perhaps because excessive animal protein intake can cause acidic plasma which forces bones to seep calcium into the blood to maintain proper pH balance, such that increased consumption of meat was correlated with increased bone loss (Smith, 2006). As Hunt (2003) indicates, the intake of iron and zinc in vegetarian diets is statistically equal to that of omnivores, however the bioavailability in both diets is significantly less. She continues: Heme iron only comes from animal products and has an absorption rate between 15-40%, while non heme iron is absorbed between 1-15%. Further, in both instances the rate is logarithmically affected by current body stores of iron, however, “the result is a greater range of efficiency for non-heme iron absorption, compared with that of heme iron.” This is because of a cellular up-regulation of non-heme iron absorption when iron stores are low, with the result “that even fairly large differences in dietary iron bioavailability do not change iron status within a few months.” Next she tackles zinc: Phytic acid, which is common in all non-meat sources of zinc, diminishes the bioavailability of zinc. In studies monitoring the change in various zinc levels throughout the body, a 5% drop, which is still within the normal healthy range, was noted after four weeks and did not drop again at the six month and one year marks - suggestive of a new equilibrium. She speculates this is an increase in salivary absorption with a marked increase in plasmatic zinc to dietary zinc, though more research is required at this point on the mechanics of this process (Hunt, 2003).\n\n*Social Perspectives*  \nPromotions such as meatless Mondays are a good first step because they aren’t asking for a huge commitment and they may cause some introspection for omnivores. Larsson, Rönnlund, Johansson, &amp; Dahlgren showed vegetarianism is a journey, with progression from removing red meat, then white meat, and finally fish in their journey towards vegetarianism. Vegans should promote a gradual rather than a sudden change.\n\nFrom analyzing online discussions of veganism, Sneijder &amp; Te Molder showed that occasionally vegans downplay the switch from other diets to veganism, such as the more complex meal preparation, lack of nutrients, or difficulty creating tasty meals. Because identities can be used for “displaying neutrality, discounting blame or building credibility” vegans are also seen by non- vegans as strict and knowledgeable on nutrition. Striving for honesty is integral for promoting change.\nThere ought to be confrontation of the pressures put on male vegans and vegetarians by societal ideas of masculinity. Larsson et al. found that mothers encouraged vegetarianism whereas fathers gave less support and even downright opposition. Further, teenage males expected less support from their friends than their female peers (2003). It is possible that women are more commonly vegan due to their own patriarchal oppression. Simultaneously, men are perhaps fearful of being too sensitive to the suffering of animals, which is seen as weakness in many societies. This oppression can be both detrimental and beneficial, if addressed and used to further understanding of the vegan identity.\n\n*Values*  \nPerhaps in part due to past oppression, veganism in Israel is becoming mainstream, largely influenced by viral videos and images which are easily comparable to the holocaust. In Israel veganism is supported by traditional foods like falafel, hummus and Israeli salad. Also, Jewish dietary law forbids meat and milk to be used together, so non-dairy products are already present in Jewish communities. There is also precedent in the African Hebrew Israelites group, vegan since inception in the late 1940’s citing Genesis 1:29 \"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat\" (King James Version). This change in choice could be modeled in other areas of the world, such as West Africa where meat is rarely eaten and the primary diet staples - cassava, yam, rice, plantain, peanuts, tomatoes, onions, palm fruit, beans, various green leaves - are plants (Bannor, 2013). \n\nSimilarly, Hinduism encourages the humane treatment of animals. One of the most ancient Hindu texts, the Rig Veda, likens drinking milk and eating cattle with cannibalism: “The fiend who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies, Who steals the milch-cow's milk away, O Agni,—tear off the heads of such with fiery fury” (10.87.16 tr. Ralph T.H. Griffith, 1896). Later around 1500 B.C.E., though it is tough to point to a single verse, Krishna, a human avatar of the Godhead, was a cow herder, and supported lacto-vegetarianism; it can be summarized that animals are believed to have souls and thus are forbidden to kill and are to be treated with respect when receiving their milk, though they do not eat eggs.\n\nIslam offers important opportunities for animal rights. The Qur’an recognizes the personal identities of animals in 6:38 “There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end” (Yusufali). Islamic laws prohibit eating animals not slaughtered in a halal way, which includes keeping the animal from seeing the blade. This is valuable to the cause of vegetarianism because it means Muslims are cognizant of what they eat and how their meat was killed. Islam is perfectly in alignment with veganism as long as vegans do not think this brings them closer to Allah.\n\nWhen it comes to secularism, there is, perhaps obviously, less uniformity of ethics as atheists prefer to define for themselves what they think is moral or not. This is where framing the benefits to the individual - of health and environment - becomes important, and why they are at the center of this paper.\n\n*Conclusions*  \nMeat consumption worldwide is expected by some to increase, perhaps similar to the larger consumption seen in China as affluence there grew. The environmental concerns of densely packed large-scale livestock production are a problem currently, as are smaller scale operations in less-developed countries. The world would benefit in many ways if meat consumption dwindled.\n\nThough there are as many reactions as there are people, a common gut reaction when a vegan discusses food with an omnivore is to take personal offense – they see it as an attack on who they are. The argument is almost always skewed, at least at first. Recognizing this discrepancy and the opposing misconceptions many vegans take personal offense at is a necessary first step to moving forward together. The commonalities already exist between these groups; most people don’t like seeing suffering – meat eaters are often outraged at pet abuse. Vegans must tailor their actions to the identities they are communicating with, rather than the blunt imagery and appeal to emotion often seen within the movement. It is a common saying among vegans is that being one is not difficult if you think about the animals instead of yourself – perhaps it is time vegans stop thinking so much about what it is like to be animals and focus what it means to individuals to not eat them.\n\n*(sources in another comment)*",

Check labels on gluten free products as they often contain pea flour. A lot of vegan cheeses use pea protein (though if you're also allergic to soy then you'll probably be avoiding these as well). I highly recommend you check labels for pea protein. It's starting to become more and more popular, especially in vegan or allergy friendly labeled foods. My best advice for you is that **pea protein is found in So Delicious brand almond milk plus!** so if you're looking for a soy-free dairy alternative definitely avoid that one. Good luck! Also let me know if you discover any other pea things I should avoid. Since it's not the most common allergy it's hard to find a lot of good information or advice on it. \n\nEdit: silly me just remembered that you're also allergic to nuts, so you can't have almond milk anyway. Sorry. But I'm leaving it up incase anyone else with a pea allergy reads this later.",

The argument for veganism isn't from an environmental standpoint. It's from an ethical one. \n\n&gt;I am not a vegan because the diet is not supported in our society\n\n\"I am not a vegan because I am a lying baby trying to rationalize that harming and stealing from others can somehow be ethical as long as it feeds my ego.\" fixed it for you",

From nuts, almonds, walnuts, pistachio, caju, even sesame seeds you can eat raw, make pate or [vegan crackers](http://www.alkalinedietexposed.com/5-most-delicious-flax-seed-crackers-recipes-2/). They are also full of minerals and healthy fats. I'd stay away from peanut butter though as it is usually full of microscopical molds (this is a drawback to peanuts). Hazelnuts are a good alternative. \n\nIf you're going to eat raw nuts and seeds, soak them to protect your digestive system and to assimilate better their nutrients.",

I am going to volunteer at an animal sanctuary and start helping the animals have a voice. Even if I can't function as well as others or if I am having a bad day, seeing how horrible these animals are treated is a thousand times worse than what I have to go through. To clarify what I have it is lyme disease.I have had it for a long time. Depression is a tough topic to debate about, personally taking pills after pills makes me empty inside. If I can wake up in the morning and not kill an animal then Fuck yeah! I guess veganism is a passion to me, so even though I don't have any talents, veganism is one for me. Basically whatever happens in my life, I am helping the world. In short, thank you everyone. I will keep everyone updated on the volunteering.",

It was easier for me to cut everything out than to only go to a local farm and shop for expensive meat. Anyways, once I realized how easy and empowering it is to eat vegan, I really could never go back. Animals have their own wants, their own lives, and I don't see them as an object to serve my own purposes anymore",

You get some of your meat from a nicer source, but you said yourself, you love meat in all forms. You still don't make any actual attempt to only eat \"ethical\" meat. You yourself are not the counterpoint you made yourself out to be.\n\nThere probably are a tiny handful of people who do only eat meat they ethical raise themselves and are vegan otherwise, but this is such a tiny minority that it's not even really worth mentioning. There are many more total vegans than there are these people.",

But I don’t want to eat yogurt, and meat..... I don’t like it. I could easily convert back to vegetarian though. The person that goes keto, they love bread but can’t have it Bc of their diet. The average person hops off their diet when they finally succumbed to their urges for that bread and usually goes back to eating whatever they want. That person should go and find another way to eat but most people eat whatever’s most convenient to eat",

"comment": "Yeah, that’s what I mean. I’m just skeptical that something like this would geniunely be solved by diet. I’d say the exact same thing if somebody thought that a vegan diet improved their hives. \n\nI mean if a doctor told me that I had to eat meat I’d probably inquire more and be a bit skeptical. I don’t want to promote skepticism of doctors but even doctors have told me things that other doctors told me were bs that probably came from the doctor’s prejudice. Is the doctor saying that for a medical reason or is she saying that because of some prejudice against veganism? (I’ve heard one doctor say “I have a hard time calling plant substances “milks””. and “You know sometimes kids want to be different from their family and they stop eating meat.” This was in a lecture theatre in front of the whole year. Most doctors have an easy time staying neutral and not letting their personal preferences impact their practice but some don’t.) So I understand your initial reaction. I’d do the same. \n\nOnce you’ve established that there really is a medical reason and there’s no practical alternative then there’s no question that bivalves and backyard eggs are amongst the least ethically problematic options if you have to eat animals. But even if somehow animals form a piece of the puzzle towards improving your symptoms I highly doubt that they’re the only part or even the most important part. This is serious stuff. It’s common (for example) with an autoimmune condition to experience periods where nothing is happening. It doesn’t mean that bivalves/eggs/veganism/any diet caused your symptoms to momentarily stop. But heck, if the solution really is that simple I’m glad for you.",

"comment": "I'm learning Japanese on Duolingo as well!  I've been there twice already, here are some tips:\n\n\"Ego Menu kudasi\" - Many restaurants in the major cities that are used to tourists have english menus.  While some countries may have a culture that frowns on foreigners, my experience is that the Japanese, especially in the service sector are extremely polite and happy to accomodate.  \n\nWatashi wa Gaijin Desune?! - If I ever did anything stupid or embarassing I'd break this one out, and it always got a laugh.  Gaijin as I bet you already know, is a pseudo pejorative word for a foreign traveler.  So in my opinion, doing this is a self deprecating joking way to say, 'whoops, don't mind the dopey tourist'.\n\nYelp! - Fantastic because many tourists that came before you wrote reviews, in english.  This was a great resource for finding vegetarian/vegan food.  Which is difficult in Japan but not impossible.  I found that in Japan, most meals had meat, just smaller quantities than america and higher quality.  Eggs were also really prevalent.  \n\nGoogle Translate is handy, but the Japanese are pretty reserved and polite in their exchanges with strangers, so don't jam it in their face.  \n\nHave a great trip!  It's a magical place.",

"comment": "Basing one's interpretation on only a partial snippet of something in totality is akin to a soundbyte. It's best to read the 2nd half, so shall we? \"In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals**.**\" Just to be clear - diet is more than just food - it's everything.\n\nThe regular definition is \"regular activities or occupations\", but most people think only about the culinary field's definition, when that only applies to that arena. [https://www.thefreedictionary.com/diet](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/diet)\n\nSo no, I don't consider using animals as medicine to be vegan, whether it's consuming them or using what they do for our gain. That might start with animal testing, but it also includes guide dogs.\n\nI just don't believe cherry picking to create an interpretation of something fully written out is making it so. Most people take one part of a sentence and apply it to the whole - it just doesn't work. My hope is for everyone to know and understand the definition in its totality. That way, we don't think something is vegan that isn't - as that's detrimental.",

"comment": "> Ok, but in many cases I've experienced... I am the one asking the other person out, and they otherwise wouldn't have even been at the restaurant.\n\nThis is only significant if their behavior would be different if they didn't know you were going to pay for their food.  If they only came on the date because you told them it was on you, then you could be affecting the amount of non-vegan food eaten.  If you invite them out and they only find out you are paying when the bill comes, then you paying for the meal hasn't changed the outcome.  \n\nEither way, they were going to eat something.  Chances are they would still eat some non-vegan food if you didn't invite them out.\n\n> Dating women is already uncomfortably transactional for me. This perspective makes me less likely to ask someone out on a date. I've never given cash to my girlfriend for no reason. It has always been connected to a specific expense incurred, e.g. transportation, lodging, food, et cetera.\n\nIf you feel that way, then you shouldn't pay for a date's food.  It's not just a \"perspective\", it is objectively true.  As I mentioned above, the only caveat is whether or not the knowledge that you are going to pay for the meal affects their behavior.  If they would have declined the date if they knew they were going to have to pay for it and stayed home instead, then your money is in effect paying for their meal because you are paying for something they wouldn't have otherwise purchased.",
