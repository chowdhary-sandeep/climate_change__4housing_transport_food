"comment": "I drive a Toyota RAV4 EV.  It has a 90 mile range on a standard charge and a 120 mile range on an extended charge.  The maintenance consists of tire rotations and software updates.  I wouldn't take my car to anyone other than a authorized Toyota EV dealer for repairs.  \n\nI think you aren't finding the answers to the questions of longevity because they just haven't been around long enough.  I've had my EV for about a year and see no discernible loss of range.  There are EV charging stations all over the place.  Most of the time, I find myself only charging overnight at home.  Every once in awhile I've pushed my range to the edge and needed to pull over and top off and so far a charging station has always been relatively available and it didn't take too long for me to charge for the last few miles to get me home.\n\nIf you haven't test driven an EV yet, you should consider it.  Such a pleasant driving experience.  Silent, great pick-up, fun.",

"comment": "I agree. A hybrid fuel cell car would be ideal. You need a 100 mile battery for daily driving and then a small 10-15 kW range extender fuel cell. The range extender could be small enough (cheap enough) that driving would still deplete the battery, but it might take 5-6 hours since you're supplying about 50-80% from the fuel cell. If the battery goes to 0% you'd be stuck with a max of 15 kW directly from the fuel cell. Stop for food for 20 minutes and the fuel cell would put 5kWh into the battery so you can resume normal driving power (battery+fuel cell). \n\nTyping this out really makes me wish that Tesla had an optional fuel cell generator. \n\nWith that being said, Elon himself has said that \"fuel cells are mind-bogglingly stupid\". http://insideevs.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-are-mind-boggingly-stupid/",

"comment": "I would like to see more projects/experiments among the users. I'm highly disappointed by the lack of hardware available for solar and lithium battery technology. With Tesla's gigafactory completion upcoming, and the accepted use of lithium as a replacement for most recharging applications, it's inevitable this is the direction we will be heading. \n\nCurrently, only 1 company I can find makes lithium charge controllers for lithium ion, but mostly LiFePO4. Not a real fan of that. But not to fret, the technology exists! Every major manufacturer of integrated chips offers solar and lithium combinations, including Linear, TI, Maxim, and more. However, no one's gone and made a charge controller for this field.\n\nI would love to build a board with one of these chips, but most of these chips are QFN type chips (unaccessable solder points) which means they have to be wave soldered which I have no experience in at home.. yet.\n\nThe other problem I see is industry may not change the way we charge (12v/24v battery mind set), but they may just turn lithium packs into 12v batteries by using balancing boards, safety circuits, and buck/boost converters to regulate the output.\n\nI guess I'm just saying I'd like more technical discussion, tinkering, and subscribing to /r/electronics /r/ECE &amp; /r/batteries isn't cutting it for me. Hell, no one even noticed my home project i posted here - it probably got marked as spam.",

My leaf gets driven 50-60 miles a day but if I was unable to charge at work and had more than 105 miles commute I would see a reason to pay more for a faster charger. Obviously a 17kw J1772, CCS, CHAdeMO, and Tesla plug would be great but we are trying to get the most use from the least money. \n\nSince you seem to want a 8 hr vs (16 hr + CCS 1 hour) for a full charge option I take it long term you only plan to drive ~300 miles a day and/or have a 105+ mile daily drive? Out of curiosity how often is your electric car(s) actively charging vs plugged in idle now?",

"comment": "The leaf's lack of thermal management is a killer for me. Those batteries are designed to last 6 years in Los angeles, and I know it gets way hotter and more humid in Florida.\n\nThe i3 is a solid car and we seriously considered it. A lot of people have them where I am at, and they are very cheap used. They have thermal management so it avoids the leaf pitfalls, and it has a nice range.\n\nBut about the charging. You are going to want to look up how your electrical rates run. For me and a lot of EV owners, we use time of use rates to keep costs super low, which means we use an L2 charger like the juciebox with WiFi connectivity so it turns charging on during super low rate times. I drive a lot, and 5 miles an hour (L1 charging speeds) at 8 hours of charging just isn't going to cut it for my range needs. Juice box also has adapters that work with electrical dryer outlets. Id really suggest talking to your landlord, and see what you can do about getting L2 charging (around 20 miles of range per hour), this way you can still have a full charge even after a late night with friends or an interuption lIke an ice cream run. Without L2, I think you may be better off with a phev, as you can rely on a gas backup. A car like the volt can be similar priced to a used i3.",

"comment": "Living in an area where solar is useful but not affordable: The installers charging as much as they think they can possibly convince you you'll pay for power in the next 30 years, while not asking if you actually qualify for the federal tax credit, is the big problem.  Not materials cost.\n\nCharging $3.50-$4/W in lower cost of living areas where the solar tax credit is meaningless for many people... no surprise there's not much solar out here.  I've had massive amounts of interest in the fact that I'm doing my own solar install, and getting far more for the money than a basic grid tie system.  Being able to do a $1.50/W owner assisted install would be huge out here.",

Unless they both needed the same part and the Tesla insurance car got \"priority\".\n\nThe company I work for has a priority tech support option that obviously costs more with the expectation that they will get faster and better service. The thing is it really depends on what the problem is. Sure we will pick up the case quickly, but if the issue matches a non priority case I have, they are both being worked at the same time. The non priority case basically gets priority due to my workflow. However I'm talking software here. If I had a physical part and only one of them, the priority case would get it and the other guy gets to wait until it is back in stock.",

"comment": "Uh you don’t have to use a credit card? Get that out of your wallet and put in the zip code? And the whole process from driving to the gas station, waiting, paying and pumping all takes a lot longer than 30 seconds. Sometimes the pumps don’t work. Here you have to stand outside inhaling toxic gases while jackasses ask for a dollar, check your oil, say No to carwashes and grocery rewards. Some stations even blare loud ads in your face. Fuck that. All after you divert from your commute to spend more money and time than I do to plug in.  Then there are queues at the popular stations around here. Maybe this is how it works in the middle of nowhere but not in a city.   \n\nI’ve had two credit cards skimmed from gas stations on road trips in the past two years, too. That shit doesn’t make life any easier. \n\nYou say “stupid shit like what you are trying to pull” yet YOU SOUND IGNORANT about how easy (albeit Slow) charging an ev is. Do you own and live with an EV daily? If not please shut up. I’ve had gas cars for 25 years (and still have two) and evs for 3. I say this from experience: Evs are easier for daily life period. Everyone says this once they’ve tried it because it’s true as long as you can charge at work or home. It's the primary reason I drive one.\n\nIn the past three years I avoided 150 gas station stops for fuel fill ups and spent about 3 seconds each night “filling up” (because I plug in and charge while I sleep). Ev is the clear winner here. The reply I made was specifically to \"its easier to fill a gas tank than charge a battery\". Faster, sure. Easier, nope.",

"comment": "Thanks for all the advice!\n\nEven if there were many \"dude, it looks like you want a Model 3\", I had a revelation. I put into [https://abetterrouteplanner.com/](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/)  the route for a trip we are doing in a few weeks. It's about 6 hours  each leg with a gas car (+ any time for stops). With a Model 3, the trip  wasn't much longer, less than 7 hours, but we had to stop at specific  places to charge. When we go on a trip and we do a stop to eat, we are  usually quite picky and make it part of the experience, so \"let's stop  here because we need to charge, and try to find out a restaurant around\"  wasn't going to cut it. I checked with another EV model, where fast  charging was not an option, and the trip was taking like 9 hours per  leg! This extra time, for our personal taste, was not something we  wanted to deal with.\n\nSo that  tipped the balance to go with an hybrid. Maybe I am being too  conservative, because we don't really so many long trips per year. But I  know that on these few situations I'm probably going to regret the loss  of \"freedom\".",

It’s unsurprising that they are all above $50k, given current battery prices. \n\nMA’s 50k cap will still help cover the cost of the vast majority of BEV purchases. And it’s certainly better than nothing. The stated goal of the MA program is to get more ZEV vehicles on the road, and not necessarily to “push the technology forward,” by the way.\n\nOut of curiosity, what BEV do you drive and how does the range work out for you? Did an incentive drive your purchase?",

The price of ICE is going to reflect the true costs ... and that will drive the final use cases to transition.\n\nI also, sadly, expect that many of us will ride that price wave until we really can't handle it anymore. Some of us will do so because EVs don't meet our use case yet and others out of stubbornness. \n\nInterestingly my \"old car\" is a 2004 and is currently 18years old and I'm eager to replace it with an EV once the supply chain shakes out a bit and I can actually buy one I want. In 2035 my current \"new car\" (a camper van) will finally be 18yrs old and hopefully I'll be able to replace it with an EV as well.",

It’s a very frustrating experience when you are in an unfamiliar place and the charging stations have little to no pricing transparency.  It’s very difficult to figure out how much it’s going to cost to charge the car whereas with a gas car you can easily figure out how much a tank is.",

"comment": "That may not be what happens to prices.  The fossil fuel industry actively manages their supply against demand.  If prices are diving from a lack of demand to the point that drilling is no longer profitable, or profitable enough, they'll have no choice but to cut production to get prices back up; likely first cutting their most expensive and least productive wells.  Sometimes there's a lag where it takes the entire group of companies to get on the same path, but it does eventually happen, which is why we see gas prices move up and down in waves.  I guess it will depend on how low these companies can sell their fuels and still maintain profits.\n\nHowever, say the market price does temporarily dive for some reason.  The point of the tax is to artificially keep the price of fossil fuels high to push people towards other solutions.  The tax can always be temporarily raised... or better yet, the tax raises could be built in automatically.\n\nSomething like, \"We lock price to $200 per barrel of oil, if market price is below $200, then the tax is the difference.  If the price is $200 or higher, the tax falls to $0.\"\n\nIf fossil fuel prices do collapse, then again, it could either cause the fossil fuel industry to cut production, or it could even cause some companies to go bankrupt, shutting down their wells.  Often their holdings are bought up by another company, who will need to actively manage the output of the wells... although with a transition away from fossil fuels, maybe that won't be the case and the assets will be stranded.\n\nAt some point the entire oil industry may start heading towards insolvency, and I have no doubt that the government will need to step in to keep companies afloat during the late stages of the transition.  There's no real way around that.\n\nSame can be said for many gas stations.  What happens if the US replaces 50% of their vehicles with EVs, and now the gas stations don't have enough customers to support their businesses while there are still cars needing gas?  Some less critical gas stations will go out of business (no need for a gas station on every corner when one will do), concentrating demand to fewer stations, and eventually the government may need to step in when demand isn't enough.  Although, the gas stations themselves may be able to simply increase gasoline prices to the proper level to support the business, or maybe add some fast chargers or other products/services.\n\nWhen we get to these late stage points, the production of fossil fuel replacements will be running full steam ahead, and it'll only be a matter of  years before we fully transition.\n\nIn my mind, BEVs are the ultimate step to transition to... PHEVs would have been a great intermediary step to quickly lower global emissions.  They'd have also helped soften the economic blow that's likely on the horizon from such a major industrial transition, as well as give us time to plan and build proper fast charging infrastructure.  We could have even started by building BEV semi trucks and the interstate charging infrastructure for them, then branching out from there into personal vehicle infrastructure, mandating a single standard for charging.\n\nI mean, lets be honest, the charging infrastructure roll out in North America has been a bit of a disaster.  Better in Europe given that they pushed a single standard.",

"comment": "Yep, hybrids will suffer too - I don’t own a BEV but my Prius will cry uncle when it’s cold via decreased hybrid battery capacity and the ICE/HV inverter having to go balls to the wall to keep the car moving(and warm/conditioned). Which is fine in the city but downright dangerous in the mountains when instead of 110-120hp, you only have 76-90hp to keep moving at near redline. A friend’s Tundra did fine during a Tahoe storm but the truck was beeping due to all the ADAS features being disabled due to snow and salt sticking to the parking sonar and front radar sensors. \n\nWasher fluid is an easy fix - winter fluid but unless you have a Mercedes/BMW/Audi or even a Cadillac, there’s no heated washer fluid. And even so, it’s an extra-cost option. These days, since coolant is sold as a 50/50 premix as well as concentrate you don’t see as many cooling system related failures due to frozen coolant but new ICE cars thanks to downsizing take a while to warm up. Honda’s 1.5T as well as Subaru’s FB20/25 engines take a while to warm up in temperate conditions. Tesla by far has the best battery thermal management - HyunKia seems to be behind them. Toyota is using the heat pump HVAC system on the new Prius Prime to manage battery thermals.",

If you charge your EV with power from a Coal plant, you have a higher energy efficiency just burning coal in the engine. If we had a nuclear grid (fission or fusion) or renewable energy grid, I’d agree EVs would cause a dramatic drop in emissions with a clean grid, especially with better recycling and less rare earth metals. But since most people charge their EVs with fossil fuels, it’s just moving emissions from transportation to energy production.",

However, it is being opened up to other manufacturers. In 2 years when adapters are available for everyone, or when the Tesla port is just standard? Then the question fully shifts from \"why not Tesla\" to \"why Tesla\"",

"comment": "I'm not familiar with New Zealand solar practices, but your total cost is similar to Germany, so the breakdown probably is too. The biggest part of the difference in cost between the US and Germany is in \"soft\" costs, business overhead. Cost of customer acquisition, permitting and inspections, and other overhead expenses. There are also slightly higher labor and materials costs across the board that mostly boil down to not having as much experience yet.\n\nIn other words, Solar PV is expensive in the US because it's hard to sell, and it's hard to sell because it's expensive. Prices are plummeting as it becomes more widely cost effective, but we're still years behind the trend compared to countries where it has been popular longer.",

"comment": "I agree with you.  Just remember that being on-grid vs off-grid is pretty much the same system.  It is just a different scale.  It makes a lot of sense to get peoples feet in the door and to help push and smooth out the peek periods so we don't hit the grid at the wrong times (pushing during noon time when not needed and pulling in afternoon when under creating).  \nThat said if it is just an over sized battery backup system (100hr 3.5kWh system) then cool.  But if the daily system saves you money then why wouldn't you want to save more money by increasing the capacity.  At some point the Grid is going to charge us money to use their grid.  Who knows how much but I've seen around $50 a month.  So thats $600 a year or $6000 in ten years.  **IF** I already have the inverters for the solar panels I can upgrade the system for less than $6000 and go off grid.  \n\nI love what he is doing though.  It basically is like a drug dealer giving everyone a taste.  Hopefully if done right, people will like it and want more.  The big if to all of this is the politicians and the political capitol that a lot of the big energy suppliers have.  \n\nFrom what I see I think China is actually going to take over the primary lead on RE from Germany and this is probably one of the few areas that the US is showing real progress.",

"comment": "hey man thanks again for your time. If you dont mind me picking your brain some more i have some more questions. I just cant wrap my head around storage design. Ive got some notes that have taught me to design, as youve seen in my post, based on total KWh demand per day and then Ah based on the design voltage to be used. I have heard many times over that if youve got an air conditioner, forget about offgrid. In this situation, there is grid access but as you can see from the link, it is severely limited in day A (16hours/24 grid downtime). In my notes there is no mention of a peak load, how do i incorporate this into my design? \n\none final question, since ive learned to design based on a design voltage and come out with a certain Ah capacity, i have no idea how to work backwards from these lithium ion batteries which give us a certain capacity. I am looking at the Tesla powerwall for my example, since my daily KWh consumption is 13.7Kwh for Day A, i figured i would tandem two 7Kwh battery packs that would cycle daily. Can i do that? but how do i design an appropriate PV system for it? says on the spec sheet:\n\n* Power\n2.0 kW continuous, 3.3 kW peak\n\n* Voltage\n350 – 450 volts\n\n* Current\n5.8 amp nominal, 8.6 amp peak output \n\ndo i design based on 350V? series connected modules? im totally thrown off by this.. I hope you can shed some light, or perhaps point me to some literature that will give me a better understan ding of design. Thanks alot for all your help!",

"comment": "&gt;And those previous papers didn't include all the costs of the study I linked.\n\nMy understanding is they did, but they just cooked the numbers a lot contradicting their own data, and to hide it they used obscure units.\n\nAbsolutely nobody else even got an EROI of one, nevermind negative energy payback.\n\nThey were off by at least a factor of 4 depending on solar PV type.\n\n&gt;The fact is, we don't know that. Suppose the study was off, by a bit. There's still plenty of room for the Swiss and German solar systems to never break even on their installs. Or perhaps they break even, but the energy they produce over their lifetimes is maybe 5% greater than the energy inputs. Given all the power those same systems could have produced in sunny countries (the opportunity cost), was that a wise policy?\n\nIt doesn't quite work that way. Solar PV panels usually have a lifetime of up to 20 years, during which they produce a lot electricity. Of course you could argue that there was an opportunity cost in a completely homoginised utopian world where each country specialises and produces its own goods at max efficiency, but the truth is the EROI is good enough according to the majority for Solar PV in Germany, meaning it's much better in pretty much everywhere else of consequence.",

"comment": "Oh.  I see.  \n\nNo, you're barkign up the wrong tree.  it doesn't work like that.\n\nFirst and foremost is you wouldn't be concentrating sunlight, you'd be concentrating the temperature gains.  So you'd burn a whole right through them.  \n\nThere *are* panels/glass manufacutrers that do something similar on the panes of glass in a produced module, but that's... that's a horse of a different color.  That's some science-y stuff i havn't read up on in a while.  \n\nNow, if you're talking *not doing* solar panels, but instead want some sort of [DIY Concentrated Solar Powr](https://www.google.com/#q=diy+concentrated+solar+power) You can do it, but you run into problems with economy of scale.  Small simple DIY CSP's are basically one-purpose machines - heat things up for cooking tends to be it.  If you want to imagine something to create electricity, sure, it's do-able, but you have to scale the operation up such that you're heating a heating fluid hot enough that the steams turn turbines which create energy.  Then you've got to recapture the water and cycle it back through the concentration device.  That's why CSP's are huge power plants, generally upwards of the 30+MegaWatt range if I remember correctly.  Shit, Wikpedia tells me that the largest is ~360MW, which is huge.\n\nAnyhow.  Hope this helps shed some light.\n\nEdit, and to be fair, I guess you could rig something low-key up... bounce up enough sun but not too much of the heat.  you'd have to have it on a tracker if you wanted any sort of significant boost, and that's it's own problem.  You'd also be eating up square footage, too.    Also, panels perform poorly at higher temperatures, so while you would be getting more light, you'd be loosing electrical efficiencies.",

"comment": "I was using the \"dealer\" term as SunPower does. But I was referring to installers. And it is my experience that SunPower only (mostly?) has territorial limitations for Master Dealer agreements. I've worked with a few Master Dealers and have become aware of some significant restrictions (e.g. sales and marketing), but I've never had anyone say they cannot sell another module. However, they do have business volume obligations, so perhaps that removes incentives from quoting much else.\n\nOutside of Master Dealer, I thought the company was much less restrictive, including allowing more within a territory (more Elite, more Premier, etc.). My guess is they don't have set limits for dealer count, but they probably look at it on a case by case basis. After all, they could benefit from having a higher proportion of sellers in certain CA markets as compared to, say, TX, where residential solar is a much tougher sell. I suspect Master Dealers get the most restrictive terms but also the most in return from SunPower's perspective. They get a greater $ pool for sales and marketing and \"training\" per unit sales (I am told). So to me it makes sense to be most limiting at that level.",

"comment": "Right now you're giving $185/month to the utility company. That's $2,200 per year.  If you decide to go solar, you're taking that money that you're already spending and using it better. \n\nThere are two major benefits of a customer-owned solar system. The first one is home value increase. The most comprehensive study on the subject found that solar panels add about $4/watt to the home's value. So it's an investment in your home just like remodeling your kitchen, except this one saves you money. \n\nThe second benefit is that your payment won't go up for the next 20 years. As utility costs continue to rise, you're isolated by the fact that you own the power plant on your roof.\n\nHope that helps.",

You can look up average KWH most appliances use in a year - the number is on that big yellow sticker when the appliance was new.  Then divide by 365 to get average daily need.\n\nThen you have to check that your peak load (in Watts) *with everything turned on* is less than the inverter capacity.

"comment": "Since you don't want to open the link, I'll summarize that the details included 87 bids for Solar + Battery storage at a medium price of $36. \n\nSolar and wind have issues with intermittency. Batteries are becoming cheaper and offering an economic alternative to address that intermittency. They may not be able to so that completely on an economic basic today, but even an incremental improvement is a step in the right direction in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nIf solar or wind gets us 8 hours per day, then we have 16 hours left to try and cover. An additional 4 hours of coverage would only be 25% of the uncovered hours, but we don't use a heck of a lot of electricity between 11 PM and 7AM. Those additional 4 hours should cover more than half of the intermittency gap. That's a huge step in the right direction. \n\n\nBattery technology still holds room for improvement as well.",

"comment": "Since the grid is still out or unreliable in so much of the island, the demand for retrofitting existing grid tied solar systems to turn them into battery based ones is huge. Grid tied only goes out when the grid is out, becoming useless. We just shipped a container of battery based inverters (Schneider XW) and a container of Crown batteries to San Juan to make it easier for customers to just pick them up locally instead of shipping them individually. We are looking at shipping solar panels soon, but the first priority was to get the existing solar systems up and running.  \n\nI suggest you stay away from grid-tied only solar, and look at grid-tied battery backup. It is more expensive, but based on what we are hearing, it is the way to go these days.",

"comment": "To be honest.... I think small solar installers/companies are where it's at. Your best be is to look into NABCEP. It's the definitive certification in the industry. With that said you don't have to have it but it proves an understanding of solar.\n\nAs far as being a Solar Project Developer these days I see it more as a sales position/financial expert. Solar is not really hard to design or install. The difficult part is showing ppl the financials involved and getting them to write the check. ROI, Peak demands, Tax breaks, locations, etc. \n\nAn Operations Manager would be more like a general manager in the cons't ind. Where you over see design, install, and office to complete jobs. \n\nI can tell you tho, if you are able to \"develop projects\" in the sense of finding large projects and completing the deal, you would be worth your weight in gold to ANY installation company.",

For comparison, I paid 28K for a 12.48kW system using 39 Chinese made JA Solar panels and Enphase microinverters.\n\nWhat size is the inverter they will be installing? I'd guess a 7.6kW but you might get lucky and they will be installing a 10kW or 11.4kW which should nearly eliminate clipping. \n\nI'd ask them how much additional it would cost to upgrade the inverter warranty to the full 25 years to match the 25 year warranty on the rest of the system. It would suck to be on the hook for a replacement inverter if yours failed at 12 years and 1 day.",

Pulling panels off, reroofing, reflashing and reinstalling panels is going to cost thousands of dollars.  But if solar is going to save you 75k dollars, so be it.  However be prepared for a month of justified headaches.\n\nSunpower is the best, however there is a significant price premium that is not worth it for most people when you can get pretty close to them for significant less.\n\nDo not waste your time with tesla shingles.

"comment": "&gt;However, improper employment of fast charging can damage the battery and bring safety hazards. Herein, industry based along with our proposed internal resistance (IR) based fast charging techniques were performed on commercial Panasonic NCR 18650B cylindrical batteries.\n\n&gt;For the first 13 charging cycles, the battery storage capacities for both charging techniques remained similar. After that, however, the industry fast-charging technique caused capacity to fade much faster—after 40 charging cycles the batteries kept only 60% of their storage capacity.\n\nBatteries that weren't fast charged retained more than 80% capacity after the 40th cycle.",

You're talking about micro-scale peaker plants, the same way the NSW Tesla battery works.\n\nYou're talking about a totally different thing from energy storage.\n\nThe worlds largest battery can power a small neighborhood for 3 hours. So what do we do when we have a winter period with low wind and a lot of snow? (which means no solar power generation)\n\n&gt;Which when you do it every day for a year is an absurd amount of profit.\n\nYeah, for a tiny, mini, micro, peaker station - which is the worlds largest of its kind, and performs like one of the smallest gas plant peakers on earth, and can only run for 4 hours.\n\nWe're talking about finding solutions to fix global warming and transitioning our entire global energy grid to renewable energy and storage - and you're talking about a micro peaker battery that will make lots of cash right now",

"comment": "&gt; How much continuous output do you need to run your AC and well pump?\n\nIt needs to be at least around 5KW for the AC and heat pump in the winter, well pump and other smaller loads (My PC pulls around 500 watts most of the work day as well).\n\n&gt; And the continuous power output of a Generac PWRcell inverter is 9kw (vs 5kw for a Powerwall).  You will need two powerwalls to do what a Generac PWRcell can for you so not sure why the powerwall comparison.\n\nJust comparing Powerwall because it was recommended as an option and seems to be one of the systems that's close to the output I might need.\n\n&gt; With Generac you are DC-coupling the battery meaning energy is being stored on the DC side of the inverter.\n\nI think an advantage here is charging and utilizing panels to run the house at the same time.  Is that a disadvantage of AC coupled systems?\n\n&gt; Sol-Ark is another good option with 9kw continuous output.\n\nI believe my preferred installer is going to recommend SolarEdge which i'm not too sure about.  I hear they had pretty good support but had gone downhill a little bit.  That could be anecdotal I suppose.  I watch Engineer775 and they use a lot of different inverters, Sol-Ark is one I see on there a lot and he seems to really like them.",

"comment": "Some thoughts on some of your questions: your solar panels will output around 12v DC. To run 120v AC, you’ll have to use an inverter to step up the voltage and convert DC to AC. Your travel trailer likely has one already ran off the original battery; you should take a look at it to determine the amperage rating. \n\nWhen we are taking about watts, we are really talking about amp-hours, so to better figure out how much power you’re looking at pulling per hour. For an AC unit running 8-10 hours a day, you’re panels aren’t going to put out the same amount of current in that time period as the sun moves, you may want to supplement with batteries.\n\nEdit: I re-read your post and saw your panels you’re looking at are different DC voltages. Putting panels in parallel will force all the voltages to equalize and may back feed current where you don’t want it- I haven’t put much thought into putting different voltages in parallel, but if you absolutely had to do it you have some extra components (like diodes) to consider",

A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.” the same Mr Homer-Dixon also said “it would be pointless to put wind turbines in poor locations”.\n\nFurther down the same source mentions...\n\n&gt; A 2014 study which looked at the same issue found that 2-megawatt wind turbines installed in Northwest USA paid for themselves in 5-6 months.\n\n&gt; A 2010 analysis of fifty separate studies found that the average wind turbine, over the course of its operational life, generated 20 times more energy than it took to produce. This level was “favourable” in comparison to fossil fuels, nuclear and solar power.\n\n&gt; Many wind turbines have a designed service life of 20 years, although the actual operating lifespan of a turbine can vary depending on the environment they are in, and the maintenance strategy applied to them.",

"comment": "I live in an Inland California area that has a climate very similar to Tulare.   For about a 1,300sq.ft. home, our power consumption last month was 420kWh, or about 15kWh/day.  Your consumption is about 4.5 times higher.   So instead of only looking at solar for power generation, you might be able to also approach the problem from the energy efficiency side to greatly reduce power consumption while maintaining or improving comfort levels.\n\nI can tell you that the main reason our power usage is so much lower is likely due to our high efficiency evaporative cooling to take advantage of the very large percentage of days with rather low humidity at the hottest times of the day, particularly in the peak time-of-use period from 4pm-9pm.  Our power rate prices are basically the same as yours.\n\nAdding well designed and maintained evaporative systems for the majority of days could cut your power usage by 80% while still being comfortable.\n\nI just checked the [weather history of Tulare county](https://weatherspark.com/y/1509/Average-Weather-in-Tulare-California-United-States-Year-Round#Figures-Humidity) compared to my area and we both have less than a 5% chance of muggy days, with less than 1 day per month from May through October. \n\nIn the last few weeks when the outdoor temp was 105F in the shade and 135F hot on the cement in direct sunlight, my evaporative cooler was blowing at about 77F.\n\nAnother benefit of working on cutting the power consumption is that you could make better use of solar PV, solar water heating, and whole house battery and backup power systems.",

You have an architecturally busy roof which looks great but code offsets limits the placement and number of panels you can install. That's why it's important to try and find ways to lower your energy usage so your solar array can be sized to match. What state are you in?",

"comment": "I hope I don't blow your mind when I mention night time.  Solar isn't a reliable energy source and can't have a controlled output.  Imagine if I replaced your stove with a giant magnifying glass and told you this is how you're going to cook your meals from now on.  It CAN work, but the conditions need to be right.  You can't just eat raw meat because you had some unforeseen cloud coverage so what you would probably end up doing is using that magnifying glass to heat up some wood, keep that fire going and then use that.  Unreliable energy is shitty.  Energy needs to be two things; reliable and affordable.  \n\nIf you want to store that solar power to cook food with, you need to be able to do that affordably, but batteries are expensive and don't store energy efficiently.    Lets say I give you a 10 aH battery ($650 CAD on Lowes website) and I get you to charge it, it might take about 5 hours.  Then I give you that charged battery and get you to plug in your kettle to it, it might last long enough for the water to boil, but not much longer.  Nowhere near 5 hours of runtime.  This is because batteries need to be trickle charged and store nowhere near the amount of energy available during charging.  A 15 Amp power outlet puts out 120V, for the 5 hours it takes to charge the battery, you had 75 Amp-hours available at 120V, and you get it down to 10 amp hours at 56V or whatever your battery voltage is.  Even the best available batteries can't store power enough to affordably use solar.\n\nSo what ends up happening is that since solar is and unreliable output, and is not affordable for storage, they need to have a backup plant running on standby, ready to take over the dips in the solar output.  The expenses of running that plant remain about the same, and this is like tracking your car's mileage in stop &amp; go traffic vs highway.  It becomes more expensive.  This is why the more unreliable sources of energy added to a grid, the more expensive their power becomes.  Europe has been investing shitloads into \"renewables\", better categorized as \"unreliables\" because that's the feature that sets them apart, but they are currently in an energy crisis because of it.",

You may want to ask if your solar panels will provide your house electricity during an outage. Some people's setup's don't.\n\nI have a 1300 sf new house with a south facing metal roof. Perfect situation for solar. I'm getting 14x400 watt panels, 1 Powerwall, inverter and other stuff. I will be nearly self powering but will stay on the grid. My cost is $24-25k including installation and before 26% tax credit.\n\nBut, you are in a more expensive part of the country and your doing extra work. So take that into account. If Tesla does work there you might check them out.",

"comment": "The aesthetic concern of visible solar panels on one’s roof is peculiar. I’ve read several reasons explaining why, but all seems to opinions that stem from a resistance to change and to adaptation, not practical and very backwards looking in general. A designer could arrange the panels in a nice way, with the sloped edging around the perimeter that brings the panels visually closer to the roofing surface is best, to be actually visually balanced. There are probably all sorts of vents and other things already protruding from the roof surface, and no one takes issues with those. You could save a lot of money, and get better performance if you could manage to get past the subjective opinion of what a beautiful roof should have or not have on it. Roofs are generally ugly flat areas on top of a structure that have a major function, utility, keep things under it protected from the elements. I have seen very few aesthetically pleasing roofs in my travels to Europe, Australia, and other places. If we look at the images of your roof as is, it seems very fractured, many different planes at varying angles and elevations, so it seems kind of chaotic in regards to aesthetic conventions. I don’t think solar panels will hurt the visual impact of it as it’s kind of all over the place anyway, it’s not unified, nor does it have a directional “visual” flow. Don’t worry this is common. Really, if you want solar panels, use them wisely. North facing panels are a waste.",

Solar panels are not like swimming pools that increase the value of property and can be maintained by any pool company. Having solar is like a Russian Roulette for the new homeowner. Solar is not like a car, fridge, air conditioner, central heating that any professional is willing to repair and maintain.",

"comment": ">they argue it makes more sense especially paired with solar panels because the car won't be at home (as a general use case) during the day when the solar power is producing electricity.\n\nYep, they \"argue\" this... but like much of what's come out of Musk's mouth, it's mostly bs.\n\nCalifornia and other sunny states, where Tesla sees the lion's share of their US sales, generates their solar electricity during the day.  Nearly all of those installations , whether home or grid solar arrays, feed electricity back to the grid.  California, for example, generates a surplus of solar energy during the day.\n\nWhat difference does it make if the battery is installed in a house where it's charged directly from the home's solar, or if it's in the vehicle that's sitting idle all day at the office on a charger, being charged from solar generated grid energy?  Either way, the battery is storing solar energy all day that could be used to power the grid at night.\n\nWarranties can be adjusted if necessary, but it's pretty clear that Tesla's (and all OEMs) warranty is more directed at major cell / battery failures than normal cell degradation.  It's a warranty against battery flaws, not against normal use.   Based on claims from Tesla (as silly as the charts and assumptions they've made on limited data), the batteries will last well over the warranty period.  What's the \"claim\" these days... 10-12% degradation over 200k miles or something?  The warranty only kicks off at 30% degradation within 8 years / 100k-150k miles.  Plus, using a battery as storage or to power a house would do less damage to the battery than DC fast charging / driving... especially if the state of charge is kept within the safest range... 20% - 80% SOC, or closer to 50%.\n\nI'm not aware that the cells they're using in their storage products are any different than the cells they're using in their storage products.  They certainly configure them differently, but outside of that ??\n\nIf Tesla had setup all of their cars to utilize V2G from the get go, and we assumed a large percentage of those cars were plugged in to charge during the day and the excess power discharged at night to power the grid, it would dwarf Tesla's current grid and powerwall storage capacity, making those installations mostly unnecessary.  Why spend huge amounts of resources, energy, and money to build those storage product when you don't need to?  I also imagine it would do far more to reduce the need for fossil fuel driven peaker plants at night than Tesla's current strategy... reducing far more emissions.\n\nIs it any wonder why California is considering requiring cars to have V2G abilities in the future?\n\nOh... and cars being used as grid batteries benefit the owners from time of use and net metering... the same way that powerwalls do.\n\nThe reason Tesla / Musk doesn't want V2G is simple.  It would hurt their profits.\n\nTesla's storage products allow them to offload excess cell inventory from their massive 3rd party cell orders.  Those oversized cell orders allow them to negotiate lower cell prices... which lower their vehicle cost and increase their margins.  If their cars can store the energy, then there's no need to sell so many home and grid storage products, and now they have no product to offload excess cell inventory when they're not building enough cars to use up all of the inventory.\n\nThose cell orders aren't static either.  They contracts seem to include volume increases over regular intervals.  Tesla does not want to get stuck holding onto excess cell inventory that could continuously grow without a mechanism for quickly offloading it.  They certainly don't want that mechanism to be selling the cells to other OEMs at a loss!",

"comment": "I reached out to a 3rd party which sent my details to 3 solar sales people in my state (FYI I'm in Australia). Since I had reached out and expressed interest in Solar all 3 companies setup online meetings.\n\nIMO I prefer face to face meetings, but these online meetings were great. They were able to show me what the web interface looks like on a few real systems (hiding any identifying information) as they had installer access. And I could ask all the nitty gritty details about the UI and how it functioned with them SHOWING me how it works. They showed me various addons (I specifically asked for home monitoring) but I know know if future if I decide to get an EV, they offer a EV car charger that will talk with my solar system and home monitoring and uses smarts to reduce draw on the grid, which is nice. I could ask about batteries and found out very quickly (for my circumstances) are just no economical.\n\nNow in saying that, the Australian market may be different to the USA market. for one, solar panels in Australia are common place, 33% of residential houses have them. We don't have a lot of misconceptions around solar. Where I am (Tasmania) they are less common because the solar feed in rate is TRASH, I am on an good rate of 10c/kwh. but I buy it at 15.29c/kwh off peak and 33c/kwh on peak. Also because the Australian govt removed all the red tape around solar 10-15 years ago competition is way up there and you can get dirt cheap systems, not that I would buy them, or really expensive systems. Also the rebates in Australia apply at the time of purchase, not a tax credit.",

(Low or zero emission Natural gas is arguably the best, followed closely by nuclear.  Geothermal and wave/tidal generation are great in locations where they are viable.)",

Some of them even with the solar roof. \n\nIMO, after seeing, and using, these chargers a lot, I'm not convinced grocery stores, or other retail where you spend less than an hour is the right place for charging. Realistically most of them will only pay for L2 which means you don't actually get that much of a charge in the average trip. The payment (or authentication) mechanisms need to be maintained, and often aren't. The spots are ICED all the time because grocery shoppers seem to completely ignore all types of signage and just park wherever they want.\n\nL2 really makes sense when you're going to be at a location at least half a day or overnight.",

"comment": "I've been Vegan for almost four years. Frozen dinners ... you'll get tired of them. At least I did. \n\nIf there's a Chipotle in your area, you can get a veggie burrito that's Vegan (black beans, rice, grilled veggies, salsa, corn, guacamole and lettuce), which is really good. You can do the same with hard shell tacos. Some Chipotle's sell Gardein Vegan chicken.\n\nAlso, if there's a Whole Foods in your area - the ones in L.A. where I'm at sell Vegan egg salad and Vegan chicken salad (really good) as well as other prepared Vegan foods in the deli. They also sell fresh, packaged Vegan foods from local distributors/restaurants (one of my favorites is Vegan Orange Chicken). They also sell Vegan ice cream (love So Delicious Cookies and Cream) and Uncle Eddie's Vegan chocolate chip cookies, Alternative Baking Company Vegan Cookie - certainly not health food, but good for a treat. Also love Tofutti Vegan Cream Cheese (Trader Joe's and Whole Foods).\n\nAlso I LOVE Morningstar Grillers Vegan Veggie Burgers. I like to get a veggie sub from Subway and put one of those burgers on it. \n\nOh, and you can eat at Taco Bell. I do a special order of tacos with beans, rice and lettuce.\n\nAnd here's my breakfast favorite. I put a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan, 3 tablespoons of nutritional yeast (Whole Foods), 4 tablespoons of flax meal (Trader Joe's), crumble up a pack of firm tofu, mix it all together and fry it on high heat until it's a nice golden yellow. It makes five servings of my substitute for Vegan scrambled eggs. It's healthy, nutritious and delicious and I eat it on top of a piece of toast with a glass of soy milk. YUM!\n\nP.S. I went cold turkey ... ha ... no pun intended! Of course I was down to only eating chicken for protein. I had a Vegan friend who helped teach me about eating Vegan, which helped a lot.",

If I were omni again, I could travel more easily, eat foods that I used to enjoy, and generally not give a damn about animals. But I decided that a cow's (or a pig's, or a chicken's) desire not to die was much more important than convenience or pleasure - the pleasure I would get from eating a steak just can't justify the killing of a being that obviously would rather live.\n\nWouldn't you rather share your life with someone who places the wellbeing of others above their own pleasure? I know I would.\n\n(And I do. I have a wonderful partner who went vegetarian of his own accord when he was 12. We went vegan together. He is generous, kind, and overall just the right person for me.)",

For the first five years or so of being a vegan I would have been excluded by the strictest of definitions because I could not afford to replace my leather shoes with faux leather, for example. \n\nBTW your sarcastic take on how language should work IS how language actually works. Language is simply a medium of communication, and the official definition of vegan is by far the least accepted one. This alone wouldn't bother me, if people weren't using it as an excuse to harass people in this subreddit who do it for different reasons than they do.

Some of the people around me don't even know it, but if it comes up, it is a 2-minute conversation (e.g., \"Why are you vegan?\" - \"Because I think animals have rights, plus health\" - \"Fair enough.\" This is an actual conversation I had with a person while we were standing in line to get lunch). Never once was I actively pushed to change my diet, or accused of being pretentious or insulted (apart from my mother, she had a lot of things to say). Online, however, it is completely different. I guess it's because of anonymity, or maybe the circlejerk, but mentioning your dietary preferences online is like activating a bomb. And the people who hate vegans are more visible than the vegans themselves - to the point that the joke should be \"How do you find someone who hates vegans at a party? Don't worry, they'll make a joke about finding vegans at a party.\"",

Oh how about the animals used in antibody production? Would we  have to disclose to the patient every  step of development that a drug has undergone so that they can make sure nothing is against their morals? \n\nThis is putting an awful lot of trust in the patient him/herself, who might not necessarily be knowledgeable enough about medicine or their condition to make an informed decision about their health. Doctors are experts who are required by law to provide the best care in the interest of their patients. Like I said before it is not productive to be a martyr. As of now medicine uses a lot of animal testing and animal products. The best thing to do would be to stay alive and keep working on technologies that would eliminate the need for these products in the future and to defend animals in other parts of life in which they actually are unnecessary (food, entertainment). \n\nBy the way I'm a immunology researcher. I'm vegetarian and my Coworker is vegan. Just because we are scientists doesn't mean we have to give up attempting to curb the use of animal products elsewhere. It's not a all or nothing ordeal in my opinion.",

She took the kid to a doctor who probably told her that she was neglecting the kid because it was on a vegan diet. It sounds like his prescription was basically, \"don't raise the kid vegan\" and referred her to the hospital. She (understandably) wanted the opinion of a doctor who was on the same page with her. Granted, I'm making jumps here and who knows what happened but it doesn't sound like she was a true half-wit with no regard for her kid's health who was putting the kid clearly at risk.\n\nI'm not vegan and I personally don't think that it's appropriate to raise your kids vegan but you know what? Who the fuck am I and why should you care what I think of the way you raise your kids? How about this: I'll mind my own fucking business and raise my kids the way I see fit and you mind your own fucking business and raise your kids the way you see fit. We can still be polite to each other on the street.\n\n90% of people probably qualify as \"dehydrated\" 75% of the time. Because the police decided that she was \"being argumentative\" and \"taking too long to get ready to go to the hospital\" they arrested her? She didn't refuse to go. She said that she would go but that she was going to advocate for her child. That's actually what you're SUPPOSED to do. The police decide that's argumentative and that she was \"taking too long?\" \n\nYou know what? When you show up at my door and basically tell me that i HAVE to take my kid to the hospital or you're going to arrest me and take my kid there, anyway, because you got \"a tip\" you better believe I'm going to be \"argumentative\" and you'll wait 45 minutes if you have to. With kids, it takes 45 minutes to do anything.\n\nHere's what people don't get: This is EXACTLY the same as 90% of the world being vegan and you decide to raise your kid omni. Then one day, your \"expert vegan doctor\" tells you that your problem is that you're neglecting your kid and that what you should be doing is raising your kid vegan. Next, the police are involved, inspecting the things you've bought at the butcher shop and asking arbitrary questions about whether or not you've cleared these items with the doctor.\n\nMind your own fucking business. When did it become the thing to do to involve yourself in shit that wasn't your concern just because you thought that you had a better answer?",

At all. \n-Brands I love/like: Beyond Meat chicken strips, daiya (not by itself...must mix with other stuff), chao cheese, Earth Balance\n-Tips: open a Pinterest account. you'll find a TON of vegan recipes. Educate yourself as much as possible so you'll have articulate answers to the inevitable questions. Find a balance between watching the horrifying factory farm videos &amp; the educational/up-lifting ones. Check out Bite Size Vegan on YouTube... she's an excellent source for all kinds of information. Vegan Sidekick is also definitely worth checking out.  And try to remember this when faced with aggressive meat-eaters who can come across as cold-hearted assholes: it's not a personal affront to you when they say shitty things. They are 'asleep' in a sense (spiritually) &amp; there's not a whole lot you can do to wake them up unless they're ready. Learn how to keep your cool &amp; have a good supply of comebacks (see Vegan Sidekick). Glad you made the switch :)  You're in for a wonderful ride",

At my work, if someone complains because we charge them for a different  sauce after taking one off, I have to explain that it is a stocking issue. If everyone had free BBQ sauce changed from ketchup, we would have a stockroom full of ketchup that we thought we sold and no BBQ when we should have a full stock. It annoys me that people think they can eat for free. You're a vegan, those are our options right now. The waitress sounds like a douche, but you don't get to demand different food because you don't eat what they offer.",

I work as a model, but due to covid it hasn't been as much work as I'm used to. I volunteer for an elderly home. I just got out of a bad break up, where we had rarely anything in common except being vegan and it was not good for me. I'm sex-averse, asexual, childfree (so no children for me though I do love my friend's kid and would die for them) and try to do activism. I have quite severe depression from childhood trauma, and I get flashbacks when people yield a knife. I like dressing up but I don't like feeling sexualised by men. I like to swim and dance, and my hobbies are playing video games and RPG'ing online. Somebody reading this will probably immediately recognise me but fuck it. I am terrified of the future but also terrified of death so I feel in limbo. I am an ex-eating disorder sufferer, though sometimes it still rears its head. I am excited for a predominantly vegan world. I think its inevitable . 10 years ago my small supermarket in the Netherlands didn't have tofu. You'd have to order them in bulk and so I did that. Now, they have an aisle of vegan food. Times are changing. My parents said I was going to die a month into veganism, but hey, still alive and as passionate as ever. That's me!",

Sadly I gave up veganism after about 3 years due to family issues and my weakness. I still remained a vegetarian. Happily I returned to veganism about 6 years ago after so many years of feeling guilty.\n\nMy daughters are 13 and 15 and are both vegan",

When we were together for 4 years before we had our child he ate what i cooked and loved it. He would sometimes eat meat at his mom's or at a restaurant and it didnt really bother me it just grossed me out a bit. When i was pregnant i had him agree to not feed our child meat for at least the first year of his life. He broke that promise and fed him Ham at Christmas telling me that it was celebratory ham and part of his family tradition.  I was devastated...we broke up but reconciled after 3 years of separation and coparenting (it is very hard to work out the dietary aspect of coparenting and i had to let go of my desire to raise our son as a vegetarian)\nFast forward to 8 years later and my son is a full on meat eater and him and my husband cook and eat it in the house almost daily. I have another son whom i raised vegetarian and my whole family of origin is vegetarian so i find it too uncomfortable to have them over and cook in a meaty kitchen for them. I have huge resentments about this, a stinky house and all of the terrible karma to go along with it. \nJust saying that if it bothers you now it will ruin your life if you have kids with her and she wants to feed them meat or animal products. Just my opinion based on lived experience.....i am still struggling with this and may have to bow out of the marriage in the end.",

Imo vegetarianism will never be good for the animals as long as capitalism exists. Just my two cents tho.",

I would genuinely think organ transplants from pigs are avoidable, even if human suffering results.\n\nI do however think they probably meant agriculture is okay, even if molluscs get ploughed up by tractors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This sub/community seems to very much be intended to follow the current Vegan Society definition,\n\nI think most vegans here want to follow something close to this. I would say to follow it properly, you ought to live a fairly scaled back lifestyle where you primarily forage for food and have very small scale agriculture. I'd also say the definition is open to freeganism and scavenging, but most vegans seem to be in disagreement about those.\n\nMy genuine belief on the matter: We can all be *largely* pragmatic about this. Fringe cases will always occur, and it's very easy to get into discussions about these on reddit. That said, organisations that are vegan ought to address specifics or have moral theories that are universal. They should also be firm by what they believe to be 'practicable', because it seems most vegans think 'achievable' entitles them to a comfortable life. I just think it means 'achievable'.",

Seems a lot of the people around here have been in an echo chamber for a long time and don't have this perspective,  [...] \n\n---\n\nYeah, no -- that's not actually the case; people here have all kinds of deep and introspective perspective to offer. Take me for example -- I went vegetarian over a decade ago, and slowly made the transition over to plant-based, and then went vegan. However, I grew up on a farm in Northern California raising, killing, butchering, and eating various \"food\" animals (e.g. cows, pigs, chickens, goats, etc.) while also raising and caring for various \"non-food\" animals (e.g. horses, dogs, cats, etc.). My father was a large animal veterinarian, and tagging along with him gave me the opportunity to also see how CAFOs (i.e. \"factory farms\" ) look from the inside; I've been to many different farms in subsequent years, some large, some small, some factory level, some family level, and I am intimately familiar with what happens there, be it terms of nutrition, animal psychology, or the abuses that can and do happen throughout the system.\n\nI would also go hunting with my father several times a year, usually for deer, but occasionally for smaller game. I'd long been well versed in skinning and cleaning animals, and had shot rifles regularly at targets, so the big learning curve for me involved wrapping my head around the psychology of the deer; e.g. when and where they move, what they look at, how they react, etc. I had been involved in the training of horses and dogs for some time, but that turned out to involve a very different set of thinking skills than what is required for groking truly wild animals.\n\nHowever, I left home in my late teens and lived on my own for a bit in southern Cal. I did a stint in the Navy, followed by several years working as a programmer and getting an Associates degree, and all this time continued to be omnivorous. I went back to University late in life to get a CS degree, but having worked in that field of study for so many years, I found much of the coursework banal. To keep myself engaged, I developed the habit of complicating my classes by picking a programming language I had not yet used for each one and engaged the coursework by using that language as exclusively as possible. I carried this practice in to my elective courses, and so it was that I decided to engage the question of eating meat when I signed up for Environmental Ethics (somewhat to the professors' chagrin, as it turned out, as the course had absolutely nothing to do with that topic). Approximately two weeks in, I had examined and shot down every reason I had for why it was OK to eat meat, so I started digging into other peoples' reasons. Another couple of weeks brought me to the conclusion that I could not justify consciously killing sentient beings to eat them and so became vegetarian.\n\nI continued to keep up on vegetarian issues, and was eventually exposed to the idea that consuming milk products meant that I was directly paying for and supporting the production of \"veal\"; you would think that would be obvious to a farm boy, but cognitive dissonance can run deep. So it was that I began strongly considering going vegan. My wife and I elected to take a few years making the transition, being plant-based in the house and vegetarian in the world, and have been plant-based across the board, and also now are vegans, for a little over ten years.\n\nNow she's working on a PhD dissertation focusing on animal rights advocacy issues, and we're the co-creators (along with a metric whack of volunteers) of the [**Your Vegan Fallacy Is**](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/) project. Life is a journey, eh?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt; [...] they'd rather just try to make people feel bad for what they eat. \n\n---\n\nYou appear here to be making reference to your perspective that vegans are \"morally superior\". Looking it up online, _\"moral superiority is the belief or attitude that one's position and actions are justified by having higher moral values than others.\"_ With that definition in mind, vegans aren't claiming to be morally superior -- This is an claim that comes from _outside_ of veganism. Quite the reverse is the case though: vegans are claiming that others shouldn't be killed for any trivial reason, while carnists are taking the position that the action of killing these individuals is justified by their higher moral value over others.\n\nHowever, the colloquial use of the phrase \"morally superior\" is a pejorative meaning \"self righteousness\", or _\"having or characterized by a certainty, especially an unfounded one, that one is totally correct or morally superior.\"_ This same charge has been made over and over to suffragettes, abolitionists, equal-rights advocates, animal-rights advocates, etc. Withal, whenever someone levies that accusation, it would seem to say more interesting things about where _they_ are at with the issue than it does with regard to the subject of their accusation.\n\nBut by and large, it has been my experience that vegans don't consider themselves morally superior in any holistic sense; i.e. people in general don't think they're better than others _in every way_, and will generally acknowledge that they have faults or gaps in abilities in which others excel, and vegans are generally in this category of people (along with pretty much everyone else). Nevertheless, in the same way that most people likely consider themselves to be \"better overall\" than, for example, a self-affirmed racist or rapist, so it is that those who have elected to no longer needlessly kill sentient individuals find it easy to consider themselves themselves doing better in the world ***in this particular aspect*** than carnists (i.e. people who acknowledge that there's a needless victim resulting from their actions, but engage in those actions anyway).\n\nDoes all this seem to align with your understanding as well?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt;Hope this gives some insight into us awful people.\n\n---\n\nIt's perhaps useful to note that absolutely nothing that you've expressed here is unique or the least bit uncommon. \"Concerned\" carnists come to this sub ***literally every day*** to say the ***exact same things*** as you have. So much so that every single reply I've made to you in this thread -- including this very sentence -- has been a copy-and-paste of previous replies I've written up to respond to people parroting the same old tired excuses for their needlessly killing sentient individuals.",
