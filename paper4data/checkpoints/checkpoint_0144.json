The addition of cruise control is likely not that big a deal on a Honda Civic, either, but you can still get a cheap, stripped down Civic without cruise control. The major cost is likely not the software, but the wiring, additional controls, and end-of-line testing that go into the feature. Still, they're likely only marginal costs compared to what they charge for the upgrade, but that's true of any car upgrade package.

A watt-hour is a unit of energy and is defined as one watt for one hour. \n\nGiven a LCD screen is not an energy storage device, it is inappropriate to assign it an energy rating. A LCD screen is not a battery. The only time it would be appropriate to use energy to describe an LCD screen is if you given some qualification for that, by for example, denoting over what time-period it will use that amount of energy, or if it will use that amount of energy over a full charge.\n\n30 Watts is about right for a LCD screen, so it seems like you confused power and energy. Given this I don't see how you can possibly make a statement about what Tesla should and should not include in their car when you don't understand the physics. As T1MT1M showed, the change in range to the car is rather small.\n\nAs for the reasoning behind the screen:\n\n&gt; A number of the interior design solutions need more polish. However, all judges were impressed with the Tesla's unique user interface, courtesy of the giant touch screen in the center of the car that controls everything from the air-conditioning to the nav system to the sound system to the car's steering, suspension, and brake regeneration settings. The system means the Model S interior is virtually button-free, and the car has been effectively future-proofed: More functionality is only a software update away.\n\nRead more: http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/1301_2013_motor_trend_car_of_the_year_tesla_model_s/#ixzz2zc7TsQiN\n\n\n&gt; An absolutely enormous, seventeen-inch touchscreen dominates the dashboard and features the controls for everything from the radio to the steering effort.

It's worse than some of the competitors, but not by much (around 5%).  Someone needs to make new technology that is an order of magnitude better before it makes a difference.  There are many other companies with worse hybrid systems (like the ford fusion ev).\n\nMany of the current hybrids use the hybrid synergy drive technology which is still a standard combustion engine that still contains a variable transmission to divert engine power to the wheels.  The newer hybrid tech that the Chevy Volt uses is a bit less efficient because the engine is only used to generate electricity to power the electric motor.  Obviously there will be some efficiency loss when you convert rotational power to electrical, then back to rotational.\n\nThe current versions of plug-in hybrids from toyota, honda, and nissan all use a similar HSD technology that lets the ICE power the wheels directly.  The chevy volt &amp; ford fusion use their ICE for generating electricity, that then powers a motor to turn the wheels.  \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_Drive","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001621293540665647,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0729570439098552,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2084365040063858,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.05761862173676491,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22873489767555025,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.11222310236946953,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08008382689634648,"ev_1":-0.13913898647975667,"ev_2":-0.01629844336518242,"ev_3":-0.022351434781739954,"ev_4":-0.0018858194986629921,"ev_5":-0.004487588494763865,"ev_6":-0.18823928760442263},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

Maybe you can run the motors at full power indefinitely, but you usually can't run an ICE motor at peak power indefinitely, either.\n\nPlus with ICE it's much harder to slowly back off the juice and change the power characteristics on the fly when compared to electric.\n\n&gt; I'm pretty sure we went over the fact that towing requires large amounts of power to be produced over long periods of time, the Teslas cannot produce large amounts of power for long periods of time.\n\nAgain, citation?\n\nWhile the Model S doesn't have a factory hitch, I know folks who have towed modest loads with theirs with an aftermarket hitch without issue.\n\nThere's also a few in the Rav4 EV community (Model S motor) who have successfully used a hitch. And those are cars that don't officially support them.\n\nAnd the Model X *will* have a factory hitch, so obviously Tesla disagrees with the claim that BEV cannot tow.\n\n&gt; It's a hybrid, we were talking about BEVs.\n\nThe point of me bringing it up was that if you had agreed the Volt-style powertrain could be a successful truck, it's a *VERY* small leap to rip the engine off, replace it with batteries, sacrifice range, and call it a BEV truck.\n\nBut since you disagreed, the point was moot anyways.\n\nBut in your disagreement you also backhandedly suggested that the Volt wasn't even a success as a car. I was simply providing the citation that yes, it is a success as a car.\n\n&gt; I don't care, ... my point is that nearly all of the people who buy trucks wont buy a BEV truck.\n\n...\n\n&gt; I don't care about you, I'm talking about the vast majority of the people who buy trucks.\n\nThe luxury BEV market started with a $130k 2 seater sports car that naysayers figured had no purpose in the world, and that the market would be way, way too small to be worth making.\n\nInstead Tesla sold every one they were willing to make, and they've retained their value on the aftermarket like no relatively new car ever has in the history of the automotive industry (suggesting that people love them).\n\nThen when the Model S solidified, the same naysayers said there was no way there would be a market for that huge of a sedan with that limited of a range that couldn't even fuel up.\n\nAgain, the market was bigger than the naysayers suggested.\n\nI don't care that you're a naysayer. I'm just happy they're working on it and that I can use my wallet to vote.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.05890570868117114,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08493494645351803,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17842736963018377,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06078010921676954,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.09806526963348006,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27963048309388505,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1388943555454413,"ev_1":-0.13877616592904585,"ev_2":-0.05235501751303673,"ev_3":-0.020851500060719747,"ev_4":-0.015598337253322825,"ev_5":-0.012074048713354083,"ev_6":-0.16236756765283644},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Which is the precursor to the precursor to the i3/i8 program.  So I do have some insight into that, since I've been onboard with it from the very beginning.  I believe I had the first MINI E delivered on the West coast and the third in the country.  So my comments on the i program do not come from ignorance, though you may well disagree with my opinions, they are at least informed.\n\n&gt;but geez, bud the Roadster looks like an upscale kit car compared to the starship i8.\n\nUh, no, nobody says that, and by the way, one of the general rules of car forums is not to talk shit on people's rides, which is probably why your most recent comment was downvoted.  There's no need to be an ass, please.  You were talking shit before on what you thought my ride was, and now you're talking shit on another car which is my ride, so that's twice you've done it.\n\n&gt;If we're JUST talking performance, I'd be getting an Ariel Atom, get the looks AND the sweet howl of an ICE engine\n\nWe're \"just\" talking about performance, then you talk about two things that aren't performance?  And considering the start of this conversation was you (not me) bringing up 0-60 and no other performance metrics, then bringing up a car which is slower 0-60 than the Model S as the pinnacle of performance seems a bit odd :-P\n\nBesides, I'd rather have the Wrightspeed X1 - get rid of the annoying belch of the ICE and gain even more performance as a result, with the same looks and cornering ability as the Atom :-p  Also, if you have a problem with kit cars, the Atom is almost the definition of looking like a kit car...\n\n&gt; unlimited range\n\nI dunno what you're talking about, you're tethered to gas stations, that's a limitation on range.  You can't even fill it up at home.  Convenience is a pro for EVs, not a con.  From the outside it looks like a con, because you're used to doing things the way you've always done things, but the vast majority of EV drivers find charging instead of gassing up as a source of joy rather than limitation.  Plug-in hybrid drivers too - Volt drivers call it \"gas anxiety\" and will do anything they can to stop from having to use the engine, because using electricity is so much more pleasant and getting gas is a chore.  Whenever you end up getting an EV, you'll understand what I'm getting at.  Hopefully beforehand too.  I say this as a person who has experienced owning both gas and electric vehicles, and who knows a lot of people who have experienced both, and the story is pretty much the same for everyone.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.331729631621514,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1557989101856947,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.07884269120660123,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2108032344228986,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2918449897223733,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23589312401600182,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2753262010101943,"ev_1":-0.17071628729266206,"ev_2":-0.1358529135225884,"ev_3":-0.1671880822007855,"ev_4":-0.146320953751759,"ev_5":-0.1723519043918081,"ev_6":-0.18668922485974093},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

The same tech could be used to handle \"bursts\" of power beyond how fast the battery can discharge. \n\nEven without any improvement in battery chemistry there are still gains to be had in motor efficiency, capacitors, charging network etc. \n\nLots of companies are throwing their hat (and budgets) into the ring right now.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005450058427716916,"1.1.1_stance":-0.037696861603762954,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16882970929145813,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08066738458971183,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2521878479281933,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.018940961143622797,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1294343131206285,"ev_1":-0.30232061863595544,"ev_2":-0.01362220801335449,"ev_3":-0.008406504633361086,"ev_4":-0.0031268048527029655,"ev_5":-0.1737517938003669,"ev_6":-0.026260234242120834},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other: (companies, not social group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.","1.3.3_second_order":"None.","ev_1":"NO.","ev_2":"NO.","ev_3":"NO.","ev_4":"NO.","ev_5":"YES.

The IFO report pegs this at between 73 and 98 grams per kilometer, assuming a 10-year battery life at 15,000 kilometers of driving per year.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.003006836671071748,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22993736067905957,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21887208524207402,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25374152403050027,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17187735771992926,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.28872730073332165,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06856925273314118,"ev_1":-0.11226320147159455,"ev_2":-0.3244587299325886,"ev_3":-0.23068622707480463,"ev_4":-0.0009227796399500221,"ev_5":-0.003884989142534323,"ev_6":-0.03854236155166291},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

This is great for home charging where the customer doesn't want to pay $4k+ for a charging station with an integrated AC to DC converter.\n\nDC Charging: The charging station has its own AC to DC converter and delivers DC power to the car. This is great for fast charging where the car's integrated AC to DC converter isn't fast enough.\n\nHere are the charging levels:\n\nkW is a rate of power transfer, the number of kW can be roughly approximated as the same as the miles of charge gained in 20 minutes.\n\nAC Level 1 (aka Level 1): AC Charging using a normal electric outlet, up to 1.92 kW allowed in the spec, although most cars are limited to 1.44 kW.\n\nAC Level 2 (aka Level 2): AC Charging using medium power wiring, up to 19.2 kW allowed in the spec, although most cars are limited to 11.52 kW.\n\nDC Level 1: DC Charging using medium power wiring, up to 80 kW allowed in the spec, although afaik no cars support this.\n\nDC Level 2 (aka Level 3): DC Charging using high power wiring and the CCS connector, up to 1200 kW allowed in the spec, although no car supports that speed and the Bolt only supports 50 kW.\n\nJ1772 and CCS are charging plugs supported by many cars. The difference is that CCS has additional hardware that allows it to support DC Level 2 charging. So the charging station you'll install at home will have J1772, although the car has a CCS port.\n\n&gt;How do I know what chargers I can use around town if I am ever in a pinch?\n\nPlugshare is an excellent tool for checking that. Just select in settings that your car can use J1772 and CCS, then it will show a map of public charging stations. You can click on the stations to see the kW rate of the stations. Level 3 stations will show up orange, level 1&amp;2 will show up green.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.4045277001583599,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1672356691509549,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1911405310261812,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20013786085082566,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11762557015742156,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21896471715220947,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13135429464940293,"ev_1":-0.1622741271870268,"ev_2":-0.19009175817653254,"ev_3":-0.15198630171847327,"ev_4":-0.2721020292511022,"ev_5":-0.1889199801638218,"ev_6":-0.19267450419288348},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

When we manufacture them, it’s on the basis that these things will never be opened.\n\nAdditionally, the high-voltage cabling and charging plugs are also “heavy duty” and “completely sealed”, Mr Warren says, while the car has technology enabling itself to shut down if it detects any damage.\n\n&gt;The batteries are very clever and can isolate themselves within fractions of seconds in the event of an accident or damage.\n\nIn fact, electric cars are possibly even more protected in wet weather than their internal combustion-engined (ICE) counterparts. \n\n&gt;For ICE cars in wet weather, the biggest issue is getting water in the air box or exhaust system … when you think about vehicles getting water damage in the engine, it has typically come from the air intake or exhaust pipe.\n\n&gt;[Electric cars] don’t have air intakes – they don’t need oxygen for combustion – and there’s no exhaust pipe.\n\n&gt; Do Electric Cars Have a Different Wading Depth to ICE Cars?\n\nThat depends on the type of car, but typically you can assume an electric vehicle will have the same wading depth as its ICE counterpart.\n\nAccording to Volvo, the wading depth for its XC40 Recharge is 450mm – when driving with great caution and no faster than at a walking pace.\n\nThat’s the same wading depth as the regular Volvo XC40.\n\nEven for electric cars that aren’t designed to go off-road, you can assume the vehicle has been tested in a variety of conditions. \n\n&gt;With the Nissan Leaf, unsurprisingly, we don’t have an official wading depth [because it’s not an SUV], but when we launched the original generation 10 years ago, they did a lot of actual submersion testing and drove the car through different depths of water to make sure there were no issues.\n\n&gt;The original first-gen launch materials actually had the Leaf driving through 700mm of water – that’s the height of a desk. That was to show that they’re sealed and there are no issues.\n\n&gt;###Can I Charge my Electric Car in Wet wWeather?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0014326458330818543,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26298470080177205,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14218411128911157,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19217626916601224,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17264186873637408,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22114250349912556,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24825863003646495,"ev_1":-0.026943832635566878,"ev_2":-0.06969442032118423,"ev_3":-0.048427021126258296,"ev_4":-0.3562818339414662,"ev_5":-0.2993204379806623,"ev_6":-0.04067621671114807},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

My guess is that means \"when the installer is done,\" but I don't have any IRS support for that.\n\nAs far as I am aware, the IRS hasn't provided additional information to clarify the \"original installation\" subsection, but you should check the IRS documents compiled at [https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/25D](https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/25D) (right side under IRS Private Rulings and Advice) to be sure.\n\nYou may want to read [26 CFR 1.179-4(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.179-4), which defines \"placed in service\" for *business* tax credits. Obviously, that definition doesn't apply to the *personal* tax credit under section 25D, but it may help. The idea here is that \"when the original installation of the item is completed\" clearly means something different than \"placed in service\" because if they meant the same thing, Congress would have just used one of those phrases.  So, if someone can figure out what \"placed in service\" means, then we can figure out what \"original installation\" does *not* mean and that can help.\n\nUltimately, I'm sorry I don't have a clear answer for you. Accordingly, I recommend talking to an accountant, but I'm pretty sure an accountant will say \"I don't know.\" However, an accountant can advise you on the risks of any particular course of action and that should help you in your decision making.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-5.86878159083426e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.03978208582982461,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24589588617285094,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08646153286099434,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.43694615593206737,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.12333159272429366,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.021138729886539902,"ev_1":-0.0005400425361585803,"ev_2":-0.00018306231383273067,"ev_3":-7.676484528928995e-05,"ev_4":-0.0005215146763148937,"ev_5":-0.00015359649357075492,"ev_6":-0.0007790253985125636},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

As a disclaimer, i've had the car since the start of june, so only a few months so far. I also bought it as a store demo (5k kilometers on the odometer already), so some of the accessories in my car isn't the default stuff (rubber floor mats, trunk insert for additional compartment).  \nIt's the Design model, with extended range (only the Comfort and Design model is available in Denmark, and only with extended range).  \n**From the worse aspects to the better:**  \n**The software suite is still not mature**  \nThe software of the car is still lacking, which does reflect well that BYD is still a pretty new competitor on the market. Lots of smaller features seems to be lacking, and if you're used to something like Tesla, it's even more evident.   \nWe do get a general idea of upcoming stuff by looking at Australian / New Zealand accounts, as they get updates faster than we do (less regulation, no EU).  \nWhile they are patching and updating with necessary features (Android auto was added somewhat recently here in Europe as an example), there's still some missing stuff:  \n\\- Car currently fogs while decompressing the AC compressor once you turn it off (a fix is out, coming later this month)  \n\\- The battery estimate is based entirely on your battery wattage, it doesn't reflect your driving habit (A update to this is coming later this month, although initial reports from the southern hemisphere indicates it still needs some work).  \n\\- The screens in the car changes very abruptly between day and night mode, but it's a very quick transition from day to night, and a very slow transition from night to day. In a real life scenario, passing under a bridge on the highway might instantly turn dark mode on, but it'll take you a few hundred meters before it's back to day mode. It's also a very abrupt change, where some fade between the modes would be great  \n\\- For some reason, turning the cars headlights from \"Auto\" to whatever manual setting, turns the monitor into Dark mode.   \n\\- Android auto is fully integrated and works well, but on a large 15\" monitor is extremely obtrusive to start your car, try and get some heat / cooling going, only to be thrown into Android Auto as it start up. There's also no quick panels back to the BYD shell (which is also running on Android), so you have to navigate through panels in Android auto to get back to the shell, and from there you can head back into the climate control section. (There is a quicker way by turning off the system and then choosing climate controls from there, but it's still a good indication it needs some work). Adding a hotbar or some other quick access bar shouldn't be an issue, considering the screen size.  \n\\- Minor annoyance, the built-in navigation is pretty great so far, but it also tells you if you're going too fast, even if it's just 2 km over the speed limit (which you can easily reach due to the cars acceleration).  \n**The software suite for the technical side, still needs some work**  \nThe car works fine for driving, but there's some features in the car that needs additional work before it'll be a good experience:  \n\\- The lane departure warning system (LDWS) is great on regular roads, but it turns the steering wheel into a parkinson experience on narrow roads, even when the car isn't too close to the lines. The \"shake\" of the steering wheel to notify that you've strayed too far to either side, becomes rather annoying quickly.  \n\\- The sign recognition is straight up useless in a lot of cases, and using ICC (Intelligent Cruise Control or whatever they call it) where the cars Cruise Control conforms to the speeds registered on signs, is simply not useable as a result.  \n \\- It does not recognize Danish town signs (which means an automatic 50 kilometer zone)  \n \\- It does not register more than the standard round sign with a red border, whereas Denmark uses both that, and a blue sign to indicate slow zones in city areas.  \n \\- It oftens misreads signs. Especially on highways, it reads our 110 kilometer signs as 100 kilometers.  \n \\- Weirdly enough, the built-in navigation suite is pretty flawless when it comes to speed recognition, so my hope is they build in some cross-over data exchange at some point.  \n \\- For now, ICC is turned off in my car.  \n\\- Turning on the AC is easy through the menu, and if you've already set it to the correct temperature, having a physical button for \"auto\" to set the correct speed is pretty handy. What's not handy, is that setting it to \"auto\" removes the previously set exhaust areas (main fans, window fans, lower fans at the feet) to only blow on the main fans. I'd prefer it if respected the previously set areas, as i do enjoy getting cold air on my legs, but the auto button just removes this entirely.  \n\\- The Lane Keeping System (LKS) warning when you're not engaging enough with the steering wheel, is a bit too aggressive for my liking. I don't want to wrestle with the steering wheel on a straight road, just to get it to shut up, but that's often how it is. On longer trips, i have become actively tired in my wrists from having to keep the pressure on the steering wheel.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0028469418175518513,"1.1.1_stance":-0.37779453457927076,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17176352511573983,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22476740525516156,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3487959766144437,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1874682141740293,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08146896951014544,"ev_1":-0.2889935108988283,"ev_2":-0.1680476341262929,"ev_3":-0.14995651288578907,"ev_4":-0.2711925247841162,"ev_5":-0.12754955823766068,"ev_6":-0.2222546709007305},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"The author's stance toward EVs is 'pro but lack of options'.

Yet you're at the same time assuming the cost of electricity will rise, despite /u/SCW--'s stated intention of getting solar panels and effectively fixing his cost of electricity for 30+ years.\n\nRequiring a battery replacement at only 7 years is very unlikely for the Model 3. Tesla battery degradation has been very slow: [\"After 100,000 miles, the typical Model S is projected to retain about 92 percent of its battery capacity and range.\"](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096801_tesla-model-s-battery-life-how-much-range-loss-for-electric-car-over-time) Typically ~70% capacity is a threshold at which owners will want to replace the pack, but that's completely at the whim of the owner. While I couldn't tolerate &lt;70% capacity in my Leaf, since a Tesla has so much more range to start the car will still be quite usable even with 50% capacity or less.\n\n&gt;Servicing is probably more.\n\nOn what basis? Aside from tires and creature comforts like A/C, EVs require almost none of the maintenance that goes along with ICE cars. With 2 EVs over a combined 8 years of use I've had no maintenance to do except for 1 set of new tires and several tire rotations, and a couple cabin air filters.\n\n&gt;less resale value\n\nAgain on what basis? Tesla resale values have held up quite well. Some reports suggesting poor resale values for EVs in general are disingenuous, as they measure resale value against the posted sticker price for new cars rather than the effective transaction price after the effect of subsidies. My Leaf's sticker price in 2011 was $34k, but I actually paid $22k after federal and state incentives. So if you compare against MSRP, on paper the Leaf resale value fell 35% the day I bought it. I guess that would make a great headline for an anti-EV troll, but nobody's going to make a buying decision based off of such nonsense.\n\n&gt;Lack of charging sites.\n\nHave you not heard of Superchargers? And with an EV your house is the charging site you use at least 90% of the time. Good luck making diesel with some panels on your roof and having it automatically pumped into your car while you sleep.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06142639724809366,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29020855307005605,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14111685131986937,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.051048446291436754,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3255172552938894,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2873308567043375,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0314087996375747,"solar_1":-0.09942399421401599,"solar_2":-0.2639598347983944,"solar_3":-0.010943875799663752,"solar_4":-0.003234229016015888,"solar_5":-0.0003476816151912014,"solar_6":-0.0004371805547028392,"solar_7":-0.0035490920417942107,"solar_8":-0.004810617262895296,"solar_9":-0.01147127214790089,"solar_10":-0.0075110030799502665},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (The comment does not contain any possessive indicators referring to a specific personal social group.

The issue is most solar loans I've come across are somewhere in the 4-5% interest range. Even taking into account all the tax credits and the SREC's that come along with owning your own panels. That interest rate is MASSIVE. And honestly kills a lot of your return value. Odds are the loan isn't paid off for 8-10 years. At that point you've probably accumulated several thousand in interest and if you want to go sell the house now, you'll 'maybe' break even with the increase in home value. \n\nRight now this is our \"starter\" home so to speak. We really only intend on being here for 10-12 years tops as long as things don't go horribly wrong in our lives over the next decade. So I think in our future home, I'll probably look into buying panels out right with cash on hand. \n\nBut for the time being I think leasing is the best way to save a chunk of money over the short and long term. And also make the house more appealing for resale. Initially I thought the lease might be a detriment to resale but the more I think about the more I'm changing my thought process there. \n\nThat thought process started because my father HATES solar panels and thinks they're awful. That said, most people under 30 have a wildly different opinion than that. In the next 8-10 years as solar becomes more and more normal in our everyday lives it won't be seen as a detriment.

A lot of people will pay cash, that would be owned outright. You need to know how long they have been there. Typical panels have a 25 year usable life (80% output) now days, I am not familiar with older systems.\n\nMy understanding is that in NY the energy generated goes to the main grid and then we receive a credit from the energy company, is his correct?\n\nSomeone familiar with the area will have to help you there.\n\nDoes having solar panels on a roof mean the roof will need to be replaced sooner/harder more expensive to replace?\n\nNot sooner, but it will require a removal/reinstall which could cost a significant amount $0.50-$.75 per watt is reasonable ($2500 for a 5kW system)\n\nShould I ask if there is a warranty on the panels?\n\nYes. Most modern panels have a 10 year equipment warranty and 25 year output warranty (they wont produce less than 80% within 25 years and they will have a linear degradation)\n\nIs there a gigawatt level (?) I should be looking for?\n\nKilowatts (kW) is what you would be sizing on a house. The largest solar power plants are typically in the 500 mW (.5 gigawatts). This is largely dependent on the usage of the house. We size our systems based on usage, not size of the house.\n\nHow do I know the panels actually work?\n\nMost systems have monitoring set up through some form of app on their phone/web based. SolarEdge systems have this as an option, but not all. If the system has Enphase microinverters, you may have to look at the bill to make sure. Most centralized inverters will have a LCD display that should light up with the press of a button.\n\nAny specific questions I should ask the owner?\n\nI would want to know all the equipment on the roof. This would include the modules (panels) and what inverter system it is using. Not much preference in racking as long as it looks good to you. They should have some info on this, or at least a contract. Some less than honest companies do not leave a lot behind, but at my company we provide everyone with a branded USB drive will all spec sheets, system designs, permits, HOA approval, etc. Basically all the data they could need should we go out of business or they sell their house.\n\n\nSource: I am the head of the sales department at a large Central Texas installer","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"yes","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.300393873410066,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09143865015198571,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16285486693909718,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.029544052357474964,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1979253865358201,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21915311312967214,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06530687057723601,"solar_1":-0.21529956605567543,"solar_2":-0.12968951200422693,"solar_3":-0.022767711566605914,"solar_4":-0.11974066756859732,"solar_5":-0.005495363666947621,"solar_6":-0.32062921083082924,"solar_7":-0.2945226354689415,"solar_8":-0.07123366681238015,"solar_9":-0.024858071643720336,"solar_10":-0.28030940312017183},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Problem is that as was said earlier, solar is a custom job. So all the solar installers on EnergySage have an incentive to lowball their quotes, in order to get a conversation with the customer started.

The downside is that there is always a substantial cost in switching current systems to integrate new technology. It will at least be a couple of years before we are ready to use hydrogen, because hydrogen has lower volumetric energy density compared to gasoline. Therefore, we need to find new ways to transport and store large amounts of hydrogen. In terms of economics, the reaction is already done on an industrial scale, to obtain hydrogen and carbon black or carbon monoxide. Currently, the hydrogen goes to the Haber-Bosch process (which also consumes hydrogen from the water-gas shift reaction). \n\nAs of now, the process is more sustainable than using solar panels, as the manufacturing of solar panels requires a fairly substantial amount of energy and also leads to heavy metal pollution. Electrolysis is possibly one of the least efficient methods to produce hydrogen, as the electricity could have been consumed directly instead. Solar panels are also not quite good at producing hydrogen, since \\~96500 Coulombs is 1 mole of electrons. Solar panels output electrons on the order of 10 amps, which is 10 coulombs per second. Thus, it will take approximately 9650 seconds  or 160 minutes to generate 1 mole of hydrogen gas, which corresponds to 1 gram of hydrogen. That is the amount of hydrogen in 9 grams of water, which corresponds to the amount of hydrogen in 4 grams of methane. The price of the solar panels will very quickly put the business of making hydrogen from solar out of business, especially when competing with the hydrocarbon industry. Perhaps, hydroelectric or wind might be somewhat okay sometime in the far future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of economics, there is no way that renewable energy can compete with the carbon industry as of now, and probably for the next 30 years. The gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of renewable energy generation and storage just aren't there yet. We need at least another decade or two. The problem with batteries, is that batteries require a lot of resources to manufacture. Some day, when a dendrite-free rechargeable lithium metal battery hits the market, then we can begin to switch over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, we have to look at the products of the reactions. For electrolysis, the byproduct is oxygen. Oxygen is very useful. However, oxygen is not very expensive, since there is a lot of oxygen around. In the hydrocarbon process, the high-purity carbon can be easily converted into high-purity graphene. Graphene has a far higher market price, because it is currently far harder to obtain and far more useful. A small amount of graphene in structural materials as a nano reinforcement can lead to a substantial improvement in mechanical properties. The ability to use less material will lead to big savings, in terms of manufacturing, which translates to less burden on the environment. The large-scale production of graphene at low cost will revolutionize nearly everything that relies on selling atoms and arrangements of atoms. The graphene market will soon explode, and we will soon be in the graphenic carbon age, where nearly every material will be enhanced by nano reinforcements.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0009561236317191893,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2970633470526924,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2187509159209295,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2287366974956801,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34384076966939575,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23700247549472936,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08475821403165658,"solar_1":-0.14675800492033308,"solar_2":-0.19425244675995526,"solar_3":-0.14224954621146493,"solar_4":-0.2086085399445035,"solar_5":-0.050802382909696894,"solar_6":-0.053344866859709364,"solar_7":-0.10817724415149617,"solar_8":-0.033448552295789545,"solar_9":-0.032516466391314225,"solar_10":-0.16117789231509466},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

In 2050, for example, our estimated electricity network annual expenditure for the Fast Transition is about $670 billion per year, compared with $530 billion per year for the No Transition. However, the expected total system cost in 2050 is about $5.9 trillion per year for the Fast Transition and $6.3 trillion per year for the No Transition. Thus, although the additional $140 billion of grid costs might seem expensive, it is significantly less than the savings due to cheaper energy. The essential reason that the Fast Transition is cheaper than the Slow Transition is because it realizes the cost savings due to cheaper energy sooner—faster deployment increases the probability of rapid progress in key green technologies, so that savings accrue for longer.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005392669651579733,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15312554891890515,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16282344944595398,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16097315762091366,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18934177744046743,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22568662150522129,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18831548288774988,"solar_1":-0.10086550562116174,"solar_2":-0.17700398098367864,"solar_3":-0.04715199761934249,"solar_4":-0.07141393915602141,"solar_5":-0.001958788650275286,"solar_6":-0.002203086768228483,"solar_7":-0.0012588305277555871,"solar_8":-0.006055978348740609,"solar_9":-0.13378916153912238,"solar_10":-0.1428699393060621},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

The utility company, looks at the city inspection results. To have a city inspection, you need a city permit because all the inspections are recorded under that permit.  Another baffling thing that I saw in the city permit database was some of the solar projects were abandoned because they failed the city inspection. The solar panels are just sitting on their roofs.  The solar salespeople must be accessing the city permit database to find out who has a working solar and no working solar. I use the Google Maps to find out who has solar in the neighborhood, then search they city permit database if their solar has a permit. If there is a city permit, I read the permit information to check if the solar passed the inspection and that the permitted solar project was completed. But then again, there are two more steps:  PTO then activation are needed after the passed city inspection. Therefore, a passed city inspection does not guarantee that the home with solar achieved PTO and activation. A lot of the homes with solar in the NEM1 era had solar installers that no longer exist today. So that is a flag that if there is a problem with the solar, no new  solar installer would repair the old solar system unless they remove the old solar system and install a new one. This is because solar installers do not want to take over or repair solar systems that were installed by another company.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20875632057855378,"1.1.1_stance":-0.40037352244198937,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24921421362123078,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18590387833798197,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17132739958346,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3275854239757651,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0379435831370453,"solar_1":-0.24428649893030738,"solar_2":-0.26816071831223637,"solar_3":-0.19275876405434156,"solar_4":-0.21463205810991548,"solar_5":-0.10065654448974536,"solar_6":-0.19080128056322893,"solar_7":-0.13071671300536356,"solar_8":-0.2403931437567024,"solar_9":-0.15432859465768445,"solar_10":-0.29388931496309184},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Last summer was one long never ending haze of smoke from fires (or frantic evacuations from said fires) and this looks to be the same. Heck, there were around 30 fires burning through the winter from last year that never stopped (I looked at the map back in Jan, the number was in the low 30’s, but can’t remember if 32 or 34, so a generalized number of low 30’s was used here lol).  We had a brown Christmas pretty much province wide as well.  What’s shocking about this is that it was the same in my home town which is really north - we are used to having several feet of snow at Christmas. \n\nBut we make most of our money off oil and gas because decades of successive conservative govts have linked our economy tightly to that industry and refuse to diversify. Heck, they just put a moratorium on new solar and wind farms, and made it harder for private citizens with solar panels to put electricity back in the grid.

And those questions hit different when you are talking about PV systems, compared to Storage systems. And even differently when trying to combine the two.\n\nA few commenters have hit some isolated great points, but are leaving out real details you should be concerned about, and when they finish with an ancecdote plus a name brand, it makes a situation where they are absolutely saying the truth; and yet it may be bad for your particular scenario.\n\nFor PV systems, there’s in general 3 options from highest cost to lowest:\n1. Micro inverter systems (E.G. enphase, SunPower-Enphase with a different sticker)\n-Benefits of this system: are maximized in high shade that is chaotic that can ruin production on DC string inverters\n- Risks are: more moving parts (1 inverter per panel) , more opportunities for failures on those parts, less stress on each part (theoretically) IQ7 & 8 are way way more robust than the gen 2-4 micros I spent so much time replacing in 2012-2014. They no longer use amphenol connectors, which may have been the problem all along.\n- you are paying a premium in order to make up for it with better production in shady places.\n\n2. optimizer systems (Solaredge)\n-instead of using Micro inverters to convert Dc to AC at the panels (creating a parallel connection where output isn’t impacted by voltage drop); optimizers act like “buck boosters” and manipulate the DC voltage from each panel as a cheaper solution to dealing with shade that crosses arrays 1-2 panels at a time. \n- optimizers are cheaper to produce and replace, and are kind of like a budget version of Microinverters. \n-still have same risk of equipment failure like Enphase, but not as costly.\n\n* if you don’t have shade, or have a consistent predictable shade line: you are wasting money paying for either of these because there aren’t any marginal benefits.\n-with predictable shade, one can strategically design the strings though a combination series and parallel connections in order to minimize the impact of shade.\n- caveat: both optimizers and micros can fail and allow the good parts of a string to produce while waiting for service. For DC string inverters when it goes down all panels attached go down.\n\n3. DC string inverters ( Fromius, Sunny Boy, Tesla, many many options)\n- if you don’t have shade, any other brand you are just paying extra for something you don’t need.\n\nMy two cents: \n-Despite almost unanimous recommendation for Enphase, all the criticism for Enphase is referencing salesman and their margins.\n- while I’m not saying they are wrong, I spent the first 5 years of installing solar always recommending Enphase based on all the sales points made in this thread. \n- for a lot of installers, especially newer ones that don’t know it too well. Pro Micro inverter arguments are an easy way to sound like you know what you are talking about with limited knowledge of how PV systems work.\n-optimizers were the next evolution, achieving similar goals but with less cost. \n\n1. I was literally that guy for both systems for almost ten years. At the end of the day. If you don’t have shade you are extending your payback timeline for a premium product you just don’t need, which will extend that period.\n2. PV maintenance is a tough reality, and it’s expensive. You may not have the whole system go down with micro inverters, but you may run a long time with  partial system until enough of them fail to justify the cost of a company rolling a truck and having a crew come swap them. \n-back in the mid 2010s, first swap was 150$ and then 75$ for each additional inverter. Real cost of rolling. Truck and labor for workers is between 500-1000$ easily so you’d need 5 minimum to fail to justify that work. \n-certainly the micros are way better engineered now, which is good.\n- my first solar work was with a mom and pop shop that went out of business. I will never buy a system from an installer that isn’t “too big to fail.” There is. Market for maintenance work on systems where the installer went out of business, but all of that is more of a premium that impacts your pay back period in the long run.\n\nFor Batteries:\n1. Know your dang AHJ before even looking at options. If they have adopted NFPA 855 your max “battery unit” is 20KWH which is a major limit on what stacking you are allowed to do regardless of brand.\n- where you can put them and spacing between can be severely restricted. Again no brands matter at this point. Are you allowed to put them where you want? If space is limited you may have to choose whatever option get the most KWH in that space. Or maybe pick smaller batteries because their physical dimensions better maximize the space.\n\n**** not a dang person has mentioned the actual KwH usage associated with their home. I see 10, 5 , and 3 versions of batteries discussed, but how much do they hold?\n\nSpending 20k on a sweet Enphase battery that only holds 10KWH is stupid if you can get 13.5 with a single Powerwall for half that, or 19.5KWH with 2 LG Resu batteries for 14-16k$\n\nFor ROI: no one said anything f about their electrical provider!!!!!!!\n\nYour electricity plan should be number 1 before picking your system.\n\nIf you get 1 for 1 credit: PV system never should be more than 100% offset. And Batteries only help if you need backup for critical needs.\n\nIf You get fucked: (export credit < import cost per KWH; or NEM 3.0; or nothing for export)\n\n-You make money off having enough battery storage to prevent any PV generation getting to the grid at a bad rate. Have enough storage to have electricity covered when no sunlight. This is determined but your specific circumstances, not someone In another state saying something worked for them.\n\nIf you are lucky and can fuck the others: VPP through multiple options ( I think Octopus energy is one), need circumstances like California or Hawaii where time of use is going down.\n- you us storage systems to strategically charge and discharge based on market rates. These. Are chances to make money with the system. Some areas it’s amazing and others not worth it.\n- if it’s worth it, then these are the scenarios where it’s worth paying for extra batteries/greater than 100% offset for. PV system.\n\n\nStep 1: what is your energy usage and cost\nStep 2: do you have any alternative electricity plan options that may enhance your return on system?\nStep 3: do you have shade? What type?\nStep 4: can you even install ESS? Where? How much space is available? \nStep 5:Use these parameters to pick your system: PV only, PV + storage, Storage only.  As well as what type of system would work best based on your local conditions.\n\n* once you know these things, then you should look at different PV and Battery solutions. It’s super easy to install the wrong system because these issues weren’t considered. Doesn’t matter how big the company is, I wouldn’t trust any of them to do this process. Unless they ask these same questions.\n\nIf you can’t do batteries because of NFPA 855, you may be able to go crazy with PV and pick. Weird electric plan to achieve the same results financially as different systems.\n\nI’m shocked at how many people  are skipping solar and getting enough energy storage to get from 9AM-9PM without using grid, and then charging everything after with a “free nights” plan.\n\nA year ago I may have agreed with everyone in this thread. But really the game has changed so much in the last year.\n\nJust as price for solar is in terms of $/Watt, treat all battery solutions as $/KWH. No one has money to buy two different batteries and try them out. They will all tell you to go with the one they picked.\n\n20k& for 10KWH does not equal 10k$ for 13.5 KWH. All battery solutions work. My first one was with lead -acid batteries (heavy as F) and an “out back Radian” all are legit. Don’t pay 10$ a KWH if you can do five\n\nDon’t buy a battery bigger than 20KWH in an NFPA 855 zone.

A vegan lifestyle certainly reduces the amount of suffering in the world, but it also still entails suffering.  Being the case that feeding a vegan diet to a cat still requires animals to suffer and be killed in the production of the food, and that such a diet also causes extreme, prolonged suffering for the cat, I don't think it's reasonable to say that feeding a cat a vegan diet is ethically preferable.\n\nMoreover, as a vegan I would argue that one of the primary obligations of those who care for animals is to create an environment as close to the natural environment of the animal as possible.  It's fucked up to keep birds in small cages because it's in a bird's nature to fly.  It's fucked up to have greyhounds if you live downtown in a big city because it's in their nature to run freely.

It's great by itself on sandwiches, or as a base to a lot of creamy dressings and sauces that you thought you would miss by becoming vegan (Ranch, Blue Cheese, ect.)\n\n* Daiya brand cheese- This \"cheese\" comes in cheddar, mozzarella and pepperjack varieties, and it is great for vegan tacos/burritos, vegan pizzas, and anything else you would have used cheese for. it melts and acts like cheese would.\n\n* Seitan- Cheaper than the lowest grade meat you can find, and loaded with protein. Easy to make yourself if you can find a whole foods or co-op that sells vital wheat gluten. Use anywhere you would have used meat.\n\n* Almond milk- I never liked the taste of soymilk or other milk replacements, and then I tried almond milk. The vanilla flavor is amazing with cereal, and you can use it as a substitute for milk in recipes.\n\n* Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Sarah Kramer- A vegan friend of mine gave me a couple of cookbooks by these two women (*Vegan with a Vengance* and *La Dolce Vegan* respectively) and they basically taught me how to cook. Loaded with information and tons of creative ideas to keep things from getting boring.\n\nI promise I don't work for any of the above companies. I'm simply trying to pass down some things I wish I had known in the first week or two of becoming vegan, when I was struggling to think of new things to eat, and being unsure about which brands and products I would like, and which ones I would waste my money on. I'd also recommend hanging out with your vegan friends. Ask if you could come over for dinner, but ask to come early, so you can help them cook. The vegan friends I've made have been a wealth of information and support. Good luck to you!\n\n(edited for spelling errors)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.042839033684382834,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18108441050930857,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20940249943986156,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2185424146252228,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31335177063010633,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22015061948315134,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23470458878002892,"diet_1":-0.16658878497164617,"diet_2":-0.08974550151227352,"diet_3":-0.13280255399010155,"diet_4":-0.2565748085827928,"diet_5":-0.13883487373762668,"diet_6":-0.1862028985233053,"diet_8":-0.0098856189736883,"diet_9":-0.15226714180485335,"diet_10":-0.15607565859002778,"diet_11":-0.1184301802851497,"diet_13":-0.12595449892493585,"diet_14":-0.19393730379863647,"diet_17":-0.013789780364580414},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

I'm not saying that they are mammals that have the exact same make-up as us, but I'm saying that they are sentient alongside animals and humans due to the very definition of sentient. Vegans say that their way of eating promotes the lessening of harm to sentient beings. Sentient beings are those of which that have the ability to feel or perceive things within their environment - and by definition humans, animals, and plants have this ability. That being said, if plants have the ability to perceive and feel, vegans are by definition consuming sentient beings. \n\nJust to show one example of how they react to their environment and stimuli: Plants have the ability to smell out prey due to fragrances, just as we humans or just as animals have a response to smell, a stimuli. [You can see an example of that here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb_9X3I38N0). It's quite interesting. \n\nAnd for arguments sake, let's say that plants don't have this sentience due to the fact that you don't think they feel pain because they have a nervous system or just because they react to stimuli (which someone else stated) - well then we have the argument of the philosophical zombie. We must realize that not all aspects of human nature can be explained though physical means. Specifically, all aspects of human nature and perception can be explained from a neurobiological standpoint.  \n\n&gt; Even insects probably aren't sentient, they are biologically programmed to react in certain ways under certain stimuli.\n\nReacting and being able to feel things within your environment goes with the exact definition of sentient, regardless of programmability or not. If the creature is living and can perceive and feel things from its environment, then by definition that being is sentient. If the creature cannot feel or perceive things within its environment, it is then not sentient.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1376346374551455,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26313615123429257,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15538928120014117,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2009081488879995,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1851589522321914,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26376113927256645,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20284703213560462,"diet_1":-0.04500692817066465,"diet_2":-0.22891903054695786,"diet_3":-0.06289991623373983,"diet_4":-0.05980580739375725,"diet_5":-0.03386185262691773,"diet_6":-0.16190020125941373,"diet_8":-0.09204581299854908,"diet_9":-0.07921525885163455,"diet_10":-0.02289545721014292,"diet_11":-0.07958610196692308,"diet_13":-0.06251363130719087,"diet_14":-0.05118693129029344,"diet_17":-0.050280002811150554},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

In some cases, the greenhouse emissions related to a transition to solar have been grossly exaggerated by fossil-fuel interests. However, there is indeed an issue with how we go about the transition. It is absolutely not zero cost to the environment. Its not as bad a has been portrayed, yet is in need of novel solutions to minimize the impact. It will take time, but the entire supply chain for renewable energy can be adapted to reduce or eliminate greenhouse emissions. A major mining company in Australia has recently begun to replace all of their heavy equipment with electric. There have also been major advances in low carbon production of steel and concrete.

I went from eating meat, eggs, and dairy to going vegan over night. What made the switch really easy for me was watching the documentary Earthlings and then reading as many articles and watching as many videos as I could to learn about veganism. I never imagined that I would or could go vegan, but I'm SO glad that I did! \n\nThe first week or two were a little challenging while I adjusted but after the second week it was like I unlocked some sort of power! I felt great about helping my animal friends, I felt great physically from eating clean foods, and I got tons of compliments from my coworkers who said they noticed a difference in me. Not only that but I had an abundance of energy and I found that I could wake up so easily in the morning without feeling groggy at all! \n\nSo I recommend to start out by watching some documentaries, educating yourself, and if you're going to try going vegan then do it for AT LEAST 2 weeks. If you don't feel any different then it's up to you from there.
