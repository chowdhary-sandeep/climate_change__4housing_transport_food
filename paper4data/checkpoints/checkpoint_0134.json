I'm working on such a monitoring software. \n\nHere are my answers:\n\n1) Yes, but it's either pricey and focused on the large commercial market (public displays etc.) OR free but highly segmented (i.e. PVoutput.org only works with a limited number of systems). Plenty of market opportunity for a programmer who understands solar customer wants to mill out a popular application.\n\n2) No. Many inverters have API monitoring systems, but many do not. Others don't have any monitoring systems, but allow you to call and host the data yourself. Additionally, there are 3rd party hardware systems for ~$500 that allow you to develop unlimited sorts of software functionality - such as the egauge or TED. Typically these systems - and some inverter monitoring systems - don't host any data at all, but allow you to extract the data to your own server if you'd like. It takes a slightly different programming technique to extract this data.\n\n3) No experience with ABB, sorry.\n\n4) If you're thinking software development, also think about service panel monitors (which can monitor each breaker on the electric service panel). If you're feeling really ambitious, perhaps consider control circuits which can turn each individual circuit on and off. Load-leveling software that integrates solar, on-site storage, a generator, and   heavy equipment control circuits could be a killer app in the future. I wouldn't be surprise at all to see Tesla move in this direction -&gt; such that the battery in the EV could compliment the home-battery to help defray overall battery costs for an off-grid home while giving Tesla/SolarCity  a competitive advantage on the EV, solar, and battery markets.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003255945775890723,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07786570237326487,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.185345891776913,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17052842924992243,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28422733103382275,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2145635296023999,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1910969614982605,"ev_1":-0.1482819764667594,"ev_2":-0.2050058162560049,"ev_3":-0.08060817633210718,"ev_4":-0.05911567976969915,"ev_5":-0.10695634100072009,"ev_6":-0.10316200655317316},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

After reaching a milestone of 1,000 units delivered or on order in the UK in May 2021, through five years of partnership, BYD-ADL has just received an order for 195 single and double deck vehicles. It's the largest electric bus order in the UK.\n\n&gt;The buses - 68 BYD ADL Enviro200EV single decks (including 21 compact 33-foot models) and 127 BYD ADL Enviro400EV double decks - were ordered by RATP Dev London, one of Transport for London (TfL)’s principal bus operators. Deliveries will start this Summer.\n\n&gt;It will be another important element of the electrification plan. TfL intends to go 100% electric by 2037.\n\n&gt;\"In London alone, over 400 BYD ADL electric buses have cumulatively covered over 20 million zero-emission miles, with close to another 300 vehicles on order including this latest intake for RATP Dev London. RATP Dev London will be the largest operator of electric buses in London by the beginning of 2022, with close to 25% of its London United and London Sovereign fleet fully electric.\"\n\n&gt;\"[Buses] will be based at RATP Dev London’s Fulwell, Harrow and Shepherd’s Bush depots to serve routes in the west of the capital. The buses will join 36 existing BYD ADL single decks in service since 2018 and 29 BYD ADL double decks delivered last year. Feedback from RATP Dev London on these in-service vehicles has been very positive, with the double deck BYD ADL Enviro400EV in particular delivering exceptional reliability on 24-hour route operations.\"\n\n&gt;The key to the BYD ADL partnership is the combination of BYD's batteries and drive units and ADL’s British-built bodies.\n\n&gt;Catherine Chardon, Managing Director of RATP Dev London, said:\n\n&gt;“Electrification is a critical part of our business and partnership with Transport for London (TfL). We launched our two first 100% electric routes less than two years ago, as well as London’s first fully electric 24-hour double-decker bus route last year. By the beginning of 2022, we will operate 15 zero emission routes and have five of our garages converted to electric. This agreement will help RATP Dev London position itself as the leading electric bus services provider in the city.

Sunlight is free, using twice as much at half the efficiency is still free. Improving efficiency can indirectly reduce cost because you don't need as much material, and less labor to install the same amount of power. It takes more space, sure, but that's another thing that's not the limitation people think. We've got more than enough rooftops and parking lots to host all the solar panels we would need to power the world.\n\nThe big limitations are cost, and energy storage.\n\n\nThe really big, exciting benefit of solar (and battery storage, as prices come down on that) is the ability to distribute power generation close to where it's used. Today, the US has hundreds of billions of dollars of electricity transmission infrastructure in place, so that when you turn on a light a power plant a hundred miles away. If, instead, when you turned on a light the power came from your roof, or your neighbors roof, or from batteries in the gas station down the street, we wouldn't need nearly as much of it, saving an enormous amount of money, and we would get greater reliability at the same time.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0015927507580878835,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3247575409966328,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19558220069120177,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17064150360723337,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27676915906084787,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27675493636134,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03660569427302107,"solar_1":-0.25400152093725625,"solar_2":-0.17365811350702115,"solar_3":-0.17401549492811624,"solar_4":-0.06199621098979454,"solar_5":-0.011385597773672393,"solar_6":-0.0009116947318640692,"solar_7":-0.000954627537187965,"solar_8":-0.003075880933465669,"solar_9":-0.20190141559942276,"solar_10":-0.09216505266886088},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (in regards to cost and energy storage limitations being addressed with advancements and distribution).","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I like to equate it to other significant home improvements like a total kitchen remodel, often in the same ballpark. Many contractors can buy the same or similar materials, but not all of them will give you the same end result. It may vary.\n\nAt a minimum I would pressure both companies to answer every question you have to your satisfaction. Ask the one offering microinverters to explain why in their experience you will see better performance from the exact same panels installed in the exact position on your roof over a single inverter (with optimizers). You don't have to share each quotation with the other. I would also look into their customer base and if they will allow it, speak directly with a reference. This is [one site that is pretty popular](http://www.solarreviews.com/) across the U.S. to find reviews. \n\nA little from my experience:  I'm assuming your two systems are about 16 to 20 panels. One probably has a single inverter with 1 optimizer per panel (or one per two). The other has the appropriate number of microinverters (16 or 20). Some say the first configuration is a little more reliable because the inverter will be mounted around better conditions (less exposure if in the basement or covered, for example) and the optimizers are not subject to the same heating as the inverters are. So the second configuration \"could\" be more susceptible to heat fatigue or failures.  Like any electronic power system, things that cycle hot and cold get the most wear. But using that same logic, one microinverter failing still allows all but the one panel to produce. If the single inverter fails from cycling, there is no power produced. I wouldn't use that as the primary factor for choosing, but I would consider it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005252876035228837,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13239867519712334,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2654294169505271,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2382623682497313,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2969208232638323,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21904002876610093,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08930737238066892,"solar_1":-0.1365536321836741,"solar_2":-0.05054926352628778,"solar_3":-0.04623345530641624,"solar_4":-0.10703836873835826,"solar_5":-0.019597155159620645,"solar_6":-0.10648700112744905,"solar_7":-0.01879532337989076,"solar_8":-0.02524425569693752,"solar_9":-0.06487813631143524,"solar_10":-0.13819307740029924},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

There are periods in the winter when my solar panels generate only 5-10 kwh/day for 2-3 weeks at a time due to short days and weather.  So I'd need enough batteries to store at least 500 kwh to make sure I can make it through such a time period.  That's about 40 Tesla Powerwalls, at $7,500 each or about $300,000.  But that's not all.  I'd also need 20 or 30 more panels to charge them, another $25,000.  Or about $325,000 to make sure I can make it through the worst 2-3 week period of the year.  The other 50 weeks of the year, most of that capacity is wasted.  \n\nBatteries will never be that cheap.

Harm is harm. Here's an inconvenient truth for you: the ability to prevent environmental harm is a function of economic health. If you harm one, you harm the other.\n\n&gt;We can't start doing something without understanding its effects on the environment. \n\nBullshit. We do it all the time. Do you think solar panels don't represent a monumental impact on the environment? How about batteries? Have you ever looked at all the materials that go into those things? Where do you think they come from? How about windmills? Are the rare and threatened raptors they smack out of the sky somehow different?\n\n&gt;If you want to talk economic harm, how expensive do you think it is to build a levee? \n\nOh, so now you want to talk about economic harm? Alright. How long will deploying solar panels delay building those levees? (Hint: not very damn long.) How about windmills? (Hint: they actually increase fossil fuel consumption: http://www.epaw.org/documents.php?lang=en&amp;article=backup7, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518300983)\n\nIn other words, renewables will not do much at all to prevent those things. Their net effect is close to zero. Yet we subsidize the shit out of them for some reason. Can you imagine how far along we would be if we had spend that money on nuclear energy R&amp;D instead?\n\n&gt;Thats a terrible solution, nuclear waste doesn't go away and it contaminates surrounding earth. \n\nLOL. No.\n\n&gt;I'm very aware the amount is small but gram for gram its the most dangerous substance on earth \n\nOh my god. You can't seriously be this stupid. Read what you just wrote again. See if you can think of some things more dangerous than radioactive waste that's so weak that it has a half-life in excess of 10,000 years. \n\n&gt;so we should have a better plan for it than put it in a box.\n\nWe do. If you had read what I wrote, you would know what it is. I'll give you a hint. India and Russia have both built them. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has 400 PhDs working on them. We have scientifically illiterate liberals preventing them. Can you guess what they are?\n\n&gt;You think lack of nuclear power has more impact than lack of EPA policy enforcement and lack of new policy? \n\nTry phrasing that question again. English this time, please. \n\nLook, you are the one who professes serious concern about CO2. If you are consistent with your professed beliefs, you'll recognize that the U.S. abandoned nuclear power in the 1970s at the behest of Greenpeace and other NGOs. What did we build instead? Coal plants. \n\n&gt;How bout the \"clean coal\" shit? \n\nIt's stupid. That's what I'm saying.\n\n&gt;In a perfect world we can get all of our power for free with no waste, why should we strive to proliferate nuclear over solar/wind?\n\nYou can't be serious. Read the articles I've cited above. Wind increases fossil fuel use. Solar produces for six hours per day on average, requires massive amounts of resources, has embodied carbon that won't be \"paid off\" in many locations, and in order to be useful requires either fossil fuel to back it up or huge overcapacity and batteries that we don't have yet. If you really want to dive deep into this shit, read Clack, et al 2017. They debunk this ridiculous solar/wind only bullshit you keep spewing. \n\nSo why did you decide to side against the majority of scientists on nuclear power? Is it because you are a denier?\n\n&gt;Florida, New Orleans, \n\nWait, wait, wait. You think Florida and New Orleans won't exist in your kids' lifetimes? \n\n&gt;the icecaps, \n\nYou've been to Antarctica and Greenland? I'm dubious about that, mostly because if you'd been there you would know that they aren't going anywhere in your kids lifetimes.\n\n&gt;and the great barrier reef. \n\nYeah, damned sunscreen and lionfish. What does that have to do with climate change, though?\n\n&gt;Please stop this lazy nuclear power whataboutism, \n\nOh, fuck no. You just don't get it. You don't get to pretend to be all worried about the climate, then reject actual solutions to it because your tribe says so. If you want to talk about what scientists recommend, you'll need to wake the fuck up to the fact that you and most so-called environmentalists are on the wrong side of this one. \n\n&gt;I know we don't use nuclear power as much as we could but that doesn't excuse conservatives vehemently defending fossil fuel power. \n\nActually, opposing nuclear power is worse. Conservatives aren't worried about climate change. Liberals are, but when they oppose nuclear power they look:\n\n- scientifically illiterate;\n\n- agenda-driven; and/or\n\n- hypocritical.\n\nYou probably have no idea how disingenuous you look right now, straining at the gnat that is nuclear waste while claiming that you fear all the bad stuff about climate change. Let this sink in, and let it sink in deep: you and the anti-nuclear portion of the environmental movement look like a bunch of fucking hypocrites and that's why the public doesn't take climate change seriously. In the latest Gallup open-ended poll, 2% of Americans listed **anything** related to the environment as their primary concern. You aren't even convincing your own party that climate change is a major problem. If you want to do some real good, go talk to those who oppose nuclear power and help them understand how utterly clueless they appear.\n\n&gt;Not even five years ago some dude brought a snowball into congress to dispute climate change. \n\nDon't give a shit. There are idiots everywhere. People who claim to be worried about climate change and simultaneously oppose nuclear power top the list.\n\n&gt;Some people do not understand the problem at all, which would not be a huge problem if they believed the scientific community. \n\nLOL! You are too, too much. YOU, yourself, **you** don't believe the scientific community on nuclear power! You don't have a speck of self-awareness, do you denier?\n\n&gt;Or they do understand but their corporate donors donate enough for them to feign ignorance, which is much worse.\n\nReally? So solar panels and windmills are built by simple woodland craftsmen? Elon Musk hasn't received billions in subsidies?

I'm obviously not attempting to commit tax fraud, just genuinely curious about where the line is drawn. It was my understanding that things like upgrading an electrical panel for example are able to be counted toward the tax credit, even though that doesn't just benefit the solar panels (or is that not true?). So, if adding the new panels were part of the same project as reinstalling the old ones and they're all part of one connected system -- ie, reinstalling the old panels is a pre-requisite for putting in the new panels, how do you draw the line? do you need to get the installer to give an hourly breakdown of the cost?\n\nLikewise, if the inverter needs to be upgraded to accommodate the panels, do I only get a partial tax credit on it, since I've already received a tax credit on an inverter for the existing panels?\n\nWould most installers know how to address these questions so I can accurately judge any quotes I'd receive?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006229167726511756,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1824139796873169,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.30109397785513836,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22113372120805141,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20583204413465847,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23049253057892977,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2191633637993533,"solar_1":-0.22639074649091337,"solar_2":-0.16444486002358905,"solar_3":-0.2135089232494162,"solar_4":-0.1730378466648593,"solar_5":-0.0039936608615486575,"solar_6":-0.02106884236369903,"solar_7":-0.06124990696115399,"solar_8":-0.14831353349752716,"solar_9":-0.05996998496674166,"solar_10":-0.1117791672279906},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

With a string inverter, even with optimizers, there’s a single point of failure in the central inverter— and string inverters commonly fail.  Enphase micros are now at a failure rate of 5-PPM (5 parts per million) which is insanely low and totally absurd. SolarEdge inverters fail at a rate anywhere from a 5-10x higher- and down goes your ENTIRE array.  If a micro fails- which, is extremely rare— you only lose that panel.

A large portion of solar homes are on what you would call Grid tied systems. This is due to the high cost of inverters and batteries. So the way a grid tied system is designed, there must already be electricity flowing for the solar panels to activate and produce electricity. It occurs to my mind that if the world ends etc the safety switch to ensure the solar panels don't electrocute lineman working on the power outage could be bypassed. So using a small converter or power pack to provide power to a grid tied solar home for five minutes would activate that homes solar panels. You can plug a double male extension cord from power pack into any outlet. Once those panels came on line. They would power the home itself and with no batteries to store the excess it would drift out into the grid. The grid itself would string this current out to other homes and if any of those had grid tied solar they would activate as well after 5 minutes.\n\nSo with no batteries in the grid where would all the electricity go? Would it simply fry the electronics plugged in once the output was higher than the draw on the grid? Or are there enough homes on the grid that it would spread the load to thin and it would never work?\n\nNot sure why but the thought nags me.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0029467606412557266,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1137604386748535,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21838624597990652,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2312590218639746,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2674943226280555,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2861672689335684,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06260069788550027,"solar_1":-0.07726441926242363,"solar_2":-0.13973110272642614,"solar_3":-0.08836621262513158,"solar_4":-0.04928904548199142,"solar_5":-0.048463878470307635,"solar_6":-0.2036556586244842,"solar_7":-0.05327082884467179,"solar_8":-0.02151469517290765,"solar_9":-0.021810290427858092,"solar_10":-0.15960622763183352},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

When the battery approaches full, it's meant to raise the Hz frequency of the AC signal to 62+.

When the grid is functional, excess pressure that's not released by your appliances/absorbed by the battery flows back out into the grid. But when the grid is shut down and the battery is full, there's no place for excess pressure to go.\n\nTesla is actually working on a new communication protocol between their inverter and Powerwall so they can communicate better than just frequency shifts causing binary on/off solar states. They're making it so that when the Powerwall approaches ~90% full, it will start actively communicating with the inverter to modulate solar production down to match home consumption to avoid having to shut down the inverter during an outage.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005041409361486634,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23863113950731882,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.5103191907207171,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1472877487540245,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08185235116565893,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2539954841980653,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2157689618632705,"solar_1":-0.09201977447028603,"solar_2":-0.08186539511532344,"solar_3":-0.2742326836472504,"solar_4":-0.023859503300627694,"solar_5":-0.0015867245335054274,"solar_6":-0.0003466536278817027,"solar_7":-0.20163401728495955,"solar_8":-0.007368693437456386,"solar_9":-0.15514117017839552,"solar_10":-0.15497961160583298},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Lettuce for example is both tolerant of shady conditions and more productive if shade helps maintain a cooler microclimate.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.320260612787024,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16887009644500495,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21490407815914606,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.055470483377575874,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21246719515777385,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23894576759718197,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26767443931506324,"solar_1":-0.0029700865901152915,"solar_2":-0.10355393807799224,"solar_3":-0.0072044803807026865,"solar_4":-0.002095001001483373,"solar_5":-0.13936167570404567,"solar_6":-0.0004914855502041368,"solar_7":-0.0012999713653698564,"solar_8":-0.0007031140751981487,"solar_9":-0.06661071649340045,"solar_10":-0.0355605451137914},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

We all know how the grid is less than reliable so the cost of the batteries may not make sense from an investment perspective but they do from a preparation perspective. \n\nThe other option is a whole house generator but that’s has its limitations as well.

Although of course if there is lawlessness anywhere, that's an issue. We do have a gun though I hope it wouldn't come to that. We do have two power companies in the area and our power has been out less than 5 minutes in 13 years total. I think the other power company wouldn't go down at the same time and half the city would still have power.   \n\nI just looked at an overhead of my house and 3 houses within 4 houses from me either direction have solar including our next door neighbor. Tons of people have it here. I do think I was overstating how many people have it on the roofs. More like one in 7. Although I'm sure plenty of people have backup systems like we do. Solar panel + generator + evaporative cooler + pool water is good enough to cool a bedroom for a week or two. \n\n I'm sure the people next to us would let us sleep in their living room in exchange for drinking water from our pool. \n\nIf all else fails, a bunch of us could head for the big grocery store down the street. It's solar powered too - they have 4 huge solar arrays that act as coverings for their parking. I think people don't realize how much solar Phoenix has. Plus Phoenix has cooling centers (we have one a 5 minute drive or 15 minute walk away at our local library). I expect those would get powered with generators by the city in an outage. It's not like Phoenix doesn't realize this could happen.\n\nThe poor would have to travel a ways to get here, and they probably aren't going far on clogged roads in 115 degree heat. But yeah, certainly it would be no better than an extended outage in an area like Chicago with highrise buildings with gas heat but forced air delivery if the power was out during a cold snap in the winter. I'm sure some people would set their apartments on fire trying to get warm and people trying to get in people's apartments that had gas fireplaces.

A few reasons, but primarily to prevent animal suffering.\n\nSo to answer your question, I would become vegetarian if I could buy my eggs directly from someone in my community who happens to have some hens and a surplus of eggs. I dislike milk, but if I liked it, I would see no issue with buying milk from someone in my community that had dairy cows who have a surplus of milk, and so on.\n\nI think people forget that there can be a symbiotic relationship between us and animals. Someone who has pet hens has a relationship with them that is mutually beneficial. The hens are ensured survival, as they have a very capable being that will feed them, and protect them from predators. We get nutrition from their unfertilised eggs, which would otherwise go to waste. Because we gain life, and they gain life, there is incentive for us to keep the species going.\n\nWhy are cows sacred in hindu religions? Because they recognise the symbiotic relationship with cows is far greater than eating the cow.\n\nSo then: What would need to be done to farming industries to make me become a vegetarian? They would have to be decentralised, and community based. The owner would have to maintain a personal and respectful relationship with the animal. \n\nWhat would need to be done to farming industries to make me into an omnivore? Producing [in vitro meat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat). No exceptions to this, except in the case where the animals do not have brains and therefore are not conscious beings and are equivalent to plants.\n\nEDIT: I should also point out that I dislike eggs, milk, cheese and a lot of meat purely based on how it makes me feel physically. Perhaps there is a psychological reason behind this, as it is a very good form of nutrition. But I feel this is because of the many negative health aspects of eating such things. So even if these changes did happen in farming, I would still eat meat and animal products at a minimum.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3325770237216986,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20440474237150738,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21664524270193844,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14343610520807898,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08110918352228207,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2393028232569705,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2526044375839943,"diet_1":-0.07252493291935025,"diet_2":-0.2111295050642249,"diet_3":-0.14276938781910076,"diet_4":-0.07604596295228987,"diet_5":-0.09907409643284065,"diet_6":-0.04005575838262904,"diet_8":-0.05426927897176029,"diet_9":-0.059646511618969576,"diet_10":-0.0753168516191863,"diet_11":-0.1952597097188118,"diet_13":-0.08615518332194165,"diet_14":-0.14734554855068735,"diet_17":-0.14633576922200472},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I think an environmental vegan would probably end up settling with eating a small, sustainable portion of animal products.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.07613426011221058,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24354681074396403,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20095045694481345,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3092088532189333,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24761627014180856,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.09903610496454007,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06233064255987605,"diet_1":-0.009496186345738048,"diet_2":-0.17715581690622012,"diet_3":-0.15658217374038924,"diet_4":-0.12104997637623992,"diet_5":-0.15249360511097362,"diet_6":-0.0760398226848202,"diet_8":-0.11568895763848445,"diet_9":-0.0006273631540049488,"diet_10":-0.022480417992483126,"diet_11":-0.0022644277354023266,"diet_13":-0.023011784302070737,"diet_14":-0.16140109202145445,"diet_17":-0.006549774855254024},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (injunctive norm for ethical and environmental vegans)","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Just add vegan to the search term (you could also add low waste if you're feeling extra environmental haha) and there's usually lots of stuff. When you find something you like make sure to check the ingredients to make sure you're getting quality stuff, I like [INCI Decode](https://incidecoder.com/)r for skincare and you can use [this website](http://www.isitcg.com/) if you're following the Curly Girl method for hair. For serum and moisturizer for my face I'm using stuff from Eminence right now, its expensive but it's vegan, cruelty free, and all in all very environmentally friendly!

Yes, but I’m bigger than his stupid opinions and when I come over for dinner they always have an option for me. Actions in this case needs to speak louder than words. He tried it, he tried a gross way of eating it- I was drooling at your description with the caramelized onions. Also, he may be saying this in an over the top way to try to deter your sister from going vegetarian. My bf is a huge carnie and since we moved in together he has LOVED all things beyond and vegan. He’ll still eat meat when we eat out but he truly loves the beyond burgers and has convinced others to try them. People are gonna be skeptical, especially when they know it’s not real. Make him some hot Italian beyond sausage and just egg and tell him it’s real meat and I guarantee you he’ll rave. :) Godspeed friend.

Put stuff in glass instead of plastic when it comes to food storage.

Not 100% on the specifics, but there is a proprty to the plastic here than can't be replaced by glass. And this woukd be the field needed for everything from stemcell technology to lab grown meats. I totally think we can find an akternative out there, but saving what little oil we have left fir these uses untik we find a solution woukd be relevant.

And synthetic chemistey is only going to get better with tech, so we could have all sorts of unseen benefits for saving the remaining oil for this.
