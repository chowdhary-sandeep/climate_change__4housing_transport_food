"comment": "Because the Tesla has open diffs, whereas everything /u/ViperRT10Matt said has some kind of locking mechanism in place.  Applying an individual brake on one side is NOT a Tesla innovation and has been around for a long time.  \n\nJust because Tesla added something to it's cars doesn't mean it's new and exclusive.\n\nA Subaru STi or Mitsubishi Evo has locking front and rear diffs for example.  The Evo has torque vectoring.  It doesn't just lock the wheel, it *applies torque* to the wheel that needs it actively.  That's substantially better.  I believe the Nissan GTRs system does the same thing.\n\nAnd I base that on fundamental understanding of racing systems and what dozens of marques have done with their drivetrains.  \n\nEdit: gonna leave this here: http://www.clubwrx.net/forums/transmission-awd/134395793-limited-slip-differential-elsd-faq.html",

While it's true most people drive under 50 miles a day, to get mass converts EVs will have to have enough for gas drivers to feel comfortable, and about 200 miles, or 60kWh or so, should do the trick.\n\nConversely, if battery prices keep falling and density keeps increasing, 100kWh may come at almost no cost or weight penalty, meaning the market can support a good range of vehicles, from \"economy\" vehicles with perhaps 30-40kWh to more expensive cars with 100+ kWh, where kWh becomes the new \"My penis is bigger\" measuring stick.",

After all they are in your smartphone, tablet and laptop. However, in cars, they will be arranged in modules that together comprise a pack. The modules themselves shouldn't be too heavy and it's reasonable to think that they could be handled by an adult. But the smaller/lighter they will be, the more of them you will have to have and carry. I just don't get the advantage, at that point it would be more convinient to get an extension cable than handle all those modules. Where it makes sense would be if you run out of power in the middle of nowhere, you could carry a couple of them with you to the nearest house, charge them up and head to the nearest charging station. Or you could call a car service company that could bring you fully charged modules, swap them up and be back on the road in a few minutes after they arrive, instead of having your car toed.",

"comment": "Fair enough, a commute as long as yours puts you in the 0.05% category and an EV isn't isn't for you, please consider a plug in hybrid instead\n\nI would like to add that your viewpoint is one many people hold before they actually try living with an EV, at which point that they learn to balance charging around their lifestyle. Rather than looking at the picture as charging in big blocks while you sit twiddling thumbs, owners sneak in charges as they go about their daily tasks. \n\nA lack of infrastructure to do this in your region is not necessarily a failing of the cars, it's a failure of local infrastructure. \n\nSerious planning? The cars do it for you. Put your destination on the sat-nav and it tells you if it'll be possible or not and where you'll have to make charging stops. \n\nEven if you take a small EV, by assuming you get 80 miles instead of 100 (the buffer) that's 40 miles both ways, but lets be extra stingy and call it 35. Yep, still enough to cross an entire city twice. \n\nBut yeah if you feel a Tesla barely holds enough range - 260+ miles worth - then I do seriously question the length of your average round-trip and it brings me back to my original point: try a hybrid. Do you live in the sticks? \n\nWhat set me off about your original comment was the part where you claimed EVs can only replace bicycles (despite the fact lots of people who have made the switch not only find the EV has replaced their daily driver for 95% of trips, but they do not plan to buy an ICE again.) In short it's a public perception issue and people have to live with the cars for a while and they almost always then around and say \"this is easier than I thought. I was wrong!\"",

I don't think Elon said that though.\n\nAnother claim I've heard, which I've not had confirmed, is that hydrogen tanks leak a lot of hydrogen over time, since hydrogen diffuses so easily. Do you know if that's true?\n\nOtherwise, I can't think of any outright lies. Maybe half-truths. Some say fuel cells are super expensive, which they are, but newer versions are much cheaper. Do you know if they are in production though?\n\nHFC will become cheaper. But so will batteries. Will HFC ever catch up?\n\nConsidering that Toyota, which was betting hugely on fuel cells, is now making a shift towards BEV, it seems HFV takes two steps forward and one back.",

On days when we don't run the air conditioner (rare), we average about 30 kWh.  During the summer, 80kWh is not unheard of.\n\nSo, for about $12,600, I can install 2 Tesla Powerwall 2's, with 27kWh, which will get me through a day with no AC, about 8ish hours with AC.  If I use it only for outages, it will probably still be at 70-80% capacity in 15 years, with some luck.\n\nOr, instead I got a high end 20kW propane generator for about $7500.  a $300 gallon tank of propane will run my whole house for about 3-4 days non-stop.  Should last for 15-20 years, again with luck.\n\nCurrently I pay $0.12 per kWh electricity, same day or night.  There's no break even point for me outages.\n\nAgain, a battery that just switches on would be so much easier and cleaner.  But until I can get a 40kW system that lasts for 15 years or so installed for 10k, its just too expensive.  Our last power outage was from a storm, and lasted 26 hours, in the middle of summer.",

They will make and sell whatever people will buy.\n\nPeople would buy a $40000 electric car with 60 kWh and 150 kW charging right now. Whose making those cars?\n\nPeople have bought $100000 electric cars with anything between 50 kWh to 90 kWh in the last 7 years. Who made those cars?\n\n\nWe have been there for the luxury segment for a decade and now we're at the point where nothing at $40000 or higher should be powered by fossil fuels, they all can be made and sold at a profit while being electric without sacrificing anything, least of all performance.\n\nThis myth that ICE cars are such money makers is nothing but a deceit. Behold the lie\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States\n\nIf making ICE cars is such a sure fire thing for making money, why did so many companies go under? Surely you jest mister. The car making business is not a place where anyone can make it, no matter what they do, it's a mean and tough environment where anybody can fail no matter what product they make and that includes cars running of fossil fuels. Remember [this](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-idUSN3044658620090601)? Not to mention that all of this happened at a time when the fuel they use is subsidized in the trillion dollar range every year and nobody is paying for externalities.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf\n\n\nIt's not that they can't make desirable electric cars that can sell well, the reality is that historically car makers have refused to do that even when it has become feasible. NOBODY is even asking them to take chances, Tesla took chances but the large manufacturers are  failing even at following in the footsteps of those who charter new territories.",

"comment": "That is precisely the quandary. \n\nMargins for dealers on new cars is already very slim, their profits come from service. And EV require little service. Hopefully, GM won't dumb down EVs to appease dealers.\n\nI suspect, many mom and pop dealers will fold as EVs gain traction. That will leave us with the Carmax type superstores who can operate on slim margins due to volume. Or, direct from manufacturer sales like Tesla.\n\nEVs are disruptive to the auto industry. Disruption often comes from more than just technology, but changes to distribution and support systems as well. Think about smartphones, Apple didn't invent new tech, they collected disparate technologies and packaged them, then changed the whole carrier subsidy way of distributing the products and ongoing software management.\n\nLosing mom and pop dealers might not be such a bad thing, and those who see where this is headed will embrace the changes to prepare to step up to the new ways of distributing cars to consumers.\n\nSo, GM is correct in stating dealers are part of the problem. But, the solution will be disruptive to the dealers who resist.",

After GM also lost Opel/Vauxhall to PSA the mass market was gone.\nTesla just came back with the model 3 in 2019.\nPeople will be careful in the beginning,  but if those chinese cars are any good, trust will be built and then those might sell if they have a selling point like low prices despite acceptable quality.  So far the Chinese rather focused on the east asian market but the first step was buying shares of other brands and get some influence (like MG which is SAIC)",

Tesla needs way more outlets because they need to support way more cars, they had a market share of 80% in 2020. The ratio for cars that have to share a single outlet is in favor of CCS. So if you have no issue charging at a SuperCharger, you definitely won't have an issue charging with CCS. \n\nCCS also has the *huge* benefit of not being locked into a walled garden. Your Model Y makes you completely dependent on Tesla and nothing but Tesla for all your fast charging. A single company controls everything. With CCS you're independent and can choose any charging network you want.",

"comment": "Thanks for the explanation, but I’m an electrical engineer with a masters degree. I understand the difference. I was trying to explain to you that 12V lead acid car batteries are night and day different than 400V lithium ion batteries, especially from a safety perspective. This isn’t about just “high current,” although yes high currents in general can produce heat if not designed properly. \n\n1) It is very hard to overcharge a lead acid battery in a dangerous way. Typically the most dangerous side effect of charging is production of hydrogen gas which can be explosive in enclosed spaces (eg buildings) which is why venting can be required when large lead acid batteries are installed indoors. \n\n2) The gross amount of ENERGY contained in the EV lithium battery is orders of magnitude higher. If the issue with a single cell malfunction or short was contained to only that cell, this wouldn’t be an issue. It’s the fact that it propagates to adjacent cells which store massive amounts of energy that causes the “thermal runaway”. \n\n3) lead acid batteries are typically charged while the car is on, not parked. They do not spontaneously combust. The risk profile here with EVs is that charging is typically done in a garage or near a building, many times at night. \n\nDon’t get me wrong. I’m an EV proponent. I just ordered my 3rd one. I work on them for a living. And I will probably install a fire protection system in my garage with sprinklers because these things charge at night near my kids room. At the moment, as an “expert” in this field, I do not have enough information to evaluate the relative risk, given how dependent it is on lithium cell manufacturer, age, charging rate, what SOC you charge too, how often you use DCFC, etc. Manufacturers need to get ahead of this and figure it out. I’m confident they will. In the meantime I am still going to buy EVs, but I’ll bulk up my fire protection for a few years.",

The big assumptions being that:\n\n1. Manufacturers can produce enough EVs in varying price points to satisfy the market demands\n\n2. Law makers continue to pass laws that are favorable to EV adoption. \n\nIf both those things fail we’ll end up more towards the 50% number. If they accelerate than we’ll be closer to that 90% number. \n\n(Now granted that’s new vehicle sales. There will still be a lot of older ICE vehicles on the road in 10 years. Especially if this recession hits us hard.)",

I said Tesla ahs been running a more efficient operation but their biggest advantage in terms of maintaining large vehicle margins is that they are able to do direct sales. Typically Dealers are making about 15%  on sales when selling at MSRP. That's margin the legacy automakers are forced to give up since most states still prohibit legacy manufactures from direct sales. \n\nIt can be true both that they are running the line more efficient and are getting a massive margin advantage by being able to sell direct to consumers",

"comment": "Welcome to the wonderful world of professional EV media / faux-journalism.  Where the journalists are terrible and often have financial conflicts of interests. (They're trading stock in EV companies, often without disclosure.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTo add... PHEVs are solid even with great charging infrastructure.  They're the most efficient use of battery materials for replacing daily commuter miles with electricity versus gasoline, given that the auto industry is still battery cell production constrained, limiting long range BEV production growth.  If society wanted PHEVs, if government properly incentivized the sale of PHEVs instead of giving larger handouts to BEVs, and the OEMs were justified in building them, we could see nearly half of all ICEV production replaced with PHEVs this year. (last year in fact)  The other half could be replaced with HEVs with the remaining cell capacity.\n\nDoubling current annual cell production would only result in enough cells for about 16 million long range BEVs, but the same doubling could be used for 81 million PHEVs... replacing all new ICEVs with PHEVs.  It wouldn't take a single DC fast charger to accommodate it, and would result in a much faster reduction in gasoline use in a far shorter period of time.  Meaning less CO2 entering the atmosphere/ acidifying our oceans in the short term, and less CO2 that we need to use loads of energy to pull back out of the atmosphere and oceans and find a place to sequester it.  Instead, we'd just leave the oil in the ground, where it can happily stay sequestered.\n\nThe most optimal solution for daily commuting is a battery that's sized with a capacity that meets daily driving needs and no more.  Even better with workplace charging, where the battery size could be halved... although that comes with the caveat that the electric powertrain will be very underpowered.  (If only society didn't prioritize high highway speeds )\n\nI like that the author suggested a PHEV needed 90 miles of range in order to go weeks (yes he started with weeks, not months) without going to a gas station.  There average daily r/t commuting distance in the US, which has the longest average commute in the world AFAIK, is only 32 miles.\n\nHe also presumes that PHEV miles driven on gas means the driver is intentionally choosing to not charge.  In reality, maybe the person doesn't have access to a nightly or workplace charger, or they're still in an older model PHEV that doesn't have enough range to fit their daily needs.  The original Prius PHEV only got 13 miles of electric range.\n\nMeanwhile... in my Chevy Volt with 53 miles of range and 25 mile r/t commute... I often get home with 20+ miles of remaining range (weather dependent), and haven't used more than a gallon of gas in local driving in the past 6 months or so; much less the 8 gallon tank capacity.  I took a 500 mile road trip this year, so that used about 12 gallons.    I have another trip lined up this summer which will use about 7 gallons.  I may use 25 gallons of gas for the entire year.\n\n90 miles of electric range instead of 53 would likely save me about 3 additional gallons per year, with a battery that's 36% larger.  It likely wouldn't even reduce enough emissions over the vehicle's lifetime to offset the battery's manufacturing emissions.  That's before considering I'd lose space in the vehicle cabin, the vehicle would be heavier and less efficient overall, and it would likely need a heftier chassis, brakes, and wheels/tires to manage the heft.\n\nVersus my Volt:\n\n* A 30 mpg ICEV driving 13500 miles per year would use about 450 gallons of gas.  The Volt is saving me 425 gallons of gas, a gasoline reduction of about 95%.\n* A 40 mpg HEV driving 13500 miles per year would use about 338 gallons of gas.  The Volt is saving 313 gallons of gas, a gasoline reduction of about 92.5%.\n\nNot to mention the savings in oil drilling, refining, and logistics.\n\nHell, I could even get away with a smaller battery and still see similar results.",

Can it be done? Yes absolutely. Would it cost time, money, resources, delays, and annoyance? Oh yes. Does the competition need to do this? No.\n\nOne thing is if you had to go to Tennessee, another thing is if you had to go to Mexico, drive it up to Alabama, and then pay import taxes and have the papers translated to English. Oh, and most of the superchargers won't work because the electricians refuse to service them. And you have to pay cash in Mexico, because your bank refuse to deal with anything Tesla Corp.",

The driving experience is actually sublime. it has steer-by-wire so theres no physical connection to the wheels (Think the technology that big commercial jets and fighter planes have) this means I can make a U-turn in this truck or parallel park this w my pinky moving it from right to left. I almost forgot how.....interesting looking of a vehicle I was driving cuz again it genuinley makes every other car including other Teslas immediatly feel so so old. After driving it I would actually consider getting one for the driving experience. I know its not a real truck nor am I gonna try to be liek \"oh yeah I drive a truck\" No, I drive a EV cosplaying as a truck but thats fine. Weirdly after driving it my brain is finding more reasons to like ti / tryna justify the looks like \"well i mean it does look kinda futuristic its not thaaat bad right\"",

"comment": "That's been reposted several times and it looks like an AI written story. \n\nNone of the facts are right, it says a traditional gas engine uses over 10,000 parts.  You may have a few hundred parts if you count every bolt. It says an electric motor has several hundred parts, they have much less than that. \n\nWe have 42k miles on our AWD Ioniq 5 with the original tires and they still look good, likely get to the 50k+ range before needed tires.  Did an oil change on one of our employees cars last month, a 2019 Jeep Compass with 36k miles on it and the tires are bald, told him they should have been changed 5000 miles ago.",

An ebike is more safe for stability but as long as your vigilant about road features I think scooters prevail in convenience  of portability and it's worth the trade.",

"comment": "Well, I read the thread yesterday so could have forgotten, but I don’t recall high praise for Musk, just a refusal to see his  (and Tesla’s) faults as worse than others overall. It wasn’t a ‘they can do no wrong’ attitude. Being mad about Dieselgate and OEMs protecting the fossil fuel economy, opposing reforms for decades, seems to have driven a lot of people to the “pure” EV world. I’m a bit in that camp myself. Once you create good and bad guy categories (EV startups vs traditional OEMs in this case), you’re going to be prone to accept further arguments that put your team in a good light and the other side in a bad light. So, just normal cognitive bias. Pretty sure you have it too.",

"comment": "&gt; Germany would like to have a word with you... at 53* north latitude, or about the same as Edmonton Alberta Canada.\n\n&gt; \"sunny\" Spain is somewhere around the latitude of NYC\n\nNo Germany is well aware of the issue; Spain as well.\n\nBoth have similar problems in winter -- the winter sun just isn't as intense (again, you DO actually understand that, right? that due to the angle, and also as a result of said angle, the increased thickness of the atmosphere the sunlight needs to penetrate reduces the intensity).\n\nAnd Spain is called \"sunny\" because of the reduced cloud cover -- due to WEATHER.\n\n*But really you're just demonstrating the kind of ignorance that I've come to expect from the \"solar-will-power-everything\" types.*\n\n&gt;Anyways I mostly agree with you on the storage issue and that subsidies are bad... but don't knock solar because it's connected to the climate nutjobs. \n\nQuit being an ass. I have nothing against solar, and have long been interested in it, as well as wind and even small (micro) hydro.\n\nBut there is a difference between that and the ridiculous exagerrated position that you've taken (regardless of whether you are a warmista or not) -- the tech has LIMITED applications, period.\n\nYes, as the cost of the panels goes down the applications broaden out a bit wider -- but they don't cover everything, and they never will -- not even if the cost of PV panels were to sink to virtually $0.\n\n&gt;PV's are getting more awesome by the day, are insanely cheap and storage battery costs have been plummeting aswell at ~ 14% a year for the last 10 years despite MASSIVE demand. \n\nAnd -- as I already noted -- as the cost of PV's drops (and at install were never more than around 50% of the equation to begin with) they become less and less important to the total cost equation, so that further reductions reap diminished changes.\n\nAs to batteries, no the costs have NOT dropped that rapidly.  The costs *of the most expensive (only slightly higher energy density)* ***battery chemistries** *have dropped* as they have finally entered mass commercial production -- but that is not the same thing -- nor are the more exotic battery chemistries without their own problems.  But the actual cost per kW of storage capacity of the cheapest battery systems has really **not** gone down more than a tiny amount -- IOW the cost equation hasn't changed.\n\n&gt;Tack on some industrial grade graphene super caps in a few years... and we **might be** well on our way to limitless energy.\n\nYeah, uh huh... and fusion power is only two decades away... just like it was only two decades away 50 years ago.\n\n&gt;Don't be that guy that said computers or the internet or cell phones, genome project, whatever will never be more then a novelty... Cheap power will change the world and, IMO, Solar is the only non theoretical way I see us getting there. \n\nSee and now you're demonstrating just how problematic ignorance and Kool-Aid drinking can be.\n\nYou're positing that battery tech (based on your ridiculous misunderstanding of the \"trends\" and history of battery tech) is following some \"Moore's Law\" path; (alas more's the pity) in fact **it simply is NOT doing so.**\n\nI'm sorry, but **you've been sold a proverbial \"bill of goods\" (a LIE) on that.** While the [XKCD \"extrapolation\" cartoon](http://xkcd.com/605/) is intended as a joke, it is pretty much EXACTLY the kind of \"trap\" you have fallen into.\n\nWhat you've been sold -- [via deceptive charts like this one](http://kk.org/thetechnium/Battery%20Energy%20Density.jpg) -- is really a complete and total LIE -- the time-lines of the innovation &amp; density have been distorted in EXACTLY the manner that the [XKCD \"Extrapolation\" cartoon](http://xkcd.com/605/) does.\n\nThe REALITY is significantly different than that distorted deceptive chart implies. *Battery tech has really NOT been advancing much at all -- not in terms of ACTUAL energy density storage capacity.*  You THINK they have because the power consumption needs of most electronics have been *dropping*, the reasons your new smart-phone operates longer on a charge is that the phone itself uses LESS power, and because the electronics have gotten smaller, they can contain MORE battery (which gives more capacity *to the device* even though the density of the battery itself remains unchanged).\n\nLithium batteries are relatively OLD technology; the first lithium cells were invented back in the early 1900's, and were already being sold commercially in the 1970's.  The Lithium-Ion (rechargeable) versions were already potentially viable in the production sense back in the mid 1970's as well -- they just didn't get the investment to implement them at that time because: \n\n1. there simply wasn't that much demand for a higher density rechargeable battery (i.e. non-rechargeable Lithium and previous rechargeable chemistries pretty much filled the requirements in the form of applications: hearing aids worked fine on non-recharge Lithium cells, and the calculators and other devices worked just fine on rechargeable NiCad and NiMH); and \n\n2. the manufacture of Li-Ion batteries had significant production difficulties (new production facilities were required, which then meant there would be a premium price to defray -- within what at the time was considered a *very* limited market -- people just weren't going to pay 10x as much for a calculator that would work for multiple days without a recharge; and laptops &amp; cell phones *were foreseen* but were obviously still a decade-plus away\\*).\n\nAs electronics got smaller and more pervasive, and as -- at nearly the same time -- tiny fractional horsepower electric motors became cheaper... then there was increasingly several needs/applications for the (slightly) higher density Lithium chemisties (especially as they also had a slightly better power discharge curve); and they then became commercially viable -- because people (and more importantly *businesses*) were finally willing to pay the premium price for them in things like laptops and portable (cordless) power tools, and a few years later, cell-phones &amp; now smart-phones and tablet computers.\n\nAnd for the much vaunted (overly so) Lithium-*Polymer* batteries -- they are THE SAME chemistry, just on a different substrate (easier to manufacture in different forms, but functionally the same in terms of energy density).\n\n\\* Note that: the battery manufacturers were NOT unaware of the (future) application-needs; and things like laptops and cell-phone systems didn't happen \"suddenly\" without any warning -- the technology to create all of them was already in existence (the first \"portable\" phones had been developed in the 1950's, the first practical cell-phone was demonstrated in 1973; and the first LED/LCD screens in the 1960's) -- but it was also obvious that the perfecting of and build-out of the infrastructure required was going to take a while (and you don't start building massive gasoline refining capacity when the Model T is still 20 years in the future).\n\n---\n\n&gt;So far the trends have been nothing short of amazing.\n\n**No, they only SEEM amazing because you are entirely ignorant of the decades long back-history.**  You're looking ONLY at the recent retail roll-out, and you think that's all there is/was too it -- because you are NOT aware of (and are thus dismissing) the DECADES of careful planning &amp; development that it took to commercialize it all.\n\nAnd because of that... you are naively extrapolating some ADDITIONAL major innovations along a similar trend to what you have SEEN.  And worse you're equating it with a Moore's Law style repeated doubling (the 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x, 64x .. etc).\n\nBut the reality (all the ridiculous claims of people like Elon Musk aside) is that the \"next level\" of energy density is NOT actually in the works yet -- it is NOT in the planning stages; and in fact isn't even fully \"proven\" in anything like a commercially viable form in the labs yet (and announcements [like this one for a Lithium-Sulfur-Graphene chemisty](http://www.gizmag.com/lithium-sulfur-battery-energy-density/29907/) are still speculative and ridiculously overblown -- at BEST it is at least a decade away {more likely two or three decades} and at MOST it promises another \"doubling\" over Li-Ion... beyond that, there is essentially nothing).  Again, it is NOT a \"Moore's Law\" doubling of energy density capacity.\n\n**I wish it WAS.** But again, alas more's the pity... it simply ISN'T.\n\n---\n\nAnd your kind of youthful \"hopefulness\" -- while admirable in many ways -- is extremely naive.\n\nThere have been previous instances of such several times in the past century:\n\n* During the late 1940's and into the 1950's -- young people were *thoroughly convinced* (and there were articles claiming it everywhere) that the future was going to include PERVASIVE NUCLEAR -- why within probably 20 years not only would FUSION be producing *unlimited* amounts of power (virtually for free), but you would be ~~driving~~ nay *flying* your \"nuclear powered hover-car\" everywhere. Not only back and forth to work, but the family would hop into their personal \"Atomo-Flyer\" and pop off to Barbados with \"daddy\" just keying in the coordinates and the auto-computer magically flying them there... woohoo!\n\n* During the 1960's and even still into the 1970's -- people had been \"sold\" on the idea that SPACE TRAVEL was just decades away.  A Moon Base would *certainly* be a reality by 1999, and we would *definitely* have a man on Mars by then (at least akin to the 1969 moon landings). The common man might not be in space -- that would just be a matter of another decade or so, and surely by 2010 or 2020 travel to the moon would be like buying a jet-plane ticket.\n\nAnd so on...\n\n**NONE of those things happened.** Why? Because people didn't understand that what they were being sold was \"bullshit\" -- ridiculously unrealistic extrapolations of technology along paths (and blatantly ignoring very REAL limits and stumbling blocks) that just WEREN'T actually happening.",

"comment": "The 'solar creates jobs' argument has been mentioned several times on this thread, and it is one of the things that suggests to me that the solar advocates really don't have their heads around these issues.   \n\nTaxing Bill and Bob to create a subsidized paycheck for Tom is not 'creating a job,' especially when you're just duplicating/replacing a pre-existing facility. Hazlitt's 'Broken window fallacy' is relevant here.  \n\nAlso, what's been putting coal out of business is natural gas. It burns cleaner and there's a lot of it, so environmentalists don't like it. They like government subsidies and the government control that goes with them.    \n\nMusk seems to be hugely overstating the number of charging cycles his Powerwall is capable of. The batteries have a rather short lifespan and are mining-intensive (with oil-powered machinery).  \n\nLastly, here's how these things work in the real world. California liked the idea of electric cars, so they subsidized charging stations at taxpayers expense. A friend of mine bought one. The car itself got a $7K subsidy per unit from the Feds. (Development got an additional subsidy.) The car was still over $40K, and because of its limited range and cost was only really workable as a second car. In fact almost all buyers were shown to be wealthy and indeed bought it as an additional vehicle. I asked him how much it cost him to get up and running, how much did the home charger cost? His response? \"It didn't cost anything. The state came and installed it for free.\" This is the reality of subsidies: taxing  middle and lower earners to provide stuff and feels to the elite. My buddy might make $400K/year, and for all I know thinks he's being kind of green.",

"comment": "Hi, thanks for the reply.  I probably should have stated that this is a college project, I'm merely researching and coming up with two different setups and comparing the costs of all the factors in each project to see which is the most viable.  \n\nMy setups are as follows:  \n1) Large solar array - off grid system for enough power during winter - sell back power during summer to help contribute towards the installation cost.  Not to mention the increase in property value for having a large solar system.  \n2)  Medium sized array - This will be sized for the midpoint, around 3 hours of sun per day to generate the house's needs.  This means in the winter we will need a grid connection to supply electricity but in the summer we will be selling excess back to grid.  This will of course be cheaper but things like property value won't be increased as much.  \n\nI had some troubles when it came to inverters and charge controllers as I've honestly never heard of them before and my project deadline is in two weeks tomorrow.  That's why I came to Reddit to try and get some help.  I came across [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SUNGOLDPOWER-Inverter-Converter-Controller-Transfer/dp/B013SSK27Q/ref=sr_1_47?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463329097&amp;sr=1-47&amp;keywords=230V+pure+sine+wave+ac+inverter), I think its a combi unit that does both, can someone help explaining this to me, and will this work with my hypothesised system?  I'd really appreciate the help.",

"comment": "Thanks! I find the \"project builder\" section to be useful in coordinating solar project development tasks, particularly between teams. Eventually it'll be slick enough where solar installers can find jobs on it, kinda like a solar craigslist for all parts of project development.\n\nThe real meat and potatoes however is the solar incentive platform. If you move forward with your system, and you aren't receiving any kind of utility incentive, then you likely still own your REC rights. It's a new effort, but I'm hoping to get those customers a 2 cent per kwh production incentive through selling your RECs to third parties.\n\nIdeally a synergy will develop. For instance, solar array owners get paid to sell their RECs through the site, but can also source system maintenance jobs, perhaps paying for the maintenance with their REC sales revenue.\n\nFeel free to check out the \"recordings\" tab for roughly 14 hours of introductory design videos.",

"comment": "&gt;The main driver is Germany’s skyrocketing electricity prices – primarily due to the legally mandatory feeding-in of wind and solar power. Currently regular household consumers are paying nearly 30 cents a kilowatt-hour – almost three times the rate paid in the USA.\n\n&gt;... millions more have been threatened with the loss of electric power: “Power cut-offs were threatened 6.2 million times. The average outstanding amount that electricity providers demanded from the impacted households was 119 euros.”\n\nLots of people accuse the Greens of being communists in disguise, seeing that they often attack capitalism as such. But I thought the communists cared about the little people, the poor.\n\nSo perhaps we can say that the Modern Green Movement combines the worst of the two worlds. Bring together the elitism and the misty irrationality of the environmentalists + the totalitarianism of the reds.",

"comment": "Because they're factoring in the value, as well.\n\ni.e., say you want to renovate your garden. Either you get a $5k garden normal, or you get a $10k garden that comes with a money-tree that grows 1000 $1 dollar bills a year and dies after 10 years. \n\nWhich one is more affordable? Well, the latter generally would be viewed as more affordable, depending on your perspective. After all, the net cost is the lowest (in fact, it's got a negative expected cost), and any money you may not have upfront can be borrowed with financing costs that are lower than the savings it'll get you. Assuming the money-tree is insured for free, everyone would choose the $10k garden.\n\nTesla is kind of doing something similar, but it's less simple as my example above.\n\nNow, a typical solar panel generates about 150 or so watt per square meter, or 14 W per sq ft, that's at around 15% is solar panel efficiency. Say these tile panels are 30% as efficient, or about 4-5%, you'd be looking at about 4 W/sqft. (napkin math here).\n\nNow the solar in the tiles will probably last at least 20 years. A typical location in the US has about 4 solar peak hours per day. So multiply it all: 4W * 4h * 365d is about 5.8 kWh per year, for 20 years that's about 120 kWh generated per sq ft, at a price of about 12 cents per kWh that's about $14.\n\nSo your $21 investment will save you $14. You're losing $7 still, in return you get a roof with a lifetime warranty that seems to be made of stronger material than $3 roofs.\n\nStill expensive, but then I made up a bunch of numbers. If the panels in the roof tiles last 30 years instead of 20 years, or they're not 30% as good as normal solar panels but 50% as good, it's already saving you more money than it costs. \n\nIt's too soon to tell exactly how the numbers play out, as there's not a lot of info, but my point is: it's a fact that this roof generates tens of thousands of dollars worth of electricity, and it seems logical to take that into account.\n\nOf course there's a lot of arguments against the above too, as we're assuming: cost of electricity doesn't drop (would reduce your savings from going solar-roof), you're not selling the house in the mean time (we can generally assume new buyers will not fully price in your investment, as has been shown with solar panels), and I've not at all examined the cost of financing. (i.e., there's an opportunity cost to putting $50k in your roof, which is not getting 'easy' 3-5% + returns on a diversified investment portfolio, which is thousands a year in value, too).\n\nOn the whole, I wouldn't get a Tesla roof myself, financially speaking. (particular due to opportunity cost of the investment). But, the difference is 'net cost' definitely not $3 vs $21. It's much closer.",

"comment": "Not surprised at the higher cost. 3kw is a small system. The overhead doesn't scale the way inverters and panels scale. Think of it this way, what does it cost the installer to install a zero watt system. Marketing, sales, benefits, rent, etc.... let's say overhead is $3000 per system (crazy low  example considering I just read an article in one of the trade mags that said just the customer acquisition cost alone is about $2600 per system)\n\nAnyway if you spend $3000 in overhead per job and put in a 2000 watt system, that's $0.66 per watt. On a 10,000 watt system that's $0.30 per watt. That's a $0.36 per watt swing.\n\nWhile that doesn't make up the difference between $3.50 and $4.54 per watt it covers a third of it.  Dealer volume matters too. A high volume dealer can easily see $0.10-$0.20 per watt in module costs. \n\nCanadian solar panels (Chinese made) run a bit more expensive then many of the other Chinese brands. Not sure why. They are, however, profitable. That's worth something (can you say solar world, Sunivia, suntech, Solon, evergreen... all bankrupt)\n\nThe Sunivia trade case is starting to drive panel prices up. We just saw a 10% jump in our tier 1 module because distributors are stockpiling expecting Trump to fuck the industry by signing the Sunivia dispute.  (That trade case threatens to add $0.40 per watt to imported panels)",

Under the Santee Cooper structure, they will still use the first 800 kWh that you produce to offset the 800 kWh that you used, but then the additional 200 kWh will be credited to you at a lesser rate. For example, if the credit is 90% of retail (I'll use 90% because I don't know what the actual rate is in Santee Cooper), they will credit you with 180 kWh (90% of the extra 200 kWh) to use the next month, or if it's converted to $, then it will be 90% of the retail rate.",

I brought up the topic of battery storage and they advised against it, saying prices would drop a lot and I should wait.\n\nThey did advise me to put dish washer and washing machine and dryer on a timer so they would run at peak solar production times, and told me that if my fridge was modern enough I could actually turn it off for up to 12 hours and it would still hold the temperature. But my fridge pulls about 200 watts and I decided against it.\n\nDue to my Solar Edge realtime monitoring app, I am pretty well informed about my „steady“ loads (fridge, server, water bed) and my part time heavy loads (washer, dryer, cooking). Lights don‘t really play a role. I use LEDs but I would say lighting makes up about 2-3% of my total electricity bill.",

I'm not familiar with it so I can't say just how big of an issue it is, but toxicity and damages to local environments is a big issue with renewable energy sources right now. For example mining lithium isn't exactly great for the areas around the mine. So it doesn't seem very desirable to go to something that is toxic for solar panels.",

"comment": "Solar does exist in ts current form due to subsidies. Not just the tax credit, but the big one is forcing utilities to allow solar customers to use their grid as a 100% efficient and unlimited battery storage system is a HUGE subsidy. Compare the cost of an off-grid solar system sized to offset energy demands with the same reliability and capacity as the grid and their is no competition between solar and grid energy. I'm all for solar (am an installer BTW) but to say solar is anything but a great investment DUE to the subsidies is disingenuous.",

With the legal situation between them and other solar manufacturers, I'd happily intake that as bullcrap. Even LG and Q.CELLS are not giving 20 years product warranty because they are scared of legal implications that REC isn't scared of as they have recently proven.  The key to purchasing solar is ROI. If you are not making a decent ROI in the products warranty then you are not in the right place on the planet for solar. Simple as that. Do your own math. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample of worst-case scenario \"5kw system in an average day will produce 25kW. (5 hours of sunlight) 25kW multiplied by your feeding tariff. (20c in NSW AUS). 25x20c=$5 a day. $5 x 365  = $1,825 a year. Times that by 10 years average = $18,250. An average system that won't fall off after 4-5 years says Q.CELL or LG for a 5kW system is 7k. That leaves you with $11, 250 profit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample of best case scenario  \"5kw system in an average day will produce 30kw (6 hours of sunlight) 30kW multiplied by providers cost per kW.

With a system price of 7k. that leaves you with $24,660 profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo positive financial invest of between $11,250 and $76,650.

"comment": "You'd be surprised how many home buyers would be attracted to a house WITH a system only 5/25 years old. Still gives them up to 20+ years of lower/zero electricity costs. You can assign a $ value to that. And it's not like having solar on your house in the state is rare, which is part of the reason it could be a selling point.\n\nAlso, I thought Tesla was really struggling to make the conventional solar PV business work. Maybe that's why this strikes me as a sort of frivolous way to repackage leasing. Would a new buyer have to qualify to take on the \"subscription\"?",

"comment": "Seems like a little negotiation got you a much better deal! In today's residential solar install world there is not a ton of profit on each job so this may be a good deal. \n\nOne way to help compare apples to apples is to look at the price per watt. Originally the LG system was $3.57/W and now they are down to $3.29/W (where the Boviet was 3.24/W).  In my area it is not unusual for the LG (depending n the model) to be 20-30 cents more per watt. \n\nWe do not know anything about your system or your home so it would be hard for anybody to say for sure if this is a good deal. For all we know this is on a 12/12 Spanish tile roof. In my area, simple residential installs are around $2.90/W. If this is a small yet reputable local installer that you trust and have a good rapport with, then price should not be your only concern. I can all but guarantee that your best long term experience will not be with the company that gives you the lowest price.   \n\nI do not know the installed costs in your area, but if you want confirmation you could always have a couple of the large companies like Tesla or Sunrun get you a quote so you  can have a better felling of where the standard costs are there. That would give you a baseline to compare, though I still highly recommend you go with a smaller local company that you trust.",

Flying is a big one, yet its harms are so large that many simply won't acknowledge them, so we make mental bargains with ourselves; \"I bought rooftop solar so now I can fly without guilt.\"\n\nThis is common behavior in many collective challenges, not only climate. \"I'll wear a mask but I won't get vaccinated; I'll buy a gun safe but I won't give up guns; etc.\"",

Really drives up the cost of a system and really hard to get ROI on it.  But if you need it for reliable power, then it could be worth it.  Tesla powerwall, Enphase are good",

Would love to get your take here since we are feeling a bit overwhelmed.\n\nWe are located in Massachusetts and the roof pretty much gets full sun. Our monthly bill is something like $200 and if I am reading my bill right it seems like we are paying .26kwh (out last bill was about $174 for 668kw. According to the sales guy we wouldn't be able to get cash from the utility company but we will build credits for future bills if we generate more than we consume (net metering?). We have no plans on selling our house anytime soon. We had our roof redone about 10 or so years ago.\n\nSystem Size: 9.2 kW.\n\nNumber of Panels: 23.\n\nPanel Type: Canadian 400 W.\n\nInverter Type: Enphase.\n\nTotal Cost: 46k.\n\nTotal Estimated Rebates/Credits: 13k.",

"comment": "That is true that you get accelerated depreciation (minus half the ITC rate) for commercial deals. I was speaking from experience because the CPA firm our customers use does not generally file for the ITC on rental properties except for some narrow exceptions. And they have a whole team that exclusively does both residential and commercial solar tax documents. \n\nWhat a lot of people don’t realize is that because the tax code is long, confusing, and has parts that contradict each other, it ends up leading to many different interpretations by different tax professionals. And the IRS doesn’t give guidance on every single nuance of the tax code so you are mostly on your own. If you found a tax professional who signed off on that strategy and attached their professional license to your return and will defend you in an audit, fantastic. But I’m just saying there are experts in the field of solar tax credits who also disagree and aren’t willing to file for the ITC on rental properties. Maybe it’s a liability thing and they don’t trust people to document their 250 hours and want to avoid getting screwed during an audit. Or it could be something else. At the end of the day, I’m not paying the head attorney’s hourly rate to ask that question to win a disagreement on Reddit. \n\nSuffice it say, there are options but definitely need to talk with a tax pro before making any decisions.",

I pay for grid maintenance.  There is a fee for when I use kWh from my NEM 2.0 bank.\n2. Power companies take my excess without paying me and sell it to others on the grid until, on average six months later.  This is also a huge savings to the electric company because the power plants and grid didn't have to be used as my excess is used locally.\n\nRooftop solar is a gift to the power companies.

If your system is installed before December 31, 2022 you Will be grandfathered in\n\n\nWhat we are seeing at the company I work for is a huge increase in sales volume and a huge increase in battery backup systems\n\n\nEdit. I literally just work all day and hardly follow this. They say install and i go to town. \n\nThe laws seem to have fluctuated from 10 to 20 and one comment below says you have until end of 2023\n\nBUT! If you plan to go solar you should probably jump on it NOW\n\nThe last recommendations I have is if you go with a larger company likely your warranty will be honored for a long time\n\nBut if you go with a smaller company likely they won’t charge you as much",

There is also a Enphase white paper that explain it well if you search this subreddit. \n\nAs for the install it went really well and they did all the paperwork and submittals. It’s been running smoothly and the app is really nice. I have the Sense system installed as well so I have CTs which is something you can’t get directly from AP Systems (yet) which adds a bit more consumption information.

"comment": "That has been incredibly informative and insightful. I greatly appreciate it. :)\n\nI couldn't say much about the operation that went on at my grandmothers farm. I was a bit too young to really ask those kinds of questions. \n\n&gt; I'm not an engineer -- just an environmentalist. And yep, I am very familiar with permaculture methods. I mentioned beans and nuts because they are great nutritional replacements for eggs, but in an ideal situation they would be grown alongside other fruits and vegetables as well. However, standard permaculture does often rely on livestock manure which, through my understanding of vegan organic farming, is entirely unnecessary. In fact, when trying to address animal rights in the popular manual The Permaculture Way, the author resorts to the fallacy of \"where would all the farm animals go if we didn't eat them??\" while simultaneously admitting that manure isn't actually necessary.\n\nI only take issue with this last statement. I think since we have domesticated many of these animals to the point that they can no longer survive without us, it is now our moral imperative to ensure their survival. They may not be necessary in some parts of farming, but they cannot go ignored since they have many uses when it comes to agriculture, and they have high cultural importance in many countries. Manure may not be necessary, but it is a great option, and in a world undergoing incredibly fast transformation, more options is what is needed, because the best solution cannot always be distributed worldwide.",

These are the reasons why people don't try vegan and vegetarian diets. I'm betting that we're going to hear more than a few reports about how \"This was nothing like what I'd been told!\"   \nMaybe you were, but I wasn't born vegan. I had to try it, see how I felt about it, and then decide if I wanted to keep up with it.

I'm sure many people in that class will not give up meat, but they were polite and didn't go out of their way to be rude. \n\nOther than that the class really liked it, I did a Q/A for about 5 minutes after the speech and a lot of people told me that they weren't aware of all of the impact their diet had on the world and their own health. A couple told me that they were going to attempt to be vegan. :)",

"comment": "My partner and I do it on $250 a month (which is close). But we go for organic almost exclusively so if you went conventional it could be cheaper. Ours is a fairly labor intensive approach (compared to the modern average) using a lot of beans/legumes and grains (cooked up with garlic and herbs) rotated for nutritional and flavor variety. We also garden and she is an avid gleaner, raiding the neighborhood for apples/peaches/apricots etc to can in the late summer and fall. I'm a former professional chef so I'm very comfortable and efficient in the kitchen. Being able to cook from scratch as second nature is a HUGE advantage.\n\nI like this site:\nhttp://www.10in10diet.com/\nfor a general 'system' of how to do it. Not totally vegan but vegetarian and easily veganized (no meat and minimal other animal products which can be easily replaced). I use a variation of her cabbage soup recipe. It's very vege heavy so nutritious especially with grain and/or legumes added.  She also has a great breakfast system for oatmeal that's cheap as well. Our favorite dinner is the 'monk bowl', grain and legumes (whatever is in the fridge) topped with steamed kale, collards, broccoli etc, whatever's on sale or cheap at the store or farmer's market. It's cheap, super nutritious and filling. Breakfast is steel cut oats (we buy a 25# bag) with raisins and cinnamon cooked overnight in the thrift store crock pot with flaxseed and the aforementioned gleaned fruits. My partner bakes bread and other treats (oatmeal raisin cookies mmmmm) so we have goodies too! Every now and then I'll make a different soup or try a new recipe for variety but we pretty much stick to the standard fare. As a student you could see the 'monotony' of the diet as the short term trade off for a cheap but nutritious and ethical diet. I don't see it as monotonous but 'consistent'.\n\nIn sum $25 a week is very doable if you eschew organics,seek the cheapest sources of highest quality food in your budget, don't demand constant variety and are willing to put in a little time to cook. Hope this is useful and not just a wall of text. Good luck!",

It is completely logical and easy based on my ethical convictions. Why do we put ourselves through a life where we do not take what isn't ours, we do not kill everything that annoys us and where we do not punch everyone we want to punch? To me those are very similar actions, but instead of other humans being on the receiving end we put animals on the receiving end of it.\n\nTo me a vegan lifestyle is incredibly simple. It is the only way I personally can live my life and not feel like a horrible, hypocritical, violent parasite. Not everyone sees it that way, of coarse, but personally I do.\n\nSo, in the grand scope of things there is nothing, nothing ridiculous about going full on vegan. Look at the definition;\n\n\"Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.\" \n\nIt is the LEAST we can do. For our fellow animals(and distant cousins), and as a bonus for ourselves, for the environment and for other people and coming generations.",

And a lot of egg, too, because you can hardly eat a veggie unless it is battered and fried (if not that, then boiled with hamhock). \n\nThat said, our southern ancestors have seen a lot of poverty and tweaking recipes to use what you have is as much a tradition, imho, as any particular ingredient. And my husband has made some great dishes that have gone over well with our fellow southerners, including his collard greens with liquid smoke and sundried tomatoes (instead of ham), biscuits and sausage gravy (Gimmelean works amazing), and deep-fried seitan. He even makes some good pumpkin fritters, though it took a while to rework his mom's recipe.",

I second the Oreo thing haha there are tons of vegan junk foods you can easily Google but honestly go big or go home. One of the main benefits of being vegan is the health so don't be a cheagan! I recommend just eating a lot of fruits and always keep yourself filled with food! Don't starve cause it makes you crash and crave the sugary processed stuff. I LOVE dried fruits. Great for a high carb low fat diet. I recently made these carob freezer fudge for my vegan boyfriend on Valentine's day and both him and his brother and their omni friend loved it. If you love chocolate, look up recipes with carob! Seriously though these freezer fudge taste just like chocolate http://ohsheglows.com/2014/08/05/easy-carob-almond-freezer-fudge-frosty-recipe/",

But my sister is vegan too, so I cook a vegan entree for us, and I also cook all the side dishes, which everyone eats. So at least they are eating less animal products than before. With my parents and the older relatives I have been less successful with the ethical argument and reasoning, than with the approach of this food is also delicious. I don't live at home but often spend two weeks at a time at home, and cook all vegan for the family, and they are basically vegan when I am home because of this. They are also open to a whole new range of foods and eating styles. Every small step counts!",

I'm still not sure about eggs, but unless the chickens were fed well I think they're unhealthy too. Honey is pretty much liquid sugar.\n\nAnd I'd quit eating meat and other animal products I'll probably replace it with healthier products, not with vegan fast food and candy.\n\nAnd health is important for lots of reasons, I've been feeling unenergetic the last year, doctors couldn't find anything. I've heard good things about people switching over to a plant based diet. I guess I could have just added plants to my meat, but this is probably better.",

"comment": "&gt; So, what’s the problem?\n\nThat they were killed prematurely, before the end of their natural lifespans. Just as you or I wouldn't want to be slaughtered before we die from old age.\n\n&gt; Meat is what helped humans evolve to where we are.\n\nEven *assuming* that is true, without any nuance or variables (given that studies exist that say *cooked food* is what evolved humans, not necessarily meat in particular), that still doesn't matter since humans have no more predatory obstacles that they need to physically evolve past.\n\n&gt; Something has to die for something else to live, whether it’s a plant, animal or fungus. Sure, with some plants the whole plant doesn’t have to die, but plenty do just for something else to eat and live. \n\nPlants aren't sentient unlike animals, so those lives matter less. Also, more plants are consumed through feeding livestock than feeding humans directly, anyways.\n\n&gt; And you do realize that plant farming can have very negative impacts on the environment, right? Disrupting habitats for animals, if pesticides are used it’s pretty clear they are not good, run off of other chemicals used, seeds with kill genes (but that’s another story altogether), mono-crops that are designed to grow big but not necessarily valuable nutritionally.\n\nAgain, more plant farming if involved with the meat industry than with produce.

"comment": "Her full comment about TJ green goddess dressing: \"I live in a border state and was raised in part by Mexican migrant workers. What people like you don’t understand is that there is exploitation of people in every single farming/food production scenario across the globe. Your claims of sustainability are very 2019 and are extremely dismissive of actual human lives that suffer because trendy veganism is driving up the demand for off season produce and the like. Have you ever grown your own food? Do you understand how hard it is? Or do you just read your articles? This is the difference. You read. I’ve buried people who died working doing migrant farm work. You have “science” I have families I know and love who are broken by Trader Joe’s need for extra green goddess salad dressing this year. Talk to me when your studies have save one of the lives I’m trying to make better and more equitable.\"\n\nYea this girl is RELENTLESS. In my OG post and comments, I've made it clear that I don't equate veganism with sustainability. Personally, aside from diet (which I source mostly locally/seasonally and avoid the usual suspects like oils, including palm oil, avocado, quinoa, almonds, several brands as they've been exposed to use exploited labor etc.), I only buy second hand clothes, can fit all my belongings in one suitcase, never purchase hygiene products/make-ups/gadgets that are likely produced by exploited labor, have grown food in backyards, have helped raise rescue chickens and bees, have helped set up multiple community compost etc, just to give a few examples. Not asking her for my \"good citizen\" badge, but being called a murderer instead is... quite something....",

The ordeal is further explained in the Talmud, in the seventh tractate of Nashim. A sotah (Hebrew: שוטה‎  / סוטה) is a woman suspected of adultery who undergoes the ordeal of bitter water or ordeal of jealousy as described and prescribed in the Priestly Code, in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible. The term sotah itself is not found in the Hebrew Bible but is Mishnaic Hebrew based on the verse \"if she has strayed\" (verb: שטה satah) in Numbers 5:12.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Add pumpkin seeds and flaxseed for extra protein (esp lysine) and other harder macros. That’s breakfast. \n\nIf you’re a heavy eater, tofu scramble with toast on the side is also easy and nice. The black salt brings out the flavour. Firm tofu if you can. \n\nAside from that, meal prep. Cook a big batch of lentil soup or curry or bean or tofu dishes and then put in Tupperware into the freezer. You *could* microwave to be warmer but suggest heating in a pan for better taste. That’s lunch sorted. \n\nThat way you’re cooking once a week for every lunch that week. And can mix it up every week. \n\nNow it’s just dinner.",

Before I gave in, all I’d eaten for months was boiled veggies, pasta with nothing on it, sliced bread, oatmeal, dry cereal, and apples and oranges.

I was worried because I eat a ton of dates and they are super sticky.  Just snacking on dates all day.  But NO, my teeth have less plaque than before.  Just glowing reviews at the dentist.  I'm not sure teeth \"de-mineralising\" is a thing that actually happens.  I eat fresh dates, not dried though.  Make sure to eat lots of greens too.  I eat at least one big salad a day, and sometimes another head of lettuce with dates at lunch.  You might want to be careful with the dried fruit, and try and find fresh if you can.  I get my fresh dates at the Persian store in boxes, but you can also order online.  Good luck!",

"comment": "Rather than write a big, long message, you can view [my lengthy response to a similar question about a vegan club on a college campus](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/pb2pxf/vegan_club_in_college_need_ideas/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) from a few months ago.\n\nMy biggest suggestion is free stuff + rewards and prizes for all participants. Free vegan snacks in the break room! Tortilla chips and salsa and Oreos, anyone? Coupons to local vegan restaurants or for vegan products at the store (sniff around online to see if any companies have coupons available for download right now, or reach out to companies directly and ask).\n\nEncourage everyone to download the 21 Day Vegan Kickstart App, it has lots of tips and suggestions for recipes, dining out, etc. \n\nCreate a hashtag you can use in your company Slack channel (or Zoom chat, or email, or whatever) so people can post photos of what they eat? Maybe have a mini-contest of who posts the best-looking vegan meal? \n\nI think this is an awesome idea, best of luck!",

Especially if you add condiments.\n\nI do recall seeing a couple of Field Roast's products containing palm oil, which I personally try to avoid due to its impact on the environment.
