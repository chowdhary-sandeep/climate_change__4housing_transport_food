I ran the numbers with two different chemistries, one with 1/20th the specific power of the other, but 3x the specific energy, and when they have matched voltages (based on the safe useable range of each), the charging profile is roughly thus, with the discharge being comparable:\n\n* Charge both until the High Energy is at ~2-3% and the High Power is at ~50%\n* Then the High Energy takes the overwhelming majority of the power until you're around 50%HE/55%HP\n* Then they advance together, with the HP battery taking roughly 2/3 the input until the HP is at capacity, and the HE is at 75%\n* Then the HE tops off to the voltage limit\n\n...all that done by virtue of natural voltage balancing.\n\nAs such, all you have to do is balance the Ah of each chemistry so that they have a combined safe Amp-output that meets the limit of your system (controller and/or fuses).\n\nSay you want a battery pack that weighs about as much as Tesla's 85kWh pack.  You could easily achieve that at 190kW of instantaneous power, by having a 210kWh HE/15kWh HP pack in parallel internal to the battery.  Sure, it'll take about 5 hours to charge the thing fully, but that should get you about 10 hours of highway driving, and the battery chemistry itself does all the work.  Increase the mass of the pack by roughly 10%, and you're up to a 250kWh hybrid pack that will get you as far as most anyone would reasonably want to drive in a day.\n\nEven better, because of the different voltage curves, measuring the voltage of the parallel packs will get you a *much* more accurate State of Charge than with current, single chemistry packs.\n\nETA: And yeah, towards the end (the last 1/4) you'd be \"limping\" along with enough power to maintain 60mph, but not to accelerate quickly, but who's going to want to accelerate like the dickens after 9 hours of driving?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002970785814492653,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1597453171311372,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2670922275578711,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2765719440051374,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3204717218673371,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19102119440025053,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2445212512393482,"ev_1":-0.16580796949461865,"ev_2":-0.15087341177180255,"ev_3":-0.09999793084358316,"ev_4":-0.026284706759421777,"ev_5":-0.0077573505283605,"ev_6":-0.1449499031803418},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It is quite surprising that so few have done it given the incentives. The ZEV credits should cover the actual production cost losses and the tax credits to the purchaser should mostly cover the difference against an ICE vehicle.\n\nThe only thing is, clearly, every major automaker is getting government subsidies to make these vehicles. That should not be seen as a bad thing whether it be GM, Nissan, or Tesla that does it. And these incentives mostly phase out... the purchaser tax credits have a sunset system in place and the ZEV credit system inherently causes each credit to worth less as automakers make more ZEVs or equivalents. That's why Tesla can only capitalize about $2,500 per credit instead of the face value of $5,000 per credit.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000965864077443257,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2339415408438603,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1886817530053344,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2565701216900867,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1965397988577407,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.4261414182479333,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2147914037729303,"ev_1":-0.13002435575761678,"ev_2":-0.1678786365192241,"ev_3":-0.023560906320199138,"ev_4":-0.01608157889980551,"ev_5":-0.003209618170027776,"ev_6":-0.11709397495739239},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I dare you to do that after soldering.\n\nThey're using recycled batteries, which are like a box of chocolate - you never know what you're going to get.\n\nAnd apparently, they blame the pack being charged when cold on the failure, but I don't feel like slogging through 20 minutes of video for the details.\n\nI'm quite critical of people who build \"DIY Powerwalls\" out of recycled (junk) 18650s, and solder the terminals, for very good reasons.  It's battery abuse.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with reusing old 18650 packs, but be aware of what you're using, test them extensively, treat them gently, and then don't solder to the damned things.  Ideally, keep each pack worth of batteries together (I reuse old BionX ebike packs, but each pack is independent so batteries of a particular age are in series with other batteries of the same age and cycle count).\n\nI will strongly argue that any time you see someone soldering to an 18650 that doesn't have a strip spot welded in place, you are watching an idiot who doesn't know what they're doing with batteries and shouldn't be playing with lithium batteries, period.\n\nSo... you know, learn the lesson from someone else.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004717037547379732,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2872768870740009,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.32946515028898155,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.10610513854771852,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22520451346825326,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.01050418052667131,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0019335267328036327,"ev_1":-0.007392546673145262,"ev_2":-0.000536114196923639,"ev_3":-0.00046571637176384684,"ev_4":-0.00023937514682378,"ev_5":-0.0004745367089829718,"ev_6":-0.032652811307343654,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.2748693672556622},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against (the author is against the specific instance of building and charging DIY Lithium Batteries using recycled 18650 cells with soldered terminals)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

There are few of them. **People who bought one are choosing not to buy another for any number of reasons.**\n\n&gt;&gt;The problem of complete lack of resale value is another problem. Nobody wants to buy a used electric car or even a hybrid with a lot of miles on that battery. **When they realize that their used hybrid likely has a negative resale value** (is basically “e-waste” that will cost them money to dispose of) the notion of buying another fades quickly.\n\nI think something similar is likely to doom even Tesla; absent a *reasonably priced* replacement battery, at the end of the battery life (which with Lithium chemistry is a not entirely predictable \"cliff\") they become zero-value \"bricks\"; and of course that then \"backs up\" into a heavy DEVALUATION of the vehicles \"used\" value long before the unit reaches the end of the battery lifespan.  Tesla has been able to effectively \"hide\" this by simply eating the costs of many premature battery replacements on the roadsters, and low volume luxury vehicles -- but that tactic *doesn't scale* -- once they begin shipping a mass-market product (especially at any significantly lower price point), the problem will, and in fairly short order, become a MAJOR detrimental issue. It's like a \"ticking time bomb\" for which there is (AFAIK) no practical/economic solution. (Tesla simply claims that replacement batteries WILL become \"super cheap\" -- but that's really just \"begging the question\" -- as to date, they haven't been able to really achieve any such order of magnitude reduction in costs.)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00045110189967090264,"1.1.1_stance":-0.131992869079113,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21407461081430235,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20060447885535124,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26258461149315665,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.08941210573539138,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3430512161382164,"ev_1":-0.12017329056197419,"ev_2":-0.2156517151398523,"ev_3":-0.2625381421444129,"ev_4":-0.11616085931988589,"ev_5":-0.05185317960907317,"ev_6":-0.16083648215847335,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.10394796868786216},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I live in a smaller city, so we're talking about no more than 40 km / 25 mi round trip for most drivers per day. Most of the time, the chargers are tied up with PHEVs. Usually it's the same vehicles there every morning.\n\nFrom the perspective of the PHEV owners, I can see why they're charging there every day. Keeping the car on battery means not burning gas and the small battery means frequent charging is necessary to do so. Who knows if they even have a spot to charge at home.\n\nFrom the perspective of a BEV owner, it can seem a bit unfair as I only need to plug in once a week, but it's hard to do so because the PHEVs are monopolizing the chargers.\n\nI suspect the same happens elsewhere as well. PHEVs need to charge more often, so they're using chargers more frequently.

So all the fast chargers are fighting for a small percentage of the actual market (long distances). That results in them competing for price against each other, which keeps prices non profitable.\n\nJust look at Fastned. The Netherlands are one of the biggest EV markets in the world. Fastned has 109 stations with 120.000 charging sessions in three months. That's 12 per day per station. Which means that basically there are two EVs charging per charger per day. And an average of 16 kWh per session. Let's say the average consumption is 17.5 kWh per 100 km. Then that's a total of around 11 million km in three months that have been charged at Fastned chargers. There are around 200.000 EVs in the Netherlands. At an average driven distance of 14.000 km a year those would've driven around 700 million km in those three months. So where did they charge? Obviously at home. Now if the biggest fast charging service in the Netherlands managed to fulfill 11 million of those 700 million km (or around 1.5 %) - how are they ever supposed to make money? They can only increase adoption by lowering prices. Which reduces their margins.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007176027429522946,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13449350475000302,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2832076609763003,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17868501444972013,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10851432328493882,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15422305912831855,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06831512416586823,"ev_1":-0.013235893306652239,"ev_2":-0.18038082059016838,"ev_3":-0.17135543069864023,"ev_4":-0.017188762964603182,"ev_5":-0.0008772888104431331,"ev_6":-0.005037528802252685},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It doesn't matter how we do it.  That is the #1 issue.  EVs goal is to replace new ICEVs from getting on the roads so that there are fewer overall ICEVs on the roads.\n\nIf EV growth is drastically slowing, it means more ICEVs will remain on the roads.\n\nThis is exactly why I do not support the idea of using BEVs as the primary solution to replace ICEVs.  They're too slow.  Either there's raw material issues.  Battery cell production issues.  Price issues.  Demand issues because \"charging takes too long, I live in an apartment, I park in the street... etc... etc..\"\n\nIf we're going to continue using cars, then HEVs and PHEVs replacing 100% of ICEVs, which we absolutely could do today, should have been prioritized.\n\nWe should be rushing towards ways for people to drive less and buy fewer new cars.  Mining / refining / smelting the materials to manufacture cars and the vast amount of energy cars use to operate regardless of their powertrain, is not sustainable and is terrible for the environment.\n\nEVs (PHEVs + BEVs) produced today may only be marginally better for the environment over the lifetime of the vehicle in many regions across the world, including in places in the US and Europe.  Some regions that utilize high percentages of renewable energy see significantly better emissions reductions.  However, EVs still are nowhere near as good as solutions like bikes and public transit; especially electrified public transit.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00352680046732227,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2160733362286224,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21130507208824265,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33666445543108864,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23223367601188252,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06020691401014725,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19567195469002505,"ev_1":-0.21502298222027424,"ev_2":-0.07260146679254831,"ev_3":-0.03585044011197169,"ev_4":-0.04611468270134841,"ev_5":-0.010805347691833353,"ev_6":-0.028103810726558247,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.121680606326845},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author expresses opposition to EVs being the primary solution to replace ICEVs and mentions several issues with EVs, such as raw material issues, battery cell production issues, price issues, and demand issues.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I've been through the solar product development mill twice and it's an expensive, time consuming process that is MUCH harder than people think. Solar, unlike say, a smartphone, needs to last 20 years in harsh outdoor conditions, and so the standards and criteria for a successful product are much higher. There is zero fat, costs need to be ultra-low, and so actually designing anything is really, really hard. Between product design, manufacturing process design, QA design, degradation testing and certification, you're looking at an absolute minimum of 4-5 years, assuming you have something like $30-60 million in funding (which no one does right now, there are zero perovskite start ups funded at that level). Then, manufacturing ramp up is at least another year, followed by early market testing which can take another year or two. If nothing goes wrong, there are no setbacks, and the first design turns out to be the one that works in mass production (something that NEVER happens), you're looking at 6-7 years as an absolute minimum, and that's if a perovskite start up announced something like $5-10 million in seed funding today (they can raise the rest later). Once you get through all of that, it's still not cheap until you get to high volume, and you can't get to high volume until banks will loan money to developers who want to develop projects based on your technology. But the banks position is almost always, \"No technology risk, call us once it's a proven technology.\"  So you have the catch 22 where you can't manufacture in high volume until you can get financing for projects, and can't get financing for projects until it's been proven at large volumes for a long time. Threading the bankability needle is really hard, takes business and finance creativity and is where many really good technologies die. Smart engineers and scientists with great leaps forward in technology often fail to appreciate the business risks inherent in bankability, and run out of cash while trying to solve the problem. I've seen more than one good company fail this way. \n\nShort version, perovskite solar panels are, at an absolute minimum, 7 years away, if they end up being a viable technology at all, which won't really be certain until someone actually bites the bullet and spends the first product design money. \n\nAnd I can tell you from very direct experience, investors are very ambivalent about solar technology right now. Researchers might be making the breakthroughs, but turning bench scale concepts into products is a long, hard, risky endeavor and one that investors are not thrilled about right now. \n\nSo seven to ten years, and even if it's an amazing technology, maybe 20 years and maybe never. Not every breakthrough and legitimate advancement in the state of the art makes it to market, and solar is tougher than most industries.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00021769790328107774,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2578983095786782,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17676925717358788,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09855592122036931,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.25324823641725136,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23547698718927634,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2146295746594357,"solar_1":-0.18782792450656416,"solar_2":-0.022976313764957013,"solar_3":-0.2607348932380696,"solar_4":-0.1375581595854363,"solar_5":-0.07845425109739847,"solar_6":-0.06895979411405298,"solar_7":-0.016821067462539457,"solar_8":-0.17496629545955025,"solar_9":-0.15640851628782737,"solar_10":-0.17212580201064234},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Or at least, the SMA TLs are newer than Enphase microinverters. Also, SMA has the only \"secure power supply\", a dedicated solar power source than you can use when the grid goes down (and the sun is out). Very new, very unique product feature to SMA. I take issue with calling string inverters old school and microinverters new school. String inverters used to weigh upward of 175 lbs, have single MPPT, and much less efficency. Technology has advanced. \n\nAs for Solar Edge, they are probably the most cutting edge company out their. With the announcement of their latest inverter, they have reduced weight and increased efficiency to unheard of amounts. They also have free panel level monitoring, lower failure rates than Enphase, and once again, unheard of levels of efficiency. \n\nEnphase does have a track record. They have been around for almost a decade. They are the biggest name in microinverters. They had for a while the largest residential marketshare, but recently have been overtaken by SolarEdge. And while maybe not easy to find online, they had a significantly high failure rate for some of their older models, which have been fixed in the m215+ newer versions. Their inverter technology hasn't changed significantly. Most of their product changes and introductions have to do with components (monitoring, cabling, combiner box, 'ac' battery), and incrementally increased power output. \n\nIf you want the best, go with Sunpower (which you correctly identified as the best) paired with Solar Edge (and buy the extended warranty, it's really cheap). Of course, this is if money isn't an issue, as you didn't mention cost in your breakdown. Solar Edge should be cheaper than Enphase anyway, but more than SMA.

Why snow and frost stays on north slopes long, and why it is the last place to put solar.\n\nAs for your VA and my WV examples they both have long paybacks with just the south.  Mine ( a cheap self install ) has an 18 year ROI.   Any north facing modules would have an ROI beyond the 25 year warranty.   VA would be about the same for most commercial installs.\n\nYou are missing considerable points here.   I have already shown how I can use the south only with higher end modules for similar ( slightly more) production, and lower cost, than a north south arrangement.  \n\nAs for your comments that larger systems using north is doesn't cost more?  Or that the south has the bulk of the cost and north is cheaper?  That's is silly apologist math.   Why are you trying to shuffle the funding to make the north seem cheaper?  Solar is bid $/w so more watts ( even less efficient watts) adds cost.  \n\nYou clearly are unique in your thinking among solar designers.

Director Jeff Gibbs takes on electric cars, solar panels, windmills, biomass, biofuel, leading environmentalist groups like the Sierra Club, and even figures from Al Gore and Van Jones, who served as Barack Obama's special adviser for green jobs, to 350.org leader Bill McKibben, a leading environmentalist and advocate for grassroots climate change movements.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00820960042377313,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23354311323686852,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20321300336098033,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19778657184567766,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19119359421700297,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2430623977755507,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013687098243584236,"solar_1":-0.17328041471871888,"solar_2":-0.215420290888844,"solar_3":-0.11122840863108,"solar_4":-0.06689288914483338,"solar_5":-0.06474790861165758,"solar_6":-0.21979970134755908,"solar_7":-0.060303090901773736,"solar_8":-0.17240498264921675,"solar_9":-0.054920618233438745,"solar_10":-0.17096101207950115,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.07082317341628368},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against (the author is expressing skepticism towards alternative energy, including solar)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

As the EVSPs' wholesale cost of electricity come down in price it doesn't mean the savings will necessarily flow through to the EV driver. Yes, as more stations come about, it might increase opportunity for competition applying downward pressure on pricing, but that is no guarantee. Look at current gas stations on opposite corners: they might fight each other by a few pennies but they may also trade price advantages day by day--not necessarily in conspiracy together. Also, look at how [gas prices do not always closely align to fluctuations in the price per barrel.](https://www.macrotrends.net/2501/crude-oil-vs-gasoline-prices-chart) Midstream is where the money is at in fossil fuels right now, exactly where EVSP's lie. We may as well anticipate similarities in the EVSE market for retail price vs. wholesale electricity. Long term PPAs with renewables plus storage may provide stable pricing but, again, the stabilized pricing that is good for the EVSP or utility won't necessarily result in cost savings to the driver.\n\nThis could all be further compounded for those who do not have access to overnight Level 2 charging relying on DCFC, particularly in regions with demand charges. Could be worse for rideshare drivers, and it will be interesting where pricing lands over the coming 5-10 years for MHD vehicles relying on 100-350 kW charging.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007242615101858974,"1.1.1_stance":-0.056779411690820326,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26279294306384016,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3654341697692871,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3163203210338755,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.304163680556276,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15672506128127375,"solar_1":-0.22469492372218355,"solar_2":-0.13975317228929876,"solar_3":-0.11269283236310912,"solar_4":-0.05769595886294061,"solar_5":-0.08130055420527545,"solar_6":-0.00450823341452633,"solar_7":-0.0026139786593072736,"solar_8":-0.038285133260311945,"solar_9":-0.02232113413248271,"solar_10":-0.18763170490231407},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The lease agreement also likely comes with some sort of roof penetration warranty that you may lose in the case of an outright purchase.

That can cause a problem when the grid is not available to handle the two functions above. \n\nThe role of the battery is to replace the grid in scenario (a) and to help out a bit in scenario (b).  To deal with scenario (b) there is also the ability for the inverters to \"curtail\" their production and that is usually signaled by increasing the frequency to more than 60hz.  The curtailment doesn't have to be binary where solar is producing or not producing but it's possible to reduce the production to come closer to the household load.  \n\nThere is a common misunderstanding that the Tesla Powerwall system (with the Tesla Gateway) is binary and cuts off all production.

The point is it is not a simple relationship so that conclusion that \"humans cause climate change\" is clearly too strong an assertion and that is the crux of the argument when it comes to policy.  The conclusion that \"reducing carbon will reduce global mean temperatures\" is predicated on this.  \n\n\n>Skeptics might claim that urbanization and the heat generated by cities are responsible for the observed warming,\n\nSome skeptics point at this effect as part of the explanation and possible policies to mitigate this that have been overlooked: paining roofs white, increased greenery in cities, more water installations in city planning  are some ideas that have been dismissed in favor of mandates of EVs, wind farms, and solar panels because of this very reason.  Urbanization has an effect.  Global warming does not have to have a single cause.  \n\n\n>Some skeptics argue that the historical temperature data is incomplete or unreliable, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about human-caused climate change.\n\nThis issue goes to the relation between carbon and temperature.  CO2 is a proxy for temperature together with tree rings, snow fall, and others.  But if CO2 is not the sole driver of climate change, then there are other factors.  The proper path of science is to examine other factors.  There is no forgone scientific conclusion about proxies except to globalist elites who want expensive policy changes.\n\n>Certain individuals may suggest that natural sources of carbon dioxide, such as volcanic activity, release far more greenhouse gases than human activities.\n\nActually, no scientists are suggesting that.  This is a strawman argument.  What has been suggested is that the tiny amount of emissions driven by human activity is small in comparison to the natural production of CO2 and that there are a number of factors being left out of the policy decisions.  Volcanoes are just one of those factors.\n\n>Skeptics often highlight the uncertainties associated with climate models to cast doubt on the accuracy of their predictions.\n\nAs anyone should!  That is how science works.  Do you simply trust every 10 day weather forecast without any skepticism?  Municipalities don't allocate resources for unlikely events and there is no good reason to do so, but alarmist policy makers want to allocate resources based on even less evidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have only begged and re-begged the question at the heart of the legitimate scientific debate on climate.  Once you conclude that CO2 is the \\*only\\* factor in the 1.1 degree global warming observed in the last 100 years, then you free yourself to make conclusions about unrelated observations.  You are disingenuous and clearly politically motivated.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005646000887888173,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06356786416434942,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12450242417168336,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21152001551189203,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20867712272842082,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2765562683324378,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13551197745696836,"solar_1":-0.07043030348722823,"solar_2":-0.2727134376958323,"solar_3":-0.22644918095708513,"solar_4":-0.023235567450077117,"solar_5":-0.03824201241756479,"solar_6":-0.00383099303386795,"solar_7":-0.005960899378502897,"solar_8":-0.005675116274990917,"solar_9":-0.08054141662432812,"solar_10":-0.22970964815855646},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

If there’s high demand for a harmful product there’s only a few ways to reduce the production/extraction of it. \n\n1) reduce the demand for it via public awareness, but this isn’t going to convince everyone (try and name a single example of when this was effective, maybe whaling?). \n\nIn democracies Popular support -> voting -> legislation & policy & meaningful action \n\n2) include options for better, more sustainable alternatives, so consumers can pick them (plant based meats), however this won’t be totally effective unless…\n\n3) these alternatives are cheaper and more economical. If these 3 are met, rapid action will be taken to solve the underlying issue (think of CFCs, the Montreal protocol and the Ozone Hole). \n\nSo what action can an individual take?\n\nIn relation to n1) spread awareness of the issue, convince friends to not buy, for example a low mpg new truck to reduce demand and consumerism, do so yourself, advocate for legislation, contact local and regional politicians, and most importantly, VOTE\n\nRegarding n2, Vote with your dollar. Spend more on pricier alternative meat, solar panels or a battery pack. Buy an EV (secondhand is best). Invest in companies working on these goals. You’re a relatively early adopter so you’re subsidising and speeding up the development of these new products. Donate to EFFECTIVE charities. Your effects will be marginal but if enough people put money into research and new products it could make a difference. \n\n3) there’s nothing you can do to make viable economically cheaper substitutes unless you’re working directly on research. Investing in companies developing new tech is the only way. Vote for policies that will reduce subsidies for environmentally unfriendly practices, eliminating economic distortion and poor incentives.

Similarly, if a lot of animals are killed in the harvest of grain, then personal consumption of grain would again be contributing to the systemic suffering of animals.

Someone keeping other animals captive so they can drink their milk or eat their eggs? Yes, that's exploitation. Breeding horses and other pets for our amusement? Yes, that's exploitation -- though we do have a duty as a society to take care of the domesticated animals already here for their sake (though we should avoid buying them as that encourages people to breed more).

I didn't learn anything new from what I posted to you. You're saying that eggs are top tier foods, worthy of looking past the moral implications of them. I disagree since (health-wise) they are mediocre at best, harmful at worst. The emphasis in my previous post was on the words \"so\" healthy and \"exceedingly\" healthy or whichever precursor it was that you used. Because eggs are not those things. \n\nThese are definitely not assumptions, I wasn't just talking about cholesterol. I was talking about every part of that paragraph in your essay. (It reads like a Paleo blog.) You're not actually listening because I would just have to repeat myself to answer your questions. Instead you're picking and choosing from what I've said. Maybe I'm not making myself clear. If you learn more about Human A&amp;P, you'll find that since we have no need to consume cholesterol, that there is no such thing as *good* cholesterol consumption. Just cholesterol consumption. Maybe you assumed that because there is no *good* cholesterol consumption, that I was implying that all cholesterol consumption is *bad*. That wasn't what I was implying.\n\n\nEggs, pasture-raised, large, hard boiled\n1.00 each\n(50.00 grams) Calories: 78\nGI: low\n\nNutrient DRI/DV\n\n choline 35%\n\n selenium 28%\n\n biotin 27%\n\n vitamin B1 223%\n\n vitamin B2 20%\n\n molybdenum 19%\n\n iodine 18%\n\n pantothenic acid 14%\n\n protein 13%\n\n phosphorus 12%\n\n vitamin D 11%\n\n vitamin A 8%\n\nOkay, let's dig deeper into what nutrients eggs contain and how to easily get those vital nutrients in a vegan diet.\n\n[Vegan foods with choline.](http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/choline)\n\n\nOmega 3's are in eggs purely through supplementing a chicken's feed with foods containing [ALA](http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/alasources) or an actual DHA &amp; EPA supplement. You can do that all by yourself and remove the middle man. You can also take an algae based DHA and EPA supplement.\n\n\nProtein is not an issue for anyone consuming enough calories. A complete protein is just a complete amino acid profile. All foods contain different amino acid profile ratios. Any grain plus any legume is a complete protein. Peanut butter and bread, beans and rice, spaghetti or corn with peas. Not to mention the vegan foods that are a complete [protein](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/natural-health/vegan-sources-of-protein/) by themselves.\n\n\nVitamin D comes from the sun, some mushrooms, and vitamin D fortified products.\n\n\nHere's a [list](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/natural-health/b-vitamins-how-to-get-them-in-a-vegan-diet/) of the various vegan sources of various B vitamins.\n\n\nThis [list](http://gentleworld.org/vegan-sources-of-vitamins-minerals/) covers the vegan sources of the remaining nutrients found in eggs.\n\n\nThe issue is that you're assuming that a vegan diet must be deficient in some way. It isn't. You also assume that all vegan cheeses are gross. That's ridiculous. How many have to tried? One? Cashew cheese is amazing, inexpensive to make, and is made of whole, natural foods.

I didn't want people to mistake it as my own argument and tell me I was wrong.\n\nPersonally, I think that's a good reply to OP.\n\n&gt; If you just do animal expermiments for the sake of knowledge, you don't know if you're going to discover something meaningful or not.\n\nNo, but we do know that many meaningful future discoveries rely on basic research and fundamental knowledge of biology.\n\n&gt;You might discover something that saves or improves lives, but the probability is a lot smaller\n\nI disagree. I think it's a virtual certainty. Basic research is the foundation of all applied research. We wouldn't be able to synthesize or test the safety of heme if we hadn't studied a hundreds of other things first. \n\n&gt;Millions of rats have surely died in [Alzheimer's drug] research, but for what? We know a bit more about the disease, but for the patients very little has changed.\n\nBut you're ignoring that many of those millions didn't die for the drug research-- they died for a better understanding of the disease. And unless you're pretty sure we'll simply never cure the disease, then that research will be the foundation of any cure we fine.\n\n&gt;I think if you condone animal experiments, the likelyhood of an impactful discovery that saves lives, has to be considered. \n\nFor the record, this is my position as well. I certainly can't say I give blanket support to research. My time observing the IACUC at my institution (the committee that needs to approve studies and methodologies) destroyed any faith I had that studies are adhering reliably to the 3 \"Rs\" principle, or that studies are not being duplicated, or that fairly meaningless studies are not conducted simply so someone can publish already known information in a different journal and get their PhD.\n\nI agree, the bottom line needs to be a case-by-case basis.\n\nI feel like the concept of automatically, unquestioningly accepting that the Impossible Burger was a good use of animal research needs to be examined. First, do we need fake meat? That presupposes that the moral change won't ever take hold. If I were to tell you that the animal rights revolution will take hold of the public imagination in the year 2027 and that legislation would be based by 2030 to outlaw all consumption or commercial production of animals, then I'm sure we'd all agree that the use of the rats in this research is unnecessary. Of course that's unrealistic, I'm not arguing this will happen, but I'm giving one edge case that defines a boundary of acceptance for the research.\n\nAnd then there's the other aspect to it-- is the Impossible Burger actually going to convince people to go vegan? What if this is just another dud product, or more realistically (in fact, in my opinion, certainly) just another small step the converts another half a percent or so of the US population to slightly reduce their meat consumption sometimes. Are we therefore okay with animal research for every small step for the next 200 years?\n\nI don't think Impossible Burgers are necessary or sufficient to lead to a vegan revolution, and that's the context where the attitudes here strike me as odd. I'm not saying everyone should be against it, but it's weird that we're angry at the people who bring up the studies as a criticism. I feel like vegans should at most feel qualified support, rather than such blind optimism and negativity towards people bringing up what really is a basic vegan principle. This was animal research for the sole purpose of making a tasty product that may or may not have any long term impact on animal lives; and yet that is unquestioningly good, while even alzheimer's drug research is bad?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004672313866649347,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29331742649561826,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.29805407535503176,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3139901450639656,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21775805157572847,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2622332562860314,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.42242172360420227,"diet_1":-0.07510772596211268,"diet_2":-0.22565388846330184,"diet_3":-0.11643466860300533,"diet_4":-0.1136947906294002,"diet_5":-0.03597802177924336,"diet_6":-0.042752473634512476,"diet_8":-0.05587670798795822,"diet_9":-0.05953455081908032,"diet_10":-0.18176065872345504,"diet_11":-0.30687418451998383,"diet_13":-0.12065762894538541,"diet_14":-0.10022679402312165,"diet_17":-0.09019913967737618},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I hope you will watch some real footage to see how mistreated animals truly are. Look into vegans Joey Carbstrong and Earthling Ed. They have a lot of info on YouTube.
