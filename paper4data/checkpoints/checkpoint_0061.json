"comment": "Article:\n\n&gt; HILVERSUM - \n&gt; Spyker Cars werkt in het diepste geheim aan een elektrische sportwagen. Dat onthult RTL Autovisie vanavond in de eerste aflevering, die om 22.00 uur op RTL7 wordt uitgezonden.\n&gt; \n&gt; Details van de elektrische auto houdt Spyker-ceo Victor Muller nog even voor zichzelf. \"We komen binnenkort met de eerste informatie\", aldus de autobouwer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of de sportwagenbouwer kiest voor een volledig elektrische aandrijflijn of een plug-in-systeem, wil Muller nog niet bekend maken. Aan het model wordt inmiddels hard gewerkt, weet RTL Autovisie te melden.\n\nRough Translation (my Dutch is a little rusty):\n\n&gt;Spyker is secretly working on an electric vehicle.  That's what RTL Autovisie announced in tonight's first episode, broadcast at 10:00pm on RTL7.\n&gt;\n&gt;Victor Muller is keeping details about the electric vehicle to himself.  \"We'll release the first details soon\", according to the auto manufacturer.\n&gt;\n&gt;Whether the auto manufacturer selects a pure plug-in based electric drivetrain is something Muller won't share.  In the mean time, RTL Autovisie reports they are working very hard on this model.\n\nBasically, there is no real news, considering most manufacturers (especially performance/supercar companies) are working on a plug-in hybrid sports car, if they haven't released one already.",

"comment": "Part 2:\n\n&gt;I think you also continue to ignore the negative externalities associated with battery production.\n\nI haven't done that at all. I've offered all along that EV production (including the battery) has a cost, but that it's easily overcome by the cost savings during the consumption phase. [Here's a well-respected LCA](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media_IOE/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf) that I don't fully agree with, but that does a decent enough job of demonstrating that.\n\nYou on the other hand *have* completely ignored that there are also negative externalities associated with conventional vehicle production. It's quite disingenuous to keep bringing up the cost of battery production without talking about the costs of those things that the battery replaces. Is producing an engine free, or a transmission? What about the steady stream of motor oil that must be wasted during an ICE vehicle's life, but not an EV's? Similar for belts and spark plugs and various fluids and so on. Even brake pads will last much longer for an EV thanks to regenerative braking. And let's not forget catalytic converters and the platinum they require! You think mining *lithium* is bad? I've yet to see a thorough analysis that accounts for all these costs.\n\n&gt;How much does a battery for an EV weigh, and how much of that is lithium?\n\nThe Nissan Leaf battery, for example, weighs 660 lbs, [9 of which are lithium](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/availability_of_lithium). The more important resources for producing lithium batteries are other metals like cobalt and nickel, but there are many different kinds of batteries that can be used if one type runs into resource constraints.\n\n&gt;I encourage you to read the following article and comment if you like:\n\nI read it. The first half is about how electricity production is dirty in China, which isn't relevant to anything we're discussing here. The second half is about how e-waste is bad, including lithium battery waste. Well sure, that's obvious. At some point expired EV batteries will need to be recycled, and they will be. The article is not a comparative analysis, so I'm not sure what conclusion you're drawing from it.\n\n&gt;Where do you suppose the majority of electricity is coming from today?\n\n70% fossil fuels of course, and of that about 40% coal and 30% NG. But as coal and NG are consumed, we'll simply replace them with nuclear and renewables - that's the beauty of electricity; it's the \"common currency\" of energy.\n\n&gt;The paper cited in the article to which I just linked disagrees.\n\nNo, as I said it's not a comparative analysis, so it makes no such conclusion. The author opines that \"the electric car is no more sustainable than the gasoline or diesel car *in my view*\" but then fails to back that up with any rigor except to say that \"e-waste is bad.\"\n\n&gt;I feel the effects of future global warming attributable to man will simply not be catastrophic. That's why I am in this subreddit.\n\nI understand that, and I hope you're right - although [the people of Kiribati](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-21/kiribati-climate-change-destroys-pacific-island-nation), at least, will disagree with you. That's why I've sought to point out that there are plenty of good reasons to support EVs that have nothing at all to do with global warming.\n\nFor that reason I don't understand the place of some junk article claiming that EVs have a low resale value in this sub. Not to apply a political label to you, but I see it as EVs getting caught in the middle of a mindless conservative vs. liberal hatefest, when in fact many of the reasons I've outlined for supporting EVs should really gain traction from the conservative side.\n\n&gt;Of course one would need to consider the NPV of the solar collectors and EV price premium to see if it is worth while\n\nThat's easily done. In my case the 30-year amortized cost of my rooftop solar and remaining electricity bill with 2 EVs together come out to about $50/month, which replaces what was about a $90 electric bill and $200/month in gas (I drove a hybrid and my wife a small minivan previously.) As far as the EV price premium, that's a little more tricky, but comparing lease payments for a proposed EV vs. an ICE car that you might buy instead works pretty well.\n\n&gt;That latter sentence could spawn a whole new thread in itself\n\nYes, and I think it's quite off-topic. Of course everyone driving around in his own car isn't the greatest idea, but as long as that's the world we're stuck with we can at least try to make those cars better. There's no reason that we can't seek to work on the long term goals of fixing public transportation and re-planning communities at the same time.\n\n&gt;the ethanol mandate comes to mind as a good counterexample. Of course you might have meant scrutiny after the fact.\n\nYes, it's unfortunately true that most scrutiny does come after the fact. With that in mind the ethanol mandate is actually a good example of scrutiny effecting change, as it [looks to be going away soon.](http://thehill.com/blogs/regwatch/energy-environment/192978-bipartisan-push-imperils-ethanol-mandate)\n\n&gt;there is non-trivial power loss in both transmission and distribution as well\n\nIt's [about 7%](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3), so yeah it's something, but it's not as much and most EV critics make it out to be, and not nearly enough to change the conclusion that EVs are more efficient overall.\n\n&gt;There are many areas of demand for light batteries that predate a serious efforts for EVs. Development has been slow.\n\nOnly Tesla uses these commodity cells for their EVs, and they're dramatically changing that market all by themselves. Also their cell costs make up only a small portion of their  battery's ultimate price tag - much of the value in their pack comes from how thousands of those cells are assembled and monitored, which is no small task by any stretch. More on this later.\n\n&gt;For $250k, I will build you a fuel cell car with similar range.\n\nHuh? Why do you bring up the joke that is the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle?\n\nMost of your remaining points are the same as this one:\n\n&gt;That isn't what we are observing. The cost of a battery pack for a car is more than half as much as the sticker price for a new gasoline vehicle. There is little evidence of a decrease in that price.\n\nAny talk of battery cost is wholly speculative at this point, as EVs are still new enough that hardly any batteries have been replaced, and actual information about manufacturers' costs is proprietary. [Here's a good piece of speculation](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084682_what-goes-into-a-tesla-model-s-battery--and-what-it-may-cost) you should read, however, that speaks quite to the contrary of whatever it is that you're observing.\n\nThanks for the discussion, by the way!",

"comment": "All good points, but there are a few considerations you're missing that make the comparison not quite as straightforward as you make it seem:\n\nCarrying a larger battery pack provides more than just the ability to cover the occasional long trip. It means you can limit your average depth of discharge, which could dramatically improve battery life. Example: If you have to drive 60 miles a day, you'd need to charge your Nissan Leaf to 100%, and you'd actually use about 80% of its capacity on a daily basis. That will wear your battery fairly quickly (believe me, I've got a 2.5 year old Leaf with less than 80% battery capacity with that very driving scenario.) The Volt will use 100% of its usable capacity every day (and some gas) in the same scenario (which is the reason its battery is over-engineered to the point of only making about 65% of its capacity usable - adding to its cost.) The Model S, OTOH, can do the daily 60 miles with only 23% depth of discharge - its battery hardly even notices the trip, so to speak.\n\nA related concern is charging speed - charging at 7kw (the power offered by the typical 30 amp home charging station) is about 1/3 C in the Leaf, but only 1/12 C in the Model S. So you can achieve the same miles replenished per hour during charging with much less stress on your battery, which can also improve the battery's longevity.\n\nAlso, even if we toss out the above considerations and assume the two batteries wear at the same rate, a larger battery will last much longer because, well, it's larger. Take the same example of a 60 mile commute: If the Leaf battery degrades as I've seen, that means in around 2 years time you need to either replace the battery or the entire car (also the scenario I'm living - I traded up to a Rav4-EV when my commute in the Leaf started to become too close for comfort.) A 265 mile range Model S, OTOH, will still be able to make the 60 mile commute when its battery has degraded to 23% of its new capacity. So if both degrade at 10%/year, then you only get 2 years out of the Leaf but almost 8 years out of the Model S. You break even if you pay 4x as much for a battery that will last 4x as long, and you get all the other good stuff that goes with a large battery to boot!\n\nAnd aside from the positives a large battery affords, there are negatives associated with integrating an ICE into your EV: Carrying an ICE at all times when only needed for 10% of driving imposes a maintenance and efficiency burden on EV driving, and also adds a lot of complexity to the car, which adds to cost, perhaps even more so than a larger battery would. Case in point: The Volt costs more than the Leaf, despite having 1/2 the usable battery capacity. And as far as the Tesla's pack cost, I've seen estimates that Tesla's costs at the cell level are much lower than you'd imagine, perhaps as low as $100/kwh. Much of the value in their batteries comes from their own value-added processes, including thermal protection and monitoring of the cells, and that stuff doesn't really scale with capacity. The cost difference to Tesla between their 60kwh and 85kwh packs is probably very small, at about $2500, but the cost they'd incur if they were to stick with the smaller pack and engineer in an ICE range extender and all the baggage it brings along would be much higher.\n\nTL;DR The idea of reducing cost by coupling a small battery with an ICE range extender sounds good in theory, but in practice it's not that simple. So far I think the bigger battery approach is looking more favorable, but only time will tell which approach wins out, with the i3 vs Model E a good matchup to watch.",

Though I feel the scientific community is trying not to say this bluntly, as it essentially removes any hope.\n\nI get the not wanting to remove any hope but at the same time it begins to sound properly dishonest. It's close to the \"you're telling me there's chance\" meme. It might be perpetuating deluded thinking. Eventually scientists saying things they don't believe gets to be corrosive.\n\n&gt; I think you seem to think that a technological solution is a magic bullet (maybe like nuclear fusion) - it isn't.\n\nI guess I maybe thought fusion could suck the co2 out of the atmosphere.\n\n&gt; We could theoretically now keep our lifestyles while rapidly transferring to low carbon economies, for example renewables are more than capable of meeting the worlds energy needs, electric vehicles have produce zero point source emissions, we have got to a point housing where buildings can be essentially zero carbon.\n\nIn theory I like this, starting over 20 years ago, and if the tech had delivered more and it was being rolled out on a big scale everywhere. It didn't deliver and isn't being rolled out on the right scale. Since it isn't I expect emissions to carry on rising. Is that not very realistic?\n\nI prefer the tech solutions because it's easier than the political solutions. The political solutions in my opinion are just weird pipe dreams. It just doesn't seem like the world I know.\n\nDemocratic politics is short term but most of the world's politics is paranoid and deeply involved with corruption and just trying to keep the masses happy and not rebelling. Saving other people in the future seems a million miles from people trying to avoid conflicts, terrorism and genocide on the month to month basis.",

"comment": "&gt; but also that the batteries are taking in on something like 3.3-3.5C.\n\nI think it may be more likely that the battery could be lowballed in usable capacity from a much larger battery. \n\nAs a Porsche sports sedan, assuming a Wh/km of 120-180 (Model S is roughy 200) I personally think the evidence is in support of the car having anywhere between 60 and 90 kWh. Let;s say it's 150 Wh/km *actual* efficiency and therefore 75kWh *max usable* capacity. Being pessimistic, we could go for 70kWh but any less usable simply can't generate 500km from \"sensible\" speeds e.g. 50-55mph. \n\nThe previous range record for the Model S prior to Bjorn's attempt had an average of 125 Wh/km (200 Wh/mile) for 420 ish miles. Bjorn's record was in the region of 110 Wh/km for 450 miles. 60-70 kWh usable means 120-140 Wh/km for exactly 500 km, so 70 kWh is on the edge of realistic here.\n\nThe circa 75 kWh figure makes sense given that the battery is of an uncannily similar size to the S, which has a usable between 75-81 kWh, although it does look slightly thicker as far as I can see. That makes sense if it has a bigger cooling infrastructure than the Model S, which is mentioned on their site about it.\n\nSo I am guessing that if they wanted to preserve, say, 2C but make it look like a 3C rate, the battery could well be a 90kWh but with only circa 75kWh (83%) usable max capacity which gives circa 60 kWh (80%) for the charging quote. \n\nAverage power rate for a lithium ion from 9-10 kWh (10% absolute protection) to 60kWh (80% usable) in 15 minutes would be 50 kWh in 15 minutes,so would give a rate of 60/15 x 50 = 200 kW rough average, so maybe a slightly larger multiple of 3, say, 800V x 300A producing a maximum of 240kW.\n\n300A is pretty common with Tesla/Chademo (400V common voltage x 300A = 120kW) and of course, Porsche already mentioned the 800 volts.",

Even if a developer could only charge a $0.05/kw premium, they'd still make money (assuming a $1000 charging station). Also, apartments with charging stations are more desirable, hence a motive to install charging stations.\n\nCharging stations aren't that expensive. It all comes down to demand. Right now, demand is low. I'm certain that demand will get much higher for charging stations when EVs are more popular.",

And as far as Tesla was concerned I'm as much of a Tesla fan as anyone but A: PV was not a thing back then and i'm pretty sure the development of commercial electric would have happened a lot differently if it was, and B: don't forget the guy died penniless because he wasn't smart enough to protect his intellectual property from Westinghouse and Edison so yes brilliant engineer but certainly no superhero.",

"comment": "&gt;what you are saying is that causing animals to suffer is not inherently wrong, unless your existence is immoral. Next we have to decide what minimizing looks like. You could end your life, cause suffering to family, but less overall. Why is killing yourself or being a Jane in spirit not practical? The problem is you are making a choice to cause harm and excusing it\n\nIf I drive a ride a drive an electric car everywhere I go I am still contributing slightly to climate degradation. Does that mean that you are justified in taking a private jet and yacht everywhere you go while you dump your garbage directly into the sea? Like, we can't be perfect, but that doesn't mean nothing is better than anything else ever.\n\n&gt;through smart use of land, we have the ability to feed more people sustainably than a sustainable vegan diet due to veganism being unable to use land effectively\n\nWhat evidence does he have for this?",

OP's location is also not likely a place drivers would stop to recharge. Additionally, Superchargers don't come in small quantities. There are only [6 sites in the US and 1 in Canada](https://supercharge.info/#data) with less than 4 stalls.\n\nThere's less than &lt;5 non-Tesla (private) Supercharger sites, they all cost a huge amount of $, and they're all for companies with large Tesla fleets. e.g. taxi services.",

"comment": "I think the real question is whether legacy manufacturers will/can develop their EV drivetrains so that they can match/beat the value of ICE's.  If your BEV has 150mi range and costs $50k, then it's only niche (I'm looking at you BMW i3).\n\nEven Tesla is barely offering a mass-market ICE-killer.  Hopefully they'll exit production hell soon, and will progress toward building a million-ish Model 3's per year.\n\nI hope the other guys catch up soon.  They have the capability to make millions of cars, hopefully they'll get their EV tech up to speed where those products are BEVs instead of ICE's.  \n\nThe good part is that it's super competitive, and any automaker that is slow to make the switch to EVs will likely die due to competitive pressure.  This will leave the strongest to build 10's of millions of EVs (and pick up some cheap/obsolete factories along the way).\n\nI'm less interested in seeing EV prototypes, and would like to see investments in battery factories.  Motors and power electronics are good too.",

"comment": "It's also... not the whole picture.\n\nYes, electric cars don't have an engine or transmission.  They still have motors (which can fail) and electronics (which can fail, or be disabled remotely by Tesla).\n\nAnd they're not maintenance free either.  Yeah, you save on the $50/year in oil changes, but you still have brakes which will need replacing, as well as suspension components which will wear out (and, since it's active suspension, be expensive to replace.)\n\nSo while it is potentially cheaper to maintain in some ways, it's hardly a clear win.\n\nI love electric cars, but I really don't like when people aren't upfront about what they can and can't do, since ultimately spin games just hurt our cause.",

"comment": "Which inverter do you have?  It seems like the FlexPower line is simply pre-wired inverters/chargers/etc, with a variety of inverter options.\n\nThe concept of having a DC coupled system that I can then add a battery to is interesting, but I'm not sure I want to be limited to what the high voltage battery options are, and it doesn't seem that sort of system will operate with a built your own pack sort of arrangement.  If I go with the Outback 48V ecosystem, I can build anything from a small(ish) 10kWh pack to a massive 100+kWh pack if I need to down the road.  Plus, there's some parts commonality with my office system on a 48V pack, which is of at least some value to me.\n\nCan you actually *get* a LG pack on a reasonable lead time?  Tesla's packs are useless since you can't order them and get them delivered on any sort of schedule.",

"comment": "Cold weather, or more specifically, cold batteries suffer from poor ion transfer. So, cars with Thermal Battery Management systems (TBMS) will generate heat (or cooling in extreme hot weather) to regulate the temperature so as to be in a more optimal range. Therefore, energy is used to heat (or cool) the batteries as well as to heat the cabin in edition to propelling the vehicle. Similarly, charging slows in cold weather for the same reason, as some energy must be used to regulate battery temps.\n\nClearly, the biggest challenge EV owners face is charging speeds. Typical 110V outlets charge at a rate of 3-5 miles per hour, 220V can typically deliver up to 25 miles per hour. To get a quick charge while traveling long distances, a much higher source of power is require and  typically delivers in the range of 100+ miles per hour, but faster charge rates generate a lot of heat, so TBMS must consume some of the power to cool things. Further, batteries charge on a curve, with faster charging when batteries have a lower charge, then slowing dramatically as the battery nears full charge. So, long distance driving requires longer \"refueling\" stops, and is reliant on fast charging facilities. For daily commuters, the Level2 220V charging is sufficient as overnight (8 hours for example) can top off the batteries (8 x 25mi\\\\hr = 200 miles of range).\n\nSince refueling (charging) makes the most sense economically when done @ home (vs using public charging), investments in electrical upgrades and EVSE will add an up front cost of up to $1000, or more. Your electrical service costs will rise, but for most, much less than what gas would have cost in a traditional ICE vehicle. For those who live in apartment\\\\condo facilities, home charging may not be possible unless the landlord is willing to install EVSEs, or allow unit owners to do so.\n\nThen, there is maintenance. While EVs require very little maintenance, if\\\\when something goes wrong, the typical mechanic will be lost. EVs will initially require specialized service, though eventually most mechanics will get up to speed.\n\nThere are many pluses to EV ownership, including less maintenance, more efficient use of energy (my Bolt averages 166+ MPGe commuting daily), quiet, instant acceleration, etc. As with most things in life, it all comes down to tradeoffs and individual circumstances. As public fast charging networks become more common, and as battery costs and tech improve (more capacity, faster charging, less cost), some of the cons will be minimized making EVs more logical for more drivers.",

"comment": "Steam reforming of natural gas is \\~65-75% efficient. Fuel cells are \\~40-60% efficient, and then you still have all the usual minor inefficiencies associated with BEVs (on top of everything else). So you take 1 energy unit of natural gas, convert it to \\~0.7 units of hydrogen. Then convert that into 0.35 units of electricity.\n\nOr you just turn that natural gas into electricity with a combined cycle natural gas plant (&gt;90% of plants in the US) at 60%+ efficiency and end up with 0.6 units of electricity, **meaning an EV powered by natural gas is about \\~70% more efficient than a FCEV running on SMR-derived hydrogen.**\n\nAnd of course you can use renewables to charge EVs just as easily, while to make hydrogen from renewables requires the far less efficient electrolysis process which consumes \\~50-55 kwh to go about 60 miles. That's about 1.1 miles per kwh, **so an EV powered by renewables is \\~300-350% more efficient than a FCEV.**\n\nThere's a reason the Mirai costs \\~60-70 dollars to fill up and goes \\~300 miles, and a tesla requires \\~8 dollars to fill up and go just as far. You need \\~50-55 Hydrogen is comically inefficient.\n\nSeriously, just google these things before making a fool out of yourself.",

"comment": "Thanks for your insight. This is the first comment in this sub I have received that's written somewhat neutral.\n\nI don't think the far left are a good way to go. They want to establish a utopia, that might benefit us in the long run, without taking the way there into account. But far right isn't a good way either. Let's take the AfD here in Germany, they're the most serious politically right party that I have encountered so far. What they want is inhuman sometimes, the majority of their Agenda is constructed around one topic (refugees) and they don't have actual plans how Germany should prepare for the future. The answer for what to vote for lies somewhere in the middle, between utopia and conservativism. I tend to lean more towards utopia, but others don't and that's fine as long as they actually know why they are voting for who they are voting for.\n\nWhen reading your first paragraph I had this thought of \"I had a feeling and dug, until I found out that feeling was right, regardless of whether it was or wasn't.\" It's not a bad thing (some research papers do take this way too), but I wanted to know if that's the bottom line.\n\n\"This place is literally only place I have in my life where people hold this opinion and the media surrounding me and everyone around me believe the world is coming to and end and I'm subjected to an endless tirade in the media of panic, fear, hate, anger and terror, guilt and blame.\"\n\nThat sounds like a bubble place to me, I know I live (or lived) in one too, so I decided to check out other bubbles and see, what they are thinking (not just what my bubble was thinking they are thinking). I'm only 19 and started with investigating what was going on in the world at around 16. I know enough that everything is biased, regardless of what they say. Everyone has some interests and tries to convey them to you. This was confirmed last year with Article 13, when newspapers were majorly rooting for the change. I found out that the publishers were benefiting from it, so their coverage was influenced by that.\n\nThe only way I could deal with that was by looking at every argument I could find and try to debunk it. That's why I went here, to see which of my points actually hold up and which don't.\n\nMy way of thinking is \"We don't know until it's proven either way.\" Like P vs NP in maths / computer science: if your proof of it existing isn't right, it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. It goes back to \"remains to be proven\". I currently think there's good evidence for AGW being real, so I want to find out the arguments for it not existing, not the ones to disprove the existence.\n\nI don't agree with FfF or green parties in some points, but in some I do agree. More renewable energy sources and electric cars are things I think are needed for a better future. But we shouldn't Force people to use it or not use their old ones. Freedom of choice (let's not get philosophical please) is important for a healthy society.",

In the US you can still get a Model 3 for $35k USD, that’s not the case elsewhere.\n\nI had a ~100 mile commute and I found the Model 3 SR+ to be a bit limiting (240 miles w/ a 100% charge). Sure, it has enough, but barely. Throw in freezing weather, faster driving, normal charging @ 90%, an errand or two and it was dipping into low single digits.\n\nI didn’t like that, it caused undue stress for me so I bit the bullet and decided to spend an extra $100ish a month for quite a few years and moved to a long-range model. That was the ticket- this car has everything I need and very, very rarely will I drive my other vehicle.\n\nAlso, for the love of all that’s holy, make sure you can charge at home or work.

The Taycan Turbo dual motor or the Tesla 100D dual motor?  I ask again because I linked proof of this in real world range tests on dual motor.  Watt hours per mile were about 140 at 25 mph and that is frankly impossible at higher speeds.  Single motor cars get worse efficiency numbers but still see roughly twice the range at those lower 25ish speeds.  Dual motor cars like Teslas and Porsches get higher efficiency.",

In smaller dealerships they can even sell the only car that they have in showroom. \n\nIf the car they receive is road legal I wouldn't see any reason why they will not sell it (unless VW tell them do not do it but that would be weird as they are pushing EVs hard), maybe the only problem now is software. \n\nHope they can finish it by a few weeks. Not a problem if it's bad at the release because they can update it whenever they want.",

"comment": "There are a few things that aren't quite right:\n\n1. Cheap parts and cheap cars aren't synonymous...some cheap cars have parts that are quite expensive to replace, primarily because of scarcity. A lot of cheap cars also use complex assemblies and designs that are easier to install at the factory but hard to repair. A lot of small economy cars, in particular, are incredibly expensive to work on because they use uncommon parts AND they're built in a way that makes the parts hard to get to.\n2. Likewise, some premium cars have very inexpensive parts. Cadillac, Lexus, Acura...all these premium brands have compatibility with Chevy, Toyota, and Honda. Keeps costs down.\n3. The operating costs of a Lexus or Acura compared to a Tesla - let alone a BMW - are completely different. Honda and Toyota design for Japan, where rigorous vehicle inspections **require** consumers to fix every little problem (even minor shit like a malfunctioning clock). Japanese consumers have no patience for even tiny repair issues that US consumers don't even notice. As a result, Lexus and Acura are built to exacting standards. Many never require a repair of any kind.\n4. As for US-spec BMWs, they design their vehicles to be leased. If you buy them, you're a sucker. They are built to work great for 4 years, and then they're someone else's problem. Same goes for Mercedes-Benz (again US-spec).\n\nIf you think your BMW is normal in terms of costs, I'd encourage you to read Consumer Reports. I don't love everything they do, but their data re: repair frequency and cost is excellent. If you study the data, you'll either buy/lease a Lexus or lease a BMW/Mercedes.",

It's more of hybrid than a plug-in hybrid, a puny electric motor and 200hp gas motor when it should be opposite IMO.",

And Model S production, at least as of last month's numbers report, was still nowhere near ramped up.\n\nThere's no way to know how many they will sell once production is ramped up.\n\nPerhaps we should allow them to meet their current demand backlog before worrying about any demand concerns.",

Just moved to an apartment where there are no plugpoints, and switched jobs at the same time.  I drive a LR model 3.\n\n\\- There is an urban supercharger 5 minutes from my house, but its a 72 kw charger.  Off peak rates (before 11am, after 8pm) are $.21/kwh, so not too bad.  \n\\- There is a free plug point about 10 minutes walking distance to work, but its only a 110v household outlet  \n\\- All the nearby L2s are expensive ($2/hr, 6kw chargers)  \n\n\nI'm constantly checking plugshare wherever I go to see if theres a possibility of charging.  Waiting at the urban supercharger is annoying.  And charging at 1kw while at work is painfully slow.  Overall, I find the apartment life with no place to even plug in pretty annoying.  Even with a supercharger close by, nothing beats being able to plug in at home and be fully charged every morning.\n\nI'm not looking forward to winter.",

Due to the battery supply chain constraints that means low volumes of the many variants which in turn will make them unprofitable.\n\nThe models all run on the same platforms. They have high part commonality. Like the Bolt and the Sonic were made at the same factory because they shared most of the same non-drivetrain parts. The Ultium cars should be the same way.\n\n&gt;GM needs to do what Apple and Tesla do. Make a few cars, make them a flag ship piece that customers thirst over and then expand over time\n\nNot to be rude, but GM has been around making cars for far longer than anyone at Tesla has been alive. They know how to make and sell cars. They know their buyers pretty well at this point. Their buyer behavior is completely different.",

"comment": "There is a case in Maine where the utility refused connection because the distribution lines were not sized to handle the power in some circumstances (load timing versus generation timing). I have had multiple dealings with the utility in question, and the PUC that controls them (and is led by a shill for the industry), and feel this is likely a stretch that suits their agenda of holding desperately on to their fading, failing business of sticking expensive power poles in the ground and making us use them when we no longer need to. It's an easy claim to make and difficult to disprove. But there are now work-arounds from the most advanced solar PV equipment manufacturers, where the power can be fed into batteries, including EVs, heat storage, timed hot water tanks, and other heavy loads on site, all managed by microprocessor, and no power need ever see the grid. So this is where the solar vs. utility tech arms race is headed: homes that are essentially off-grid even when it would be better for all concerned if they were on the grid, including better for the climate (because my surplus power runs straight through my neighbors fridge or EV or whatever, no GHGs), and only because short-sighted utilities can't imagine a working business model that includes rooftop solar. Fuck 'em, I say. Bring it on. You can't fight progress. Microprocessors and wiring is a lot cheaper than power poles, so we know who wins. Then their only remedy will be to try to find a way in the courts to force people to connect. Which I have no doubt they'll try. But I tend to think that's where this ends. Your particular experience, however, was just a hard sales-pitch with a hint of truth. \n\nhttps://www.bangordailynews.com/2022/12/23/mainefocus/maine-solar-grid-stressed-by-demand-joam40zk0w/",

Anything less than the ultimate trim with supercruise is not comparable to the base model 3.",

Wet streets kind of absorb the brightness of the headlight, plus reflections and such create a murky visual. Nothing is as clear as you'd like. Whenever I've ridden in the rain I've taken it VERY slow. Once there was a major flooding problem that pushed debris and tons of dirt into the street and bike lane. It was a long slow ride home. That dried dirt over the next few days was a major obstacle that required slowing down and proceeding cautiously.",

"comment": "All of this discussion of \"moral behavior\" and the \"rights of all\" to be free from harm is predicated on the idea that CO2 is a control knob for temperature and that the sensitivity is high.  Climate Policy, the one that I would be \"immoral\" for resisting, is based on the idea that if Climate Policy isn't followed, great harm will befall the people.\n\nUnderstand that I have not been convinced that the climate scientists know that the climate sensitivity is high.  If and when I become convinced of this, I will then need to be convinced that the US has not done enough to combat the rise in CO2 of the planet.  I don't rule the entire world, and I cannot force developing nations to stop increasing their CO2 emissions.\n\nLets assume, for a moment, that CO2 sensitivity is high, and that we need to stop, or even reverse, the amount of CO2 we are emitting to prevent a high rate of warming in the future.  What should we do?  Well, we should work to develop non-fossil fuel based energy sources, so that we can work to reduce our own nation's emissions.\n\nI fully support moving to non-fossil fuel energy sources anywhere we can do so.  I like the idea of lining all of the warehouse roofs with solar panels, so that the 10's of thousands of square feet of roof space can produce the energy that the warehouse (or retail store, or whatever) needs to operate.  This seems to be a win-win for businesses who have large amounts of roof space.\n\nI fully support using wind energy at the coasts and through the \"wind corridor\" of the central plains of the United States to generate electricity.  I'm most certainly not a NIMBY wind turbine hater, who lobbies the government to ban the very sight of wind turbines.  That having been said, I do recognize that wind is an inconsistent energy source, and that there are times when the wind is blowing well, but the energy grid already has too much electricity available.  In those times, we need a way to store the energy, so that it is not wasted.\n\nDeveloping energy storage systems to even out the inconsistent nature of wind and solar, developing tide-based energy systems, and other methods of generating energy is just good sense, whether or not the world is going to melt.\n\nOn a personal level, I don't see energy getting a lot cheaper over the next few decades.  Because I don't like to spend more money than I must to remain comfortable and entertained, I look for ways to reduce my energy related expenses.  This, again, is not dependent upon the idea that some poor person somewhere in the world will be victimized by excessive heat.  I don't let my water hose run all the time, because it's wasteful, and I don't see any need to waste energy that I have to pay for, either.\n\nTo that end, I work from home, using the Internet rather than driving into an office.  Back several years ago, my employer wanted to see my face every day, and I had no choice in the matter. Instead of driving the 70 mile round trip every day, I took a commuter bus when I could, since it was a lot cheaper, and I was less stressed.  Now, I don't do the trip at all.\n\nI don't like to be shut up in an artificial environment all the time, and so I generally leave my windows and doors open for a large part of the year. All spring and fall, of course, and a good bit of the summer.  Winter days, as well, if it's a warm day.  I tend to use exhaust fans to rid my home of excess heat, rather than seal it up and run an air conditioner.\n\nIn this way, I have a fairly low electricity bill.  It's about half that of others I know with similar sized homes in my area.  I don't do this to reduce my use of fossil fuels, or to reduce my CO2 emissions, but my habits do have that effect, nonetheless.  In my area, about 30% of my electricity comes from coal, and almost none from oil.  We have hydro-electric dams that provide some, and we get a large percentage of power from a nuclear power plant, nearby. \n\nWhen I do travel about in a personal vehicle, a good portion of that driving comes from either a very high efficiency vehicle (102 miles per gallon) or my Nissan Leaf, which is fully electric.  Again, neither of these choices were made because of CO2 emissions, although they do have the effect of being very low in emissions, compared with others.\n\nSo, you can accuse me of being \"immoral\" because I don't agree with Climate Policies that I don't think help any of the goals that I don't share, nor even the ones you promote, but I think that if you examine my life and habits outside of my lack of faith in your CO2 hating religion, you'd hold me up as an example of how to live.  Ironic, isn't it?",

"comment": "Module prices are going up because of tariff-related issues, which I feel will be overcome by then. Inverter quality continues to improve. There are more micro-inverters on the market, SMA has released a pretty slick batteryless inverter that provides emergency power, DC power optimizers are gaining market share. Time-of-use metering is becoming more prevalent. Solar financing is becoming more prevelant. Mainstream labor resourcing is becoming more prevelant. Cap-and-trade won't be implemented until after 2016.\n\nAll those reasons indicate a solar array prices will continue to fall, have higher generation rates, and be of higher quality in 2016 vs. today. Of course, the big assumption is all this is the lack of local incentive funding. \n\nAs much as I'd like OP to move forward with his array as soon as possible, OP asked if I think the smarter play is to wait, and... yes, I think that's the smarter play.",

Any light that unable to be used for electricity production (which is most) that hits a solar panel, that excess energy will be converted to heat and is unlikely much if any is reflected back.\n\nMost man made objects will not reflect much light back. That's why cities are considered \"heat islands.\" We are comparing buildings &amp; roads to plant life and open land. In most cases where a solar array is placed, it would have already have been an area where most of the sun's energy is absorbed as heat (man made area). Unless you're clearing out forests and green countryside to place solar farms, I would still see it as a positive impact since some of that solar energy is now being used.\n\nTo answer #3, it would reduce the need for fossil fuels (energy production) that would have been used in place of the solar production. However, the question is if the energy used to transport/create the solar panels itself was more wasteful in terms of a carbon footprint and if its clean energy production can eventually make up for it vs if coal electricity was used in its place to begin with.",

"comment": "This is getting pretty lengthy.  I'm going to copy/paste out somewhat of order to try to bring relevant points together.\n\n&gt;I never said the economy would have to shrink.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;My point was... that it is possible to reduce per capita energy use without having to \"reduce aid, research, development or production of pharmaceuticals.\" as you suggest we do.\n\nYou said, \"Yes, a reduction in complexity is necessary...\"  Complexity is tied directly to GDP.  If you fix a component that is inefficient, that frees capital for other products and services, maintaining or increasing complexity.  But let's set complexity aside and go back to my premise: increases in energy costs hurt economies.  Do you agree or disagree with that statement?\n\n&gt;Again, if you want to argue on costs, then you need to include the cost of continued use of fossil fuels. \n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;I read your source. And it doesn't include the large external costs that fossil fuels don't have to pay.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;I read them with no mention of the health costs or damage from global warming.\n\nIt's extremely frustrating to tell you that you haven't properly read my sources, then have you tell me you've read them when you clearly haven't.  When you asked that your ban be rescinded, I thought you would be operating in good faith.  Are you?  If so, how did you miss the obvious?\n\nHere is the source I am referring to:\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/counting-the-hidden-costs-of-energy-12710\n\nYou clearly never made it to [figure 1](https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/21070/area14mp/z8s8k7m7-1362635829.jpg).  See the gray area on the chart?  It's the cost of carbon emissions being added to the fossil fuel bars.  Now, you doubled and tripled down on your claim that my sources don't include the cost of carbon, but it's staring you in the face.  Are you operating in good faith?\n\n&gt;Efficiency is not the metric that matters here. $ per KWh is. And in that metric CSP is competing or soon will compete with fossil fuels.\n\nEfficiency always matters, because the amount of resources needed to collect diffuse energy is a function of efficiency.  And CSP is nowhere near competing with fossil fuels, by any metric, except possibly the metrics of \"biggest eyesore\" or \"the ability to ignite birds while in flight.\"\n\n&gt;I never said that it produces the same output, just correcting your statement that solar only produces power on sunny days.\n\nOh, so were being pedantic.  Should I go through your comment and correct your numerous spelling errors?  Do you think I didn't know that solar panels produce a trickle of energy on cloudy days?  Or is it more likely that I'm speaking in broader strokes when I say, \"they don't produce on cloudy days\"?  Would you feel better if I edited my comment to say, \"Solar panels don't produce any meaningful energy on cloudy days\"?\n\n&gt;That's not what I said. I said wind and solar can provide large amounts of power... \n\nIn that case, you didn't bother reading the comment above mine in the thread.  It was clearly a discussion of what it would take to go 100% renewable.\n\n&gt;...and there are entire nations, Germany and Denmark that agree.\n\nYes, there are governments that made some very poor energy decisions.  You'll note Germany has started burning a lot more coal of late, and it's CO2 emissions have actually started to increase.  You'll note as well that Germany actually has to pay other countries to take their excess when the wind is blowing too hard and that wind in Germany wouldn't be viable at all were they a stand-alone grid.  They are using their neighbors' infrastructure as backup.  That's not viable at all if the neighbors follow their lead.\n\n&gt;These technologies save money.\n\nThen why do they require subsidy?  If they saved money, utilities would be investing in them already.\n\n&gt;I suggested biogas or power to gas to supply the heat to make concrete. Not electricity.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Wikipedia says 64% efficient for substitute natural gas.\n\nAnd I addressed the problems with each.  To restate, biogas requires petroleum else it would bootstrap.  Power to gas is very inefficient.  I would say losing more than a third of your energy to heat, to then produce a gas that is burned for heat, is highly inefficient.\n\n&gt;Wind can power electric arc when it is blowing.\n\nDo you not even bother to try to understand what I write?  How many times did I state in my comment that production of concrete or steel requires **steady** power?  Intermittent sources just don't cut it.  \n\n&gt;Using electricity for heat is far from inefficient. Resistive heating is nearly 100% efficient and heat pumps can have an effective efficiency of 350% or more.\n\nIt's inefficient because it's better to use the heat itself rather than to go from heat to electricity (maybe 40% efficient) to heat again.  It's inefficient for wind to be used in an arc furnace because of the opportunity cost of that electricity (setting aside that it's moot because it's intermittent).  To wit, the purpose of wind is to offset fossil fuels, but if you use the electricity that wind produces for heat, then you aren't offsetting fossil fuel use at all.\n\n&gt;... heat pumps can have an effective efficiency of 350% or more.\n\nSorry, we obey the laws of thermodynamics around here.  We are talking about high heat manufacturing.  You don't produce that from heat pumps.  If so, people would already be doing it.\n\n&gt;Finally something we agree on. I am 100% in favour of nuclear power.\n\nThen you should have noted that the conversation was about going 100% renewable.  Renewables can be integrated into a nuclear powered grid, but they can't provide the whole package.  Not even close.\n\nBy the way, if you support nuclear power, are you performing a similar study for your class over in /r/greenpeace?  Are you decrying in anyway Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Rocky Mountain Institute, Friends of the Earth, or any of the other major ENGOs than oppose nuclear power?  Those groups have some serious power, and I would argue that they do more to inhibit CO2 reductions than to those they call deniers.\n\n&gt;No one technology is enough but your so called \"Rube Goldberg\" renewables are a very large part of the solution.\n\nI'm asking you to critically examine that assumption, for the sake of thought experiment if nothing else.  Please tell me why renewables (and I'll include biofuels in that) must be a part of the solution.  I think we would both agree that nuclear must be part of the solution, but why must solar, wind, or biofuels?  What is their unique, inherent value?",

Lol WTF?\n\nNow in many states if you get a new house you won't even have to convert anything\nIn some cities in Colorado for example all new houses are required to have solar panels\n\nIn the very near future it may make more sense monetarily for YOUR house to convert once prices go down even more and you end up paying less than a penny per kWh.  \n\nIn fact you might not even need to change much as your house can just tap to a grid pulling from a bank of stored renewable energy.\n\nIn Chile and Dubai it's already below $0.01 per kWh it's just a matter of time\n\nThis is why I feel the climate skeptics argument that renewable energy is a waste of time is bogus.  Even if global warming from mankind is bunk it still makes sense from an economic standpoint and will eventually save YOU personally money",

"comment": "Actually, I'm making fun of those people who are putting forth extreme opinions.  My position is the opposite of extreme.  On the other hand, you do whatever it is that you feel like you should do to mitigate the coming calamity of climate change.  Weep and wail, cry in the streets, tear out your hair and proclaim the end of the world.  Whatever.  Make sure you drum up as much false panic as you can, to lead the stupid masses into believing that the end of the world is nigh.  Just realize that people like me can see through your lies.  The world is not about to end.  People may be displaced, but over generations, not over the weekend.  The very poor who are displaced will just relocate to other poor areas, farther away from the beach, uphill.  The way they will do it is that the kids will move away from home to another home, higher up.  Eventually, the shitty rental they have will stop being rented, and the evil landowner that you people hate anyway will lose his investment.  Greens and liberals will cheer as the people win another victory over capitalism.   But the poor will just move on.\n\nAnd remember, this will affect mostly low lying areas within a few feet of sea level anyway, not areas 20 feet above sea level. Not for a long, long, long time.  Like I said, generations.  Even though Hansen has said that the seas will rise 10 feet by 2050 or 2065 or whatever it was, he is full of shit.  Seas are rising less than a foot a century.   Poor people have time to get out of the way.\n\nAnd famine?  Famine in modern times has been caused by politics, not by the lack of food.  Remember the famine in Ethiopia?  Completely political. There was plenty of food - but the Army (not ours, theirs) kept it from the people who needed it.  The government in charge was using hunger as a political tool. He literally wanted to starve his political rivals to death.  \n\nThe rising levels of CO2 are causing the plant levels to explode, growing crops much more efficiently than any time in the last 200 years.  We are so much better at growing food that we literally destroy food before it causes a problem.  So, famine?  Only if the governments decide to starve people again. \n\nWhen you talk about me wanting to prevent solutions, or \"mitigate climate change\" I assume that you think I'm all in on team coal or team oil or something.  I'm not.  I love the idea of renewables. I have bought solar panels, and will continue to buy more of them for my new home, when I get one.  I own an electric car.   I support the idea of a tax on fossil fuels.  I built a sailboat.  \n\nI just hate people who are willing to lie and state that the end of the world is near, that we're about to cause millions of species to go extinct, to very nearly cause the extinction of mankind itself to scare people into their personal agendas.  If you do this, you are a liar and a fraud and bad things should happen to you.",

"comment": "Here are some things to consider from a solar sales rep who has worked with both SunPower &amp; SolarCity: \n\nSunPower's offer is a good one for the technology, but you're not just buying the technology for that moment; you're buying it for 20+ years. SunPower subcontracts everything for their system, so if you have any problem with the system &amp; work needs to be done, you're going to be at the mercy of a 3rd party getting out there to get the work done. And you might end up paying for all that out of your pocket. \n\nIn my experience in San Diego, my SunPower customers have experienced frequent no-shows, reschedules, &amp; lack of communication from the subcontractor &amp; they are very frustrated. \n\nSolarCity has their operations side wayy more together &amp; all the issues with no-shows &amp; lack of communication are not as blinding as they were for me &amp; my SunPower customers. \n\nBottom line...if you know you will be in that house for 30+ years with the same panels, SunPower's panels might be producing more energy than the SolarCity panels, but you might have a headache with the maintenance. With SolarCity, you might have less production down the road, but the headaches will be much less severe (and cheaper) than having to deal with a subcontractor. \n\nHope this helps a little.",

"comment": "FYI, I just completed my solar installation last month. My out of pocket costs after fed incentives is about $9,000 for a 5.5kw system. That is roughly enough power to cover about $300 a month worth of SDGE (my power company) electricity. For a 20 years life or longer system, I would be breaking even within 3.1 years. Not sure who is quoting you on these *rip off lease &amp; power purchase agreement deals* but they had you bent over and not using any lube. RUN as fast as you can and get a quote for straight cash price from a reputable installer. \n\nForget warranty, forget increasing equity value on the home, assume all those things are zero. You would still be better off if the system just runs for 5 years and drop dead. The annual production decline of .05% over 5 years is about 2%-3%, which is probably not even noticeable, even for the super geeks actively monitoring the system. Anything over 5 years is icing on the cake. Just to be clear that icing is worth about $25,000 if it runs for another 15 years beyond 5 in my case. As others have said, beyond 20 years, panels don't just drop dead, they are guaranteed to perform above 80% or be replaced. After that, they will still continue to function, probably around 90% of their day 0 performance (10% ish decline). Don't get caught up in the declining production numbers. \n\nOn the flip-side, your utility will certainly continue to your raise your rates over time (probably over 200% over 20 years). In Southern California, SDGE raised rates by 500% over the last 10 years, google that if you don't believe me. Fact checks your own utility historical rate increase.  It's a no brainer to go solar *if* net metering is allowed.",

"comment": "Mods, delete this fake news. \n\nThere is no 2007 data on solar industry deaths! All you can say is that roofing work is dangerous and solar is roofing work! \n\n&gt; 1/6th of the 9 million roofing job accidents would be about 50 deaths from installing 1.5 million roofs if other countries had similar to US safety. The amount of roof installations is increasing as a percentage. 4 TWh from roofs PV. So 12.5 deaths per TWh from solar roof installations\n\nThe author completely makes up the solar death statistics in this sentence.  \n\n&gt;4 TWh from roofs PV. So 12.5 deaths per TWh from solar roof installations. Assuming 15 years as the average functional life or time until major maintenance or upgrade is required. The average yearly deaths from rooftop solar is 0.83/TWh. Those who want a lower bound estimate can double the life of the solar panels (0.44deaths/TWh)\n\nWhat about utility scale solar? Is that not the most TWH capacity in the industry? Completely left out of consideration in 2011, despite the fact it was a majority of USA installed capacity starting in 2009, and the USA was behind the game on that. The margin of error could easily place solar in the same category as wind/nuclear/hydro etc. Fake news!\n\n&gt;Deaths per TWH by energy source...Electrical power installers   32.5  [also, solar power related]\n\nYes, and electricians are also essential in every other kind of power plant known to man, inherently. Why isn't this specified? Because its a useless comment. The solar callout is utterly useless.",

Dust can be a problem.\n\n&gt;Chemical storage has overtaken mechanical storage.\n\nCSP uses thermal storage not mechanical storage. Mechanical storage = pumped hydro, compressed gas, moving weights etc.. Mechanical storage using pumped hydro is still the cheapest available.\n\nCrescent Dunes CSP plant in Nevada has storage capability of 1.1 GWh which is like 8.5 times the [world's largest lithium ion battery station](https://cleantechnica.com/2017/11/23/tesla-completes-worlds-largest-li-ion-battery-129-mwh-energy-storage-facility-south-australia-notfree/)\n\nIt also costs less than lithium ion battery station of equivalent capacity. Tesla USD 390 million for 129MWh ($3Million/MWh). Crescent Dunes is $1 billion for 1.1 GWh ($0.9Million/MWh), this cost also includes the power plant cost. Only pumped hydro can be cheaper than molten salt storage.\n\n&gt;Solar PV outperforms solar thermal.\n\nWater heating &amp; space heating are largest application of solar thermal. Worldwide these applications save as much energy as solar PV generates.\n\nIn the future when our civilization builds Dyson Sphere. CSP will overtake all energy sources.",

"comment": "I'm a layman and bad at the maths, but could your calculations not make a lot of financial sense because of the cost to borrow money?\n\nI had a large system installed. The out-the-door cost was 41k (Arizona, solar city). Obviously there's installation and commission built into that number, which i accept. But if i could afford to pay for 20 years of electricity up front, my monthly cost over 20 years is about 170. If i had applied the rebate to my solar loan my cost over 20 years would be about 116, again, without financing. For Arizona summers, this is a no-brainer. But now, throw in the interest on what is essentially the cost of a luxury car, financed over 20 years (!!!), and my total, final repayment is just north of 67k. My monthly loan payment will be ~285 for the next 17.5 years (1.5 years included interest deferment).\n\nSo, it's good that you're running hard numbers. I had a difficult time buying in too because, while I'm a big proponent of clean energy and HATE giving a dime to my local utility, i wasn't going to cut off my nose to spite my face.\n\nAt the end of the day, i pulled the trigger because i convinced myself i could start doubling or tripling my principle payments on the solar loan once my 37k truck was paid off.\n\nAgain, I'm not very smart, but it sounds like you're lumping in the interest which has nothing to do with the actual cost of a rooftop solar install.\n\nMy 0.02",

"comment": "I just got 7 quotes from small to large solar installers in Arizona this week.  First, living in AZ requires a lot more electricity due to the hot summers but we get a lot of sun light - Valley of the Sun and all!  :)  We just signed a contract for a 17.92kw system.  Silfab's all black 320w panels, solaredge inverters and optimizers.\n\nAlways, always get multiple quotes!  Almost every quote I received I was told this is the best we can do... Yet when someone else beats them they can suddenly go lower.  The cheapest quote I received including the finance charges came out to $48,611.00 for 17920W system which equals $2.71 per watt.  So your price at $2.25 is a smoking deal, at least compared to what I was able to get in AZ.  I would get a quote from one and send it to the others asking them to beat it.  I don't care if it's not the nicest thing in the world to do or not.  \n\nI'd suggest making an excel sheet to track all of the quotes.  it helps a lot to have everything in one spot and just go down the list to find the best deal.  Assuming all the same equipment or very close too.\n\nI like this loan calc website.  It'll amortize everything and shows you how much you pay in interest for the life of the loan.\n\nhttps://usmortgagecalculator.org/loan-amortization-calculator/\n\nIt is showing a 20 year loan at 76.35 based off of 12,600 @ 3.99 with 5,724 in total interest.  \n\nThe 10 year is 127.57 @ 3.99 with 2,708 - 3K less interest!  Both of these numbers assume you pay the tax credit towards the loan.  Also, always pay principle on the loan.  All of the installers we talked to had an 16-18 month grace peroid, which allowed us to pay 70% of the regular payment - principle and interest.  This allowed us time to get the tax credit and pay down the loan.  Never pay interest only payments on anything!  You'll pay way more over the life of the loan. \n\nHere is a screenshot of my break down for my quotes.  I left out Sunrun and Vivant solar's quotes because they were way higher and not in the running...\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/qfT6gsI\n\nFor those interested, we went with Titan Solar for a 10 year loan @ 2.49%.  Since it offered the lowest cost/watt when taking into account tax credits and the total principle + interest on the loan at the full 10 years.\n\nHope this helps!!",

"comment": "Seems like everyone has you covered pretty well here. I would just like to add that as you start peeling back the layers of the onion you might go from feeling anxious about the end of the world because of global warming to... anxiety about something else entirely, which has a lot more to do with a stunning realization of how truly and fundamentally twisted and weak our society has become, or perhaps always was, that it is so easily tricked on such a grand scale.\n\n&gt; I believe in protecting the environment.\n\nMost of us here do. \"Climate change\", as a movement, is not about protecting the environment, as you will soon discover (hopefully), but controlling people and money. I would suggest mentally decoupling environmentalism from climate change so you can investigate it more clearly for what it is, on its own. I'm a proponent of solar power on the individual level, and nuclear on the public level, and I greatly dislike pollution of any kind, but those have nothing to do with the climate change ideology.",

"comment": "That panel kit seems pretty decent for the price, though my preference is for MPPT charge controllers to make better use of the panels. The only thing I'd change would be to go with a 100Ah AGM battery instead of the 35. This will give you a few days of reserve in case of several days of overcast weather. Charge controllers are designed to not discharge the battery significantly in the absence of power from the PV panels. \n\nI would recommend getting a programmable battery protect device like this:  https://www.amazon.com/Victron-BPR000100400-BatteryProtect-12-24V-100A/dp/B07PJ1SW9Z/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=victron%2Bbattery%2Bprotect&amp;qid=1573055913&amp;s=lawn-garden&amp;sr=1-4&amp;th=1\n\nYour biggest consumable investment with this system will be the battery, so spending money to protect it is generally a good idea. If you keep your SOC above 75%, i.e. never use more than a quarter of the battery's Ah in any given charge/discharge cycle, you can expect an AGM battery to last thousands of discharge cycles.",

I just got off the phone with support and they said another round of upgrades is taking place. I asked to speak to a supervisor and one was not available. I was told it should be taken care of within 5 days. I will be calling back in 5 days if that is not the case. I would encourage other SunPower customers to call and file a support request as well. If enough people call in, something might actually be done. You can reach them at  1-800-786-7693.",

However, the world, not even the US has 100% coal fired power plants, as a global fleet today it would emit less CO2 than ICE cars which are all run on liquid fossil fuels. In the future it will only improve and today, those who can afford it, can buy solar panels and produce what is consumed in daily commutes which on average is likely under 30 kWh.",

The article you linked talks about using solar and wind to generate or create hydrogen fuel and I don’t agree with this notion either. I was more so talking about the Tesla powerwalls being used in mass to help regulate and store energy in Australia which has helped their energy problems but is a far cry from a fix. What sort of disadvantages are shown in solar that are not in the production of the panels phase?  It’s all really new to me since I primarily joined this sub for discussion and info on energy that didn’t involve random taxes pushed by Green Party advocates.",

In May 2020 during the pandemic NY adopted building codes but the interpretation is largely left to the building inspectors.   \n\nNot only do we have a different set of rules normally, but since May we have had a new set of rules based on interpretations by all of the building inspectors.  Most of which hate solar so they make us jump through hoops while moving the goalposts. \n\nI disagree with you thin on the product Sunpower is the best product available.  Period.   Their customer service may be off but if you’re making a 25 year decision and going with 4-5 companies on your roof where sunpower warranties everything from monitoring to panels, the decision is easy.",

"comment": "I was going to recommend using solarquotes as well, it takes the effort out of finding suppliers and getting quotes in.   Although I would recommend doing another round of quoting once you have confirmed exactly what you want.   One thng I would recommend is get good quality panels, I had bad experience with \"Tier 1\" panels losing their efficiency rapidly after 3 years and had to get the whole system replaced (under warranty) which was a battle I could have done without.  I wish I had gone with LG or SunPower from the get go.  Don't go cheap here. \n\nWhilst Battery doesnt make complete financial sense, it may be worthwhile considering anyway if she has money now, and wants to significantly reduce her bills ongoing for the next 10 years or so.   Alternatively she could just throw $10,000 onto her energy bill and forget about it for a few years :) \n\n$150 a month just to run a hotwater system for one person?  Doesn't sound right.  Heat pump solar hot water may also be worth considering, or retrofitting in flat plates or evacuated tubes to your existing system so the water is partially warmed by the sun.  Or a solar diverter which diverts any surplus solar to heat hot water before it goes back into the grid. \n\nGood luck with your research!",

I ask them politely to stop and they got mental aggressive saying ‘no they’ve been here longer than you’ (been here 3 years and this is first time they’ve nested on our roof) they’ve broken the cage around the bottom of our solar panels, allowing pigeons to get under them and destroy the roof. That’s potentially thousands of £. They’re aggressive, dive bomb and shit everywhere but no, I’m the arsehole for not wanting them to feed wild animals yet they chow down on dead animals every single fucking day. Sorry, rant over, it’s still raw and even though the other neighbours are pissed they don’t say anything. Edit: they even threw animal sausages over our back garden fence when the baby gull went into our garden.",

"comment": "Interesting question!   Being a native plant advocate, a renewable energy investor, and having a desire to purchase a solar roof with an EV… I too wonder which approach would be most beneficial for the environment.   Unfortunately I doubt anyone could answer these questions, as each one has benefits as well as deductions.   So for now my investments advance green technology while generating “seed money ” for the native plant garden at my local park.  To me it’s a win-win as I purchase through the Audubon and donate the plants to the garden club.   Do I still itch for the real life panels and gas free TSLA , sure do.   Ahh maybe someday soon I’ll be driving over to irritate my daughters with new solar roofs instead of planting more trees in their yard lol.  (I’m in a dreaded HOA so I have to live vicariously).  \n\nGuess anything is better than the usual pave paradise and pocket the cash approach.  Folks are becoming more enlightened, one of our friends recently bought a small lot near them just to save it from the developers.",

When you start looking at the scale of what has to be manufactured to supply the world with renewable energy it is daunting. Remember, we have to build the same renewable infustrure in India and the developing world that you have in the west.",

"comment": "The Germans decommissioned their nuclear intentionally.  Nuclear is also the most expensive tech, by far, and is not carbon free (if you look at it’s entire life-cycle).  And if you add up *all* the energy required to produce nuclear, you get the same number of joules as what nuclear produces, so why not just put all that input energy into use directly and skip the middlemen? Most mining equipment runs on hydrogen, so instead of burning fossil fuels to produce hydrogen to run the mining equipment that extracts the uranium ore that takes even *more* energy to process and dispose of, just pump that hydrogen into cars & furnaces & factories directly. Hmmm…\n\nRenewables, by itself, makes no sense, which is why it’s being combined with other tech.\n- Windmills that produce hydrogen onsite that is pipelined to regions where the hydrogen is consumed, just like we pump natural gas around the landscape.\n- As more windmills are moved offshore (where the wind is stronger), ships would collect the H2 and take the gas to distribution centers where it is mixed into the existing natural gas deliveries; furnaces would be updated to accept this gas mix (this idea is *already* being designed in the northeast US).\n- Innovative battery designs extend the capacity of batteries; for example, 800 mile EV ranges (Toyota, 2025) using solid state batteries, which allows renewables to store massive amounts of energy directly into cars, instead of generating the energy on demand or using grid-sized batteries.  So you’ll run your fridge, at night, off the energy stored in your car, that is collected during the day.\n- households *reuse* old EV batteries as power storage for household wind and solar panels.  EV batteries are considered useless when they cannot be charged past 80% of capacity, however, in household power storage where the weight or size of the battery pack does not matter, the useful life of these same packs is extended by decades.",

The first is the claim, put forth by organizations such as the Environmental Law Institute, that the U.S. subsidizes fossil fuels more heavily than green energy. Not so.\r  \nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in 2010 that fossil-fuel subsidies amounted to $4 billion a year. These include $240 million in credit for investment in Clean Coal Facilities; a tax deferral worth $980 million called excess of percentage over cost depletion; and an expense deduction on amortization of pollution-control equipment. Renewable sources received more than triple that figure, roughly $14 billion. That doesn’t include $2.5 billion for nuclear energy.\r  \nActual spending skews even more toward green energy than it seems. Since wind turbines and other renewable sources produce much less energy than fossil fuels, the U.S. is paying more for less. Coal-powered electricity is subsidized at about 5% of one cent for every kilowatt-hour produced, while wind power gets about a nickel per kwh. For solar power, it costs the taxpayer 77 cents per kwh…”",

The power company had to install new equipment near me and upstream just to handle the potential that I could be pushing that into the grid. Then with all that I can only produce a sliver of what we use in 24 hours barring a few rare days of the year. Even with batteries which wear out fairly fast in a real sense, and the size that I would need, that would have been an insane amount of money. I also own a small Lithium battery company (Lightning Lithium) and I still think at the moment, battery storage is just a huge cost for very little gain. So there needs to be another source of energy or better battery development until that point. If we want coal gone. We need something. I don’t want to build a nuclear power plant but, I like the idea of keeping the ones we have until we’re truly ready.",

I am going to install PV modules soon.  I had to have my meter changed from \"Opt out\" to one that can go backwards.  The installer explained that when the meter runs backwards the user side voltage is higher than the grid voltage and is supplying the grid.  That made sense to me and I can see how power can be sold to PGE.  What I don't understand about OP's  argument is how the battery voltage can ever get above grid voltage to make the meter run backward unless the grid goes down.  What am I missing here?",

"comment": "> It is actually affecting poor people disproportionately, that part is true. \n\nBecause of criticisms of net-metering similar to what you just wrote MIT researchers conducted a meta-analysis showing rooftop solar panels help keep electrical rates lower for everyone:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032120308832\n\n>“VOS calculations are challenging and there is widespread disagreement in the literature on the methods and data needed. To overcome these limitations, this study reviews past VOS studies to develop a generalized model that considers realistic future avoided costs and liabilities.”\n\nVOS = Value of Solar\n\nIt's a nuanced debate and it's not necessarily easily understood, but investor-owned utilities have been mis-characterizing the effect of rooftop solar for some time to drive higher profits to themselves precisely because understanding a nuanced topic is difficult.\n\nThe authors conducted this study because of the criticisms you've highlighted here about net-metering. A key takeaway from the study:\n\n>This shift towards VOS is fueled by criticisms of its predecessor [49], net metering, that is misrepresenting the true value of distributed solar generation [[50], [51], [52]]. VOS is more representative of the electricity cost because under a Value of Solar Tariff (VOST) scheme, the utility purchases part of, or the whole net solar photovoltaic electricity generation from its customers, therefore dissociating the VOST from the electricity retail price [51,53]. \n\nHowever, the conclusion is pretty straight forward:\n\n>The results show that grid-tied utility customers are being grossly under-compensated in most of the U.S. as the value of solar eclipses the net metering rate as well as two-tiered rates. \n\nAs always, more work is needed and the authors capture that as well as suggesting regulatory reforms to properly compensate grid-tied PV systems (and note that recent regulatory reforms have moved in the opposite direction this meta-analysis suggests).",

SunPower who would have had my business offer a 19.84KW 0 escalator and 3 Powerwalls for $550. And because they could not fund the project I now have a system that is going to give me 47 REC 410 Alpha Rure panels generating slightly more power then SP the same amount of batteries at 581 a month for the first year and then 401 a month from year 2 to 20 I get the incentive and I do not have to worry if and when I want to sell and move.",

I was pointing out the flaw in people using the environment as a major selling point for veganism.\n\nThe only argument compelling enough to stop the consumption of animal products altogether is the ethical one. Environmental concerns might lead one to cut back on all kinds of consumption that are deemed environmentally damageable. You could have one meal with animal products per month and you would be, in the dietary aspect, greener than almost everyone you know. You can't however, have such a meal and consider yourself respectful of animals.",

Looking at some of your other replies I can see you take a stronger stand on vegan ethics than many others.  Can I presume you'd still consider yourself vegan after some inadvertant consumption, but any conscious consuption is immoral?  I'm curious where you land on the grayer areas: do you think it's immoral to drive or use electricity given that those actions contribute indirectly to animal suffering? For my part I think I'm complicit in a immoral system, so there's a cloud of guilt that motivates me to drive less, use less power, buy less stuff, generally maintain a smaller and smaller footprint; but I don't think knowingly engaging in those activites precludes me from calling myself vegan.  Very curious to know what you think.",

Veganism is a philosophy against all animal exploitation and I do hope that vegans will continue to try to get people to give up animal exploitation. I guess we could call that \"recruiting\". \n\nBut, anyhow, yeah... I think it's silly that some people who will even on one level agree that veganism is a positive thing (for one's health, the environment, and definitely the animals) and at the least not a negative one will at the same time put it and vegans down because it's not something they are personally willing to do. I have a lot of friends that do more than me in certain areas, whether because they have choices I don't have or they're more passionate about something or whatever. I don't feel the need to put them down because they do something I can't or won't do. More power to them!",

It's completely ludicrous to suggest that one isn't doing \"enough\" by abstaining from eating animals. I too started out as a vegetarian (cold turkey) and later became vegan (c.t  as well) but I know I'm a rare case. It's not a matter of who is better than the other, it's about the realization that our actions greatly affect other sentient beings. Each meal that's vegetarian or vegan is notable and one step in the direction towards animal equality. Instead of trying to divide ourselves with petty labeling of \"us\" and \"them\", everyone pat themselves on the back whether you're an old or new vegetarian or vegan. Even going one meal takes courage when you're going up against all that you've ever known to be true.",

"comment": "well, agriculture isn't RELIANT on animals dying, but it is an unfortunate accident of harvesting. i hope you can see the difference between something happening on accident and something being done on purpose. of course most vegans know about this, of course we would prefer it if it didn't happen. but what we are trying to do, i'd say generally, is reduce harm as much as we can even if we realize we can't exterminate it. to go a bit further into your livestock example, take a look at this graph &amp; article http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc\n\nthe thing is an animal has to eat 6-11 times as much energy from plant matter as it will end up yielding. so even if animals are accidentally dying to produce vegetables, it is still less than will die to feed an animal and then slaughter it.\n\nthere are also a lot of hidden deaths in many animal products. in the egg industry for example, almost all the male chicks are killed as soon as they hatch because they are not profitable. this is done by throwing them into a grinder while still alive or gassing them.\n\nalso, the person you are responding to did not call meat eaters murderers. s/he was using murder as an analogy, but specifically says (in another comment i believe) that murdering a person and eating meat are not moral equivalents.",

But I guess that is typical Reddit, since much of the discussion around here isn't serious and is geared to generation Twitter. In a world where JK Rowlings who wrote a book targeted for children also became the most popular adult writer with Harry Potter, getting voted up or down is not a good indication if you are serious or worthwhile commenter. And when Rowlings tried to write an adult book, alot of the world found out she really isn't that great of a writer... That is the low intellectual threshold of Anglosphere and other countries where consumerism is the most dominant ideology. Try to educate yourself for once in your life and stop basting in ignorance. Try to stop advocating apathy or the rights of carnist consumers to not be offended by people like Nikolasv, for once in your life, like the rest of the pathetic \"let's not offend the carnists\" crowd in the fake vegan subreddit.",

Although I'm very active (20-30 hrs of exercise per week), I rarely run because I hate it. Most people tend to be in the hate it camp. I would ask yourself if it is really important that they share the same the exact same hobbies or if you could be more broad in your choice of activities. If running is a do or die thing you might fair better joining a running group than searching on tinder. \n\nYou could also take them to a vegan restaurant or coffee. Taco Party is amazing. Zhus is pretty good too. Irashai, though omni, has absolutely phenomenal veggie sushi and that is reasonablely priced.",

I actually find it abhorrent that they can make the claims some of their food items are vegan while there is reasonable doubt that is not the case. Should be a huge lawsuit imo, but that's modern corporations in a nutshell 🙄.\n\nOn the topic of regulars though, no, I do not agree with you. You say more than 3 fast food meals, but my specific comment that started all this was more than once a week ***at the same place.*** Unless you misquoted the statistics, that does not contradict me at all. \n\nAnd I'm not saying your entire experience is invalid, you're being dramatic. I'm saying if you see regulars, you're going to fixate on them. Do you know exactly how many unique people came to your specific location? Plenty of people don't eat fast food at all. The percentage of people that went to your restaurant that are regulars is not the same percentage of the normal population that are fast food regulars in the first place.\n\nObviously there are people with really unhealthy, lazy and repetitive eating habits, and they'll eat at the same place a lot. And yes I'll concede I was pushing it too far, there are definitely going to be fast food regulars, but I stand by what I say when I think it's not normal and it's not the norm. \n\nThis is all subjective anyways, it depends on what your definition of \"too many fast food regulars\" is.",

You can try explaining it to him so he understands it, but it seems that since he feels the need to justify his actions by saying he's been \"vegan\" for however long, he already knows his actions to be wrong.\n\nI don't think you would be putting him off from becoming vegan if you explained to him why what he's doing is going against veganism itself. If he really shares the ethics, he should be able to understand that his actions are not aligning with his claims, and he would change them.\n\nOtherwise, he just likes using the word vegan to make himself feel better or some other such reason that has nothing to do with the animals. Either way, he's mildly plant-based right now. Maybe \"freegan\" is the better term for him. Quite disappointing.",

Meat eating is not unethical, do you see cheetahs becoming vegans? Have you ever met a grizzly bear who decided to ditch the salmon because he feels bad for them? What about a coyote  hunting deer? Do you think he feels bad he just pounced on bambi in some suburban backyard? Because as animals it is instinctual for us to hunt and collect our food. I just think it's rude to pretend science has nothing to do with the reason we eat meat. Sure oatmilk taste good but if you want people to join your side be less of a snob about it.",

That being said, I like the above comment consider myself and extremely conscious omnivore. I date a vegan, I was vegan for 3.5 years, I eat majority vegan meals, work on a small OG veggie farm and pretty much eat seasonally. But I also discovered after over 3 years of a well regimented and active vegan diet that controlled, clean and small amounts of meat bring my body to 100% where as supplementing and active diverse protein consumption left me feeling about 75% myself in terms of daily energy, proper sleep patterns and sexual vigor. I trade veggies and grains for meat from local farmers with very reputable animal treatment practices and lifestyle diversity. The animals live happy sustained and comfortable lives. For many vegans the endgame eliminates the positive approaches that many small farmers are learning to make use of which I completely understand. But for myself, I never eat meat that I can’t ask the farmer about and I, personally, can live with it.",

I just think it is important because even if someone is being harmful, complicit, or even actively perpetuating these systems, I always try to remember peoples' underlying humanity, and try to treat them with a baseline level of respect and compassion if possible. \n\nNow obviously there are limits to that. And if by \"ruthless\", you mean, \"uncompromising in your values and willing to legislate against those who would disagree for the greater good\", then by all means, be ruthless. I am under no misgivings about the fact that this is essentially a war of ideology, one whose stakes involve infinite mass slaughter and subjugation the likes of which we can barely comprehend. And I have no doubts that eventually, the interests of those who want to preserve this nightmare of a system will inevitably clash with those who seek to abolish it completely. This is politics.\n\nI just also recognize that this is going to be a long, multi-generational conflict, and that in the meantime, we should at least try to buff up our numbers and our representation in the general populace by being gracious and forgiving of our fellow human beings. It's hard, and I actually struggle a lot with it in my own interpersonal relationships. But I think it's worth it and is the right thing to do for everyone involved--human and non-human.",

"comment": "\"It is entirely possible for companion animals to survive, and indeed thrive, on vegetarian diets. However, these must be nutritionally complete and reasonably balanced, and owners should regularly monitor urinary acidity and should correct for urinary alkalinisation through appropriate dietary additives, if it occurs.\n\nThose interested in vegetarian companion animal diets should be aware of concerns about the nutritional adequacy of some such diets demonstrated by a number of studies over a significant number of years. However, to ensure a balanced view, they should also be aware that similar concerns exist about commercial meat-based diets.\n\nThey should also be aware that, although rarely conducted in accordance with the highest standards of evidence-based medicine, a significant and growing body of population studies and cases have indicated that cats and dogs maintained on vegetarian diets may be healthy\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035952/\n\nThis meta analysis is about vegetarian diets for companion animals, so I don't know whether a vegan diet is safe for cats. If you are going to feed vegan kibbles, do your research on which are the best and nutritionally complete, you can buy it online",

You seem to have stated yourself that you don't need them and it's just a taste thing? So I'm confused at how it would effect your nutrition by not having them?\n\nI just don't get why missing Greek yogurt = effecting your nutritional wellbeing. Because...you're still getting all the nutrients you need from veganism. You don't need Greek yogurt.\n\nI may just be misreading though.\n\n...\n\nAlpro Greek yogurt is very good.\n\nI also LOVE dairy free oykos. Tastes just like the normal one.\n\nFor eggs I've seen some restaurants experimenting with vegan boiled eggs which is cool to see. For now you could try...\n\nEgg mayo (vegan). The black salt makes it taste EXACTLY like egg mayo. If you sub the chickpeas for tofu you get the taste AND texture of egg mayo (which is basically just mashed up boiled eggs with mayo). Tastes so good.\n\nhttps://simple-veganista.com/mashed-chickpea-salad-sandwic/#tasty-recipes-8838-jump-target\n\nIf you fancy dipping egg yolk (dippy egg and soldier) then this recipe is very good.\n\nhttps://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/vegan-egg-yolk/\n\n...\n\nIn the end, if this is just about cravings maybe just try to remember WHY you're vegan. Think of the victims. \n\nWhat helped me get rid of my cravings was watching Dominion. Couldn't look at dairy etc the same after that.",

The one I wanted to list was[this one here.](https://k-higashiyamaso.jp)\n\nWhile they are not 100% vegan (most places in Japan won’t be) you can communicate with them what you eat and what you don’t eat and their chef will prepare breakfast to your restrictions. (They will also make you fill out a form where you can cross out dairy, eggs, meat etc… so they always have the info available) \n\nDefinitely recommend them as the chef is highly skilled, they have an in-house onsen and the rooms are beautiful. \n\nIn my experience it’s quite easy finding vegan stuff in japan, at least in bigger cities or temple sites (like around Kurama). It always helps though if you can speak some Japanese.",

Vegans avoid all forms of animal exploitation, which includes exploiting their habitats for commerce, transportation, *entertainment* or any other purpose. You're vegan practice is incomplete and misguided if you do not also practice practicable harm reduction to non-human animal environments. The inverse is also true; you cannot be an environmentalist without being vegan. Animals and their ecosystems are one shared concern by the very obvious reality that animals require an environment to exist.",

"comment": "We really need better/more innovation in the egg and cheese departments. Vegan brands have mastered meat substitutes, but vegan cheeses still don’t hold up to the taste I remember. And if there is a brand that has perfected vegan cheeses, I can only imagine how expensive they must be. And for vegan alternatives to egg, the best experience I’ve had is with Just Egg. The problem is that it’s too expensive to be something for daily use, and it does not fill in for the fried or hard boiled egg. \n\nAlso, can we please bring down the prices of vegan chocolates that are dupes for traditional milk chocolates like snickers and Reese’s cups, etc. ?\n\nI also think the Peta style/dramatic protests only turn away most people from veganism. I get the sentiment, believe me, but the average person is not going to see the message, only the obnoxiousness of the messenger. It’s the sad truth. Documentaries are usually the best ways to convert people. I can’t help but cringe when I see vegans dress up as animals and pour blood on themselves in hopes of making people understand animal suffering.",
