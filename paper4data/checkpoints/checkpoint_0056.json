However, the popularity is also bringing a lot of wealth and prosperity to the region.  People who get wealth then do the same thing people everywhere do, buy calorie dense junky foods.  It's an ethical food in my view, and is helping lift poor folks out of poverty.\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/quinoa_bad_for_bolivian_and_peruvian_farmers_ignore_the_media_hand_wringing.html",

The EV Buyers Guide and magazine is a great pass-along to friends who might be considering driving electric.",

"comment": "&gt; It will be a niche...\n\nGood luck finding that niche, most of the pickup truck drivers that I know wouldn't give up internal combustion engines even if they could only be run on baby seals that were pureed alive.\n\n&gt;But when you consider that full sized pickups are the best selling cars in the US and have been for years (decades?), getting a smaller sliver of that pie is still substantial.\n\nBut people like pickup trucks because of the freedom that they provide, not because they make good daily drivers, which is about the only place a BEV makes sense. They may buy a truck to go camping, or haul jetskis or a boat to the lake only a couple of times a year, but that freedom is always there.  \n\n&gt;Right. Just like with ICE pickups that are bad on mileage unloaded, and WAY worse when loaded.\n\nBut you can refill an ICE vehicle in a matter of minutes, so it doesn't really matter.\n\n&gt;Let's pretend that you take a P85D, raise it, and put a truck body on it, bulk it up for capacity... and you have half the range when loaded. I'd buy that truck that goes ~140 miles on a charge (and has access to superchargers, which are available around me) in a heartbeat.\n\nIt would still cost a fortune. How many people buy $100K pickups that can't be used to haul heavy loads for long distances?\n\n&gt;I'm not a battery-in-car engineer, but I'm close enough to the industry to know that 3-dimensional packing of batteries is viable. Trucks run higher overall and have proportionally higher cabs than passenger vehicles. Lots more places to cram batteries.\n\nThat has nothing to do with payload. Even the V6 diesel Ram is being ridiculed because its ridiculously heavy engine cut so deeply into its payload, how is a BEV going to stack up?\n\n&gt;Not sure why he would explore a hybrid.\n\nBecause a hybrid drivetrain is the only one that makes sense in a pickup truck. You can't refill a BEV in a few minutes on a road trip the way you can a hybrid.",

See [this table](http://blog.ucsusa.org/wp-content/uploads/Hallstrom-2015-Table-1.png) from [this review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652614012931).\n\nCutting out beef and lamb is like driving an electric car, and going vegan is like riding a bike instead of driving. Riding a bike is better for the planet but an electric car might be a more practical option to suggest to the public.",

"comment": "Yeah they are available right away, they are the same technology (Lithium Ion), but they do not have a built-in inverter.  This makes them a much better choice to use with a solar system like SolarEdge, where the DC power from the panels can go straight into the batteries.  In a system like the Powerwall, you have to go DC-&gt;AC in the inverter, then AC-&gt;DC back into the battery (and a final DC-&gt;AC when you use the power, but all batteries have that at least once per cycle).  There is a small loss each time you do this.  It's not huge, but over 20 years it adds up to a lot of lost power.\n\nThe other issue is simply that Tesla is not doing well.  SolarCity got bought by Tesla to give it a boost in the arm, but their solar installs are down 50% from 6 months ago (Q2 2017 to Q4 2017).  That's NOT good news.\n\nThere's a lot of people offering batteries out there, the two we use are the LG Chems, and the Phazr system from JLM - they work, for lack of a better comparison, kind of like an Enphase inverter for batteries.  Between those, we have can handle most customer requirements.",

However, the deaths involved in hunting are instrumental to the process and cannot be reduced.\n\nA system with room and capability to improve is better than a system which is inherently flawed without any chance of improvement.\n\nThis is the same issue with electric vs. gas powered cars;  Some people might naysay electric cars since the electricity that powers them often comes from coal factories.  But by switching to electric cars, we open the possibility for solar/wind/water power to be used instead of gas or coal in the future.\n\nEven if it's a small step backwards or lateral at the moment, it comes with the promise of improvement down the line, and as such, is the most reasonable course of action.",

It is much shorter than a Model S - length wise, it is between a Model S and the Model 3, but based on interior room, it is smaller than a Model 3.\n\nThe base Taycan probably does compete against the discontinued Model 3 LR RWD for about double the price. However, given the price difference, one might as well compare the Model 3 Performance against all Taycan variants.",

Most of the hydrogen produced today isn't used for transportation industry. A lot of the hydrogen produced today is mostly a byproduct from fraking rather than a primary product.\n\nThe difference is we need to install quadruple the energy to create hydrogen as to go electric.  It will always be a dirtier fuel.  BEVs serve us much better in applications where energy density isn't as crucial.",

It'll take more than a decade until the global EV market will reach anything close 50%. Tesla will be fine as long as they manage to to build competitive cars in the future and to control their service issues. Especially the latter will become more and more important as soon as there's actual competition.",

When electric chargers are fast enough for that to be an option, usage of electric chargers will mirror that of gas pumps.\n\n&gt;I've already seen some complaints on Tesla forums about charging times becoming too short. Sometimes it's not long enough to go have a meal and make it back to the car before the idle fees kick in.\n\nThat's because charging times are still too long. if they were 15 minutes, people would just wait.\n\n&gt; First, a lot of people can charge at home. That means when they are traveling away from home is the only time they need to even think about charging speed.\n\nThat just means we'll need less charging stations in the city. They'll all be freeway adjacent. \n\nPeople driving on gas don't plan their trip around gas stations because there are enough on the way and the fill times are fast enough that they can just get gas when they need it. That's the future for electric charging.\n\nThis transition period where you have to plan your trip around charging stations where you need to stop for an hour will pass.",

"comment": "Regardless as to whether it actually makes sense or not, there are a lot of reasons why someone would still be anti EV. There are alot of people view electric vehicles as less convenient and worse than internal combustion cars still. And while we know in many cases this is not true there still are a lot of cases where it is. Extreme cold or extreme hot climates are not great for electric vehicles still in 2019. Hopefully the technology is going to the develop to a point where this is not an issue. Charging infrastructure for non Tesla electric vehicles is still not great, especially in rural areas where people have to drive very long distances. the other large problem is that electric vehicles have become a political issue which I think is just terrible. Politics in 2019 are not governed by reason but more by emotion and identity. if you identify with one side or the other you basically become part of that \"team\". You have to support with the team wants. It doesn't matter who's right or wrong it's more about how you identify yourself.",

Just being in a Chevy dealer was like an out of body experience, no one in my family and friends has had a GM product for 40 years. But the Spark EV was such a great car that when the lease was over I purchased a new Spark EV to replace it. \n\nWhen we decided to replace our Honda Fit GM absolutely should have sold us a Bolt: we are committed to electric driving, we love small hatchbacks, and our two Spark EVs have been stellar. And yet -- GM's palpable lack of interest in if not contempt for the Bolt and the poor DC charging experiences we had with the Spark EV (ICEd, broken, in a closed Kia dealer lot, one outlet with an Uber on it, etc) made us wary. The Bolt is sort of expensive for basically an electric Sonic.  We ended up with a Model 3. I still love small hatches, hopefully someone serious will make a good electric hatch.",

Examples abound of these systems in cities.\n\nI have personally only ever seen systems like this where the tram tracks are completely separate from the road. Are there electric trams that share overhead space with cars? If so, I'm a lot more confident that the safety issues with that are a solved problem.\n\n&gt; But I bet it's better than an ICE rebuild and the pollution that it that engine emitting.\n\nI am *not in any way* arguing for the continuation of the status quo with ICE trucks. I'm saying that we don't know if overhead power lines for EV trucks are going to be better than just EV trucks with bigger batteries.\n\n&gt; Cost is not zero. But what's the alternative? \n\nBEV trucks with big enough batteries and fast enough fast-charging to do long haul by themselves. With the way battery tech and charging tech are improving year by year, this is absolutely on the horizon, if not already possible.",

The ranking of 2 to 3 year old passenger cars includes 128 vehicle models.\n&gt; \n&gt; The four e-cars considered are not yet included in the TÜV report because they have only been sold in significant numbers in Germany for a few years. The data is based on 1142 main inspections of the BMW i3, 1939 of the Renault Zoe, 1645 of the Smart Fortwo Electric Drive and 812 of the Tesla Model S. On this basis, a preliminary assessment of the technical safety of the respective vehicle models is possible.",

But also don't be speeding and trying to push cyclists ahead of you just coz you can hit 25mph.\n\nWhen you come to a stop at red, you're also stopping towards the right side to signal to everyone you are faster and demonstrate that by zipping off the line first on green, and no cyclist will have the chance to be an A-hole.\n\n25mph Road: \nAgain, make sure you got a scooter that can hit 25mph and that you are indeed on a road with a 25mph limit so that you can keep up with traffic and ride on the road like a car if you have to if it's safer. \n\nAnd dress to be visible for God's sake. Don't be racing in all black gear with a full face black helmet on a black scooter with no lights. You're not Batman. Wear a reflective jacket and a helmet with brake lights. Drivers will appreciate you for being able to see you from far and they will not be A-holes.\n\n35mph and above Road:\nYou are the A-hole if you're on a 20ish and below mph scooter here.\n\nI can't decide if those who are risking it at meat crayon speeds with their 30+ mph are A-holes, or not. \n\nApparently, some legitimately use these beasts as car replacements for long commutes to work so I can really fault a man for trying to earn a living.

Many solar retrofits are being installed on homes that are over 30 years old. \n\nLikewise no bonds or rate fees went into funding that solar project expansion unlike traditional power plants\n\nI'm all for a fair and balanced discussion on whether net metering at this point benefits that nonparticipant, because with solar at .2% of the national grid, The demand production benefits that's the way the reduced operating revenue, to the nonparticipant.\n\nOf course it does force power companies to adapt to changing technology...",

I don't know exactly what the output is of that panel.\n\nThe \"system size\" of their proposal is 5.89 kW (though that may change after they do the site survey) and the guaranteed production is at least 7,857 kWh the first year (ditto) with a tiny bit of degradation annually after that.\n\nTheir projection for price of electricity is $.11/kWh in terms of savings.\n\nWe used 3826 kWH last month and the bill was $383.\n\nHaven't gotten into what the attachments will look like and any of that stuff, nor did they mention how much sun the house gets (again that may come after the site inspection, but I didn't consider that).  There aren't any big trees near my roof, so I would assume that whatever sun the new orleans suburbs get typically would be what my roof gets.\n\nThanks for the questions.

"comment": "I know a lot of folks in /r/climateskeptics are very interested in the efficiency and performance of installed photovoltaics, and many of us recognize that Germany has \"lead the charge\" in the last few years by installing a large amount of PV.\n\nThere has been a large number of claims about how much electricity is actually generated by this huge installation of PV, and in my opinion, most of those claims are BS, on both sides.  Climate Alarmists, who would have us completely abandon all fossil fuels, point to Germany as the shining example of how to convert our global energy systems to something clean and pure, while Skeptics, or even \"Deniers\" often point to the cost and inefficiencies of renewables, and show that installed PV does not equal actual production.\n\nSo, here's a website that tracks and reports on a DAILY BASIS how much electricity is produced by PV, either on a total basis or on a percentage of installed capacity.  We can now used actual data to make our arguments, for or against.\n\nEnjoy!",

"comment": "Installing the solar panels is obviously cheaper (less than half the price). But there's no cost for the land used, and a non-trivial portion of the cost of electricity is the transmission infrastructure, and distributed generation significantly reduces the load on that infrastructure. There is significant potential for a grid built around distributed solar + storage providing the majority of residential electricity (with the utility primarily serving load distribution and reliability rather than retail electricity sales) to be cheaper than centralized utility scale generation within the next 10-20 years.\n\nedit: But of course this study ignores all of those factors, because it's a hack job funded by a conservative utility unable to cope with the idea of changing their business model to accommodate modern technology.",

"comment": "Two main module types are Polycrystalline and Mono-crystalline.  Mono- is black and comes in black on white and black on black (second color is a back ground color).   BoB is most expensive and all black but a bit less efficient, BoW is a bit more efficient.\nPolycrystalline is cheaper, blue to dark blue in color and cells are usually square (mono usually has rounded corners on cells).  Poly is almost as efficient as mono now (~17% vs ~18.5%).   \nThe efficiency is miss leading though, it is not power produced per dollar spent or life time.   It is power produced per area.   So a 5kW Poly system will produce about the same amount of power as a 5kW mono system on the same location.\nAs for Batteries, most PV systems do not have batteries.   Some do and are referred to as Hybrid or bimodal systems.   These cost more but have backup power capabilities.\nSunpower modules are certainly the most expensive.  Not sure why you would think they are the best quality.  They claim the best quality etc. but other vendors can meet the same warranty, efficiency etc. at a lower cost but sure they are the best quality; just ask them.\nNot sure you can avoid parts made in China.   Some modules are partially assembled in the US, some are made with parts made in the US but from some materials from over sea.   Does it matter?  There are some pretty high quality modules made in Korea, China, Japan, etc. \nFor inverter it will depend on your needs etc.   For general grid tie it is hard to beat SolarEdge inverter for warranty, module level optimizer and monitoring, and meeting rapid shutdown.  For Bimodal, Outback has some pretty nice solutions.",

"comment": "The space argument was true in the 19th century, but we've learned a thing or two about *why* the methods the cowboys used worked. and now we can replicate it on much smaller paddocks using some high-tech stuff, including electric fencing and small solar panels, neither of which grand pappy knew of. \n\nThe goal here is to produce maximum cow-days of grass per acre, and to have the cow eat most of that growth in a controlled manner. A cow-day is how much grass a 'standard cow' will eat in a day. How do you maximize cow-days/acre? You simulate the large roving herds of pre-human times by bunching up the cattle, and moving them frequently. You time the encounter with the cattle to ensure that you take advantage of the growth cycle of the grass (ever notice it grows much faster after you mow?)\n\nBy using these methods, densities hundreds of times higher than open grazing can be achieved. \n\nEdit: And regarding being undercut, well that's just how it's got to be. If we value carbon capture, we can put tariffs on industrial meat. Why is free trade so f-n holy if it's killing us? Meat is (and has always been) inherently more expensive than current prices suggest. You can think of current prices as an anomaly due to subsidies by cheap fossil energy.  We can afford to run diesel combines to harvest corn and grain to feed to cattle living in concentration pens. Such a notion would be pure insanity in any other time. As fossil energy becomes unaffordable and undesired to more people, we'll see more localized food again. \n\nChange is required, and we can either get in front of it and change what we can, or have it lead us where we don't want to go.",

"comment": "So, first off, you don't need any certification whatsoever to install solar panels.  You need to be hired by a company that installs them, and they will pay you to do that.  That being said, companies (generally), need someone on their staff that is NABCEP certified, to bid on government projects, larger scale projects, and generally just as peace of mind for potential customers.  The entry level certification does nothing really but show that you are interested in making a career in the solar industry.  It's a good first step.\n\nI was in the same boat as you, and I took classes here, http://www.solarenergy.org/.  I got all my classroom credits out of the way, so when I got the necessary experience under my belt, I was ready to take the NABCEP installer exam.  Hint: you cannot take the Installer Exam without at least some experience, aka, you need to show that you worked on legal, completed, commissioned projects, ( I think at least 5?) before you can become certified.  So even if you have all the class hours under your belt, you cannot take the exam without proven experience.  \n\nI was in the same boat as you, looking for a career change, and was always interested in solar.  It took me 2 years, from not knowing about anything solar, to where I am now, a NABCEP certified installer that now does most of the design work for a small solar company in Maryland.  I love what I do, and love the industry I'm in.\n\nBest of luck in your solar endeavors!",

"comment": "Keep in mind that you should recoup your investment earlier than you think since the system adds equity to your house for at least 25 years. \n\nFor example, lets say it costs you $5,000 to install the system. After 7 or 8 years, you will have saved about $2,000. But the equity it adds to your house could easily still be $3,000. If you add the equity value of the system and the savings, you will break even at 8 years even though you've only saved $2,000. So every dollar in savings is money in your pocket from the time forward. \n\nNot only that, but if electricity rates in your area increase faster than the panel efficiency decreases, then the value of the system could actually increase over time since the value of the system is dependent on A) How much money it saves off utility bill and B) The useful life of the system. If this happens, the residual value system could increase back up to $5,000 at some point, in which case you really broken even the day you turned it on if you're still living in the house for that long.\n\nMy biggest concern would be what happens if the utility increases net metering fees above what you'd be paying for the electricity if you didn't have solar.  Hopefully they wouldn't do that, but that's the ace in the hole that the utility companies hold. They can erase all savings from solar simply with fees and adjusting rate schedule.  But that's a risk every solar owner has to accept.",

"comment": "That seems pretty high. Like someone else mentioned here, thats over $6/watt. Sunpower has good panels, but the system seems a little off. I would shop around and see what else you can get. A full system warranty with a production guarantee compared to that is one way to go. My company tends to sell for $4.22/watt, so that definitely seems a little too expensive. \n\nIf you feel he may be pricing you high, and then offer it lower as a sales tactic, I would be very wary of that as the solar market is competitive enough already as it is, and the last thing you would want is for someone trying to play with a price to make it seem like \"a deal\" when they should be upfront in the first place.\n\nGood luck!",

"comment": "LG for solar panels, SolarEdge w/ power optimizers for inverter, and Quickmount PV for roof attachments.  Check with your utility to ask about their net metering policies since you'll be leaning on them to backfeed your excess energy generated during the day and you'll want to make sure they give you a full credit when you pull the energy back from the grid.  Your AHJ will tell you about their requirements for panel placement etc they'll also likely want electrical line drawings and possibly structural load calculations before issuing a permit.  South, West and East roof surfaces are your best bet, as you angle further toward the north you lose out on efficiency drastically.  Feel free to PM me if you have questions.",

It's really no different than anyone else spreading a dogma, when it comes with a subscription that \"you are a bad person if you don't adhere to my beliefs\". If anything I think it pushes people further away and more into their defensiveness when you phrase it that way.\n\nNot everyone wants to be this selfless, pious person. And I don't think shaming them is going to change that. Maybe appealing to their empathy, but shaming definitely triggers a defensive reaction, because that's the way humans are wired.\n\nSome people (myself included) genuinely believe that animals are not that important. I only agree with veganism to the point that it contributes to greenhouse gasses, but if they tomorrow decided to switch all their trucks to solar power, I really wouldn't care. I don't have nightmares about the cow when I eat a steak.\n\nTo make the point you're making, you have to ignore all of my personal preferences and super-impose yours above them. Do you really think that's an effective way to get someone to see your side?",

We pay 34c per kwh and they buy back at 17c per kwh. The money savings come in power that you don't pay for vs power that you're paid for.\n\nNot where I am they aren't. My two 12v 105Ah (I have a 24v system) is $575 for them both. I still want to take my house off grid or at least semi grid-tie as the grid would still charge the batteries if my panels aren't producing enough. It would be cheaper than a generator.\n\nAs I stated before, we pay 34c and they pay us 17c per kwh. It used to be 34 and 34 but they changed it and are planning on raising the cost of power again.",

"comment": "&gt;Also, install batteries that draw during the cheapest time and feed it back to the grid at the most expensive time. \n\nAgain, as long as you connect to the grid, the utility companies hold all the cards. For example, if the utility is forced to keep net metering, all they have to do is make peak rates no more than about 25-30% higher than off peak rates and the math for batteries no longer works.  Figure you're going to lose about 15% due to charging losses.  It's not worth the high capital expense to save 3-4 cents/kwh.....the system will never pay for itself.\n\nOr...net metering goes away and the utilities simply reduce what they to pay during peak hours.  If you want to buy electricity from the grid at 6:00 PM, they will charge you $0.35/kwh.  But if you're selling to the grid at that same time, they will only pay $0.04/kwh.  THAT is the inevitable future and there's nothing we can do to get around it.",

Their company is financially in ruins and their CEO is talking about how he wants to innovate and invest 20 mill. It's a straight up lie to try and save their asses from years of being overpriced. Wow, you can put out 360 watts to LG's 350's. Wow over 20 years you might produce 400 more kwh then other companies. How about invest in making your panels cheaper and fail less.\n\n\nEdit, more recent source. This has other manufacturers listed as well. The ones right below sunpower are out of business I'm pretty sure. And for everyone saying they have the lowest failure rate can I get a source?\n\nhttp://sinovoltaics.com/solar-panel-manufacturers/altman-z-score-q2-2017/",

"comment": "Am I? Are you? Chill, bro, just chill. Also newsflash: EVs won't save the climate. Do you honestly believe that those billions upon billions of tons of oil won't be used anymore? They will just sell it for cheaper. It's a natural resource and it will get used. Like Saudi Arabia is just going to sit on that oil that is their only income? Like Norway is going to just not use 50 % of their exports anymore? Fossil fuels and their CO2 will go away when they have been drilled completely. EVs can make you feel better and think that you are helping climate (which you do) but they don't change the overall CO2 emissions. If they can't sell the oil they will literally just burn it to create something else. Like electricity, because it's cheaper to burn what you already have than to create solar arrays.\nEven with all the renewable energies over the past decade overall CO2 emissions have only ever gone up. Because more people reach the standards to be able to afford cars and such. If you want to stop CO2 emissions you have to kill 2 billion people. Otherwise they will continue to rise and EVs will just slow down the rise.\n\nDo you think that in an up and coming country with an average annual salary of $15.000 EVs will be a thing in the next 20 years? They are just starting to buy cars. They will buy cheap cars from western countries, probably those that we get rid of to buy an EV. And big oil will keep selling their product, not to us, but now to them. And trust me, the one billion that pollute today won't matter much when the next two billion are starting to pollute. Even if we all went EV, that would still be double the pollution of today, just due to population growth and higher standards of living.",

"comment": "I think in most cases where utilities have fought against net metering, such as Arizona, the motivation is primarily financial. However, in Hawaii, rooftop solar has grown so rapidly that it seems there is a legitimate issue with grid integration - there are times when the grid is oversupplied with electricity. Net metering is currently closed in Hawaii. \n\nI believe there are several utility scale solar+storage (batteries) projects underway in Hawaii, and the local utility is incentivizing solar homeowners to include battery storage.",

"comment": "It depends on what you define as \"decent\".  For example, if your home consumed 30 kWh for a given day, and your solar happened to generate 50 kWh for a given day, where your home used 100% of your solar power and you exported 20 kWh back to your grid for credits - then - to a degree - who cares if your inverter peaked.  Your solar provided for your needs and then some.  I would consider that decent :)  kWp percentage is just part of the story.  That is why properly sizing is so important relative to your goals with regards to solar.\n\nWith that being said, I installed mine the beginning of June.  I actually had higher kWh days in June than I have had in July thus far.  As others have said, it is about temperature right now stealing some of those watts from the panels.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, you need to consider location.  Comparing a solar array in New York to a panel in Texas (same azimuth, size, pitch, equipment), while the arrays may be identical, weather, temperature, sun hours, etc for each location are going to be different and hence will result in a comparison that can't really be made.\n\nA better question might be \"I'm in upper Michigan, what kWp percentages are typical for my area?\"  PVOut can help put some context where you can put in a postal code and see what folks in your general area are producing.  That might yield a more apples to apples comparison.",

If it is still a leased system, you'd have to look at your lease agreement to determine what modifications you can make. For batteries: You can add any AC-Coupled battery system including the Powerwall. Enphase has the Ensemble system which would keep all your hardware under one mfg. This will make it easier to service in the long run. Sonnen, OutBack, Schneider, SimpliPhi, Generac all make great AC-Coupled battery systems. I think it will come down to getting some quotes from local installers to learn what they are most experienced installing.",

That's the ratio of the capacity of the solar array to the capacity of the inverter (or micro-inverters).\n\nIt's typical for systems to have an ILR larger than one.\n\nI'm going to make a guess. If your app is believes that your inverters are only capable of producing 4.38 kW (max) than your ILR is, 5.5/4.38 = 1.26\n\n1.26 is at the upper end of the ILR that a typical residential system will be designed to have.\n\nOpinions vary about what the best ILR should be. I'd suggest an ILR close to or equal to 1.0 if your system has good weather conditions, good orientation, and little or no shading.",

"comment": "Not emitting or taking out the same amount you emit is exactly equivalent.\nActually if you produce fuel from air co2 and later burn it, there is a timeframe in which it is not in the atmosphere anymore, so on the large scale this \"credit\" makes the all system kinda negative.\n\nTake a tree for instance. A tree basically stores co2 during its life storing it in its trunk, branches and leaves. then it dies, it rots and gives it back to the atmosphere. oversimplificating a bit, also trees are carbon neutral.\n\nAnother thing that should be taken into account is how the energy used to extract co2 from the atmosphere and produce fuel was produced. Extracting co2 is a very energy intense process and no form of energy is completely clean. Solar panels, hydro plants etc have to be produced and dismantled at the end of their life, and in most cases some sort of pollution is involved.\n\nSo it's not really possible to assert a fuel is carbon neutral if all the energy involved to produce it was not completely green. Or they should also extract co2 to compensate for the energy used to extract co2, in a weird endless circle that I'm not sure will ever end.",

"comment": "Funny you should ask!\n\nI've been mentally stewing about how to deal with excess current if you were to combine a generator and a solar array.  (sans battery)  Obviously you don't want to start backfeeding the generator, which is not designed to SINK current.  Let the magic smoke out!\n\nThe generator cant run any slower than idle speed.\n\nThe first idea I came up with is a set of 3 electric hot water heaters.   Two elements each.\n\nAs load decreases, and voltage rises, (110, 115, 120, ....) the heating elements, in turn, get switched on.  Turn electricity into hot water.   When the last and final element gets switched on, so does the cold water tap --- and hot water drains in the yard, garden, down the sewer or whatever.\n\nMy latest thought is about Net-Zero inverters, used in Australia, Hawaii, etc.  Above a certain voltage the panels simply go open circuit and you feed NOTHING into the grid.   No reason you couldn't do that.\n\nYour idea about refrigerator or AC system... perhaps in a house, have the system turn DOWN the thermostat a couple degrees whenever you've got current to burn.... run the chest freezer down to -20 instead of 0....   or hell, air condition the attic, garage.... no different than making hot water.\n\nNow add automatic generator stop/start features and...\n\nYou and me, bruddah, we got some design work to do, a product to create, and a company to start, because ALL of California wants a genset / solar combination that stays up when the grid goes down.  And you correctly identified the key issue ---\n\nTake a look at this:\n\n[https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/pv-inverter/the-solaredge-energy-hub](https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/pv-inverter/the-solaredge-energy-hub)\n\nI need to go back and review its features myself....\n\nWade Nelson",

This process will largely depend on where you want to interconnect. Since your size is relatively small for solar, you will mainly have to deal mainly with your utility. Most companies who have commercial solar hire a solar developer to develop their project. As you have to first do an interconnection study. In this case most likely the utility would do it, but you would have to pay them for it. In addition, you will have to meet very specific requirements from the utility.",

Sunlight carries energy based on how bright it is, essentially, and how much of it you collect. The more power you need, the more sunlight you need to collect. A few square centimeters can power a calculator, but will not make a noticeable difference in an EV's battery charge. This is why solar panels on cars aren't common; a car's roof is so small that you would need to leave it in the sun for hours just to go a few miles. So if you're willing to fill up half a football field with solar panels in order to power one fast charger that is reduced to a slow charger when it's overcast or near dawn or dusk (and has no power output at night), go for it.",

But let’s go with there $20 or $240 per year which is about $5,000 in 20 years.  It’s hard to say how much your power is going to go up in 20 years but I suspect not much.  If you took the money you were to spend on your solar system and put it in conservative stocks in 20 years you will say around $20,000 or four times as much money.  The cost of your power is so low it’s going to take you 15-20 years for the system to pay for itself.  No if you were in California where our rates are $0.62 kWhr the system will pay for itself in 5 years.\n\nThe amount of money you MIGHT save is just to little to even consider it.  If I were you, I would wait on solar.  If in 5 years from now they increase your rate to $0.25 kWhr, then I would consider doing solar then.  If you wait, the cost of solar panels keeps decreasing and their efficiency increases.  The panels being sold 4 years ago produce half as mush power as the ones today.  Waiting does have it’s advantages.",

"comment": "Technically solar thermal can collect more if the sun's energy hitting it, but it also loses more of it too: whilst solar thermal panels are sitting out in the cold losing energy, solar PV works *better* when it's cold! And you can run a simple electrical wire (also loves the cold) to wherever you keep your water, massively insulated inside your living space. Any heat lost here just warms your home.\n\nWith thermal you're pumping your precious hot liquid outside into the coldest place. Yes, it collects more, but at what price?\n\nThe very next sentence in the article you quoted and linked to:\n\n&gt; Technicalities aside, however, photovoltaic systems are the better choice for the vast majority of consumers—and for the environment. That’s because some of the energy used to heat the water goes to waste as it cools off in your basement, and because you can share electricity (but not hot water) with your neighbors.",

"comment": "Your CPA can be turning a blind eye, and that's fine.  If I showed my tax pro a $500 receipt to a local charity that I attend their gala every year, they may or may not ask me if it was a blanket donation or a gala; even if I was audited, the IRS may not ask; but the law is the law, the charity pays $80 per person for dinner, so I can only deduct $340.  \n\nOtherwise what is to stop a solar installer from including anything they want and just showing a receipt for \"solar\".  Tree cutting? New roof? A pool heater? An EV (well, it runs off the solar panels, so it's related)?  Where would it end?  The law is clear that it's only for the panels, labor, and necessary components to make the panels operate; and every clarifying FAQ says that financing and origination costs are not part of the ITC.  \n\nI file my taxes to be compliant with the law, just not what my tax pro or the IRS may or may not catch.",

This credit is also non-refundable, but, unlike the EV tax credit, **it can be carried forward indefinitely** to offset future federal tax liabilities if a client doesn’t have a high enough tax bill to cover the full amount of the credit in a given year.\n\nYou should also note that the writer cited the specific IRC Code, while your source did not nor is there any evidence the authors for your citation even read the law. Additionally, your source was written by two people who have no background in tax or law for a website not focused on tax or law.\n\nMoreover, if you read the actual law, [26 USC Section 25D](https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/25D), or all of the various IRS documents nicely complied on the right side of that webpage, you won't find a single mention of any so-called 5-year limit.  If you read the [instructions to form 5695](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5695.pdf), there is no mention of any so-called 5-year limit.\n\n[IRS Notice 2013-70, A-3](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-70.pdf#page=3) and [IRS FS-2022-40, pages 7-8](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2022-40.pdf#page=7), both discuss the carryforward, but do not mention any so-called limit that you claim exists.\n\nConversely, if you read [26 USC Section 23](https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/23) regarding the adoption expenses tax credit, subsection (c) does mention a 5-year carryforward limit.  Naturally, [page 7 of the form 8839 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8839.pdf#page=7) has a carryforward worksheet\n\nIf a 5-year carryforward limit for IRC section 25D actually exists, how do you reconcile the fact that such a limit isn't mentioned in form 5695, the corresponding instructions, or any IRS document?",

These are just material and labour costs. Regulations and marketing are not taken into account.\n\nIf mass produced, it will cost us5000 just like the Velomobiles but demand for Velomobiles is still low, all of them cost around us 10,000 because they need to be custom built, similarly for the Velomobile electric motorcycle.",

Extremely happy with the install, and after support, will use them again for additional panels and battery when the 25kW rules actually get finalized. Did not want to jeopardize my 1:1 net metering, so have 10.1kW system. In the NW suburbs. My $/kW rating was similar to this.

"comment": "This might be off. But for me, with an annual $5k+ electric bill each year and spending $35k (cash, I expect when some CDs mature) on solar to cover all or almost all of my bill. I calculated solar interest: 10 years with $5k dep each to = $71,467, and at 20 years with that continuing $5k dep to = $180,937. My return on solar would be $131,000. It seems to be a better investment than the stock market or a CD. Stocks say they average (a tricky word) 10% annually. True. However, the average person's actual earnings in mutual funds or stocks are less than 3% annually. No one tells you this.\n\nI'm assuming around 5% on my deposits over that 10 to 20-year period, and I'm getting more than that now. The electric rate where I live keeps going up, which will make this an even better investment.\n\nMy singular problem is how much of a hassle (I'm a busy guy, and I despise bullshit) it is to have solar installed and who to trust with it. I live in Connecticut, where there is presently NO net metering. I call my local power company, ForeverSucks--as they constantly suck people and the economy dry by strongarming the government to make bad laws for us and the environment.\n\nThose are my humble thoughts. YMMV.",

"comment": "This happened only a couple of days ago, in a local restaurant here in Novi Sad, Serbia. \n\nSo we went out of the office for lunch, and went to this really old place, (established in 1880) where we usually drink. Anyway, I saw they have vegan meals, so I ordered one from their menu. The waiter then basically harassed me for even looking at the vegan options, saying that they don't serve them. Having a bit of patience left in me (and not wanting to have to get up and change restaurants), I asked if I could maybe get a soup, or anything else basically without meat. The genius waiter told me that I can't order anything like that,  because everything “seasoned”, to which I replied “With what? Meat?”. He answered “Yes”.",

I didn't want to pressurise him or force him, but at the same time it was harder and harder to respect him or even feel attracted to him when he ate meat or dairy. I'd always done the cooking &amp; shopping, so our house went vegan when I did, but we eat out &amp; order in a lot so he was still eating animals almost every day (lunch at work he'd get steak pies etc). \n\nHe followed the debates I was having with friends, family &amp; online strangers and started agreeing more and more with it, which oddly enough frustrated me even more - I was grossed out and disappointed whenever he chose to eat meat. At the same time, I was trying so hard not to let it become a major issue. It really was how I imagine it must be for people of different religions, or an atheist and a religious person living together. I always admired his intellect, and just couldn't get why he wasn't \"getting it\" and when it looked like he was \"getting it\" I couldnt understand why his behaviour wasn't aligned...\n\nEventually we watched Earthlings together, and I think it was the final nail - he'd accepted all the arguments before then, he just hadn't \"made the connection\". He's been vegan ever since. \n\nAwesome for us! yay!\n\nBut I don't know if that story helps you at all - you don't want to push your boyfriend - it won't be good for your relationship, and I'm not sure its good for veganism (I fear those who adopt veganism for their SO are the most likely to \"cheat\" by eating meat/cheese etc when their SO isn't aroung, and generally perpetuate myths about veganism being hard or unsustainable as a long-term diet etc).",

Since I don't gain anything from it, why should I hurt (or have hurt) the animals involved?\n\nMy secondary reasons are health, environment, and population concerns. Aside from ethics, these bring me to a mostly vegan lifestyle.\n\nMy rationale is the same as is documented elsewhere on pro-vegan websites.",

I went in during a grand opening and seemed to be an impromptu vegan focus group as they asked me a few questions, as in do you expect it to come with guacamole like the veggie burrito does now? I told them no as it doesn't come with any of the \"meat\" fillings and is extra. They struggled with the fact that most of the their Gardein based customers expected them to include it. In addition I found out that while they didn't charge the most for it, the Gardein was the most expensive item cost wise on their menu.",

You go vegan to prevent animal deaths, you don't go into it for the difficulty of eating out. My morals don't take 'well will this make dining out difficult?' into consideration. It shouldn't frustrate you when someone does what feels right to them just because it might be harder on THEM. It also makes it sound like you don't support her, which would be a deal breaker for me, I need to know my partner isn't bothered by my lifestyle even if they don't follow the same one.\n\nAlso, this is NOTHING compared to the frustration you feel as a vegan being unable to eat with other people. It can feel very isolating and embarrassing. Sometimes my boyfriend gets annoyed when a restaurant has nothing I can eat and I'm getting flustered, but I guarantee his annoyance is nothing compared to mine at that moment, and his frustration only makes me more upset with the situation because I become embarrassed.",

"comment": "Obviously McDonald's as a corporation is not vegan friendly, but I think that they are even *trying* a vegan option is a huge milestone.\n\nIf you only view them as a greedy corporation then you must realize that they are probably losing money by providing a vegan option rather than something they know they will sell. That menu space, advertising budget, and other supplies (packaging, condiments, etc.) could be used towards something they *know* will sell. But instead they decided to take a risk (or most likely a calculated move) and provide something completely different.\n\nRegardless though, if it becomes popular then maybe they offer something else that is vegan, and then maybe something else, and eventually they have to remove their loss popular items from their menu to make room. It would be a very gradual change but a change in the right direction.",

"comment": "*Animal* agriculture has more of a detrimental effect on the environment than non-animal agriculture. Here's how animal agriculture negatively affects the environment:\n\n* [Animal agriculture's impact on climate change](https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/animal-agricultures-impact-on-climate-change/): The average American diet, beef consumption creates 1,984 pounds of CO2e annually. Replacing beef with plants would reduce that figure 96 percent, bringing it down to just 73 pounds of CO2e.\n* [Here's How America Uses Its Land](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/): Agriculture takes up about a fifth of the country's land, with most of that land being used for pasture/range, livestock feed crops and corn crop for ethanol production.\n* [Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock](http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3437e/i3437e00.htm): 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions, or 7.1 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, can be attributed to the livestock sector annually\n\nAs for the renewable cycle you asked about, more CO2 is being added to the atmosphere than it being taken out. For example, the forests that would usually absorb the CO2 and produce oxygen are being cut down and cleared to raise methane-producing livestock like cattle. [These forests are not being replaced](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/this-is-how-animal-agriculture-causes-deforestation/) at the same rate they are being cleared.",

[It's actually illegal to advertise eggs as a healthy food.](https://nutritionfacts.org/2015/03/26/peeks-behind-the-egg-industry-curtain/) Anyone who eats eggs *is* lining their arteries and endothelium with cholesterol. This isn't a problem of old age, it isn't something that takes years to develop (although it doesn't take years to manifest true symptoms), it's something that happens just after you eat something with dietary cholesterol in it. This is why we're able to see very young children, in *grade school*, with fatty streaks on their hearts. No amount of eggs is really healthy, but a small enough amount mitigated by an otherwise all WFPB diet will mitigate eggs. That doesn't make them healthy just like smoking one single cigarette once or twice a week and living an otherwise healthy lifestyle may protect you from emphysema, but it's stll fair to say cigarettes are very bad. Plus, it's unethical, but I know you already know that, I'm preaching to the choir, but its best not to concede false information to people doing the wrong thing, believing the wrong thing, etc. (Like ovo-vegetarians)",

"comment": "it shows just how inseparable animal products are from our culture. Even super progressive friends I have cringe at the idea of veganism, and you can see the mental gymnastics going on when they try to rationalize it. Politics and religion are topics you might apathetically adhere to as a child, then as an adult you have a chance to solidify and really choose those beliefs. But veganism in a way is trying to undo a habit that's been ingrained into us from all sides of culture. I mean we all drank milk with every school lunch, like wtf? Divorcing yourself from that I think is actually harder than leaving a belief system in most cases. Just all the more reason we have to stay level-headed, compassionate, and persistent.",

Also it’s not a comparison to slavery, lol, it is slavery (again, slavery used to refer to the concept of slavery, not as a shorthand for the transatlantic slave trade).",

I'd say we should defer to scientific consensus of organisations and people that do actually understand it, you were saying that you use your feelings.\n\nWell you don't have to eat meat substitutes, I haven't eaten any in a year. Those are just for people that like the taste of them they're not meant to be health foods. \n\nI brought up the case of animals being given B12 supplements because that's where farm animals get it from. Animals don't produce B12 they get it from bacteria, which is the same place that vegans get it from.\n\nWestern diets have more meat in them than non-western diets. If you look at places like Asia and Africa their carb intakes are way higher.\n\nParasites and bacteria do feed on meat? Meat rots way faster than plants and are much more likely to transfer diseases to you.\nFibre has the most satiety to calorie ratio, meat is terrible for satiety since its volume is very low compared to its calories.",

Sure, it's nice to have a dog, to walk it and pet it, which clearly prevents many people from actually considering this seriously (well, that and OP being a knob in the comments), but isn't that kinda like all the people who refuse to engage with veganism because \"bacon taste good and it's all I know\"?\n\nI think we can all agree that dog breeders are definitely a no-no, since they use dogs for profit while contributing to further inbreeding and the problems it causes. Adopting shelter dogs seems a lot better, because they're already born and need help, but isn't that the same \"what would you do with all the cows\" argument that carnists use?\n\nPets wreak havoc on our environment, too - unleashed dogs in parks and forests disturb and drive away the native wildlife, while outdoor cats just casually hunt down any creature smaller than themselves, and each one can be responsible for thousands of dead birds and mammals per year.\n\nIt's definitely a more radical viewpoint than most, but I'd love to see some actual serious discussion on this, because it's something that I too have though a lot about.",

"comment": "Disneyworld is pretty well covered by other commenters, but *[here is a guide to vegan options at Universal Studios.](http://www.happiestwhenexploring.com/usa/vegan-universal-studios-orlando/)*  Not sure how your trip is going to be structured, but I'd say it definitely wouldn't hurt to bring your own snacks, especially if you're going to be with a group that isn't willing to go out of their way should the nearest eatery not have vegan options.  Seems like with both parks, it's hit or miss depending on the eatery.  Best of luck, and I hope you enjoy your vacation even if it turns out to be a scavenger hunt for vegan food!",

"comment": "I see white sugar as a fringe issue, to which there are multiple valid vegan perspective.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nIs keeping previously purchased leather/wool product is vegan? Yes, you weren’t vegan when you bought it and to buy a replacement now would use up more of earth’s resources. No, those items should be thrown away because when we wear those items, it shows that we condone animal abuse for fashion. \n\nIs palm oil vegan? Yes, it does not contain animal products. No, it’s production damages the habitat of orangutans, which are endangered, and therefore not vegan. \n\nIs owning a cat vegan? Yes, the excessive amount of cats is a human problem and requires us to step in and care for these creatures we’ve created. No, to own a cat, you must by meat-based cat food and therefore support animal agriculture.\n\nIs eating meat out of the trash vegan? Yes, we are not contributing to the demand for meat, only eating what was already discarded, and therefore not buying additional food, which does have an environmental cost.  No, vegans don’t see animals as food, and wouldn’t eat meat anymore than they would eat a shoe or a pencil. \n\n\nIs white sugar vegan? Yes, it is not an animal body part product or secretion. No, animal bones were used in its production.\n\nThere are so many of these fringe issues to which there are multiple valid answers.  Every vegan will have a variety of yes/no responses to the above questions. I think we can all just agree on abstaining from using animals as objects to be eaten, worn, tested on, or entertained by.",

I'm going to proceed seriously.\n\nSo you made an argument for why OP's children should eat meat. That argument was then repeated replacing \"eating meat\" with \"dog fighting.\"\n\nAt this point, you have three options:\n\n1. Withdraw your argument.\n2. State that you do believe dog fighting is ethical.\n3. Explain why eating meat and dog fighting are different with respect to your argument.\n\nYou seem to have taken 3, and your argument was \"humans are omnivores.\" However, unless omnivores can't enjoy dog fighting, you haven't actually succeeded in taking approach 3.\n\nOmnivorous species *can* eat meat and they *can* enjoy dog fighting. Vegans choose to do neither.",
