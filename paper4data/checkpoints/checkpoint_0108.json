Maybe if you live on the west coast otherwise it is very unlikely that there would be any chargers that would be useful.

Thus, anything other than a Model S would have longer charge times and occupy that charger for longer periods of time.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001370692189084366,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1051399021691168,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.04427792628606161,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04640547807017962,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27251493056440573,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2540180062167639,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10467456378743616,"ev_1":-8.884471996376912e-05,"ev_2":-0.00030885759527639795,"ev_3":-0.0003123585678016146,"ev_4":-0.00048548111226409674,"ev_5":-0.0003063322607583056,"ev_6":-0.0005567209445871413},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

It's OK for the first model year of a brand new &lt;$30K vehicle to not have every bell and whistle of a $135K Model S P100DL.\n\n&gt; Tesla has offered others to adopt their standard and use their infrastructure but none have opted to accept their invitation\n\nYou say this like they were handing out candy and nobody wanted to take it. What they \"offered\" was a Tesla tax on the entire automotive market. It was a royalty on the sale of every non-Tesla EV in exchange for access to their chargers. \n\nOf course nobody took that deal. The end goal, and if you really care about EVs and not just Tesla you should agree, is for every car to be able to charge at every charger, as easy as getting gas. Not for Toyota cars to fuel up at Toyota gas stations, and Honda cars fuel up at Honda gas stations, and Ford trucks fuel up at Ford gas stations.\n\nJ1772 was standardized years before Tesla the company was formed. They pulled an Apple and spurred the standard charging cable in favor of a proprietary one, then tried to use that as an additional revenue source by licensing it to other companies, who weren't interested. That's all that happened.\n\n&gt; Not the least important, nobody is talking of building hundreds of thousands, let alone millions of electric cars besides Tesla\n\nSure they are. Mostly as hybrids. Because that's what people are buying. The demand for EVs at what it costs to build them today isn't there yet, and you don't just build millions of cars nobody wants to buy. \n\n&gt; I'm not convinced.\n\nI'm not convinced you have any interest in this conversation beyond justifying your infatuation with Tesla to yourself.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00013071914145257324,"1.1.1_stance":-0.03190215397905831,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.032656829338520765,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.024959630022446316,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22236099218328795,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.09657384703207939,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.020296974849770777,"ev_1":-0.004732963893426738,"ev_2":-0.0013801803603807155,"ev_3":-0.0003310145693831146,"ev_4":-0.0842880867421627,"ev_5":-0.0003740098230385532,"ev_6":-0.0023364162091941885},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.","1.3.3_second_order":"none.","ev_1":"NO.","ev_2":"NO.","ev_3":"NO.","ev_4":"NO.","ev_5":"NO.","ev_6":"NO."},"year":2016},{"comment_index":21719,"comment":"Is Model 3 more practical?

Yet you're at the same time assuming the cost of electricity will rise, despite /u/SCW--'s stated intention of getting solar panels and effectively fixing his cost of electricity for 30+ years.\n\nRequiring a battery replacement at only 7 years is very unlikely for the Model 3. Tesla battery degradation has been very slow: [\"After 100,000 miles, the typical Model S is projected to retain about 92 percent of its battery capacity and range.\"](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096801_tesla-model-s-battery-life-how-much-range-loss-for-electric-car-over-time) Typically ~70% capacity is a threshold at which owners will want to replace the pack, but that's completely at the whim of the owner. While I couldn't tolerate &lt;70% capacity in my Leaf, since a Tesla has so much more range to start the car will still be quite usable even with 50% capacity or less.\n\n&gt;Servicing is probably more.\n\nOn what basis? Aside from tires and creature comforts like A/C, EVs require almost none of the maintenance that goes along with ICE cars. With 2 EVs over a combined 8 years of use I've had no maintenance to do except for 1 set of new tires and several tire rotations, and a couple cabin air filters.\n\n&gt;less resale value\n\nAgain on what basis? Tesla resale values have held up quite well. Some reports suggesting poor resale values for EVs in general are disingenuous, as they measure resale value against the posted sticker price for new cars rather than the effective transaction price after the effect of subsidies. My Leaf's sticker price in 2011 was $34k, but I actually paid $22k after federal and state incentives. So if you compare against MSRP, on paper the Leaf resale value fell 35% the day I bought it. I guess that would make a great headline for an anti-EV troll, but nobody's going to make a buying decision based off of such nonsense.\n\n&gt;Lack of charging sites.\n\nHave you not heard of Superchargers? And with an EV your house is the charging site you use at least 90% of the time.

Other undesirable behavior (burning fossil fuels) is taxed. \n\nOtherwise you could say not smoking is subsidized, since smoking is taxed and not smoking isn’t. The reality is much simpler. As undesirable behavior is taxed further, the degree with which it occurs declines. This may be buying an electric vehicle, using public transport, using an electric bicycle or a regular bicycle etc. None of those activities are subsidized at all.\n\nThe US could reach 100% EV marketshare in 15 years if we increased sales taxes on gas cars 2.5% a year. It would cost 0 dollars to do this, and in fact would generate a lot of money.\n\nSubsidies distort markets much more than taxes, but are useful when marketshare for a competing technology is very low (aka electric vehicle subsidies made a ton of sense at 1% marketshare, because 99 gas cars could easily pay an extra 70 bucks in taxes to subsidize EV development). Still might make sense at 10%, at 700, but really you’re better off taxing gas cars more and leaving electric cars untaxed. Distorts the market less. You don’t have ultra cheap EVs being bought as second cars to get groceries from the corner store because they’re so darn cheap etc. \n\nIdeally America eliminates electric car subsidies and starts taxing gasoline cars appropriately. Best approach would be actually a carbon tax for the anticipated emissions of the car over 15 years of usage included up-front in the price of the vehicle. EVs maybe pay every 3 years depending on local power emissions of the registered state.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003233330013851325,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2398351102860708,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22390458477383324,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3011989486335649,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3276773101557228,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16088765862815227,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3046386227530699,"ev_1":-0.136171040621954,"ev_2":-0.04948480873038837,"ev_3":-0.013192781190203581,"ev_4":-0.03325760583902593,"ev_5":-0.0024241568959647943,"ev_6":-0.018916247923698393},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Pretty sure Tesla has only spent about $0.5-1bn on chargers total, thats nothing for VW and others. These other companies need to figure out how Tesla does it so much more efficiently and copy them because the supercharger network is still a massive selling point and having 2 identical cars side by side but the Tesla branded one was $1k more id still go with that one since I can drive anywhere long distance and not worry.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.009629825130105019,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19656912434400375,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1929868354397983,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2136771637775373,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31492130596266826,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22457807596304935,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05965818651020527,"ev_1":-0.256847698452475,"ev_2":-0.22510449899541426,"ev_3":-0.19549995073854612,"ev_4":-0.14717945973063037,"ev_5":-0.029262637486681342,"ev_6":-0.29836613359502995},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options for Tesla, against for other companies (Electrify America and Ionity) in terms of pricing and efficiency.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

(This is probably a tiny percentage)\n\n\nIf you believe that the burning of fossil fuels contributes to the warming of the planet through a CO2 greenhouse effect, then the use of solar power IN PLACE OF FOSSIL FUELS may reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (more solar power does not guarantee we will use less fossil fuels)\n\nThis is probably also a minute effect.\n\nThe biggest reduction might be the switch from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00044464699991901097,"1.1.1_stance":-0.050422936628137904,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.06842720943192641,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07854895169536273,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27773070761900054,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30135645959274127,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.016791352216387168,"solar_1":-0.024060904761427082,"solar_2":-0.16221616962044072,"solar_3":-0.0020483849554390567,"solar_4":-0.0020324991013088343,"solar_5":-0.009096241209893682,"solar_6":-0.00017420577326750694,"solar_7":-0.0007975466251082253,"solar_8":-0.00022134135906526353,"solar_9":-0.039301134427660145,"solar_10":-0.007173666612895128},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

Additionally if you can get the price down on the units and install them while installing a new roof maybe we can install on sides of the roof that don't work as well for solar modules. For instance I don't install solar on north facing sides at all because the price per watt doesn't make sense. However, if the pricing on the shingles was strong enough and I was installing them when I was redoing the roof then maybe I could install some on these west north west, east north east facing sides and it not hurt as much. I just need to see the math to better make that decision. If the math works out and I can use more roof space than with standard models, the efficiencies become less relevant.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005069003988561841,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3261447179118475,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14778464607314992,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.29060480873405936,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08169994135710112,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.09476222095781377,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2763826745407035,"solar_1":-0.2675370397636764,"solar_2":-0.03808054241380887,"solar_3":-0.22046188504221695,"solar_4":-0.13315598073533277,"solar_5":-0.03051733165193582,"solar_6":-0.003913458171155071,"solar_7":-0.0023288622905965894,"solar_8":-0.019168016387993703,"solar_9":-0.05555749961001055,"solar_10":-0.12384118205712487},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Should cover 100% of our annual electricity needs, with a little room to grow. The installer/permitter made a bunch of errors and recently discovered, after the array was on the roof (and working/looking amazing), that the array is too large for a standard residential install permit. We would need to get a MassACA cap allocation. The kicker is that a MassACA cap allocation is unavailable with our utility. (We specifically asked whether we would need it before anyone climbed onto our roof and were waived off, but that's a whole other story.)\n\nThe installer tells us our options are:\n\n1) Keep the system size as-is and register as a qualifying installation (and get net metering compensation at a wholesale rate rather than retail rate), and/or wait for the cap to be lifted and then apply for and get a net metering permit under the retail rate if available; or\n\n2) Yank two panels off to get under the residential size limit and qualify for the current, retail-rate net metering program.\n\n\nWholesale-rate net metering doesn't seem very attractive, from what I know.\n\nUnder Option 2, I understand that we may be able to drop the two panels back in later if the cap is lifted and we decide we want to (e.g., because retail-rate compensation is available).\n\nI did some research on the current legislative proposals in MA for net metering. Looks like the cap will be lifted, but there's an open question about whether solar producers will be compensated at the retail rate or wholesale rate, or whether only some customers will get the retail rate based on family income.\n\nI'm leaning toward Option 2 based on everything I know, with the possibility of putting those two panels back on and re-applying for net metering later if the economics of the expanded program are attractive.\n\nAnyone have recommendations?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012651906266304043,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2566956214635933,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2637072735547815,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2189982841537847,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27129976303240255,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2397831495581923,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07115252139919903,"solar_1":-0.19474181557352369,"solar_2":-0.28505611802141895,"solar_3":-0.23655460405226827,"solar_4":-0.16318072201494585,"solar_5":-0.22246031010463097,"solar_6":-0.24600390549571283,"solar_7":-0.04806264633953106,"solar_8":-0.06744581764963596,"solar_9":-0.18884469886079813,"solar_10":-0.2513340660482923},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

If we blindly follow code without comprehension of it, it encourages shortcuts and human error.\n\ncode is for health and safety.   plumbing systems that do not work or back up or can't be easily services, is a health issue.   A vent that is too close to an air intake is a health and safety issue. \nIn this case it would cost less than $50 in parts to move both vents inside the attic, they could even be combined to a single vent closer to the ridge line.   \n\nCode does not allow for them to be shorter OR to be hidden and inaccessible.   If there is a problem a plumber could snake out from the roof but not if they are hidden and inaccessible.   \nIf you want to put in your permit packs that you are cutting the stack pipes off at 3\" and covering with solar modules, I would love to see your results.  I would imagine that you would pass in a few locations but fail to acquire a permit in most areas.   I know you can put that you are moving them in the attic and pass everyplace.  \n\n&gt;  Still waiting on your basis for the 6\" height requirement.\n\nIt is not always 6\" BTW, some regions have 12\"  and there are other exceptions like neighboring building heights, nearby decks, intake vents, windows, doors, etc. that would force the height higher or location different.  \nIf for example you covered intake vents as well as waste exhaust vents (yes there is not much exhaust but that doesn't matter) then the calculations differ.  The basic problem is that solar installers have to have an electrcian on staff but rarely have a master plumber aware of all the code issues with plumbing.   Someone like you with arrogance stating things like :\n\n&gt; If we blindly follow code without comprehension of it\n\nare dangerous.   It is your lack of understanding that means you SHOULD be following the code.   A master plumber is qualified to make exceptions.   Just like with NEC it should be followed precisely unless you have a master electrician making an assessment to make a change.   Much of the code both NEC and UPC are there to allow tradesman (certified but not master electricians and plumbers) to do some work while they become masters of their trade with other master tradesmen reviewing and assessing their work.   The trades have councils that write recommendations for changes that are then reviewed and approved or rejected, like the way the new NEC 2017 code recommendations are being done.   It is then ratified as a national code recommendation and then each state can take them on with their own modifications for environmental or other local issue based changes.  This is the system and it relies on people (particularly untrained in each field, people) to follow it very closely.  \nThere are lots of things in local code that I think are silly but I follow them so that the homeowner doesn't have regulation and financial issues latter.   \n\n&gt; If you're going to chew anyone out for not following non-NEC code, then how about you focus on rafter penetrations without the sign-off of a registered design professional?\n\nand yes clearly this OP has a problem in that they have not staggered the mounts on the first row of modules.   OP wrote that he removed the bottom row of modules to correct the issue there but not the top row.\n\n&gt;  That's much more of a safety issue than this not-real-issue.\n\nI never said this was a safety issue.  I said it was a permit issue.  I further stated that latter if other permits are pulled they could fail due to this.   It could have issues at sale of the home as well with a good home inspector pointing it out.  These are all financial issues, that could have been avoided with $50 in parts and an hour of time, or an exception.  Though an exception is unlikely to be granted because it is so easy to avoid, permit offices are generally like that.   The easier to work around the problem without the exception, the less likely they are to grant the exception.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.01449898025020957,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1487221184992025,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18995462857608914,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06842010173325737,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2891101437176725,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23436241904788158,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17302485679510937,"solar_1":-0.16836337206162474,"solar_2":-0.06802452590333512,"solar_3":-0.05959570402107298,"solar_4":-0.054425223635917064,"solar_5":-0.0008474765636492521,"solar_6":-0.14535378910659347,"solar_7":-0.10867462538347657,"solar_8":-0.07788124536455143,"solar_9":-0.06907172967597337,"solar_10":-0.08810659517278824},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

But they also are given some other advantages based on their level of business. The numbers you state for their quote don't add up in my opinion. The model and panel count do calculate to the stated 6.867 kW. But $34k seems extraordinarily high. Over a year ago and perhaps closer to 2 years ago in San Diego I saw more than a few quotes using the same models, and those prices would calculate to about $30k for a system your size. So I would expect prices today to be at least 10% to 15% lower than that. Or at least no higher. Also, I have no reason to warn against that company, but it is also curious to me that they use only an uncommon outlet for installers for their reviews. It seems like they abandoned Yelp and HomeAdvisor perhaps about the time they became a Master Dealer (my guess). Or for some reason, late in 2015 they stopped asking for customer reviews. If you look at their current service for that, there are a few bad reviews you should at least address with them (ask why).\n\nI would also be cautious about any company that is willing to offer a contract WITHOUT completely locking down the specifications. That gives them too much leeway post signing in my experience. \n\nBut without more details it's hard to offer more analysis.

This is true around the world —  for physical reasons.\n\n\nThink of it this way. It would take 18 of California’s Ivanpah solar farms to produce the same amount of electricity that comes from our Diablo Canyon nuclear plant.\n\n\nAnd where just one set of transmission lines are required to bring power from Diablo Canyon, 18 separate transmission lines would be required to bring power from solar farms like Ivanpha.\n\n\nMoreover, these transmission lines are in most cases longer. That’s because our solar farms are far away in the desert, where it is sunny and land is cheap. By contrast, Diablo Canyon and San Onofre nuclear plants are on the coast right near where most Californians live. (The same is true for wind.)\n\n\nNew transmission lines can make electricity cheaper, but not when they are used only part of the time and duplicate rather than replace current equipment.\n\n\nOther readers pointed to cases that appear to challenge the claim that increased solar and wind deployments increase electricity prices.\n\n\nJohn Hanger, a former Secretary of Planning and Policy for the state of Pennsylvania, pointed to the states of South Dakota, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, and Iowa as “examples of high wind/solar (up to 30% or more) and average/below average prices.”\n\n\nMy colleagues Madison Czerwinski and Mark Nelson pulled the data and here is what they found:\n\n\nWhat about Hawaii, California, and Nevada — states that, Hanger noted, “have 10% solar or more”?\n\n\nDoes that mean that deploying solar and wind at-scale always and everywhere increases electricity prices? No. In some cases, the high cost that unreliable solar and wind impose on the electrical grid are offset by much larger declines in the price of other fuels, namely natural gas.\n\n\nTexas and Nevada are two cases in point. In Texas, electricity retail prices fell 14 percent, while electricity from solar and wind grew from 5 to 15 percent between 2009 and 2017. In Nevada, electricity prices fell 15 percent while electricity from solar and wind grew from 1 to 12 percent, between 2009 and 2017.\n\n\nHowever, it is neither remarkable that there are outlier states nor that they are Texas and Nevada.\n\n\nMany factors beyond the relative reliability of a power plant determine electricity prices. We have been discussing the big ones, which include but are not limited to the addition of new solar and wind and the costs they impose due to their unreliability.\n\n\nTexas, for example, is the epicenter of the fracking revolution. Between 2009 and 2017, natural gas prices for Texas power plants fell 21 percent and wholesale electricity prices fell 21 percent.\n\n\nTexas energy experts point to the way the way Texas electricity market is structured, which has allowed some high-profile bankruptcies of natural gas generators, and a re-tightening of supply last year.\n\n\nThat tightening of supply contributed to a 27% increase in electricity prices in 2017 and, according to Bloomberg, prices in Texas are going to increase again. (“Think power's expensive in Texas this year? Just Wait Until 2019.”)\n\n\nMeanwhile, solar plants in Nevada are, like those in California, the most efficient in the nation, producing electricity at whopping 30 percent of its rated capacity. By contrast, solar in New Jersey has a “capacity factor” of just 12 percent.\n\n\nNevada thus benefited more from cheaper gas and high solar capacity factors than relatively modest amount of intermittent solar in an extremely sunny climate.\n\n\nIntegrating solar on to the grid is much easier when to do when you can easily turn natural gas plants up and down to accommodate their intermittency. And it’s much easier to do when it is 12 percent of your electricity instead of 20 percent.\n\n\nBut even at low levels, problems arise. According to the research done by Lion Hirth, solar’s value drops by 50 percent when it gets to just 15 percent of mix. While those values may be different for Nevada, the impact of unreliability is the same.\n\n\nWhat is most remarkable about U.S. states heavy in solar and wind is that electricity prices rose so much given the huge decline in natural gas prices.\n\n\nHad natural gas prices not plummeted at what was almost the exact same time as the beginning of the large-scale build-out of solar and wind in the United States, price increases in solar and wind heavy states would have been far larger.\n\n\nAround the world, from Germany and Denmark to Spain and South Australia, even modest penetrations of solar and wind, compared to what advocates claim we will need to decarbonize, lead to large price increases.\n\n\nConsider Spain. Its electricity prices were below the European average in 2009. Today they are among the highest in Europe. There is little debate in Spain that this was a result of adding so much solar and wind, which led the government to cut subsidies.\n\n\nSome readers suggested that the contribution of solar and wind to high electricity prices was a legacy of older, more expensive projects, and implied that rising solar and wind penetrations would decline in the future.\n\n\nThis thinking requires ignoring both physics and economics. The value of solar and wind decline in economic value as they become larger shares of the electricity grid for physical reasons. They produce too much energy when societies don’t need it and not enough energy when they do.\n\n\nThis problem is temporarily fixed through short-term (but still expensive) work-arounds — like California and Germany paying their neighbors to take their excess electricity.\n\n\nBut the more solar and wind are added, the problem is worsened, not improved, which is why the economic value of solar and wind decline as they become a larger part of the grid.\n\n\nMoreover, we can see that in places like Germany, which is now procuring solar and wind at their supposed rock-bottom prices, is still paying massively more for electricity.\n\n\nGermany spent 24.3 billion euros above market electricity prices in 2017 for its renewable energy feed-in tariffs.\n\n\nFor example, solar and wind farms require at least an order of magnitude more land than non-renewable plants. A single example dramatically illustrates the difference. California’s Ivanpah solar farm produces 18 times less electricity on more than 290 times more land than Diablo Canyon nuclear plant.\n\n\nThis reality could, along with new transmission, be a significant additional driver of higher costs, now and in the future.\n\n\nThe cost of land and expensive new transmission lines can be eliminated if you have solar on your roof, note solar developers, but the savings on transmission are more than cancelled out by higher installation costs.\n\n\nWhat all of these additional costs have in common is that they stem directly from underlying physical limits with generating electricity from sunlight and wind. Both “fuels” are dilute and unreliable.\n\n\nTo make up for those inherent weaknesses, expanding energy from solar panels and wind turbines requires massively increasing the physical footprint of energy production.\n\n\nRenewables require the use of vastly more land, longer and less-utilized transmission lines, and large amounts of storage whether from lithium batteries, new dams, compressed air caverns.\n\n\nAll renewables thus require a material throughput — from mining to processing to installing to disposing of the materials later as waste — that is orders of magnitude larger than for non-renewable energy sources.\n\n\nAs such, while there is and will remain complexity and uncertainty about the specific causes of why solar and wind make electricity expensive, most if not all stem from their underlying physical and (thus environmental constraint), which is the limited, diffuse, dilute, and unreliable nature of renewable fuels.\n\n\nAnd that’s something we need to talk about — and deal with — if we are to protect the natural environment while expanding prosperity to all.\n\n✌ cool people read before commenting ✌","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.024904351060589153,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17323268558516247,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16431379444919147,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23222670642038187,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34710411342724967,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.242618415457613,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12524812452230707,"solar_1":-0.14532118233219907,"solar_2":-0.1815269799952369,"solar_3":-0.08581166103995859,"solar_4":-0.2462108813829634,"solar_5":-0.22199855136316923,"solar_6":-0.04339913141913475,"solar_7":-0.04367294869492374,"solar_8":-0.025096548231707864,"solar_9":-0.07064783345970227,"solar_10":-0.08772023005354533},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

One company (the 2:1 quote) are 'master electricians' with large government contracts for solar and even employed by Tesla to install charging stations and the other is a well regarded local solar installer so either should work out ok.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007662142161279917,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1970446236676556,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21875868484290184,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.10433070920407772,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2473973376986578,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.28185305196960786,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.053900870795284085,"solar_1":-0.15771543326400173,"solar_2":-0.26518357256039354,"solar_3":-0.0003082990230420061,"solar_4":-0.008549319473483289,"solar_5":-0.006000899125259214,"solar_6":-0.05283914506435394,"solar_7":-0.0015618306739876668,"solar_8":-0.0032492397052313513,"solar_9":-0.04808080040675122,"solar_10":-0.0007409040408674628},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

To try and diminish my perspective (and the company’s superior tech) because I’m a passionate investor is missing the entire point.  You’re competitive to a fault, and totally blinded by your bias.  I told you to invest in Enphase back when the stock was trading around $4... your pride made you miss out on 50%+ growth, and for what- because you’re an “SE guy”?? Because you got burned by the 1st iteration of Enphase micros way back when?? I told you to exact your revenge on Enphase BY INVESTING, thereby recouping any loses. Then you’d be free of this horrible grudge and more able to survey the merits of the current Enphase platform more objectively.\n\nEnphase tech is superior and is the future.\n\nBTW, scroll down for an image of the new A-series panel (w/ IQ7X embedded), and pay special attention to how small the junction box is. Zippo lighter small... can you imagine that being absorbed into the micro?  I can.\n\n\nhttps://us.sunpower.com/solar-panels-technology/a-series-solar-panels/","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005790764116682112,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2367817490658672,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17663262062882198,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2898166413858431,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17157402608494235,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.042416666918143164,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1429110624982665,"solar_1":-0.02095757758797845,"solar_2":-0.017353037642654574,"solar_3":-0.011900830905384888,"solar_4":-0.004957245640980545,"solar_5":-0.0003105640862486325,"solar_6":-0.00018572194676380605,"solar_7":-0.0004692221821945471,"solar_8":-0.0002542609278558909,"solar_9":-0.004882716713230669,"solar_10":-0.010649574682853805},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Mild hybrid drivetrains are *nothing* like BEV drivetrains. For one, there are literally *thousands* fewer parts, which completely invalidates your argument.\n\nAnd your arguments about natural gas are absurd. You can't ever run a hybrid off of green energy, while you can (and many people *do*) with an EV. So your argument completely falls apart anywhere that has significant solar and wind power, and especially so if the owner has solar panels.\n\nAnd also, importantly, the emissions from EVs are physically located away from where the EVs drive, and thus where the people live. So many fewer people die of direct pollution exposure with EVs, even if you are lowering the electricity generation entirely from fossil fuel sources. This is not true of mild hybrids.\n\nAfter rereading your comment, you got so much wrong about mild hybrids that I think maybe you're mistaking them for *series* hybrids?

Then they cut the value of solar energy provided to the grid, even though the utilities make money every time they sell your solar power under NEM 2. \n\nPeople confuse the 1:1 credits with actual payouts. You roll 1 kWh onto the grid and it is worth say 28 cents. The utility sells it to your neighbor for 28 cents. Then you buy 1 kWh of power back at night for 28 cents but the utility only has to pay for the generation and transmission so let’s say 5-7 cents, they were able to net 21-23 cents in this energy arbitrage using generation capacity they didn’t pay a dime for. If you have credits left over at the end of the year, you can get paid wholesale rates for those, not the retail rates they are valued at. \n\nThe real issue is that they keep starting fires and have been neglecting the grid for decades. They are unable to raise rates on everyone to pay for this because solar customers are largely immune from these rate increases. I’m not saying solar customers shouldn’t pay their fair share because they absolutely still use the grid and should help pay for it. The utilities should have come up with a total cost for all improvements needed to harden the grid against fires, blackouts, and design it for the renewable energy transition we are undergoing. Then charge a fixed amount over several years for everyone, including NEM 1 and 2 customers to pay for these costs. \n\nBut they are specifically targeting payoff windows, with the utilities requested making all payoff windows 17-20 years up from 3-5 now. The CPUC “compromised” at 10 using bad cost per watt numbers that are only 60% of what Californians actually pay for solar so in reality the payoff window is 16-17 years for NEM 3. But this change is not triggering any rate reductions for non-solar customers so they get to charge about $90 per month extra for all future solar customers without providing any additional services or power.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"frustrated but still pro"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00210618848601977,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28394256240910776,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2012846946986941,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23161330571158323,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2666961098436218,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.01328059813628594,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18359029870811494,"solar_1":-0.23098567700188577,"solar_2":-0.36102461547610193,"solar_3":-0.13899689102922066,"solar_4":-0.17971957684419396,"solar_5":-0.029417426643097617,"solar_6":-0.05708655084405715,"solar_7":-0.02448895418153067,"solar_8":-0.0548203955428208,"solar_9":-0.04727675271847431,"solar_10":-0.3339335245300502,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.23095665003142862},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author's stance is against solar policies, specifically NEM 3, due to the increased costs and perceived unfairness towards non-solar customers.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

The rules are changing in the EU as well, but as long as you have yearly net metering you are not in a position to complain IMHO. With the current electricity prices (at least here in EU) solar is the best investment one can do. We have varying electricity rates based on supply and demand, so yesterday when it was very windy our raw electricity cost (before taxes) were €0.2 per kWh, today in the evening peak where there is almost no wind it is €0.7 per kWh (plus transport tariffs, taxes and VAT which is another €0.3) and no one else is paying for the grid to be “my battery” (Net metering). Right now when it’s summer I’m having close to zero energy bills because I produce more than I buy during the night, but in winter I’ll be buying 90% if my electricity.

It’s not the absolute cheapest, but when you factor in the additional services like tree trimming and removal, the value seems justified. Tree removal can be a significant cost, so having that included is a big plus—especially since it addresses both shading and structural concerns.\n\nThe equipment you’re getting is high quality. Mission Solar panels are well-regarded, and the SolarEdge Optimized String inverter is a reliable choice that balances efficiency with scalability. Both should serve you well for the long haul.\n\nThe 25-year warranty for all parts and labor is excellent, especially with the extended OEM warranty on the inverter. This gives you peace of mind that you’re covered for any issues, and it’s a testament to the installer’s confidence in their work.\n\nAs for the installer, BriteStreet’s reputation in Colorado is solid. Completing 140 projects a month shows they’re experienced and capable of handling high volumes without sacrificing quality. Their local expertise is a bonus, especially when navigating incentives and regulations.\n\nThat said, if you’re still unsure, it never hurts to get one more quote for comparison. I recommend to check with solar sme and few more reputable solar companies, you can find on search results or energysage with good credibility review scores which could help you validate this deal or provide another perspective.\n\nAll in all, this looks like a fair deal, especially considering the included services and the strong warranty.

I think there is decent evidence that eating meat is unhealthy:\n1) Atherosclerosis is the build up of plaque in your cardiovascular system caused by increased blood cholesterol levels. This is the direct cause of the #1 killer in the US: Cadiovascular disease (i.e. heart attacks, heart failure, and stroke). The human body simply was not designed to eat cholesterol heavy foods such as meat and eggs. Ask around your family; you will find that most older american adults have high cholesterol and many over the age of 50 take medications to reduce blood cholesterol levels. Why not decrease your consumption of cholesterol rather than take a pill to lower your blood levels? More information here: https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/\n\n2) In the US the #2 killer is cancer. Processed meats are known to cause cancer. They are listed as a group 1 carcinogen the same as asbestos, tobacco, and arsenic. Red meat most likely causes cancer and eating it is a known risk factor for colon cancer. It is possible that 25 years from now society will look at processed meats in the same way we currently look at cigarettes. More information here: http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/\n\n2) Animals are raised and slaughtered in unspeakably unsanitary conditions. They are pumped full of mega doses of antibiotics to try to ward off disease long enough to get them to slaughter. Not only does this breed drug resistant bacteria it also means that the meat you eat (and handle before it is cooked) is filled with terrible bacteria. In fact, there are studies showing that bacteria such as MRSA, Cdiff, salmonella, and ecoli can easily be found on meat found in the supermarket. I'm too lazy to find a link at the moment, but I have personally read some of these studies and they seem very legitimate.\n\n3) The Adventist health study (http://publichealth.llu.edu/adventist-health-studies) and the china study (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_Study) have provided considerable evidence that vegetarian and vegan diets provide an overall reduction in mortality including from top killers such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The Adventist study is a very large study of 96,000 people. Once again, I think the evidence holds up.\n\nI do not think humans are \"meant\" to eat meat. Personally, I have never had the urge to bite into a living animal and eat it raw. On the other hand, my cat (a carnivore) will happily rip the head off a bird and eat it raw.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006505801633466035,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12989606724161185,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17705179004975946,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2974422458167496,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38581262242904424,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1383699048920756,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1738951903781959,"diet_1":-0.17544511527037193,"diet_2":-0.2016643917206982,"diet_3":-0.18149081051457566,"diet_4":-0.19123812458929024,"diet_5":-0.1374343455972134,"diet_6":-0.18563952021698546,"diet_8":-0.004346067365986528,"diet_9":-0.005781763994794649,"diet_10":-0.020592215015009668,"diet_11":-0.02026267823263576,"diet_13":-0.03485885765015458,"diet_14":-0.18286691704629063,"diet_17":-0.003902247455092341},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

You can search “easy vegan meal ideas” / meal prep ideas or whatever you’re craving for a recipe. \n\nYou can try using TVP (textured vegetable protein) to make a taco salad. Or just for regular tacos. \nLentils to make Bolognese sauce, “meat”balls, or “meat”loaf. These things can be made in bigger batches and frozen as well so you have easy meals for later. \nVegan Alfredo sauce with cashews and other pantry staples. Can use the sauce for regular Alfredo pasta or make a lasagna variation with broccoli and other veggies. Lasagna can also be frozen for later. \nStuffed sweet potatoes w veggies and roasted chickpeas. I like to make a tahini dressing to put on it. I normally have it with steamed kale too. Soo good! You can make a couple at once and leave them in the fridge for the couple days after. \nPita or tortilla pizzas - I love making or buying vegan pesto for these. But you can use any sauce and any toppings. \nAlso like another person mentioned, tofu is great because you can leave it marinating in any sauce/spice mix and it will taste even better when you cook it. You can have it with rice, potatoes, quinoa, with veggies, like typical dinner plate or you can add it to a salad, bread it like nuggets, add it to a sauce like sweet and sour or bbq. I love to make curry with tofu as well. \nI like to have frozen vegan burgers as well for a quick night meal. You can try having it with lettuce wraps or just topping a bowl (rice, salad, veggies) with them. Or just regular burgers 🍔 with whatever side. \nAnother easy meals is just different variations of “bowls”. Normally has a grain, different veggies, and protein and you can put any sauce on it. Try searching “Vegan Buddha Bowls” for recipes. \n\nI like to make sure I have a couple different fruits cut up in containers for easy snacking access. \nYou can batch prep vegan energy balls for the week with oats and other add ins like maple syrup, different seeds, some have cocoa powder for a chocolate flavoured one. Keep these in the fridge or freezer. Same with granola bars. \n\nyou can also try adding a smoothie to your daily menu to get diff fruits or veg in. Add some hemp seeds and dates for added nutrition and some energy as well.\n\nI’m not sure what the working/life balance looks like but maybe hubby getting involved with helping you meal prep some things on the weekend or whatever day might encourage him to get creative with vegan eating. I noticed my boyfriend start to come up with more ideas and involve himself more once he started to have his own understanding about have to navigate vegan cooking. \n\nI hope at the very least I passed along some meal ideas for you!

When I thought veganism = strict equality of moral status, I was able to hyper-fixate on trolley problem cases, the problem of animal predation, questions about whether it's okay to kill an animal to avoid starving and avoid thinking too hard about whether any of this has much of any bearing on whether purchasing animal products in the here and now is permissible.  \n\nI start talking to omnivores from the 'you are against animal cruelty because you recognize animals to have a kind of moral status - it might be lower than that of humans, but it's clearly high enough to make it wrong to cause them intense suffering purely for our enjoyment. So why do you support factory farming?' angle.
