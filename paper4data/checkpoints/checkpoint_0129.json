But there's huge variation within level 2: Commercially available level 2 EVSEs range all the way from 16 amps to 80 amps. While 30A has been the \"standard\" so far for EVSEs, I'd recommend 40A or more. All Teslas can charge at 40A (and some top-of-the-line ones can pull 80A), and Tesla drivers are probably your customer's preferred clientele (they're rich.)",

This appears adequately cautious if you don't know the trip or the capabilities of the car but he could have traveled more comfortably had he known the route, charging station locations and the car itself better.\n\nI'm sure he'd find it easier to do a 2nd time, and easier still in another year when there are more stations available to choose from.",

We do not have the infrastructure for the fuel and it really isn't cheaper than gas-- although environmentally is better.  No one will buy it because they wont be able to fill up anywhere, and then they will claim \"there is no market\" and go back to burning oil for another 50 years.  Short sided assholes. We need to support companies like Tesla so they can change the game.

"comment": "It is true that lithium batteries age.  But I wouldn't take Teslas warranty to mean that lithium won't possibly last more than 8 years.  That warranty states that at 8 years the battery will have at least 80% of the original capacity.  Anything less is considered to be a defective pack.  In a solar application where charge/discharge rates are low and DoD is generally much below 100% I think you're likely to beat 8 years by a large margin.  Even a heavily used tesla pack after 8 years probably has another 8+ as a great off-grid battery.  And then, who cares if it only holds 50%? Buy another junkyard battery and double them up, weight isn't a concern. \n\nSounds like you're planning a system exactly like mine.  The problem right now is storage costs are high.  I'm betting that widespread EV use will take care of that problem, already there are cheap volt and leaf batteries hitting the market.  In fact my electric mower/tractor use recycled leaf cells with 80% capacity I bought for 40% the cost of new batteries.",

"comment": "&gt; In just 15 years? \n\nYes.  I did the calculations, and if storage continues the way it has, you're going to get EVs that can drive a full day before needing to recharge.\n\nLet's look at *current* battery technology.  If you were able to replace [a Tesla's 85kWh battery pack with a LiS pack of equivalent mass, you'd get more than 12 straight hours of driving before you needed a recharge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/2zbx7b/lithiumsulfur_battery_chemistry_that_delivers/cppl82x)  Basically, the only reason that's not being done currently is that it would cost almost $64k *just for the battery,* as opposed to the ~$21k a Tesla pack currently costs.  If the 16% per year holds, in 7 years, that 255kWh pack would only be $18k.  If it instead continues at the 14% per year, it'd cost $22k.  Either way, even without anything other than *battery cost* improvements, 2022 will have 850 mile battery packs *in the car.*\n\nIn 15 years?  Even if it's only 10% cost improvement per year on average, it'd only be $13k for a 850 mile battery pack.  That's only about twice the cost of a Leaf battery pack currently.  You think people wouldn't pay an extra $7k for 850 miles of range?  No problem! They can buy the 400 mile pack for the current $6k.\n\n---\n\nAlternately, if you put the LiS in a range extending trailer, you could make them rentals, so that when you needed to drive for a full day without stopping.  Then, you could charge it overnight, or possibly even swap it out at the local uDrive place.  And then, when you get to your destination, you could drop the trailer off at the uDrive place, and *still have a full battery.*\n\nSeriously, for any consumer vehicle, the technology *already* exists to do this, the only real problem is that of production volume/cost.\n\n15 years?  That's a *conservative* estimate for the technology, and that's even if the *only* improvement is cost/production volume.",

"comment": "Despite big concerns about battery replacements cost, my estimate is that practically zero EV batteries will be replaced due to capacity loss.  Zero.  There may be hardware or quality control issues with the cells but that will probably happen at the same rate as will gas/diesel engines.  I'm not saying that capacity loss won't happen, I'm just saying that it won't cause the owner to replace the battery.  For example, if someone has a Model S with 265 miles of range and losses 30% over 8 or 10 years, the car still has 185 miles of range.  That still meets the customer's daily needs.    Now the short range EVs (LEAF, Focus, etc) are more complicated.  If a LEAF losses 30% range it might not be enough range to meet daily driving needs (0.7*84 = 59 miles, less in winter).  My supposition is that the owner will not buy a new 84 mile battery but either buy a longer range BEV (coming in 2016) or a PHEV.  The LEAF will probably we sold to someone that can get by with the reduced range.",

"comment": "&gt; I might just be putting too much emphasis on simplicity and assuming higher failure.\n\nThis. The Volt has had very good reliability thus far. Instead of thinking of it as two things that can fail, it is actually more like having redundancy. The gasoline powertrain does not get as much wear and tear, so you are not having to fix those bits nearly as often as you do in a normal gasoline car.\n\n&gt; It has enough range for my daily commute but it is carrying around this useless ICE when it does.\n\nI hear this argument against the Volt but the same thing applies to a Tesla: if it has a 250 mile range then it is carrying around a \"useless\" 200 miles of battery if all you need is the first 50 miles for daily use. Those batteries are quite heavy.\n\nThe battery in the Volt is quite pampered and among all plug-ins out there, its battery is seeming to have the least degradation after years of use. That is largely because it does not use the top 20-ish percent or the bottom 20-ish percent of the battery pack, which is when most degradation occurs in lithium ion. (i.e. pro tip: don't let your iphone drain to empty and avoid charging it to full if you want it to last forever.)",

"comment": "Dump truck's of this size are typically Diesel-electric anyway due to the difficulties of building such a large multi-speed gearbox. (similar to diesel-electric locomotives &amp; Azipod driven ships)\n\nTypically these are not hybrid (no storage for electricity) under power a diesel generator makes power which is directly used in the drive motor. Under breaking the motor regenerates power which is dissipated as heat via an electrical load bank.\n\nGiven that these trucks use electric motors anyway it's not that bigger jump to make them Pure electric or Hybrid. Biggest downside is if you put the battery on-board its weight comes straight off the payload. Meaning you can carry less per trip. Its not like a car where you can just have the car be heavier and maintain payload. With these trucks their payload is limited by axles, tires, the haul road etc.\n\nMy favorite tech is is \"trolley dump trucks\". These use an undersized diesel engine on the flats, and connect to the grid for additional electrical power via twin rail style panto-graphs for during the climbs &amp; descents that are common in mining. strictly this is a hybrid.",

If the graph had been looking at percentages of vehicles Norway would be way higher. If you’re looking at percentages of purchases - even more. \n\nThe article says that part of the incentives in Norway are being exempt for toll roads. Certainly that’s a motivating factor, and in some areas even the main factor for people buying EV’s, but another important point is that EV’s have been competitive on price since the beginning. ICE cars are taxed around 100%, give or take, while hybrids vary depending on CO2 emissions. \n\nWhen Tesla started selling vehicles in Norway a fully loaded model S was about 1/3 of a BMW M5 (or about half the price of a 1M). Tesla prices has risen due to currency exchange rate changes (the Dollar has become stronger compared to the Norwegian Krone), but other EV’s are still price competitive: for example a Nissan Leaf is cheaper than an ICE VW Golf (cheapest model) by about 1/4-1/3.",

No.\n\n&gt; How likely am I to purchase?\n\nAgain, difficult answer... Is this a money is no object kinda question?\n\nComparing the vehicles is also difficult... All the questions relate to technology and none of the questions relate to range or recharge time.\n\nLet's say I was offered the choice of two vehicles completely free of charge. (No pun intended)\n\nVehicle #1 is a Gasoline powered, modern luxury sedan. Think Acura TL, Lexus IS, BMW 5 series, etc. All the modern conveniences... Power everything, Heated Leather seats, Infotainment, etc. I'd pay for fuel and maintenance for the duration of my ownership.\n\nVehicle #2 is a 1991 Geo Metro or Honda Civic that someone got from the scrapyard and did a DIY electric conversion. Lightweight and BARE BONES... No power windows, No power Locks, Ratty interior, No radio. BUT it had performance equal to the original gasoline engine, it had a 300 mile range like a full tank of fuel would have had, and I can go from a dead battery to 100% charge in 15 minutes...\n\nI would pick the bare bones car every time.\n\nThose are the ONLY reasons I don't own an electric car...

Tesla's chargers are no use to 99.7% of drivers that don't own Tesla vehicles, so it really doesn't matter where they build them so long as they're using proprietary plugs unlike everyone else.\n\n2. Your presumption is wrong. The majority of Tesla's Superchargers are located well off highways, in suburban shopping centers. Other charging networks have built their DCFC on long highway stretches, almost 4 for every 1 built by Tesla to date. For example, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the main highway in the state, has DCFC at most of its service plazas, the rest stops directly on the highway. They're run by Blink, not Tesla. Nearby, Tesla requires a nearly 40 minute long detour during rush hours to get off the highway, drive to a suburban shopping center, then get back on the highway... not including charging time.",

"comment": "Once EV adoption takes off, every one of the stations I put on that map (and more) will be built by someone. The question is, essentially, how soon we can build them and whether that coverage is better as a starting point than as a final goal. The funding source here is assuming local partners, and the substantial flexibility in location means you should be able to find somewhere cheap to put it. Most cities would like to have vehicles stop in them (so are likely to offer use of a city parking lot) and there are plenty of businesses that wouldn't mind a free amenity to draw customers to their location. I think you are over-estimating leasing costs. The operation cost of a 150-kW station is six times the operation cost of a 25-kW station simply due to the demand charge. It will be far harder find partners willing to eat that cost until enough EVs are on the road to cover it.\n\nTo be clear: this is not money that VW is spending. This is the money from the diesel-gate settlment. Each state has an agency in charge of deciding how to spend this. There is no *way* a for-profit company would build some of the chargers that I am suggesting until the EVs exist to use them. I am arguing that a state, however, can use the money to build the network *first* which will increase the number of EVs. It is a chicken-or-egg problem, and a non-profit-driven entity making the decision means we can make decisions for the long-term.",

"comment": "From a utility of energy perspective, lots and lots of BEVs can soak up wind power at night and solar power in the day to help balance the grid and provide for higher renewables penetration. One of the key issues with adding relatively intermittent renewables is dispatchable demand and BEVs can provide that demand just like HFC but at much higher efficiency.\n\nThe HFC stack in a Mirai is 114 kW, Honda Clarity is 103 kW and the Hyundai ix35 is 100 kW. To get regenerative braking and therefore get a boost during acceleration, they all have batteries. There is really no energy argument that supports HFEVs right now, not without a slew of advancements. They have been getting the platinum use down a lot and so the cost of the HFC stack has lowered dramatically, but there are still lots of basic scientific breakthroughs necessary. By the time that happens, if it happens, likely BEVs already win.\n\nThe only real argument for HFC vehicles is about refuel time. I don't think that one issue is enough to save HFC vehicles though. Especially not when we factor in the complexity and cost of scale of HFC stations, especially the high pressure pumps.",

I drive there regardless, because if you get caught (if they even care) it costs 15 bucks if you can't talk your way out of it. with the insurance you get a small license plate sticker that you put on your scooter wich is a different color every year, so they know your insurance is valid without checking the number.",

Near your home or near work?\n\n&gt;As said, I can fill it up while I do groceries shopping, mostly using the 11kw AC, sometimes the 50kw DC.\n\n\nHow long do you shop? 1h on a 11kw charger equals to 11kW/h. That does not get you far. 50kW/h on DC is definitely better.\n\n&gt;I would recommend anyone who wants to go the route of no home charging to see how it fits into their daily lives with commute and everything.\n\nAnother tip from me, don't think that the charging port at your shopping destination will always work. I had a unpleasant time, when my ABB charger did not work for 3 months. In general, do not count on all the best case scenarios because you love EVs. Do the opposite! Check if it works for you in the worst case (AC, winter, charge speed and many more).",

"comment": "I was going to say the same thing. It takes a surprisingly long time to focus your eyes on a gauge cluster, and then back onto the road again. There's a small amount of information that arguably should be displayed on a HUD. HUDs focus at infinity for that reason - so that you don't have to refocus your eyes in order to read the displayed symbology...\n\nPersonally, after having had a Model 3 as my only car for 2.5 years, I think the center screen is fine. Its just as quick to glance to the center, as it was in previous cars to glance at the gauge cluster, and does have the advantage that the steering wheel doesn't block any of it, even when turning.\n\nI'm less happy about having to use the UI to adjust some safety critical controls like windshield wipers. In general, I think Tesla made some poor choices about removing some dedicated physical controls, but that's another discussion. The center screen itself is fine, perhaps even better.\n\nThe yoke? I'm afraid I wouldn't buy a car with one.",

Ford could also release a more off road ready trim of the Lightning if they wanted too. Bigger, more aggressive tires, and a small lift kit would go a long way.

Their complaint is that the range says it’s x but they’re unhappy they don’t get said range despite knowingly driving at the speeds they do. This goes for the other driving habits people have. Imagine someone in Germany cruising on the Autobahn at 100 mph in their Model Y and then complaining their range is reduced and that Tesla mislead them. The complaining from a loud group of clueless people is rather annoying. \n\nAgain, back to analogies, the vast majority of adults cook and prepare food to feed themselves and their families. How many people are actually good cooks? Just because you cook doesn’t mean you good at it. Why can’t so many people achieve the same or similar cooking results to experienced cooks, using the same ingredients and tools?",

I charged outdoors for about a year connected to a 110v 15 amp outdoor receptacle and the EVSE that came with the car.\n\nI used a heavy duty 12 gauge cord:\nSouthwire 2588SW0002 Outdoor Cord-12/3 SJTW Heavy Duty, 50 Feet https://a.co/d/5UzpFzB\n\nAnd the rubber cable ramp over a sidewalk.\n2 Pack Rubber Cable Ramp Hose Cable Protector https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W4HH8BK/ref=cm_sw_r_apanp_c3QFZKVWRE6pk\n\nIt worked well.\nAgain the volt is now more than a decade old and is not the most energy efficient. As others have said any newer BEV should be much more efficient. You should get more miles than I do with my volt with the same hours of charging\n\nNow I have it plugged into a garage circuit that is rated at 15 amp with the garage door opener and chest freezer and mini fridge. When I had it charged at 16 amps (I know silly), the circuit breaker tripped...but now I have the car just charge at 8 amp. It works well and no more tripping circuits. It's not the fastest but effective for overnight charging. My circuit breaker panel is completely full....if I want to add more circuits I need a subpanel. \n\nPortable chargers are not that expensive - about two to three hundred on Amazon. The key search terms are: EVSE level 1 2 adjustable 10 amps. (Charging at 10 amp should permit you to charge from any regular outlet). You maybe able to change the charging amps on the car itself.....older cars can't...if you are able to adjust on the car itself you eliminate the \"adjustable\" and \"10 amps\" from the search terms. It will save you some money.\n\nYou don't need a high amp circuit....but it is nice to have if you are building a new home. The plugshare app is useful for outside the home charging. All of that being said I am immensely jealous of those in Europe/Asia where all of their circuits are 220v.",

We're determined to avoid such pitfalls with our product, which is why we collaborate with a trusted factory to produce reliable scooters. \n\nAs I mentioned, this type of model is inundated with copies, and the discrepancy in price typically stems from differences in materials quality rather than variations in design. As for the model's appearance, there's no need for further modifications. With a power output of 500W  and a speed of 25-28 mph, our scooters strike the right balance; they don't require excessive power or speed.\n\nAnd Imagine if you're considering forgoing the purchase of an e-bike in favor of a \"scooter with a seat\". What features would make that decision appealing to you?",

Or, to put it another way, if a western manufacturer builds an EV they need to price it at a place where they can stay in business and then the customer within that country has their purchase subsidized to the point where they are willing to buy. If a car is exported to a country with no incentives for the buyer, there is no incentive at all. \n\nChina does the vast majority of their funding at point of manufacture (or even development). Or, to again explain further, once a Chinese company builds and EV in China at that point they can claim a credit no matter the final destination of that car. This means that Chinese EVs, sold anywhere in the world, have an MSRP that already reflects a credit from the Chinese government.\n\nThe US FMVSS and the UNECE regs are tougher than what's it China, and there are tariffs on Chinese EVs, so they will be priced higher than the same model in China, but it still reflects approximately 15k USD in subsidies already given by the Chinese government.",

We’re so focused on hating the other side instead of trying to be welcoming that we forget about the animals. Vegans who vote for Trump exist. But frankly this sub is more focused on other matters such as LGBT, representation, politicians taking away our rights that in the end, we forget about the animals & more focused on other causes & pushing out other vegans who may not agree. So yay, less soldiers for the cause. And yay, people are making fun of vegans again.\n\nRemember, the Republicans are the least of our problems. there are prominent vegans over on the other side, or one of many disillusioned former Liberals like myself who see our own party do shit for the cause that now I’m just a boring Independent. Frankly, under Donald Trump 2016-2020 I see way more gains than the past 4 years. For one, personally I became a vegan under his watch whether he had anything to do with it or not. California’s AB-44 fur ban in 2019. More vegan products on the shelves like Impossible & Beyond goes public. So they can’t be that bad, right? We just have push & persuade the right way.\n\nSomeone remind me what animal rights issues did we achieve under Biden or Kamala? I see worse vegan selections on shelves in the past 4 years or maybe I cannot afford them due to inflation. And what did we have go gain to be antagonistic against Elon Musk. Did we forget the electric cars?\n\nThe past 4 years have been honestly pretty demoralizing. So yeah, it makes no difference to me who’s president. I care only for the animals how to help them, preferably with help even from the … yes… CONSERVATIVES. We may not make much headwind with them. Sure. Maybe. But we’ve already lost if we didn’t try. \n\nI mean. We lost it all last night Senate, the House & Presidency, focusing on fearmongering & identity politics instead of putting out a proper candidate with solid issues. So, yay? We’ve lost Tulsi Gabbard to them, a vegetarian & someone I supported. RFK Jr who could meet us halfway in regards to food & health. They also have Vivek Ramaswamy, Glenn Greenwald, Russell Brand, all plant based or vegan so they can’t all be evil right? And who do the Democrats have? Heck we’re even so focused on hating them so much that we’d even ignored the Peanut squirrel story just to be contrarians instead of joining them in solidarity. So, congrats to us I guess. Yay!!! \n\nWe need some serious mea culpa if we are to help the animals. Trump is not the problem. It’s us.",

"comment": "My folks have been off grid for over 10 years in New Zealand . They had a wind turbine in addition to solar. \n\nThe wind turbine wasn't that cost effective it was an early soma model from memory? Needed to be re-coiled a couple of times, never performed that well afterward. And eventually it fell over. They have been using solar panels exclusively now for some time, about 8 panels mounted on a bracket which they can manually turn to face the sun. \n\nThey use LPG for cooking, and have a wetback fireplace in addition to a solar water heater. With a backup honda petrol generator. \n\nWith just the two of them at home, during summer the water is hot enough for showers, and electricity is fine. They even run a dishwasher occasionally. \n\nThey have had to replace the deep cycle batteries and inverter once during this time. The batteries being the most expensive portion, I believe 10-12 batteries? But dad took the best of them and rigged up another system on the farmyard barn, so that now has its own setup. \n\nIf you wanted to know the specifics of the system I'm sure he'd be happy to tell you.",

"comment": "The EcoFasten are solid mounts, and its not uncommon to use a bit of silicon between the flashing and the roof. Particularly in an upside down \"U\" shape (facing uproof) to shed any water that might work its way under the flashing laterally. \n\nBut obviously there's a problem here. And the problem is REALLY shoddy workmanship. Someone manhandled that flashing to the point where it's no longer the intended shape. This commonly happens when lazy installers use the actual flashing to pry apart the shingles that it will sit between rather than a standard pry bar. It's not uncommon but a very bad practice. Seems obvious that this is what happened here. The cup shape of that flashing is scary. \n\nAlso, this flashing is not far enough up under the shingles. As you can see from the pic, there is enough exposed flashing to cover an entire shingle course and it even overhangs another course by a 1/4in or so. That's actually your biggest problem here. Flashings are sized so that they cover a full course then tuck under 1 full course and then just slightly under another. If you don't get the flashing under that second course, there is a small bit of exposure at the very top of the shingle split directly up roof of the L bracket. In a good install, water that washes into that crevice hits the flashing and drains down the roof. But, if the flashing doesn't extend under the course completely there will be a small spot at the top of the crevice for water to work its way under the flashing. That's how leaks happen. Based on the part of the flashing that's visible, I would bet that they didn't go up under far enough. \n\nThis is a common corner that is cut by the solar roof guys because there is additional tar that needs to be pried apart to get under that third course and usually a nail that needs to be carefully removed. It's not easy. Plus, it's very hard to tell whether they actually bothered to do it unless the company has a very detailed inspector that gets up there to take a look before the panels are installed, so its easy for a roof guy to be lasy and get away with it. The Orange/Green/Baby Blue guys are infamous for this kind of issue.\n\ntl;dr The silicon is sloppy but not the worst thing. The workmanship is poor and the flashing seems to be installed incorrectly.",

What this means is that each solar panel (which produces DC power) has its own inverter (converts DC to AC which is what your house and power grid use). From the log you had two microinverters that failed to report in when they powered on but the issue was cleared a second later. I would keep a eye on them for possible issues but it may be as simple as their panels are shaded or something. \n\nMicroinverters are a good setup and I would look it up on Wikipedia to get more information. If one does fail it just means your down that 1 panel and not the whole array. \n\nLet me know if you need/want more information. I have a electrical power engineering degree and love solar.",

But it was matched a month later in a different auction in December by SkyPower.\n\nFortum’s offer was also no outlier. The bid was nearly matched by Rising Sun Energy (which bid 4.35 rupees for two blocks), France’s Solairedirect (also two blocks for 4.35 rupees a unit) and Yarrow Infrastructure ( a 70MW plant for 4.36 rupees).\n“This (Rs 4.34 a unit) is the lowest solar tariff so far in India. This has happened because of confidence in the balance sheet of NTPC and solar parks that come with all clearances and confidence in the market,” new and renewable energy joint secretary Tarun Kapoor said.\n\nThe bids are also not subject to price indexation. Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) wrote last month that this means a potential 5 per cent annual real price decline is contractually in place for the next 25 years, a significant long tail advantage of renewable energy.\n\nFossil fuels by comparison offer prohibitive price variability and currency devaluation risks.\n\n“India currently has over 4.4GW of installed utility solar capacity, and solar consultancy Bridge to India estimates another 16GW of tenders have been allocated or are in the process of tendering, much which we expect to be operational by 2017 at the latest. Rooftop solar is also on a steep upward trajectory in 2016,” Buckley wrote.",

For typical panels, changing from STC (everything at 77F or 25C) to PTC (ambient at 68F 20C and cells at 113F 45C, 2.2mph 1M/sec breeze) will mean about a 10% difference in output - hotter being lower.

"comment": "I have solar PG&amp;E and we're in the Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE) CCA. There wasn't any impact on grandfathering (we're on NEM 1.0); we get $0.01/kWh more in credits for excess electric production than the regular rate, and credits are actually cashed out instead of being lost and returned at the wholesale rate. So it was actually beneficial for us. The billing process is the same as before, there's just one more line item in bill that splits up generation(from PCE) and generation (from PG&amp;E)\n\nTechnically: with PCE, generation charges are handled by PCE and the distribution and transmission charges are still through PG&amp;E; both are presented in the same bill. On the first month after switching to PCE we paid any existing generation charges to PG&amp;E, but now we won't have pay those again at the end of the next true-up cycle. Effectively any generation charges were paid up and cleaned out early, and with the credit rules it won't be a loss to us. \n\nFrom the SVEA CCA draft: \n\nhttp://lincolnca.gov/home/showdocument?id=6947\n\n&gt; **Net Energy Metering**\n\n&gt; Customers with on-site generation eligible for net metering from PG&amp;E will be offered a net energy metering rate from SVEA. Net energy metering allows for customers with certain qualified solar or wind distributed generation to be billed on the basis of their net energy consumption. The PG&amp;E net metering tariff (NEM) requires the CCA to offer a net energy metering tariff in order for the customer to continue to be eligible for service on Schedule ENEM. The objective is that SVEA’s net energy metering tariff will apply to the generation component of the bill, and the PG&amp;E net energy metering tariff will apply to the utility’s portion of the bill. SVEA plans to pay customers for excess power produced from net energy metered generation systems in accordance with the rate designs adopted by SVEA.\n\nYou will keep your existing NEM rules. The SVEA NEM rate will cover part of your bill, and it should match the PG&amp;E one. If you have the final draft and the SVEA rates let me know and I can look through it to see what the SVEA rules are like. FWIW, if you're billed under NEM2/NEMST (the schedules for NEM 2.0), the non-bypassable charges are billed on distribution so that aspect of your rate won't change either way.\n\nIt also looks like you have 60 days to opt out (see ch9 of the document), so if the SVEA NEM rules are unfavorable you can always switch back to PG&amp;E.",

"comment": "5 yrs with SunRun, this what happened to my family.\n\nLast year this time, my family encounter roof leakage. As we look up to the ceiling where the leaking spot is, we see and touch a metal threaded stud that slightly beneath the surface of the ceiling drywall. As the spot where the water is leaking match with the spot the spot where the solar panel is installed, we suspect the leakage may have something to do with the panel. So we call the SunRun, they sent a field technician for evaluation. The result from the SunRun technician is that some of the metal thread studs were installed too deep. What was keeping the water out is the thick rubber patch that adhesive to roofing surface and the studs, now are no longer seal probably after 5 yrs exposure to cold and hot weather. Anyhow, before the technician left, he reassures us the same thing the sale person said to us five years ago that every damage that is solar panel relates, whether is to weather, neighbor's tree fall on my panel, are all cover by SunRun leasing warranty, nothing to worry about. Couple months later, SunRun slams us in the face with a quote that asks my family to pay for the removal of their panel, for an improper installation their contractor done 5 yrs ago. And the quote is $3969.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nV2oy",

"comment": "While the next version of the NEC has addressed most of the concerns, many first responders don't know about this. Plus, systems built before the current code don't comply to the rapid shutdown requirements. I am on a code writing group in MA working with the firefighters. In MA, the BBRS (building code org) rejected a portion of the fire code (NFP-1) that called for working paths and roof edge set-backs so firefighters could access the roof and cut ventilation. The code writing group I'm part of is attempting to write a less draconian version of that. I estimate that if we (MA) were to implement the NFP-1 version, it would cut array sizes down by 30% or more (on residential roofs). (Current NFP-1 would require a 3-foot boundary around all edges...). Oddly, we asked firefighters on the code committee what they do on metal roofs and they said \"We don't go on metal roofs\" - So the obvious question is, why do you want setbacks on a solar roof yet you don't go on metal roofs. Why can't you treat solar roofs like metal roofs.   FYI other states have already enacted roof access (Colorado and NY). NY requires one 30\" path on the street or driveway side of the home.  As many of you here know, selling solar is hard enough. Imagine having to introduce a 30\" \"Path\" on the most visible side of the home.....  Like it or not, this is a real issue and could dramatically impact the size of the array (and thus the ROI) of solar.",

"comment": "Generally, retrofitting batteries to a grid tied system is hard.  If your inverters will play nice with a battery powered inverter for an AC coupled system, great, but not all microinverters will do that.\n\nAnd there are some funky games you have to play because a microinverter setup is either \"all the power it can emit\" or off - so you can't clip power like you normally do on a DC system (where the charge controller just draws less from the panels when the batteries are full).\n\nVery few solar installers know the first thing about battery backed systems, so you're going to be heavily on your own unless you can find someone.\n\nWhich inverters do you have?\n\n... and all that said, if what you want is backup power for a few days, a backup generator is going to be so radically cheaper than a battery system that you should go that way.",

(He said that after the first LADWP refusal, we could submit a “Load Justification,“ but I got the vibe that he considered it a circuitous and/or if he process.) \n\nThe other two guys (from SunPower and Solar City) said there was absolutely no such limitation – that we could install any size system we wanted.\n\nI told one of those guys that I was getting conflicting answers, and asked him how I could independently research it. His answer was that I could try phoning LADWP, but that they don’t have much incentive to give me a straight answer because they don’t want me to install solar.\n\nAny thoughts on other ways to research this?

LG still makes awesome panels and as long as you have a good warranty through the company you are buying your solar from you shouldn't have anything to worry about.",

If you are forecasting battery storage to drastically decline in price, and solar is already the cheapest and falling continuously, then in 32 years, natural gas and coal are not going to be used. Coal is already struggling in 2018. There is no way it will make up 11% in 32 years.\n\nhttp://pvinsights.com/",

We are about at the stage where we are adding enough electrical power into the system to match the increase in demand and on track to drastically increases that over the next few years. So hopefully them pollution figures will start going down rather than up.\n\nThere are also tricks like the Chinese are experimenting with ways to grow things in deserts, often in the shade of solar power farms.

"comment": "I was reading an interesting opinion the other day about the United States Government subsidizing nuclear energy, and the writer made some interesting points, pointing out the success subsidiaries in renewable energy has had and the need to fund new nuclear technology. The problem with nuclear energy in the United States is simple—we are using outdated technology and not putting enough funding towards nuclear energy to expand it and make it more reasonable as an energy source. Nuclear energy would be a great base load source to backup renewable energy; however, new nuclear technology must be researched and funded—along with the nuclear energy industry being subsidized by the United States Government—for any progress to be made. I think there need to be a nuclear energy revolution in the United States for the county to see a surge in nuclear energy across the country. If new, updated nuclear technology can provide states with a reliable base load power source for renewable energy, there is no doubt in my mind that nuclear energy should be used. I find it absurd how politicians either outright deny nuclear energy or accept it, even though the majority of those who accept it are accepting old nuclear technology, not funding to update nuclear energy in the United States. \n\nNuclear energy, however, does have its flaws. Nuclear reactors are very expensive and take a long time to build. Additionally, in today’s time, nuclear energy must be placed near water in the United States, although I do not see this impeding the potential nuclear energy has in the future. \n\nEnergy storage has been making strides, but it will still have to make significant progress in the future to possibly make wind and solar energy base load power sources. If solar energy, for example, becomes a base load power source—due to energy storage—we would be able to trust solar energy to power the whole country. Concerns for it not being able to sustain cities due to the fact it cannot work at night will no longer be present, and solar energy will be able to live up close to its full potential. There is another option, a costly and ambitious option that may be implemented one day: solar energy in space. Because solar energy in space will be able to produce electricity all the time, a lot more electricity will be generated. Additionally, more sun will hit each solar panel. Spacecrafts use solar panels themselves, including the Kepler Spacecraft and the International Space Station. This idea, though, may not be technologically feasible at the moment and too expensive. For the time being, solar must be improved, as it has been for the past two decades. When solar energy is not generating electricity at night, the grid or stored electricity will have to be used, which is not ideal at the moment. Ultimately, the duck curve happens at night, a problem that will hopefully be fixed soon. \n\nIn the future, harnessing electricity from the cold and dark night could happen, but we may be far out from this. A Dyson Sphere may be created in a few thousand years to capture a large percentage of the sun’s energy output. \n\nIt is essential that solar panels are improved due to their future use to power colonies in space, which will depend on solar energy. A colony on Mars, for example, will use solar energy, but the solar energy used will generate far less electricity because less sun reaches its surface. This can pose a problem, and solar panels must be improved to prevent such problems in the foreseeable future.",

Vegan diet of local produce, with an electric car, second hand clothes, solar panels, wind turbines, tidal energy, protecting rain forests, reducing ocean pollution, and minimalism..etc. There are many ways people can help, I am all for them doing anything they can at this point. Save the world now, convert everyone to veganism in ten years when we have the time. A carbon tax will rather force everyone into a vegetarian lifestyle anyway. Eventually owning pets will be too expensive, too. Currently pets account for [30% meat consumption](https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-08-09-pet-cats-and-dogs-eat-almost-30-of-the-total-meat-consumption-in-the-usa.html). So honestly, we have to fix the humans' diets and limit the massive breeding of animals. Would as many people own dogs if dog food cost twice as much? That carbon pricing would fix itself if it is adopted as policy. There will be a massive culture shift in the next decade in many areas of our lives. The way people view purchasing goods, to consuming food, to housing, to transportation, to pet ownership; all those things will likely be changed.",

If you could plug in a trailer that had enough battery to negate its own drag, that would be amazing.  Putting a 200 kWh battery in a camper trailer would not only add to the range it could be towed, but make it somewhat self sustaining when it got there.  Throw some solar panels on top and the experience would be completely different.",

You can put them on your house and fully power it without a grid connection if you have enough of them.\n\nSolar panels on a car don't produce a ton of energy (likely ~1 kw per hour for these at most) but over 5 solar hours on average in the US that's 5 kwh. A tesla gets 3.3 miles per kwh roughly, which would be 16 miles a day for a conventional vehicle. This gets 40 miles per day because it is much more aerodynamic.\n\nThey aren't saying it's some perpetual motion machine. They aren't saying it can drive indefinitely.

"comment": "Many have tried, but they all eventually failed. (I cannot think of any success story of being fully integrated) \n\nMaking reliable inverter/module and make a profit is hard.  Building project and be profitable is also hard.  The two don't really intersect well because of very different cash flow profile.  and that is key. \n\nAlso, to make inverter cheap/reliable enough, a lot of volume is needed. More volume then a single company can purchase.  So, this means, you also need to be able to sell inverter/modules to companies that will also sees you as a competitor to bring down your cost and improve reliability. \n\nSunPower had a hard time with their microinverter business because of cashflow and lack of volume. They sold that business to Enphase. Tesla wants/tried make their own inverter, but are they successful at it? (that's debatable)\n\nSunPower and First Solar are probably the two most vertically integrated company and pure play.   Tesla also has a high level of integration but is not pure solar play.",

"comment": "Naomi Klein's analysis is mostly wrong, in my opinion.\n\nThe real problem is that all people are hypocrites by nature. Evolution formed our brains and minds in such a way that we basically choose moral norms like we choose wine in a supermarket: Sometimes this one, other times that one. Usually, we pick the moral norm that favors our own social and material interests. Also, we're oblivious that we do.\n\nInterestingly, Naomi Klein both sees, and fails to see the hypocrisy, depending whether it suits her desired conclusion, or not.\n\nFor instance, it's not just billionaires. In the beginning of the book, she documents the hypocrisy of some environmentalist group. Initially, it fought one of those supposedly evil oil corporations to save some minor species. And they won! As a result, the corporation donated the land and the associated rights to the environment group. Years later, the environmentalist group sold the rights to oil companies. Obviously, that minor species wasn't important, anymore. This is the hypocrisy Klein notices.\n\nIn the end of the book, however, she mentions some small Greek island in a similar situation. Again, it's some supposedly evil oil corporation that needs to be fought in the name of the environment. But did they do it because of the environment? Or to save their incomes (mostly agriculture and tourism as Klein notices)? Well, when the threat was over the people on the island bought no solar panels, or electric cars. This suggests they were not trying to preserve the environment. They used the environmental argument merely a moralistic means to an (selfish) end. This is also hypocrisy, but Klein fails to see it.\n\nFinally, Klein fails to note her own hypocrisy. At least, she's honest by mentioning that she didn't give a damn about climate change until she made the connection that it's another means to get what she really wants -- namely to blame capitalism for everything (which so happens to help her gain prestige among her peers and sell books and articles).\n\nClimate change won't be stopped by playing the blame game. That's a distraction.",

Backfeed- with 7 powerwalls and 30kw of solar you're talking about potentially ~370A of back feed at 240v split phase. Make sure your electrical panel can handle that much power because you will need a commercial grade service from utility.\n2. Tesla uses what's called storm watch to proactively charge the battery, the batteries are ALWAYS ready to backup your home if you lose power.\n3. This is a very large and expensive system.\n Much,much larger than the average residential systems. Make sure you need that much.\n4. The ev charger is independent from solar or powerwall. It will be compatible.",

"comment": "1. My apologies, I was intending to say that no modern climate advocate I’ve seen argues for only a carbon tax and removing everything else. (Bill Gates for example) You're entirely correct that only doing a carbon tax and nothing else is a terrible idea, but it's a positive influence if added alongside other things.\n2. Consumerism is objectively not the issue. If we look at the EPA’s breakdown of America (arguably the most consumerist country out there) the total% of our carbon that is from industry is 22%, of that, only about ⅓ is actually from things such as plastics production.\n\n&gt;A smaller amount of direct emissions, roughly one third, come from leaks from natural gas and petroleum systems, the use of fuels in production (e.g., petroleum products used to make plastics), and chemical reactions during the production of chemicals, iron and steel, and cement.\n\nWe can also look at China, which has been producing much of the world’s stuff in the past, if we look at that, especially their CO2 now and when they were producing much of the world’s goods, we can see that a) they only increased their CO2 very recently and b) with that increase, it’s mostly from power generation and production for local goods, i.e. the U.S. isn’t just outsourcing a ton of carbon from the above argument.\n\nWhile other sections, like transportation, do contribute to our total CO2E output and are influenced by consumption, they are sections that we already have proven technology and are already targeting (solar power, EVs, new farming practices). These changes are already economical, and a carbon tax would only make it even more profitable to switch.\n\nYou are highly overestimating the carbon effects of the production of goods. On a human scale, goods are a small % of our total emissions, most are from massive industrial processes inherent to human life, and that we can pretty simply (in theory) cut down. New technology and it becoming cheaper than fossil fuel options is key, and that’s why we need a carbon tax.\n\n3. Yeah, the thing with China and India, is that if you look at their CO2 emissions, they’re rapidly climbing. If they get anywhere close to that of developed countries per capita (which is mostly due to electricity and transportation emissions, that doesn’t change no matter the country). We need tech to help them here, otherwise, you’re promoting going to war with them, which probably would actually make more CO2 just due to the total emissions from the entire military being spooled up and stuff.\n\n&gt;\\&gt;The root of the problem is the simple fact that infinite growth on a finite planet cannot stand\n\nI don’t think you understand how massive this planet is. Obviously, infinite growth isn’t possible, but we’re nowhere near the carrying capacity of our planet if we are carbon neutral. Particularly as we are going to have to use alternative meat products anyways, as it’s just mathematically more efficient use of energy. (also we're gonna be moving in the direction of space in the next 50 years anyways)\n\nOutrage very often leads to misinformation, staying fully informed allows us to tackle our challenges directly, pragmatically, and efficiently. As someone with a pretty strong sense of morality, I cannot support any war or massively evil actions if we have superior alternatives.",

By 25 years, you are probably at least considering a roof replacement, which has a cost increased associated with solar panels.  A 10 year old system is not worth the same amount as a brand new system.  Just like a 5 year old car isn't worth the same as a brand new car.  My main point is that strictly from a financial perspective, I would much rather have a 10% annual return on a stock market investment than a solar system with a 10 year payback.",

Some folks don’t care about cost and want the best. Other folks don’t care about cost and want to generate as much clean power as they can. To answer that question it would be a good idea to know what’s driving your friend to look at solar in the first place. If it’s savings then going with something other than SunPower is probably worth getting other quotes.",

So that shouldn't be an issue for you.\n\nPG&amp;E and other CA utilities are working on changes to net metering, which COULD impact you if you don't have your system installed soon. But, nobody knows exactly what those changes would be. And, I suspect, even if they lower the credit that you get for excess electricity production, that won't be worse than the extra $2.24/W these solar installers are trying to charge you. Plus, you will have a Powerwall to help mitigate the impacts of net metering changes, by using more of the energy your produce (versus selling it back to PG&amp;E).\n\nI personally would go with the Tesla system at that price versus your local installer. $5.19, even with a Powerwall, sounds like a ripoff to me.",

"comment": "So BE is 2.777 per watt, sun run is at 4.863 per watt, sunpower is 4.248 per watt. So isn't it a no brainer even before the warranty? Though why is sunpower system larger than others? Can't the other fit even 5kw?\n\n2.77 per kw isn't too good to be true, seems standard. Is it string, optimizers or microinverters? you should mention that.\n\nTesla solar panels is 25 years warranty, 10 years is on the comprehensive warranty.\n\nSo your question my guess is how important is workmanship/labor warranty? My opinion in general is the most expensive part of the warranty is labor. And will be so going forward as solar continues to get cheaper but labor probably won't (even if new installs become cheaper). It's even better if both installer and manufacturer have warranty cause just in case anything happens to the installer, the manufacturer has your back. That said, I would go to the tune of paying double for the warranty. Why? Because if it doubles your payback period what's the point?\n\nI would try getting more quotes, especially see if they can get more than 3kw up there. And you can definitely get even sunpower at lower prices than that, try a dealer over the original.\n\nYou should redo your roof if it needs to be done within next few years.\n\nAs for communication, it is hard to judge communication of sales person with communication of support. Many may have great salespeople but support can be lukewarm. It is better to research what people say about them in general.",

But if you pay off the 3.9% interest loan early you’ve basically wasted the money you paid upfront to get a below market loan. \n\nThe lease can also be paid off early but will be a much higher total payment. And buyers will often just insist you pay off this stuff as part of Closing. The Buyer might not even be able to really understand the terms of the lease or the loan, or it’s value in terms of what it does for your utility bill. \n\nI’m pretty sure when you look into this more, you will opt to buy and take smaller loan at market rate. In three years you might be able to take out a HELOC on your home at some lower interest rate and just take out the high rate solar loan. \n\nHere is some bigger advice. You know how there was a rush to qualify under NEM 2.0 earlier this year? The solar crews are going to be building those jobs for the rest of 2023. I’d just park this idea for six months. The solar installers will be much more hungry for jobs by then is my prediction. I would not be surprised if that knocks $15,000 off this job.",

This is because the “demand for electricity remains high and there is less solar energy available.” It turns out you can’t run a state of roughly 39 million people entirely on solar panels.

"comment": "Do you have a soul? Ethics? Morals? \n\nCan you sleep at night knowing you put crushing debt onto someone for an inferior, trouble prone product with little to no return on investment? \n\nI've been off grid for about 33 years, I built my own system from used panels to whatever I could scrounge, so I know what will and what does not work... \n\nIt takes about 10 years of actual hands on experience to be able to tell what will, and what won't work, and I haven't met a 'Salesman' yet with that experience.\n\nIt's much like being a salesman for drug companies and later found out the drugs you sold cause birth defects, cancer, neurological problems... You made good money, but can you sleep knowing you even indirectly killed or crippled people, ruined lives. \n\nNow, having said that... \n\nOne of my side businesses has been TROUBLE SHOOTING and consulting on solar projects. Trouble shooting is a real eye opener into what works & what doesn't, and what goes wrong with systems.\n\nWhen I say use conduit or armor on ALL wires/cables (yes, I know the difference) it's from direct, and hard won experience. \n\nWhen I say use BOTH crimp & electrical solder on heavy cables/lugs, it's very hard won experience. \n\nWhen I say to keep away from propritary systems and micro-inverter systems, there are VERY good, and very common reasons for that advise. \n\nYou won't make 52 thousand a month with a reputable company selling household installs. The company is cutting corners somewhere, product quality, less than reputable installers, they are cutting corners somewhere. Decide if you want to be a part of organized fraud or not.\n\nI recently pulled 40 thousand on an industral install, my commission on all top quality products, top end installers, but it was a 4 million dollar project. You aren't going to see many of those since you don't have the knowledge/experience to know what the best is currently. \n\nSince this isn't my primary source of income, I spend most of my time fixing what others have screwed thw pooch on, like finding solutions getting around failed propritary micro-inverter systems so existing systems actually work.\n\nDo you know thw difference between a standard grid tied, inverter based system, a hybrid inverter based system, and off grid inverter based system, and a power managment based system?\n\nIf not, you have a STEEP learning curve ahead of you, otherwise you will just be reading a company propaganda sheet.\n\nI can equate this to the government hurricane relief money. The government paid $1,000 a square for roof repairs, but the companies only paid the fly by night installers $100 a square, which was mostly just tarps and not actual roofing. A huge fraud that left the home owner picking up the bills for actual roof repair.\n\nThere are hundreds of examples of this 'Boom Market' fraud, and right now the solar tax credits, rebates and grants are doing exactly the same thing. \n\nWhat I do is completely different. \n\nI assess the situation, I don't sell any products, I can recommend what will and won't work, I basically filter the noise, bullshit and lies for the buyer, and I get systems working as well as they can when they have already been purchased. \n\nI sleep just fine at night since a lot of what I do I don't even charge for. No sense in charging someone that has a problem I've seen 300 times before, I'm not selling any product or doing the install. I can do it over the internet when I'm wasting time in semi-retirement so why charge for it? \n\nParticularly from someone that has already been ripped off seven ways from sunday...\n\nThe manufacturer SAYS they use 'Gorilla Glass'? I'll get a bucket of baseballs to test that claim... The manufacturer claims their battery cells won't fail with fire? I drive nails and bolts through them, even shoot them with rifle bullets to confirm that claim. \n\nA 'Good' installer uses armor on wires EVERYWHERE because UV light is everywhere, birds and rodents are everywhere... even where code says it doesn't need added protection. Been there, done that, have the repair part receipts, busted knuckles to prove it.\n\n'Code' is the absloute bare minimum requirements to be 'safe'. A good installer protects THE SYSTEM for the long haul, doesn't stop at just 'Code Compliant'.\n\nNo such thing as a free lunch, and no such thing as free money. Someone is paying somewhere, and if you have morals & ethics, then there is a learning curve to know the difference.",

"comment": "I agree that $2.88/watt is suspiciously low. \n\nBut to answer your basic question:\n\nFirst, there's no absolute reason you need to aim for 100% unless that happens to be your goal for environmental reasons, etc. In my view, the question is which proposal is ultimately a better financial investment. \n\nThe basic inputs for the math are your all-in costs and how much you expect to save in electricity costs. I'd recommend you assume that electricity rates (especially in Mass.) will rise well above the rate of inflation. You can just use historic utility bills to get a baseline for what you'll save, but it'll probably be much better than that over time as rates go up.\n\nSimple Payback is a common metric, but I'd calculate your Levelized Cost of Energy and Internal Rate of Return. LCOE is the effect rate (cents per kwh) you've locked in for the life of your panels. You can compare that to current and expected utility rates. (My LCOE is 11 cents/kwh compared with current the Central Maine Power rate of 23 cents.) IRR is the annual compound rate for your investment, which lets you compare solar vs what you might expect if you invested that money in the market. Mine is around 9 percent, which I think is damn good considering that's it's guaranteed and effectively inflation-proof. I'd note that my numbers are based on 1-to-1 net metering.\n\nWhat's your basis for annual solar production from those 26 panels? Solar installers use different design models and I expect some are much more sophisticated and accurate than others (mine used Aurora). You should also run the numbers yourself through PVWatts if you haven't done that already. It's possible that the installers are being conservative and that your actual production might be higher than their estimates and that the smaller system might be enough.",

"comment": "raw vegans can eat anything that is edible raw, and is vegan. So, not so much potatoes and butternut squash, but almost everything else.. All the greens, which can be classified as either tender (lettuces, sprouts, celery, spinach counts I think) or of the dark green type, often tougher type, like mostly kale.. but I think also chard, collards, maybe mustard greens. Summer squash like zucchini might go in this category, too. I can't think of too many other veggies that are edible raw.. carrots...\n\nThen all the fruits, including avocados, durian if you can handle it, coconut and young coconut (these being sources of fat). Dates and bananas often are featured a lot, as are other tropical fruits such as pineapple and mangoes. So many fruits.\n\nThen there are also nuts and seeds. Though some sects of raw also eat low-fat, so they choose not to consume these.\n\nAnd then some grains as well, sprouted. Gabriel Cousen's is big on sprouted buckwheat, which I personally find delicious with some stevia, cinnamon, and vegan milk. Some people sprout everything else, too--quinoa, kamut/spelt, wild rice.\n\nAnd then some include raw, unprocessed oils like coconut and olive, some do raw vinegar. There's all kinds of raw agave sweeteners now. You can make raw [insert nut] milk (they sometimes spell it 'mylk') by soaking nuts, then pureeing them in a blender with some water and straining out everything but the liquid. Then there's using raw cacao, mesquite, maca, gourmet mushrooms, algae, and just all manner of jaw-droppingly expensive silliness to spend money on :)\n\nSo, hope that answers you somewhat. I was raw vegan for a while and still am somewhat hooked in, so I can answer more if you have more specific questions.",

Because I don't know what the fuck to do, and I feel so helpless, I want to save every animal, but I can't, and it makes me feel so.... empty, angry, frustrated and useless.\n\nyou're not the first person to experience powerlessness. and veganism isn't the only philosophy out there that gets shunned by mainstream politics.\n\nlook at the violence and death created through US drug policy. tens of thousands of people have died through our policies and our economic power and our demand for drugs. the demand for drugs isn't going away. and the economic disparity between the US and Mexico isn't going away any time soon, so it seems entirely rational to begin restructuring US drug policy.\n\nbut that's not going to happen any time soon. no matter how many people die, and no matter how much evidence piles up, there's no real political will to rethink prohibition in the US. despite the deaths and despite lawless zone we've created on the border, people are generally okay with the status quo.\n\nhow does someone deal with that kind of stubborn ignorance? how is anyone supposed to cope with the idea that their society is complicit establishing law that kills people?\n\nyou don't. that's the truth of it. you let it go and you move on. you can only affect your life and the lives close to you.",

R/vegan believes that eating a plant-centric diet is healthier, less selfish, more efficient (in the sense of trophic levels), and doesn't involve the cruel, unsanitary practice of factory farming animals.

This is how it is defined by the people who came up with the term so most of us reject how the media has come to use the word.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nIf you're following a plant based diet because it's healthier or better for the environment then who gives a shit if you cave once in 2013? It's not going to add in any meaningful amount of environmental harm and it's not going to negate the healthy food you put into your body for the rest of the year. But if you're operating under the premise that eating meat is wrong, like most of us are, then it's not really okay to accept that you'll probably cave and have a \"I no longer care about my morals\" day once a month.\n\nAlso, I always despise getting into discussions with you because you invariably do something mindboggling annoying each time. Like trying to point out logical fallacies while giving me a false dilemma.",

You can look up a meal planner like https://www.eatthismuch.com/. It has a vegan option so that's really helpful. It will also keep you from getting bored! \n\nWhen I'm confused about what to eat I stick to a basic protein+ carb+ vegetetables/fruit.\n\n* chickpeas, brown rice, and broccoli\n\n* seitan, potatoes, and green beans \n\n* black beans, quinoa, and bell pepper \n\n* peanut butter, oatmeal, banana\n\n* tofu scramble, breakfast potatoes, avocado\n\nAnd so on and so forth. It's pretty hard to mess up that way and adding different sauces (salsa, bbq, terriyaki, hummus, tahini dressing, satay, etc) makes it more interesting. I don't strictly eat that kind of meal set up, but when I have no clue then it's nice to have a fall back plan. I imagine if you have a rice cooker then you can just throw things in at once (unless you're using dried beans, then maybe not) and it's super easy for college life/ busy people.",

"comment": "I'm going to take focus off hunting. Though I do know people who consider it necessary to be able to supplement their family's food budget, I doubt there's much swaying you on that.\n\nHowever...\n\n&gt; As long as you consider taking a sentient life unnecessarily to be a morally neutral act, then we still have a vast chasm between us.\n\nI think I figured out where we differ: necessity.\n\nHumans evolved eating meat as a primary source of calories. If you look at the function and form human digestive system against other carnivorous species, there are striking differences. Much archaeology has shown that primary calories were meat, and thoughtful logic says that must have also been the case, since no fruit or vegetable we know existed for most of human history. Prior to agriculture, the occasional tuber or tiny berry was available some honey if you can avoid the bees, but similar to animals like bears and wolves, humanity had a meat-based diet with some occasional non-meat additions. (If you want more info, please ask or visit /r/zerocarb)\n\nThat said, I assume you wouldn't put a dog on a vegan diet. It's not optimally healthy for them, even if you can make it work.\n\nMy own research (and, yes, I researched veganism and vegetarianism for my health issues, but there was no reasonable way to make it work for me) has led me to believe that it's similar for humans. One can make an all vegetation-based diet work, even make it work well, but it's not optimal for human biology. It's far better than the Standard American Diet, but there's no way it's optimal based on our evolutionary past.\n\nCurrently, killing animals is necessary for *my* health, certainly, as I've outlined elsewhere. I also think that meat is an optimal food source for the general population and not truly replaceable without hacking your diet (or eating *some* animal product). Maybe it's morally neutral, maybe its negative. Some religions specifically give the animals to humans for stewardship and consumption, so I guess it depends on your moral guidelines.\n\nIf it's evil, it's a necessary evil. Burning fossil fuels and paying for the destruction of innocents in foreign countries are necessary evils (since you can't avoid all fossil fuels, and taxes are mandated at the point of a gun regardless of how they're spent).\n\n***\n\nAs I said, if we can eventually create a similar nutrition profile from lab-grown meat at a price within my reach, I will purchase that over killing animals. I don't like killing them and I don't like doing it myself, but my options are limited.\n\nFor now, I'll draw the line at recognizable intelligence* and self-awareness and avoid eating greater apes, dolphins, whales, and elephants.\n\n*_we went this entire discussion without considering the inconclusive possibility of a foreign intelligence in plants._",

There is no pinnacle of evolutionary development - we evolve through adaptation to what's around us, and that continues as long as the environment changes. It's not so much that we 'evolved TO' eat meat, more that we evolved BECAUSE we ate meat. It's a shame, but the protein sources relied upon by most vegans nowadays weren't available to early hominids. And it didn't much matter that meat caused health issues in the long run because the survival of the species relies only on survival to a point where you've procreated and raised your offspring to be self-sufficient. Evolution isn't concerned with longevity. We've reached this point because we evolved with the ability to eat as omnivores. \n\nLuckily nowadays we know that vegan diets can be superior both ethically and from a health perspective. I don't think understanding that meat consumption aided the proliferation of the species in the distant past in any way diminishes the justification for veganism now. Just as you say, we can eat with our brains now.",

Protein in larger doses can be turned into glucose while the breakdown of fat results in ketone bodies. As ketone levels increase blood glucose decreases. Ketones provide a preferential energy source yielding more energy per oxygen molecule when compared to glucose. One of the benefits of ketosis is insulin sensitivity increases because you generally have a very stable blood sugar due to the ketone production and or use of exogenous ketones.",

"comment": "Agree with what has been said about Seed and the Gumbo Shop. \n\nDepending on your transportation options, around the city there are a few other vegan-friendly places with New Orleans-y food. Parkway Po-Boys is a popular po-boy place in Mid City and has sweet potato fry po-boys (yes, terribly unhealthy, but YUM, make sure no dressing though). Breads on Oak is Uptown and has vegan king cake (not sure if they sell it by the slice, but they most likely do, and have other amazing baked goods and food). Carmo is downtown and has tropical-style foods. All of these are totally omni-friendly. Also, I recommend Satsuma Cafe! There is one Uptown and I think one in the Bywater or maybe the Marigny. It isn't \"New Orleans\"-specific but it is a good healthy place to balance out the other food :)\n\nI have been vegan in New Orleans for years, no vegetarian/vegan friends, and still manage to eat out with my friends all the time with no issue! Have fun and be safe!",

Vegans will also dispute the work of Allan Savory but support false meat made by centralised corporations which remove farming skills and further centralise food distribution. Look where that's got us.\n\n I 'd like to hear from a Vegan whom is actually a Vegan .I don't believe it's possible.",

You can try providing education and resources to those around you, but most of them won't bother learning. It's easier to turn a blind eye to it and make bacon jokes. \n\nThat's why it can be nice to have places like this to vent too, and hopefully you can make like minded friends.

You're just outright ignorant to Islam in India and South Asia, it seems. There is a large vegan Muslim movement in India. YOU are being delusional.",

And I still struggle every day with my body image.\n\nBut veganism has improved my relationship with food. I make almost all of my own meals, and I'm constantly trying new foods. It's so exciting to try new recipes, especially while baking! And then, I can share those recipes with others, and improve my techniques. For the first time in my life, I love eating because it's a process that I own, that I have control over.\n\nAnd I don't feel at all restricted. When I see something that isn't vegan that I want, I find a replacement, or I veganize it myself. It's so energizing knowing that there's nothing I can't eat. I can make my mother's meat loaf, or her homemade pizza, all vegan, and it tastes the same. That's exciting, and it gives me even more reason to eat.\n\nLike I said, I don't think any of that will help you, but I just wanted to say it!",

The reason why there would be a lack of wild bees is a lack of resources/habitats. Livestock bees would compete with native bees for these resources, and drive the population down even further. \n\nThird, in order to breed bees, males are killed to extract their sperm. Buying bees contributes to this. \n\nFourth, bees don’t “drop honey like fruit”. Like all non-vegans you’re incredibly ignorant. The honey remains in the honeycomb in their hives. They need it for food. In order to extract this, the trays are removed, which risks squashing the bees every time. \n\nThe honey is replaced with cheap syrups, which are unhealthy and leave domestic bees susceptible to diseases, which are devastating bees around the world by spreading to wild bee populations.\n\nFinally, coming onto a vegan sub to proselytise your favourite myths about your favourite animal product is not respectful at all.",
