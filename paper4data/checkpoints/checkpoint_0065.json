"comment": "No, I didn't imply lease. The Federal Tax Credit for a residential installation is 30% on a $50k install is $15k. If the incentive was given 1.5 years ago - customer only keeps $4,500 of the $15k tax credit.\n\nNothing related to Lessing. If the modules were leased - this isn't a conversation as customer has zero rights to modules.\n\nAs a side - the total value of the hardware on the open market is probably worth less than $13,000. Let's say those 33 modules were 250W each - that's about 8,250W. Right now I can buy, brand new, that hardware (modules, racking, inverter) for less than $2/W (retail price - if I were buying as a builder it would cost closer to $1.40/W: $11,500).\n\nThat $16k - is closer to a used price of: $10-13k MAX. Customer will owe the Feds $10,500.**It does NOT make sense to remove from house.** Total profit will be a few thousand, at most.\n\nFind a house buyer who want solar. Add $35k to price of house - don't negotiate solar system price. This isn't a bathroom or a judgment call of value - it is an absolute value equivalent to the commodity it produces.",

I see guys in town with street rod plates lots of times.  I live a block away from the bars so I see these in the lot and spot the owner.  \n\n\nI'm saying I want an electric vehicle with street rod plates.  It needs to tow and at least drive across a plowed field.  Internal combustion engines can start a fire in the fields in fall so electric is most safe for bringing out to a tractor. \n\n\n300 straight 6 is a solid motor and I think it will burn the gas at a constant RPM.  It has perfect balance and a decently low compression ratio.  It would be burning wood and I guess I could pay close attention to the emissions.  The idea is that on long trips I need to stop and get some wood for the gasifier.  Otherwise the electric range on the car fulfills my need of 10 miles per day.\n\n\nThis needs to be pretty good during winter.  I'd bundle up real good for the ride.  Maybe I'd even get some Mattracks and take the ditch.",

But as solar, wind and nuclear take hold Tesla's will do a lot of good. Your view point condemning them is very near sighted.\n\n3. Even if we ignore the facts above, and pretend we live in a fantasy world where anyone who is earning money is an asshole and coal is the only source of energy, what's the harm in improving the product?

I don't own a Tesla and never will.\n\n&gt;Fuel cell is just a different type of battery.\n\nYes, an insanely complex one.\n\n&gt;They literally produce water. Nothing more, nothing less, just pure, clear H2O. How is that pollution?\n\nYou're forgetting about the production of the fuel.\n\n&gt;You don't have an EV. You refuel your car at a refueling station.\n\nAnd? I would much rather have an EV that I could charge at home, so would a lot of people.\n\n&gt;There is one for hydrogen in my city because a few city buses are running on hydrogen. \n\nOne, wow! So maybe you have to spend 2 hours of your day driving to it and back?\n\n&gt;It's way cheaper than gasoline, too.\n\nOnly because it's heavily subsidized. Electricity for an EV is also much cheaper than gasoline, and that's not subsidized nearly as heavily.\n\n&gt;And unlike electric batteries, this one will just keep on running because the capacity will not drop with time.\n\nFuel cell longevity is a massive problem that fuel cell makers are trying to overcome, they can't even compete with batteries yet. HFCVs use large lithium batteries anyway, in addition to the fuel cell.\n\n&gt;Two comments ago you said that this is the main reason.\n\nNo I didn't.\n\n&gt;I'd like to note that Toyota Mirai has an extremely tough hydrogen tank, reinforced with carbon fiber and all that. It's way safer than your normal gasoline car.\n\nCouldn't care less. It also costs a fortune, looks like dogshit and doesn't offer any benefits over a Toyota Prius.\n\n&gt;Please use the whole quote.\n\nThat's not the rest of the quote. This is the rest of the quote: \n\n\"...and less often from more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water.\"\n\nHydrogen isn't produced primarily with electrolysis because electrolysis uses a lot of energy, energy is expensive. Producing energy also pollutes.\n\nEither way, it's much, MUCH more efficient to use electricity to charge an EV than it is to use it to produce hydrogen for a HFCV.\n\n&gt;Everyone agrees that electrolysis is now the best option because it would allow local production of hydrogen.\n\nMost people understand that electricity doesn't come out of thin air. \n\n&gt;...but solar cells are improving daily, so we might just have a sufficiently good system in another decade or so.\n\nWhy not just use the electricity to power an EV directly?\n\n&gt;Also, most developed countries are trying to move away from fossil fuels and onto renewables.\n\nWhich isn't going to happen if we're still using a fossil fuel like hydrogen.\n\n&gt;Using solar and wind power to generate hydrogen is every Green party's dream.\n\nUsing it to power BEVs is the green party's dream, HFCVs are useless crap.",

"comment": "Despite the age of the article, it truly is an excellent read for helping to get one's head around the growing number of advantages that come with regenerative braking and dual motor systems.  I've been following EVs for years and still found some points that were new to me:\n\n\n1.  Regenerative braking has yet to reach its full potential because manufacturers are engineering for new EV drivers who have ICE driving habits.\n\n\n2.  Furthermore, regenerative braking has the potential to be more effective when applied to more axles or wheels because of the way that brake force is distributed during harder stops versus mild stops.  Most of today's systems just use it for the front or rear axle.\n\n\n3.  The reliability of vehicles can be greatly increased by distributing the work of moving or slowing the vehicle between the front and rear axles using dual electric motor systems (he doesn't mention it but in the future, we may see systems that have a motor for each wheel).  \n\n\nIt's worth the read.  \n\nAt the end, he made some predictions - for fun we can look to see how many are happening.",

The same will happen with the truck, no exception. The range will double by 2025 and they will meet the range, acceleration targets.\n\n&gt;Every manufacturer improves his car over time otherwise the customers wouldn't have any incentives to upgrade.\n\nWe're talking about Tesla specifically and how other manufacturers doubt their claims for the truck. \n\n&gt;It's strange since the German Wikipedia states a 5.7 second 0-60 time in the first batch but maybe that one is wrong. \n\nDid they also make 2 versions with under 4 seconds acceleration time? They did.\n\n&gt;What in \"the current development of batteries doesn't allow for faster timelines\" says that it's impossible? It literally says that they think it's possible just not in the time frame Tesla provides. \n\nThe context being their up to 26t and 240 kWh truck for the timeline mentioned. It could either be price per kWh or energy density, or both. Either way the joke about physics being different in the new world would suggest that energy density is blamed as not being good enough for Daimler to make such a truck and that's why they don't believe Tesla can do it as well. Also, who is stopping Daimler from making a 1000 km range heavy truck and sell it for $300000? If the current batteries are not the issue but the price, they could have told that instead.\n\n&gt;This Mercedes is already on the road at customers who test the truck and give feedback. In Tesla terms it's basically released. \n\nThat 240 kWh truck? It's the truck version of compliance cars. It's like telling me in 2010 that Nissan launched Leaf ahead of the Model S.",

That doesn't mean, however, that scaling up our current renewable technology would be anything short of a massive affront to the environment. The point isn't to demonize \"renewables\" entirely but to acknowledge that they aren't suitable as a 1-to-1 replacement for our existing fossil fuel based technology. We need to rely on them just enough to keep people from going hungry, but shouldn't expect 2 Tesla's and a power wall in every garage. If you can't admit that then you're the one who might need to examine your agenda.",

So what will happen is the bigger EVs will have a lot bigger monthly payment, and people will end up opting for the smaller monthly payment.\n\nI went through a period where everything was extremely tight financially. Take away from that was how much cars actually cost when you add up everything. And yes everyone focuses on price or worse monthly payments. Over the life of a vehicle, capital cost is only a third of that total cost.\n\nBut I think you will see electric cars get bigger and less aerodynamic, but it'll be slow and dependent on lower battery costs.",

It used to be that the weather was something strangers could talk about without accidentally offending each other, but it's been weaponized to instill fear and divide us.  You can't read any weather report, even perfectly normal, expected weather without the implied doomsday scenario in the subtext.  The media knows fear sells, so they constantly provoke fear in readers for nothing more than the mundane task of selling advertising.  Meanwhile there is now a formal psychological disorder called Climate Change Anxiety Disorder.  You basically have to just stop reading the news media, since it's now setup to get eyeballs at any cost just to sell more soap.  What an utter embarrassment the media have become in this country.",

Do you have any idea how outnumbered America is vs China and India? Billions more people ok.. so yeah overall China is waaaay worse than America. Geeze it's like talking to kindergarten kids.\n\nPer capita. ... You are out of your depthif you didn't understand that website you quoted.\n\nSo per capita is different than overall. \n\nOverall China and it's billions of people are way worse than America and its 327 million people vs China and it's 1.36 billion people.. the population of China does more damage via greenhouse gasses just by farting every year compared to America's total emissions..\nSame with India's 1.39 billion people.\n\nSo you are comparing a tiny population of 327 million to more than 5 billion people (China, India, Russia, Asia, africa) and somehow think we are worse..or even in the running... Or truthfully.. not even in the ballpark as far as global emissions are concerned FFS. Compared to those guys we are a tiny fraction. And if those guys don't at by the rules it won't matter what brand of electric car you buy. And why should all Americans get fucked so China and the rest can carry on doing whatever the fuck they want? Just so you can virtue signal what a great person you are for putting your farts in a jar and heating your house with them?\n\nWake up. That was the stupidest argument yet .. I've never ...

Some idiot replied telling me there is a “volume control” on the passenger side (completely irrelevant to my complaint about a lack of physical buttons/knobs). My reply to that is what got downvoted by you angry bois.\n\n&gt;\tYou can tap and hold on the volume arrows on the scree\n\nDo you use the volume buttons on your cellphone to change volume or do you use the touchscreen? \n\n&gt;\tYou can tap and hold on the volume arrows on the screen rather than needing to continually twist a knob. \n\nI much prefer a chunk knob that I can blindly twist than a 1/4” of touch that requires my eyes to locate. \n\nI would also rather twist a knob the hold a button for a similar reason that I prefer playing FPS with mouse rather than a controller. \n\n&gt;\tAlso, in most vehicles the volume is on the driver’s side of the infotainment system. Which means there isn’t a knob on the passenger side.\n\nFortunately for every passenger in nearly every car, most center stacks are the same width as the arm rest (the model 3 being one of the few exceptions). This means that a control on the driver’s side is likely only about 6” from the passengers arm rest (which is coincidentally about the same distance as the volume “buttons” on the model 3 are from the passenger arm rest.\n\nYour logic would also mean that the driver wouldn’t be able to access controls on the passenger side of the center stack as well, which isn’t true. \n\n&gt;\tAnd of course there are shortcuts for mute. But. You don’t seem to be as interested in those kinds of things.\n\nCouldn’t care less. My desire is to adjust the audio up or down when I’m in the car talking with my friend and family, not to completely turn it off. \n\nAlso, most cars *also* have a “shortcut” for mute. Pressing the volume knob. \n\n&gt;\tSo I guess most vehicles suck and none of them have what you like?\n\nActually the opposite. As just stated, most vehicles figured this out a long time ago, which is why I find it so off putting.",

It might even be a similar powertrain to that of their Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivan that actually gets fantastic reviews. I think Chrysler is going to have to be pulled kicking and screaming (aka EPA requirements) to offer a large amount of pure BEVs and do so on a national scale and not just in CARB states...\n\nThat being said with some European ownership that's going harder on EVs that might really help them get there unlike say, Honda and Toyota in particular who are the most recalcitrant and conservative of all the automakers...

"comment": "&gt; Comparing the average mpg of vehicles from 2001 to only the EVs that have thus far been produced isn't exactly an apples to apples comparison.\n\nSure, I can agree to that.  But I think that a transition to BEVs is going to push people into smaller cars naturally.  Range is a big deal to many people and if you're driving a mid-size or compact SUV instead of a full size SUV, you're going to get more range.\n\n&gt; I imagine most of the BEVs produced and sold thus far are smaller sedans, replacing smaller sedans.\n\nI think you're probably seeing to some degree a down-sizing.  Given the range discussion above, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if most people were \"downgrading\" by a class or two.  Someone who used to be a mid-sized car driver is now in a compact.  If you used to drive a mid-size SUV, you might be in a mid-size BEV now.  Would be fascinating to see a large scale study.\n\n\n&gt;A lot of people who have never owned a truck have suddenly gotten interested in buying an electric truck.\n\nI think the amount of people doing this is very small.  And if they are, I think it's people who are getting larger incomes and would be looking to move up in car anyways.  So, sure, the ICE mid-size sedan to a BEV Pick-up comparison isn't that great, but if they would have been moving to an ICE Full Size SUV instead, than a BEV pick-up would be way better.\n\n&gt;Replacing a 50 mpg Prius with a model 3 SR+ (most efficient EV around right now) is a 72% emissions reduction for fuel in California. Adding in manufacturing emissions on carboncounter, the lifecycle emissions reduction of the model 3 in California is 53%.\n\n53% reduction in comparison to what was a \"tip of the spear\" car in 2001 is outstanding.  Most cars didn't come close to the Prius even in the same class as the Prius.  And that's a comparison to today's grid.  Best I can tell your calculator doesn't account for future improvements in the grid which we know over the next 15 years will be substantial.  I, personally, did a comparison with a Passat and a Chrysler 300, (for the CA grid) two cars I think are much more representative of what was on the road in 2001 and they are already very nearly that 80% reduction.\n\n\nOkay so that kind of addresses a lot of the initial paragraphs.  Then you get into a lot of discussion that's pretty out of scope here and things that would fall under the banner of \"If we want to get to an 80% reduction, we'll need to address that.\"\n\nSome states having dirtier grids, Chinese manufacturing being dirty, etc.  None of that has anything to do with the question of BEV vs. ICE and we will need to address it anyways.  We're going to have to clean up our grid, we're going to have to clean up Eastern manufacturing, none of that are reasons why we shouldn't be switching over to BEVs.",

All the BS being posted is based off a call concerning the launch of the new fsd computer that will debut in the Cybertruck. The plant will be finished this year and is already in test production mode with the  Model Y. Do you really think they're going to let that huge investment sit idle for 2 years? \n\nThe CT will have limited production in 22 and no one ever thought they'd be at peak production at the start of 22.",

In an average European electricity system, electricity has around 30% lower climate impact than diesel for a heavy truck, and 65–70% lower for a passenger car or city bus. Average European vehicle gas reduces the climate impact by up to 28% compared to diesel, or 11% compared to fossil natural gas, and in some countries vehicle gas has lower climate impact than electricity. This demonstrates the importance of not limiting analysis and policy to tailpipe emissions.\"",

For example, if your solar PV system was installed before December 31, 2022, cost $18,000, and your utility gave you a one-time rebate of $1,000 for installing the system, your tax credit would be calculated as follows: 0.26 * ($18,000 - $1,000) = $4,420",

I got 96kW at $0.47/kWh.\n\nReading the press release I'm guessing MagicDock is going to stay an experiment for a while. I'd imagine that Tesla will prioritize enabling other manufacturer agreements (like Ford) working through those apps rather than more MagicDocks working through the Tesla app.",

The SunPower trackers used to use a PLC and VFD that had to be programmed and could be difficult to work with.  A few years ago they were rolling out a remote controlled unit that made commissioning a bit easier and gave a lot of visibility of the tracker and could be configured via Internet.  The PV Hardware trackers had the highest quality components I've ever seen used for commercial solar.  Very nice product and a great support team in California.  I did not like the Ideematec units because they were very difficult to service and install.  Those were dual axis for Solaria panels that used a fresnel concentrator glass layer.  That seemed to complicated for my tastes.  The ATI trackers are decent.  Good support but the stop limits, slew gears and inter-row 'drive-shafts' had a tendency to need a lot of servicing.",

If you have a 1 for 1 kWh net meter (you over produce 1kWh, send to the grid, and are credited 1kWh off your bill), it is essentially a fully efficient, free storage medium for the homeowner.\n\nThe issue with that from the utilities perspective is that you're using their infrastructure for free. That's like you letting someone squat in your house without paying rent (different scale, but same idea). That's why utilities are trying to push for charges to households with rooftop solar .\n\nI'm not advocating that charge, but I understand why they're pushing for it. I personally believe that the grid should become a \"common good\" controlled by a state/federal agency that everyone pays to use. In this case, the utility would become more of a service provider and wholesale seller of electricity.",

"comment": "I just got here but this is a question I can help answer. Solar pricing gets about 20% cheaper every time industry capacity doubles, this is sometimes referred to as [Swansons law](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Swansons-law.png) or the [experience curve](http://i.imgur.com/H9PBlMZ.png) and is about every 3 years.\n\nIn 1976 solar panels were over $70 watt, in 2004 it was $3/watt, today they are under $1/watt. \n\nThose are just panel prices though and don't represent the total installed cost of the system which has also seen improvements but is dependent partly on square footage of the install so aside from panel /cost/ efficiency matters as well. \n\n[Solar cell efficiency](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Best_Research-Cell_Efficiencies.png) has also improved over time. \n\nOther can comment but current estimates put the total install cost of a grid tied solar system in the ballpark of about $2.50 to $3.50/watt. In other words, you can now install the entire system mounting hardware, inverter, labor costs and all for what just the panels would have cost in only 2004.\n\nThe gold standard in renewable energy costs is parity with the costs of using fossil fuel. The answer of when solar passes coal as a cheaper energy source varies greatly depending on who you ask but by 2020 or so Solar LCOE (levelized cost of energy) should be cheaper than coal.",

"comment": "I've built several vehicles with solar panels on them.  Replaced the constantly failing alternator on a ~2000 ford ranger with a \"solar bed cover\", as well as another bed cover on my electric 52 ford f-1.  Also built an autonomous solar robot, mobile tool trailer with a solar roof, etc, etc.  that being said I don't think solar panels on cars is a great idea.  It's a matter of utilization and cost efficiency, plus a sub-optimal environment for the panels.  Allow me to put my reasons in list format.\n\n1) An electric car is often sitting ready to go with a full battery, nowhere for that solar power to go.  Return on investment requires maximizing the total energy out of that panel\n\n2) When the battery is drained and able to accept charge it's often in need of a huge amount of power, fast.  In order to be useful again you need many Kwh in a relatively short timespan, often at night.\n\n3) Orientation is only going to be optimal a small percent of the time.  When you're in clear sun you'll be pointed east/west/north/south at random, and much of the time will be spent shaded.\n\n4) Road hazards (rocks, sticks), vibration, and other physical damage.\n\n5) Dirt, mud, general road grime.  My car is often filthy.  It accumulates a layer of muck faster than anything else I own.\n\nNow compare that to a panel mounted on a house.  There is always somewhere for that power to go, the orientation is fixed and always optimized, far fewer physical hazards so the panels are cheaper/safer/far more likely to actually make power for their 30 year lifespan.\n\nRight now we need every solar panel to make as much clean power as it can.  When the day comes that most roofs are making power and we're turning to less optimal locations then cars make sense.",

Third, I never made the claim it was optimal. Fourth, electric cars and solar power are essentially in their infancy as far as widespread use.  Every technology needs to start somewhere, then it can be improved upon over time.  Trying to argue about copper, inductors, and simply bizarre.  I'm not talking about optimal.  I'm talking about the idea as a concept. I wonder how many people told Elon Musk that his electric cars would be too expensive because of the cost of copper and inductors.  He would have told you to fuck off.  Obviously you've thought about this idea too if you've supposedly built cars with solar panels.  You of all people should know that it's not a stupid idea and could improve with time and advances in solar technology.  Lastly, don't talk to me about learning what engineering is all about and asking me why I don't live in a solar house. The type of house I live in has nothing to do with this discussion.  The fact you would even ask it reveals your IQ and thought process.",

Over the course of a year, the second system will produce 5539 kWh, presumably factoring typical daylight hours, lattitude, weather, etc. And over the course of a year you will use 4600kWh.

If you go to the high end you can pay 3x the price.  Notice the price is per watt so even when you pick the low efficiency you get more panels, same energy, and still 3x cheaper.",

Also you arent reliant on a singal entity that might decide not to continue at any time, if the community supports it, then it cant be undone.\n\nLook at what Solarcoin are doing, a global solar PV incentive that anyone can join.  The community ElectriCChain project is already logging actual solar PV production data, again the blockchain makes this truly open/resilient in a way that websites cant achieve.",

During a power cut most solar systems actually shut down.\nIf the electric cables were cut near to the solar panels, then the batteries would continue to supply until they run out.  If the wires between the house and the batteries were cut then the home would have electric until the sun goes down.\nThe latter seems a more compelling device for a dramatic story, the pragmatist finds the battery wires cut and knows come sundown, they will have no power!!",

No one wants to invest in new nuclear plants in the absence of subsidies in the form of government loan guarantees.\n\nThe cost of solar and other alternatives is falling.  You don't seem to dispute that.  The cost of concentrated solar power (CSP) --which includes storage in the form of molten salt-- is also falling steadily.  It is projected to cost 6 cents per kilowatt hour by 2020.  Battery technologies will also surely improve and become cheaper.\n\nAs CSP and other forms of renewable energy and storage continue to fall in cost there will be less and less reason to look at nuclear which is already rejected by the current marketplace.",

It seems to me, that the \"mass market\" idea of the home battery has only been around for a few years and the price still may drop in next 2-5 years.

Even L1 you're looking at a sustained 1.4kW AC load which means you need ~2kW of DC generation.  Even if you had a string of [say] 8 300W panels out in full sun the variability of power output (temp/clouds/haze/farts/etc) means you're going to want to have batteries to sustain a charge.\n\nEven then L1 chargers add like 5km/hr range thereabouts.  So might be useful in a disaster but that's about it.\n\nIf you really want to do this you should get multiple kW of panels on your roof or perma mounted on the ground + a 10+ kWh battery + a 5+ kW dual pole (240V) inverter.",

Really didn't like them doing that.\n\nThe tariffs are screwing up a lot of things from what I've heard. Hard to get stock because people don't want to take hardware off the port because they are unsure if they are going through.",

"comment": "With leaving a tile replacement mount  exposed like that I  see two big problems: 1) What is the hole where the standoff mounts filled with? If any kind of caulk, it will fail in the sun and eventually leak. 2) Wind rating. These are meant to be protected under a solar array and are made of super thin stamped sheet metal. Perhaps someone else can identify the mfg (I cant), but if so, call them and get their technical opinion. Racking manufacturers are very helpful. If you can't identify the manufacturer, call Snapnrack or IronRidge technical support and see if their tile replacement mounts are rated for full exposure without a standoff supporting them in the middle.",

We produce more energy than we can consume, so we're net-negative for all intents and purposes. But a new construction home is an enormous carbon debt, solar panels have carbon debt, all the things we own, etc. \n  \nI should probably do the math on when we'll break even from our carbon debt given that we're net-negative, but I don't feel like it's realistic to actually reach. Eventually we'll need a new car and that will be more carbon debt. Pretty much everything we buy is carbon debt. \n  \nIt's weird.",

As an example, the battery charges at super off peak rates IE: .14 a kwh and then feeds back or offsets real time use during peaks rates IE: .54 a kwh. In this scenario most home battery options return 3-4 times the cost over their warrantied lifetime, with the added benefit of being able to run a limited number of critical circuits if the grid goes down.",

Install turn around time, install quality, customer service before during and after. Might want to reconsider those other companies man",

I have a hand in building the world I intend to live in. We can build thin solar shades in space to cool the planet without further changing our atmospheric chemistry. These can also collect and direct solar power to eliminate fossil fuel plants. There's no reason to suspect this can't work. Once we're building infrastructure in space, we gain a certain immunity to climate change, as well as the ability to resolve it.\n\nYes, we can still criticize certain billionaire space industrialists for their greed and instability. But this is also key to our future.\n\nHonestly, I'm much more concerned about fascism and billionaire sociopaths preventing this kind of thing, or worse, laying sole ownership claim to the entire solar system. Not sure that's actually possible though, what with light speed lag and the ability for anyone with a rocket to send a rock right through their mega yacht.",

"comment": "They don't get \"hate\", they get reality. I don't like snake oil, and Iike snake oil salesmen even less.\n\nThere is nothing revolutionary about the Aptera. It's an electric trike with a relatively small battery, that gets high range because it's a lightweight electric trike. Pretending it's a magical vehicle made of unicorn horns and unobtainium is part of the snake oil.\n\nI *like* the Aptera vehicle. I'd love to own one. It looks like a gas (no pun intended) to drive and I'd love to live in a world where we could drive lightweight high efficiency vehicles around without the fear of being crushed by GM's Electric Hummer!\n\nBut the Aptera is *ridiculously* overpriced for what it is. The entry level model is an oversized ebike with a 25kWh battery, yet it costs nearly as much as a new entry level Nissan Leaf with a battery twice the size (but less range, given the greater efficiency of the lightweight Aptera.)\n\nThe reason the Aptera gets \"hate\" here, is the folks pimping it always have a vested interest (e.g. investor) and have always drunk the Kool aid and seem to think there's some magic in the design that makes it a \"killer\" of other EVs. \n\nThere's *no* reason the Aptera couldn't be here already. It's essentially a 3D printed shell that uses off the shelf electrical parts. Spec that design out to Mahindra in India or BYD in China, and they'll have a container ship of them waiting for you six months after you wrote the check.\n\nThe solar panel nonsense is a gimmick that gets them free coverage in the EV press (\"the *only* EV that never needs charging...\") *Any* EV sold today could be covered in solar panels, but it simply isn't worth the cost (we covered that further up the thread.) If it's an option for those with special circumstances (or haven't worked out the math), fine, but the included 400 watts of panels is a significant cost to an already overpriced vehicle. (Much like the 10\" display, etc.) If this were a 10K vehicle, I'd be singing its praises with you, as a neat alternative to expensive EVs for city folk. But this thing costs as much as a \"real\" EV, and yet doesn't qualify for the federal tax credit because *it's not a car.*",

"comment": "Maybe. I had the solar panels for 11 years before the car, and they have long ago paid for themselves. In 2010 I paid $6,800 for 5.4 kW array after the various state, federal, and electric company incentives. If you figure they and the car will go another 9 years, that'd be $340 / year pro-rated over the life of the panels. Figure I go about 12k miles per year, that'd be $0.0283 / mile, so the total cost would be $0.0283 - $0.0723 / mile (average $0.0503 / mile).\n\nAlso, they're solar panels - there's no maintenance. Unless you're asking about the car, in which case most of the traditional car maintenance doesn't apply. Regular maintenance consists of annual safety inspection, biannual air cabin air filter change, biannual brake inspection, wiper replacement as needed, wiper fluid fills, tire rotation (can do myself), and replace tires as needed (judging by the wear so far, every 3 years or so?).",

"comment": "No, it isn’t any cheaper. Solar inverters and the Ford V2H inverter operate at different DC voltages, so are completely separate. One other annoying thing about the Ford home integration is that extra solar production is wasted during an outage. If the truck is in “home has a power outage” mode, it can’t charge. Once it’s in “power outage” mode, it will only provide power out, not allow power in. So if power goes out at night, and the truck powers the house for say 5 hours before sunrise, then your solar panels start producing - you’ll still power your home off the solar panels; but if they start producing more than the home is using, the excess is wasted, it won’t go back into the truck’s battery.\n\n(Unless the Sunrun engineer who helped set up my friend’s Lightning home integration completely screwed up.)",

It might be a good idea to research and compare them with other solar panels on the market to see if they meet your specific needs.\n\n  \nPersonally, when I was searching for solar panels, I used this comparison site to evaluate different options based on efficiency, cost, and features. It helped me make an informed decision that suited my budget and goals.",

They are two separate programs. I also asked very specifically about this program change (2:1 vs 1:1) and as long as you choose the 1:1 net metering before 1/1/25, you’ll be grandfathered into and continue to receive 1:1.  They were offering a per kWh bonus to move to the 2:1, which I’ve declined. They also said I could accept the bonus and go 2:1 after 1/1/25 if I wanted.

"comment": "1.  I keep my bees (i have 2 hives) in Langstroth style hives.  here's a pic: https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/268024_506334740612_165100056_30107355_1702466_n.jpg\nthey live in an arboretum in upstate New York.  I have never used chemicals to treat them for any pest, as i have been lucky and they haven't had many pest problems.  if they ever do get any mites, i will treat them with powdered sugar. (makes it almost impossible for the mites to hang on to them)  i try to treat them as well as i can.  i give them a home in an arboretum with plenty to eat, i give them water, i built an electric fence to keep bears away, and i don't view them as a source of honey / propolis / wax.  they are just some animals whose company i enjoy, and who i like to care for as much as i can.\n\n2. I do not have bees for commercial reasons.  I keep them because i am fascinated by them, and have been for most of my life.  next year i am *considering* taking honey from them, but again, not for commercial purposes.  it would just be for me and possibly to be given as gifts to my immediate friends / family.  i'm not trying to make the bees my employees / slaves.\n\n3.  i got into bees at a very young age when i was stung by a bee at about age 2-3.  for the next couple years whenever i experienced anything painful i would yell \"Bee!\"  my mom tried to get me over my bee fear by teaching me about them, but from the time i was 6 until i was maybe 17 i never thought about them.  then i randomly remembered them, and began reading up and researching bees, and reciting random facts about bees until i had annoyed everyone around me to the point that a couple years ago, my parents enrolled me in a bee keeping class as a christmas present.  i've been doing it ever since.\n\n4.  If someone doesn't want to eat honey, i'm not going to try to convince them.  i totally see their point, and agree with it to a certain degree.  here's where i don't agree with viewing honey as being similar to milk (or any other animal product)  honey is the nectar from flowers that has been taken by bees and had water evaporated out of it.  because of this, i view honey as non-animal food.  yes, the bees create it, but assuming you are getting your honey from a non-commercial source (which is next to impossible unless you keep your own bees) they are making as much as they possibly can, and will make too much if you let them, so you can take some without dooming them.  \n\nhowever, you do have to be very responsible when you take from them because they are storing it up so they have enough food to get them through the winter.  further, i think that honey is the one type of food vegans avoid that is insanely healthy.  it is full of vitamins and minerals, it works amazingly well on cuts and scrapes, it is good when you are sick, and, to get a bit esoteric, is the closest thing to pure fucking magic that we can eat.\n\nBonus: \nhere's a picture of me kissing my bees (they seem to like the texture of my beard)\n\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/264886_506333752592_165100056_30107274_7972216_n.jpg\n\ni hope this was helpful, feel free to keep asking.   - Will",

My point was that there is nothing gained by putting down veganism as a \"first world\" whatever, because they are still having an overall good impact on the world food crisis, versus a diet based heavily in meat. Therefore, I find it hypocritical when meat eaters criticise vegans as being elitist, because the more elite diet would be the typical \"first world\" omnivore diet.\n\nEven if people eat meat in developing countries, their diets, as you seem to suggest yourself, are probably closer to a vegan or vegetarian diet than the amount of meat consumption we see in North America, or even Western Europe.",

I've yet to look for recipes (so far it has been a variety of fried/steamed veg mainly). \n\nThanks for the tip about H&amp;B. I think the biggest challenge is not walking into Morrisons and just buying the non-animal products, but thinking about what I need vitamin and mineral wise and making a list beforehand. On a general note, is fresh veg supremely better than frozen veg? I *love* Spinach, but it comes in greater quantity and is cheaper frozen than it is fresh.\n\nLastly, I never knew there were so many vegan athletes, let alone body builders! It's really an inspiration, and I'm quite excited to see where I go with this. Thanks mate.",

There's a lot of coverage of vegan-related themes as Wilbur faces being served for Christmas dinner unless he's saved with the help of his friends.  Another would possibly be *Cloud Atlas*, but I hope that others can vouch for it being relevant for veganism or animal rights.  I've only seen the movie, but have recently added the book to my to-read list since the film definitely had something to say about human and nonhuman animal rights.",

It's a grey area like I said from the outset, we all have to make up our own minds with that sort of thing. It's not for me to judge.\n  \n  \nPersonally the few times a year when someone leaves non-vegan food at my house, I eat it instead of throwing it away. By doing so, by eating the calories that are right there in front of me ready to go, I'm avoiding the load on the planet and its animals that come with me choosing to get my calories (yes, even vegan calories) elsewhere that will have to be processed, packaged, shipped, purchased, transported, prepared, etc...  To me that far outweighs the possible bad effect of any 'message' I might be sending by eating something rather than putting it in the garbage.  \n  \n  \nWhat veganism is about is avoiding the exploitation and suffering of animals.  How far we all go is up to each of us. With easy stuff like buying a new pair of leather chaps or eating a steak, it's easy. We all agree. \n  \n  \nOther stuff, like do I call an exterminator, do I throw food out, do I wear a pair of leather shoes that I found in the trash, do I use medicine that was tested on animals, with stuff like that it's not so easy. It's a grey area and we don't all agree.  But hopefully we all do the work of carefully considering the impact of our choices and being up for the challenge of sacrificing when we deem it necessary.",

I'm a \"cis\" person, but I don't want to be called that, mostly because it tends to be used with a very negative and accusatory context. Regardless of how rational it is, when I hear the term cis, I get defensive. This is bad for the feminist cause. You don't want people to be defensive if you're trying to convince them, you want to get them on your side. As such, even though it may be irrational of me, I think it would be better for feminists to jump through my hoop and say straight, as in the end it helps their cause, and I feel less accused of the connotations of that word that I don't feel guilty of\n\nWhen I first saw the word \"carnist\" used on this subreddit, I didn't know its definition, but my immediate mental image was that of a caveman chomping on meat. Regardless of what it actually means, I very much doubt that this term was invented with the intent of rational discussion, and if it was, then it was very poorly chosen. Just like the cis example, no matter how legitimate its definition may be, it puts people on the defensive, and shuts out reasoned conversation. There's no need to alienate people like this, and I don't think it helps anyone. \n\n&gt;I think this label in a way reminds people that it isn't just some unchallenged default but a choice to continue to be a carnist.\n\nI am very doubtful that if I ate meat and someone called me a carnist, my first thought would be self-reflective. I think I would feel unfairly criticized, and it would reinforce the negatives stereotypes that I might have about vegans. I don't see how this term could ever lend the world to being a better place.",

But the truth is, most of the animals that we eat are still hidden away in factory farms, and forests are being cut down to make room for the few grazing cows that we do have.

The next day my boyfriend is a stricter vegan than I am!\n\nAnyhow, for newbie tips, I suggest \"veganizing\" the food you already eat. It isn't ideal, but a lot of the meat-substitutes are really tasty and are really helpful as you transition to a healthier diet.  Trader Joes has some GREAT chicken-less mandarin chicken packets (in the frozen section) that are basically indistinguishable from real chicken. Boca burgers taste better than Gardenburgers, and Yves makes a very decent \"deli sliced ham\". Veganaise tastes better than real Mayo... \"Just mayo\" brand will do, but \"veganaise\" brand is superior... \n\nIf you go out to eat frequently, I suggest mexican restaurants until you are confident you know what dishes hide animal ingredients (lots and lots of fish stocks in otherwise vegan asian dishes). The reason mexican is so easy, is you can order veggie fajitas with no sour cream or cheese, if you miss the creamy fat; add extra guacamole. It is super easy and very satisfying but don't forget to ask if their spanish rice is made with chicken stock. If it is, just get plain white rice with a side of salsa instead.   \n\nAvoid vegan cheese though. Oh god. You need about 6 months of abstinence to change your taste-buds enough that it will be palatable. When you DO get around to trying the vegan cheeses, go with Field Roast's Chao Slices first, and there are a ton of great recipes for cashew-based \"ricotta\" out there (We like Veganomicon's version the best). \n\nWelcome! You will notice a lot of positive changes in your health (but get some gas tablets to help with the transition) and also your mood if you are anything like me.",

"comment": "I saw someone had posted a vegan French toast recipe a few days ago, but it was a little more complicated than I normally go. This is one is easy and I usually have everything on hand to make it. I usually eyeball everything, but here’s an approximation of how it goes. This normally will do 3-4 slices of bread no problem. Double as needed for more French Toast.\n\n1/2 cup soy coffee creamer (Vanilla or regular flavored)\n1 tsp Cinnamon\n1 tbsp cornstarch\n1/2 tsp vanilla flavoring (if your creamer isn’t already vanilla)\n\nWhisk all that together really well (the cornstarch will want to clump. Knock those badboys around until they stop that shit). Dredge a piece of bread one side at a time in the mixture (make sure you dredge just before going in the pan to avoid soggy bread). Throw that in a pan preheated at medium-high, with a little Earth Balance or oil to avoid sticking. Heat is pretty key here, so keep an eye on it and move it around a little to make sure it’s not sticking. Flip over once golden brown and cook the other side. Amply apply confectioner’s sugar and maple syrup on top. Enjoy your diabetes.",

I've always found that I can re-create the taste (for example, I've made a delicious chickpea 'chorizo' and mac and cheese dishes that I would choose over the old versions) but it helps to remember not to expect the texture to be the same.

Will fix later.\n\nCurrently I live in Japan (in terms of veganism definitely not recommended) but I am originally from Germany.  \nGenerally, it is pretty good. Larger supermarkets, drugstores and organic markets offer a variety of vegan products. There is also a completely vegan supermarket called veganz in some cities... compared to general German food prices expensive though so I never really shopped there. But I've seen some products there you won't find elsewhere in Germany, like gardein. Fruits and veggies, especially seasonal and not imported are super cheap. Only noticed this in comparison to the ridiculous Japanese prices and I really miss this. Even smaller supermarkets now often put an effort into offering some products like some soy yogurt, soy milk or random vegan spreads.\nPeople will sometimes mock vegans a little or try to argue but it is generally accepted and supported.  \nIf you eat out in rural areas you might have trouble finding anything without having to alter your meals. Almost all restaurants have some vegetarian thing on the menu, vegan not so much. I mean, there is still a probability that a restaurant has a vegan option, but you cannot fully rely on that in small towns.\nVeganism is booming in larger cities however. Berlin, of course. I myself am from Leipzig, where the youth is pretty progressive. So especially in rather alternative neighborhoods almost every place will have a vegan option, some are even fully vegan. Many restaurants have their menu online so one can take a look before going there. Also, allergens are, I think, marked by law and a meal will almost always really only contain what's said on the menu. One can ask to be safe but normally you don't have to riddle if something is vegan or not.  \nRecently I lived in Osnabrück which is a rather small city but there was still a ton of vegan options because a lot of students live there. So I am guessing any city where one world expect a larger portion of the population to be young, especially students, should be relatively vegan friendly. :) so if you have friends that listen to your wishes you should be able to find a place to eat. Also, Dönerläden are often open 24/7 and people like to go there for late night junk food. Most of them have falafel, which is vegan, and fries. Some even have a vegan version of Döner (must try).\nSo yeah, can recommend. That's all I can come up with right now, feel free to ask questions!",

"comment": "&gt; why do you feel the need to evangelize your choice of diet?\n\nI feel like you may have already answered your own question. You spent the entire post talking about how it's obvious that a vegan diet makes sense and is the kindest and gentlest diet out there. Why wouldn't we want to let others know? Isn't it now our responsibility to preach it? Notice any connection to your religion? If you know a way of living that makes you happier, and the world happier, why wouldn't you spread it around as much as possible?\n\nAlso, keep in mind that veganism goes beyond diet (although diet is pretty prominent, and definitely the most socially noticeable aspect of veganism). So, no leather, wool, silk, honey, dairy, eggs... It's a lifestyle change, not just a dietary change. And there are a million ways to be vegan, there is not one single \"vegan diet\".\n\nSorry, editing to answer your other questions. If you're in the US, there is a great brand called gardein that makes frozen faux meats. Can get pricey but will squash a craving in a pinch. Tofurkey also makes some decent sausages and lunch meats, you might like their deli slices in place of ham. Light Life has some good stuff but some contains eggs so be aware of that. Field Roast meats are also good, but I can only find them at Whole Foods in my area and they're also pricey. \n\nGround beef is the easiest to replace, gardein's crumbles and meatballs are my favorites and tend to match what I remember of animal meat. Then you've got tofu and tempeh, and SEITAN. You are going to love seitan. It won't be a literal steak, but look up some recipes. It's pretty amazing stuff. \n\nAlso try to learn how to base your meals around other foods like starches, grains, legumes, and vegetables. You don't need a meat replacement every day. They're not that healthy, and you'll be missing out on all the amazing vegan food out there! Indian, Thai, Mexican, and Chinese are good places to start. Just google \"vegan palak paneer\" or \"vegan Chinese recipes\" for some ideas.",

Also lactose intolerant folks exist lmao \n\nVegan beef may be for those who want to get family members into the vegan lifestyle by showing food similar to it to tell them they won't miss out and can still have similar traditional meals just plant based \n\nI also don't like the meat looking ones as if you're becoming vegan for ethical reasons it's vomit inducing for me when I look at some of the realistic meat plant based ones. \n\nI do however love [batter (eggless)](https://www.finedininglovers.com/article/eggless-tips-how-make-batter-without-eggs) frying my oyster mushrooms I grow and they remind me of when I was a kid growing up I'd have battered fish so it's nostalgic inducing and I know some people just miss old foods but don't want to partake in the ethical dillemas \n\nOf course there are those that became vegan for health reasons as well especially after the whole game changers craze on Netflix. \n\nThose vegan meat are also often fortified with those supplements (b12 for one)\n\nTL;DR: Vegans (even nonvegans) make vegan substitutes because a lot of vegans grew up nonvegan and want a plant based substitute that'd scratch that itch or to accommodate for others who are used to traditional meals with nonvegan ingredients and possibly make others more open minded to going plantbased.\n\nRandom: Green Eggs and Ham - the show adapting Dr. Seuss' books - has a vegan character which surprised me. She made a vegan version of green eggs and ham for Sam who loves green eggs and ham eating it everywhere and anytime lol",

I honestly was unable to connect to the person I seemed I was back then. I couldn't relate at all anymore and I never thought I was like this at all. And in retrospect I know for a matter of fact that I had never really encountered any annoying or pushy vegans back then. I was just heavily projecting.",

"comment": "> Adds supporting meat or products with animal origin should be immediatlly forbidden\n\nLaws like this, focused on discouraging people from buying animal products, I think could be very effective. I think complete abolition is an ideal end goal, but in my opinion that can't work until society has already come around to the idea of veganism, otherwise if governments simply banned animal exploitation overnight there could be riots, uprisings and an underground meat trade might take over (who really knows though). I think for people to go along with it and give up animal products without too much fuss (or a manageable amount of fuss), it needs to be made the majority view in society that animal products are unforgivable for a person to support *before* they're told they actually can't do it anymore. Similar to how over the last several years people started catching on about a lot of other social and world issues, and being informed about what they needed to start doing or stop doing as the \"rules\" of society evolved. Veganism needs to become an expected value, like feminism.\n\n> And gov should explictly promove big campaings on all medias saying such bad habits bring bad consequences on our reality.\n\nExactly this, we need government funded campaigns and worldwide initiatives aimed at educating the public about the harms of animal agriculture and the need for our society to do away with these outdated practices.\n\nBut I think short of complete abolition, law changes can still also help to send the messages that animal commodification is wrong and will need to be phased out. For example, removing tax subsidies from animal agriculture and giving them to plant-based foods.",

It's made from mixing golden sugar and caster sugar over heat to make a sort of caramel sauce and then adding bicarbonate of soda to make it all puff up and bubbly! So entirely vegan and tastes delicious 😋 it's a common ice cream combo here with vanilla ice cream and the chunks of honeycomb through it or also can be coated in chocolate for chocolate bars too!

"comment": "But in wanting publicity, they then do have to sexualize their campaigns. Any other attempts of theirs, (splashing paint onto fur coats, posting anti-meat ads in front of meat shops, denouncing video games, etc.), just makes them get dismissed as \"those crazy vegans\". When women's bodies are thrown into the mix, suddenly everyone is paying attention. Sex sells and I'm not against women's bodies, (or male's bodies for that matter); I don't get upset when I see one. I'm against using that tactic because I know how conservative others can be. \n\nThat being said, I am aware they don't win only with that strategy though. As I said earlier, I like that they *can* get stuff done so I applaud those efforts.",
