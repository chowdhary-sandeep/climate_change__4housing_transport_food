In this case, fluids are HVAC and Battery conditioning fluids. Cost is probably under $100.\n\nAny tire shop can manage tire replacement, repair and rotation. The operation is no different than any other car.\n\nEV components such as batteries and motors, as well as the computers to manage it all are still pretty specialized and are probably best handled by dealers with necessary training and certification. But, an EV battery should last 200-300K miles at least, brakes and electric motors should outlive the life of the car due to their simplicity. There is far less complexity than ICE, so major repairs should be rare.  \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with EV driving, you may wonder why brakes may outlast the life of the car. Simply, you rarely use them. The Bolt has a 1-pedal driving mode, many other EVs have similar. When in this mode, you take your foot off the accelerator and the car will come to a stop more aggressively than many of us use brakes on ICE cars. Added benefit is this returns power to the batteries and extends your range. In the 20K miles on my Bolt, I have probably used brakes the equivalent of an ICE driven 200 miles.

Instead of saying, “I disagree with you on policy, but have empathy with your position and want to find an alternative solution that can help address some of the problem,” they say, “if you disagree with my position, you are wrong, and I have to do whatever it takes to defeat you.” (Yes, many Democrats also have a similar party-first mentality, but my own ideals lean more conservative, so I’m more likely to criticize the Conservative party for their shortcomings). \n\nI believe that market-based solutions could have been used to solve the global warming and climate change problem at one point in time. In order for that to have happened, during the 60s and 70s, politicians would need to be dedicated to researching it, and the major oil companies would need to acknowledge publicly what their internal communication was saying, that CO2 may be acting as a greenhouse gas and has potential to effect global climate. If that had happened, I believe the major oil crisis of the 70s would have led to significant investments in alternative energies and battery technology. We would probably have cars like Tesla by the late 80s or early 90s, instead of “ Who killed the electric car?” \n\nBut I believe it’s nearly too late for free market principles to cause enough change to prevent devistating loss of property and life. As a conservative, I believe one of the main roles of government is to protect its citizens from being harmed or victimized by others, whether by theft, violence, vandalism, arson, pollution, etc. We have moved from a point where climate change has the potential to cause harm to us to a point where \nclimate change WILL cause harm to us. From a selfish perspective, America can likely adapt to climate change, but not without a great loss of life and property, and at a very great economic expense. But to make matters worse, the entire world will also be suffering from climate change, and billions of people don’t live in a country that have the resources to adapt, and will cause catastrophic loss of life. Again, as a conservative, I would normally say, what happens in other countries isn’t really our responsibility. But on the other hand, we are literally causing climate change, and have the responsibility to help find a solution, just as if we would have the responsibility to clean up pollution from a foreign country if we were responsible. No, we are not responsible for ALL of the solution, but we must do what it takes to solve it, at least for our own future, and in part for the harm which will be done to others less fortunate because of our actions. \n\nThe problem then is, what should be the solution? As a conservative , this is where I struggle. One proposed solution is to subsidize research into possible solutions. Another is to charge a cost associated with greenhouse gasses and create a market to trade credits. That one is sort of market-driven, with the exception of government setting the cost of carbon. I think a hybrid approach could be valuable:\n\nInstitute a carbon fee, starting fairly low, but increasing every year. Instead of being a tax to government, companies pay the carbon fee into a fund. The companies could invest into research and development of new technologies and get paid back for up to 75% of what they paid into the fund, sort of like a tax break. The additional 25% gets turned into various research prizes, like the XPrize, for meeting certain milestones. For example, a company that can create a 100 kWh battery that can charge fully in 10 minutes, or commercial solar cells that are a certain efficiency or cost per kWh, or cost effective carbon storage; and as research prizes are won, the milestones would be raised just a bit for the next prize. I believe innovation and ingenuity can create new ideas and technologies far faster than just subsidies. And as the Space Race taught us, technological competition can yield much faster and more innovative results than just independent research alone.  Although the conservative in me doesn’t like the carbon fee, I can settle for this type of solution, knowing that the companies can get it back by investing into R&amp;D which doesn’t just help climate change but also has the potential to make them even more money (by developing new technologies), and it also uses competitive market forces and competition to help push companies to be more innovative than their competitors. \n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.31210997208472474,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23144672302844982,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.30513580113501754,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23346598051990614,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31442981788533025,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20174581331793706,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.025943034275163274,"ev_1":-0.20529268023935715,"ev_2":-0.33617612171777483,"ev_3":-0.13578726659761742,"ev_4":-0.2402065161165222,"ev_5":-0.1253324315912323,"ev_6":-0.282406894345017},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

Folding bicycles are an option, but models compact and light enough to take onto a train are very expensive (e.g. Brompton bicycle, from A$1800 upwards). Also, for inexperienced users of folding bicycles, riding on the road (as an adult) may be too intimidating to make the choice to take one on and off a train. Additionally, in warmer months, arrival at work after a bicycle ride necessitates ablutions for which facilities may not be available at work. Pedelec/electric assist bicycles are also generally far too heavy and unwieldy to take on a train.\r\n\r\n•\tPeople with minor disabilities such as arthritis anywhere in the lower limbs, plantar fasciitis, or other minor injury (like a broken toe) may still use mass transit to get to work and use an electric scooter to move between station and work, where a walk of 1-2km may be otherwise difficult or painful.\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tThe advantages of encouraging car drivers off the road and onto mass transit has obvious benefits in terms of traffic congestion and atmospheric pollution. Electric motors have zero emissions at point of use.\r\n\r\n•\tShort trips to the shops from home may be achieved with an electric scooter, saving unnecessary use of a motor vehicle, with subsequent difficulties in parking, road congestion and pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tTourists using hire/ride-share scooters can see the sites of major cities in a convenient and rapid way.\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenges of electric kick scooters\r\n\r\nChallenges specific to hire scooters:\r\n\r\n•\tIn some cities in the USA there have been incidents of kick scooters being parked in an inconsiderate manner by users. Many fall over. Since hire scooters are not folding models, when left on the footpath they can impede the flow of foot traffic (and minors on bicycles, as well as skateboards, or manual kick scooters). This can be unsafe.\r\n\r\n•\tThe state of scooter maintenance or battery charge level may not be reliable. Hire companies use contractors or employees (often called “juicers”) to drive around town picking up scooters. They then take them home, charge the batteries and perform minor maintenance. To date, it is difficult to tell what kind of training or standardisation (if any) exists between “juicers”. There have been cases in the USA of some hire scooters with faulty brakes, occasioning severe injury to riders.\r\n\r\n•\tMany users of hire scooters may have next to no experience using them. Even at speeds as low as 10km/h, some users may be unaccustomed to acceleration to that speed and may lose control. Some new users may confuse the brakes with accelerator. Some of the more popular scooters (such as Ninebot-Segway) contain batteries in the vertical pole and are as such top-heavy – riders need to know to adjust their centre of gravity downward and rearward when braking, lest they topple. Other scooters have rear disc brakes (Xiaomi m365 but no suspension, so may present with a bumpy ride which can be hazardous when its 200mm tyres encounter obstructions on the footpath). In short, there are things to know and to learn about electric scooters.\r\n\r\nChallenges pertaining to both privately owned and hire scooters\r\n\r\n•\tSome people are selfish and inconsiderate. Some scooter riders are reckless, just like some motorists and some cyclists. For this reason we have laws to fulfil both an educational function as well as a deterrent to misdeeds. The effect of a reckless scooter rider impacting a pedestrian could be quite dangerous, particularly to children and the elderly (or to small dogs); it is comparable to a teenager on a skateboard or trick scooter crashing into someone, at speeds comparable to an electric scooter.\r\n\r\n•\tSome scooter riders may be unaccustomed to even modest speeds. At speeds of 10-15km/h - equivalent to a brisk jog or run - some users may fail to anticipate the closing velocity of cars emerging from driveways or street corners, as can be the case even while actually running.\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tCar drivers - particularly in NSW as mentioned above - are unaccustomed to seeing many personal mobility devices on the footpath, save for children on bikes or skateboards, or elderly or disabled people on motorised wheelchairs. Car drivers would therefore not be used to watching out for people moving at a running pace at intersections or driveways. The onus is shared, of course, with motorists being required to look before emerging and on riders to anticipate obstructions. This is one reason it can be safer for a cyclist to ride on the road rather than footpaths, because motorists usually pay no heed whatsoever to anyone on foot paths, but for the most part will watch out for approaching vehicles on the road. Scooter riders would be especially vulnerable to cars at intersections and should ride with a commensurate index of suspicion regarding the intentions of car drivers. That is, they should ride defensively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible countermeasures to challenges\r\n\r\n•\tTraining and competence issues for hire scooter users may be alleviated by requiring hire companies to alter their smart phone applications to make viewing a short tutorial mandatory for the first five or so rides before the scooter activates. If a company adopts a new model of scooter, the tutorial should be re-imposed. The user ride number status should be linked to usernames so that the number of rides would be catalogued irrespective of which phone the user uses.\r\n\r\n•\tReckless scooter riders on the footpath should be heavily penalised, especially if they hit someone.\r\n\r\n•\tAs per Queensland, safety and speed regulations for scooters should be mandatory. In Queensland and a number of other jurisdictions such as Singapore, electric scooters must not be capable of moving faster than 25km/h and 10km/h if amongst other pedestrians. They must have brakes on one or both wheels, a bell or horn, and lights in the dark.\r\n\r\n•\tHelmets properly fitted and worn should be mandatory.\r\n\r\n•\tScooters should only be allowed on main roads for no further than 50m in order to avoid an obstacle on the footpath. Scooters should be allowed on suburban roads with a motor vehicle limit of 50km/h or below, since many such streets are constructed to a more modern design with no footpaths at all. Scooters should be allowed to use shared pathways (but give way to bicycles) but not dedicated on-road bicycle lanes.\r\n\r\n•\tIt should be an offence to ride a scooter under the influence of alcohol or other psychotropic drugs, such as it is with driving, cycling or horse riding.\r\n\r\nI do believe that the phenomena of privately owned personal mobility devices (as defined in the Queensland regulations) and share/rental scooters represent a positive development in car-free transport for short distances and may reduce motor vehicle traffic congestion and pollution.\r\n\r\nI do however think that the cavalier attitude of the share companies like Lime or Bird have got the devices off to a bad start vis-à-vis public safety and general acceptance. Share bicycle companies are routinely and not unreasonably the target of criticism for the way their bicycles are left littering city streets and footpaths – not infrequently motorists have to stop, get out and move such bicycles off the road. Vandals also damage such bicycles and scooters, rendering them unsafe and exacerbating the litter problem.\r\n\r\nBut not everyone in New South Wales lives in Sydney and not everyone using a scooter uses a hire/share scooter. Short trips from outer Sydney stations (such as Macarthur) or homes (such as Wagga Wagga) to work, can be facilitated by electric scooters, to ease parking problems at the hospital or other congested locations. \r\n\r\nThe misbehaviour of share companies, their users and of vandals should not ruin the opportunity offered to users of privately owned scooters afforded by the development of this technology.\r\n\r\nI humbly urge you and your department to consider my arguments as above in your deliberations on variations to the laws in order to facilitate the opportunities made possible by the advent of personal mobility devices.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23189014779785525,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09852708142651947,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15363753717543205,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.012880307234202823,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32494928493664743,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1311839365733076,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.028256324302977493,"ev_1":-0.13665179124121093,"ev_2":-0.05382011746405624,"ev_3":-0.03270358809580406,"ev_4":-0.06223039476511379,"ev_5":-0.09443362406940044,"ev_6":-0.22025575205550704},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

Winter I can land around 3.8-4 until I hit 15°F because of the Volt forcing gas engine usage; I don't mind the cold so the sheet+ wheel warmers suffice. OP is in Sweden and it's cold, and I'm in Illinois where it's a little warmer and horrendously flatter.\n\n In order to get remotely accurate data, you have to consider the fact that there's essentially 4 versions of the IONIQ 5. Standard range of single and dual motor, and long range of the single and dual motor - all of which come with noteworthy differences in weight and energy distribution. Trim levels may even impact these numbers - mostly due to the different tire sizes (19 vs  20 inch). Then add in the variables between drive modes, which do truly impact efficiency from what I can tell - especially with AWD. Sport mode uses the second motor consistently, normal uses it upon initial acceleration, and eco doesn't use it outside of needs for traction from what I can tell. \n\nEven then, it's a silly comparison. The Volt we drive, for example, is 500-1100 pounds lighter than an Ioniq 5. The Ioniq 5 also can truly sit five people, and has more than twice as much cargo space before factoring in hidden storage, folded seats etc. while possessing a nearly identical drag coefficient and more ground clearance. It also has a heat pump which makes it far more efficient at cabin heating. A Volt is far more comparable to a Leaf, Original Ioniq, Bolt, BMW i3 or even  even a Tesla M3, than the Ioniq 5.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-6.68716032426649e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05463371353228012,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.0959243414302667,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1304022197922071,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13471109039448403,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2373636268810221,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07012346260792886,"ev_1":-0.010135024342162069,"ev_2":-0.001406411247444339,"ev_3":-0.0006773012476818016,"ev_4":-0.0010067261270307881,"ev_5":-0.0017327655611249309,"ev_6":-0.004451599985863197},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers (implied in \"I have a spring-fall average of 4.9-5 mi/kWh in the same vehicle you have.\")","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

(ha!)\n\nBMW with the i3 *really* pushed that car hard with test drives, promotions, etc.  It was one of the first \"practical\" electric vehicles, especially with the range extender.  It's the first electric car I ever drove (at an auto show test drive) where I got to experience one-pedal driving and the quietness of an EV.  They also pushed an electric scooter really hard that used  the same batteries. for the BMW Motorrad division, as well as home charging.\n\nThe problem for the BMW was that it was very expensive and the design was, shall we say, *unique*....Sales never took off because people could buy a much more practical 3 series for the same or less money, then they had a management shake up and, then they came to the conclusion that people didn't want to drive electric because of poor sales of the small, exopensive i3.\n\nTesla is really the first automaker to be fully committed to electric vehicles (after Detroit Electric, of course) because they are a 100% electric vehicle company.  They came out with attractive, affordable (relatively speaking), and practical vehicles that made people desire to drive them.\n\nCompetitors have only half-heartedly embraced the EV;  they thought it had limited appeal and they also had their own interests in selling maintenance and parts vs what is best for a consumer.  A classic example of this is Kodak which *invented* digital photos but then stopped development because they were making so much profit from selling cameras, film, chemicals, and prints to customers.  We all know how that worked out for them.  Tesla is like digital photos and everyone else has been selling rolls of film still.  They are finally awakening to the fact that if they don't start selling what customers want, they will cease to exist.\n\nIt is exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming out, but I still shake my head when they are surprised by demand and selling out vehicles in minutes....\n\nThey are trying to delay the inevitable switch to electric for various reasons, but what they don't realize is that customers will not wait for *them* to be ready, customers will buy from another brand that sells what they desire.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.21271096070456827,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26499796907107037,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11535760725514538,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16470978972767786,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23378947706527875,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2369638582085218,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18049932698098323,"ev_1":-0.32209882140159607,"ev_2":-0.24162286904174834,"ev_3":-0.010570163702747474,"ev_4":-0.018660065329944093,"ev_5":-0.10189232646967028,"ev_6":-0.11291982512921095},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

There simply is not enough data out there for us to KNOW.  Some people believe that it will cause a massive amount of warming, while others, like me, suspect that it might cause a mild amount of warming.  But, we know for certain that living things react differently to various levels of CO2.\n\nTerrestrial plants seem to grow best with a higher level than we now enjoy, while certain sea life seems to be being harmed by the now elevated levels in the oceans.  I don't know if this will lead to overall harm to the ecosystem as a whole, but I'm not interested in finding out after the fact that it was a problem.\n\nSo, yes, I do support efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, here and abroad.  I suggest making them unnecessary, by improving our non-fossil fuel energy sources to the point where they are economically and environmentally superior to the old coal and oil solutions.  This way, everyone wins.  The companies who use the new, improved energy sources win because their costs go down, the environmentalists win because the new energy sources impact the ecology less, etc.\n\n&gt;I have seen you suggest several times that there is no need to do anything more than you are already doing in the US,\n\nAgain, this is not what I have said.  It's what your opinion of me has suggested to you.  What I actually said is that the US, for the last 7 years, has been actively doing the things necessary to go down the path that you want - overall reductions in per capita emissions.  We have been increasing fleet average fuel economy.  We have been designing and improving electric drive trains, and electric only vehicles that can be powered by clean energy sources. We have been building electric power infrastructure to charge up those clean running vehicles.\n\nWe have been switching from coal to natural gas.  Remember that natural gas is half as carbon dioxide intensive than coal.  As an interim measure, that's quite a bit better than simply remaining with coal, don't you think?  You say that we've \"done nothing\" and that all of our gains have been because of a downturn in the economy.  I would like to politely disagree, even if you've not been very nice to me.\n\n&gt;the developing world should be regulated under threat of economic sanctions.\n\nWhat I said was that the developing world cannot be allowed to increase their emissions to the point where they simply change places with the US in terms of CO2 emissions levels.  If we, through whatever mechanism you desire, are able to cut our emissions levels in half, drop down to, say, 8T per person, but China continues to grow to 12 or 15 T per person, how is this helping the planet?\n\nIf they will not agree even to slow down their growth, any advances we make are moot. Can't you see that?  Again, I am NOT suggesting that we should not do anything if they don't.  I do advocate for all nations to pay attention to their CO2 emissions levels and if they are high (like ours is high) they work to reduce them, as the US is working to reduce ours.  I support moving from 38% coal powered plants to 0% coal powered plants.  I support moving from oil to natural gas, where we can do so.  I support putting cheap solar panels on every roof in the US.\n\nBut, we cannot simply say, \"The US should pay an increasing amount of tax on carbon dioxide emissions, so that they drop to very low levels, but nothing else needs to be done.\"  It's not true.  We can't just trade places with the developing world and call it done.\n\nWe need to figure out how to reduce our emissions AND get commitments from the developing nations on what levels they will never exceed.  China was at 7.1T per person two or three years ago, and have been rising by 10% per year for over a decade. Last year, 2013, they also had a poor economic year, and only increased their CO2 emissions by about 3%, but that was an anomaly, not the trend.\n\nWhen they cross 10 Tons per person, and they will, will they become bad?  When they cross 12 Tons per person, and the US has dropped to 15 Tons per person, will you consider thinking about how they should slow down their growth?  If China and the US get to the point where their emissions are equal per capita, will you still insist that the US is the Biggest Villain, and China must be allowed to grow?\n\nIndia has been growing at six to seven percent per year.  Sure, they started off a lot lower than the US or Europe, but they are still growing. Mexico is considered a developed nation, I think, and has as high a per capita emissions rate as the US does.  Do you wail and moan about Mexico? No, that's reserved for the US.  Canada also has about the same as the US, they just have fewer people.  Australia is very similar, but it's the US that you seem to have a special hatred for.  We must be the ones to suffer high taxation rates to force our fossil fuel rates to plummet.\n\n&gt;What about carbon tax and subsidies to green energy?\n\nSo, I've looked over the Carbon Tax scheme someone else, (sorry, can't remember who right now) linked in.  It suggested a $10 per ton carbon tax in 2016, increasing by $10 per ton each and every year until 2035.  This would be almost inconsequential in 2016, but would ramp up over the years to make coal and oil prohibitively expensive to use.  \n\nDo you know what my reply to that scheme was?  I don't like extra taxes, and I don't like the idea that we must make energy (and everything that depends on energy, like food) more expensive, but I'm on board with the idea.  I actually like consumption taxes better than I do income taxes, and this is a pure consumption tax.  So, let's do it.  Let's implement that tax scheme, and start sending me my carbon dividend.\n\nMy prediction is that such a scheme will increase the final costs of goods and services by more than the dividend will pay the average person back, but I'm oddly okay with that.  By the time it's ramped up, smart people will have found a way to alleviate the worst effects of it.  Only those who can't adapt will suffer, so let's do it.\n\nI know that my own, personal cost of living would go up some under this scheme, but I think that I can absorb it. Well, to be honest, my two children will be out of the house in a few years, and my expenses will be lower.  Right now, if my cost of living were to rise by 5%, I'd likely have to default on a lot of debt.  But, in a few years, when the carbon dioxide taxes start making the cost of living rise up, I think I can adapt. Not everyone can, and there will be a lot of people forced from middle class into poverty, but if that's what it takes, then that's what it takes.\n\nI've always said that I believe implementing more taxes will cause an economic slowdown and push people into poverty. I've rarely if ever said that we should not consider doing it.  I just want people to be aware of the consequences, and not live in a Pollyana fantasy that these actions will be completely benign.\n\nI don't really support direct subsidies to green energy, such as feed-in tariffs and forcing energy companies to pay two or three times the cost of producing energy themselves to people who own windmills or solar panels and sell their excess energy to the companies.  That seems to be counter productive, to me. Instead, I like the idea of helping people to buy solar panels, giving tax breaks to companies who install renewable energy sources for their own use, etc. \n\nI would like to see more industry investment into energy storage systems.  Right now, the biggest hurtle for renewable energy is the inconsistent nature of it.  When it's coming in strong, it's too strong for the need a lot of times. Then, there are some times when the demand is strong, and there is none produced.  An efficient, reliable energy storage system can fix that.  We use pumped water in my area.  I'm not 30 minutes away from a place where there's a good sized reservoir pair.  One on top of a ridge, one at the base.  When the local grid is producing too much energy, water is pumped uphill.  When there is strong demand, water is allowed to flow back down through the turbines.\n\nThis solution is only about 50% efficient, I'm told (although, some dispute that number and say it's higher). We need to have a much, much more efficient storage solution. I'd invest in that very quickly, if a good one could be found.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2316247815435588,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29782832275140614,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2720071542133415,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30796559217089786,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31399438738789187,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2734065211481889,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2561934094315577,"solar_1":-0.11714885584490276,"solar_2":-0.1910933151516649,"solar_3":-0.07130061477073468,"solar_4":-0.11033163434331072,"solar_5":-0.12002259708727554,"solar_6":-0.02135200490495966,"solar_7":-0.08191293841809966,"solar_8":-0.10900068248520256,"solar_9":-0.04394058624161801,"solar_10":-0.18163103445872633},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

After first year of having solar, I used a total of 16,600 kwh for the year (5,400 from PG&amp;E and 11,200 from my panels).  This would have been about $4,500 had I stayed with PG&amp;E.\n\n**After Solar:**\nThe 5,400 kwh I pulled from PG&amp;E cost me a total of $330 ($0.06/kwh).

The CO2 concentration of the atmosphere had only risen by a 20 or 25 parts per million by then, so we cannot attribute much of that temperature change to CO2.  Three quarters of the CO2 change since pre-industrial times has occurred between the mid-1950s and today, and yet we are only about 0.4º warmer today than we were in the decade preceding the 1950s.\n\nMy statement has never been that we have not warmed, but that the warming is not well aligned with the increase in CO2, and therefore it is questionable to suggest that CO2 is the *main* driver of temperature change.  When we look back further into the Earth's temperature record, through proxies, and see that serious warming has begun when while CO2 stayed low, and that at times, temperature fell drastically while CO2 continued to climb for long periods of time (well longer than our piddly 130 year record, or the 40 years of \"anthropogenic warming\"), it's even more clear that a warm world causes a rise in CO2, and a cold world causes a falling of CO2.  We just came out of the Little Ice Age, which is 500 years or so of cooler temperatures.  Could that have caused a lower than optimal amount of CO2?\n\nWe only really started measuring CO2 reliably in one location in the mid-1950s.  Before that, we had sporadic and wildly varying measurements of atmospheric CO2.  \n\nAs long as our CO2 levels keep climbing rapidly and our surface temperature doesn't, we must view the connection between surface temperatures and CO2 with more and more suspicion.  \n\nIt could very well be that CO2 is affecting the temperature, but at what level?  Honestly, I think we should be continuing to develop and deploy solar PV, solar hot water systems, wind (where it makes sense), tidal power stations, geothermal, bio-generated methane and research safe nuclear solutions.  Oil and coal are cheap and plentiful now, but there are other pollutants besides CO2 that are released when we burn oil and coal.  The reserves of oil and coal are limited, and will eventually run out.\n\nI just don't panic over the thought of temperatures suddenly rising out of control and causing the type of destruction the anti-fossil fuel propaganda crowd would have us believe.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00016698633650473008,"1.1.1_stance":-0.261050521900295,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2683157081622682,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2667809886173908,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21043563432900117,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19948421026920563,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08995351201156154,"solar_1":-0.006967317555487777,"solar_2":-0.06921268689135711,"solar_3":-0.017863342864681424,"solar_4":-0.0020512720414747796,"solar_5":-0.0016044644204763852,"solar_6":-0.00043397212599908624,"solar_7":-0.0009054452542234989,"solar_8":-0.0008256789199852695,"solar_9":-0.009632651982731963,"solar_10":-0.008117557459627278},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (in favor of renewable energy solutions, but expressing concerns about the current state of solar and other renewable technologies and their availability)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I'm one Docusign signature away from having a big system installed. My rep is the one who made me aware of this ACC vote. I've been on the fence about the final purchase contract simply because of the loan cost which is not insignificant (25k interest on a 42k system over 20 years, interest you can't deduct) -- not to mention more than anecdotal info from a realtor and friend about failure to qualify on solar loan transfers during home sales.\n\nThe way I understand it, under net metering, you \"settle up\" with your utility at the end of every year for the *net* amount you used in the previous 12 months versus the amount you produced and sold back to the utility. Most home owners break even with a suitably-sized system. Today we have to buy electricity from the utility when the sun goes down, obviously. But solar owners generate and sell back so much electricity, that the evening hours when you still need AC are almost a wash financially.\n\nAfter the new rules go into effect *and after the grandfather period*, these \"off-peak\" times when the sun isn't shining but you need AC because it's still 100 degrees at midnight, you'll buy electricity from APS at full retail rate, not at a reduced rate for off-peak usage because APS makes you change your plan in order to install the interconnect. You won't get credit for the excess electricity you generated when the sun was up. This essentially wipes out any financial advantage to having solar installed on your home in the first place (if 20 years of non-deductable interest weren't enough.) In fact, your net out-of-pocket cost of energy for anyone who isn't in the sales pipeline before the new rules hit, chooses solar after the rules hit, or gets to the end of the grandfather period is actually much higher than someone who just buys electricity from the local utility.\n\nSure, 20 years is a long, long time and a lot can change over that time period, but the math, the way it looks right now, doesn't look good. I'm hoping someone can tell me how this doesn't destroy solar in a state that gets 300+ full sun days every year.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"frustrated but still pro"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000375199345095704,"1.1.1_stance":-0.6820770800113678,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18801597857658678,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2032677510178963,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29707503149843106,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.040239900505791106,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.267151127535913,"solar_1":-0.2413418218901029,"solar_2":-0.15695163795802122,"solar_3":-0.3138286345176488,"solar_4":-0.14013636941018096,"solar_5":-0.1710431617414725,"solar_6":-0.0770175009141288,"solar_7":-0.006749918019825903,"solar_8":-0.06698352801807535,"solar_9":-0.19309675003865007,"solar_10":-0.19089497422936486,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.030351576421480786},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

We have a lot of south-facing roof space, so that's not really a concern.\n\nWe got quotes from a couple companies friends had recommended, and the one installing Q Cell panels actually quoted a much higher price than the company that installs the Sunpower panels.\n\nThe company that installs Sunpower also installs Silfab panels. They gave us a quote for a Silfab system (Silfab 310 - 8.37 kW with Solar Edge optimizers/HD Wave string inverter) that costs about 5% less than the Sunpower system (X22 360 AC - 7.56 kW with preintegrated microinverters).\n\n1. Thoughts on Silfab? Thoughts on this situation? (\"Get more quotes\" is a thought I am having, but I'd rather go with a company that's been recommended to us by people we know than one we just found online, and we know very few people who've even looked into home solar locally.)\n2. I read somewhere that a perk of Sunpower is their warranty covers the whole system, whereas with the Silfab setup above, we'd have separate warranties for the panels and for the inverter, and if something were to go wrong, we could end up chasing various companies (with Silfab pointing at Solar Edge as the problem and vice versa). Is that right? I feel like it's worth paying the extra 5% to not have to do that.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"yes","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.30752414589096194,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19942211681029134,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21769686919386788,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3204203172835112,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2358616681273046,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30251037607587294,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24432131393633583,"solar_1":-0.189387513721571,"solar_2":-0.25162659404549864,"solar_3":-0.21998787152870847,"solar_4":-0.2093711977967061,"solar_5":-0.0433032048727758,"solar_6":-0.3188980635662052,"solar_7":-0.16174976360951557,"solar_8":-0.2154145418367663,"solar_9":-0.23003498512480292,"solar_10":-0.17175245164499356},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

With the charge controller you mentioned you would want to run them in 3s2p, or 3 panels in Series (one string), and 2 strings in Parallel.  The charge controller will convert that 100-150V down to the proper battery voltage, whether 24, 48, or other.\n\n&gt;Would we have to get twice as many batteries for a 48V system to get the same Ah, or would it actually require less amp hours from the battery for the same amount of wattage used?\n\nWatts are the true measure of instantaneous energy, and Watt-hours is the measure of energy storage.  Watt = Amp \\* Volt.   In other words, a 24v 200Ah battery bank stores 4800Wh of energy, while a 48v 100Ah also stores 4800Wh of energy, and they could actually be the exact same batteries, just the first has four 12v 50Ah batteries wired 2 in series 2 in parallel, and the latter has the same four batteries wired 4 in series. The cost, size, and total storage is the same, but the advantage of higher voltage is smaller, cheaper wiring, more batteries in series (better), and higher efficiency in charge and inverter conversions.   I second the recommendation to use 48V\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also recommend strongly considering Lithium Iron batteries, I read your cost concerns, and the cost per *usable* Watt-hour is a definitely more up front, but much less in the long run.  I know sometimes it's just not feasible to spend more up front to save money down the road, but do it if you can.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008355345538196465,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26023926744665477,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17791790953799896,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25594190819537804,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1807838763763551,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2715278918166938,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18809639856397098,"solar_1":-0.26351764917735576,"solar_2":-0.11716808467631983,"solar_3":-0.2678783815827795,"solar_4":-0.03575497776951952,"solar_5":-0.10737857171989162,"solar_6":-0.07659106404025806,"solar_7":-0.05148897138189549,"solar_8":-0.22934609586324464,"solar_9":-0.06533965464870306,"solar_10":-0.2254771846055718},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (the author expresses a desire for more solar options, specifically more powerful solar systems)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Not sure about if these grid access charges are part of nem 3.0 or a seperate thing though.\n\nI think net metering is a bit of a subsidy for non solar users to solar users which is a regressive redistribution. This is because the retail rate seems to cover a lot of infrastructure in the distribution part of the charge so a larger flat rate cost for solar users seems to be the right answer to this.

Seriously, you're willing to pay 25-30% more for something just so you can borrow the money to do it? That's a 100% gratification now mentality and part of the reason why this country is going down the shitter. I read this whole string and not once did anyone mention paying to maintain and keep your array running. Yeah sure there are warranties but we all know that's a backyard brawl waiting to happen with all sides blaming the other for the failure if something stops working. Meanwhile, while your system is down in year 11 of your 25-year loan, your making your loan payment and buying 100% of your grid-tied electricity.\n\nThe unguaranteed electricity price hikes all the solar installers scare you with, think about it, do they have crystal balls and can predict the future? I've watched the prices swing up and down in Texas for years. It's high now, but 18-24 months from now, it will go back down again. Scare, scare, scare. That's what our country survives on now. What's the next big scare to get you to go out and buy something to save your family? Come on people. Solar makes sense IF YOU CAN PAY CASH. That's it. You can convince yourself low-interest high dealer fee loans are worth it. You can convince yourself that HELOC is worth it. Anything other than cash and you are fooling yourself with fools math.\n\nIt's a \"NO BRAINER\" says the sales guy.\" \"I've been doing this for 10 years and I have never seen a time better than now to install solar,\" says the sales guy. THEY ARE SALESMEN and will always be SALESMEN. Their job is to convince you that taking out that loan on a product that is 25-35% inflated in price, that you will be paying back for 20-25 years is the way to go. \"Just imagine how much electricity will be in 25 years,\" says the salesman. Funny, I have paid for electricity for a lot of years and I am paying less today than I did 25 years ago. How do you explain that Mr. Salesman? You can't which is why you have to convince me to buy your inflated by 25-35% solar array to be in control of my electricity destiny, save the planet, and give your money to me instead of the big bad evil electricity company.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0009076552620778481,"1.1.1_stance":-0.305468244114844,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27967429137598165,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28252315936501565,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2506018873171077,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.04617106138418118,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22123689002667865,"solar_1":-0.09032110294841307,"solar_2":-0.00206683143430079,"solar_3":-0.04243607777849926,"solar_4":-0.10698956292020177,"solar_5":-0.0012357006077460635,"solar_6":-0.013569832968642004,"solar_7":-0.0021362969018809963,"solar_8":-0.019243443941377336,"solar_9":-0.09041978864964524,"solar_10":-0.1574994050509607,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.13774279210095605},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.

After much soul-searching, we have decided to change our official recommedations for certain cats.\r\n\r\nUrinary tract problems are fairly common in cats, and because of the relative acidity of meat to vegetable protein, some vegan cats suffer from them.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have been giving advice for some time on how these problems can be minimized while still feeding a completely vegan diet, we have found that many of our customers have not been following this advice. It is imperitive to feed your cat a vegan diet properly for optimal health, as not doing so may jeopardize your cat's well-being (as is the case with improper feeding on any other diet - ideal nutrition is a necessity for optimal health!)\r\n\r\nUnless you are very committed to following the advice outlined on our site by feeding your cat a properly balanced diet as per the information below, we recommend that you mitigate the risk of urinary tract problems by feeding males cats only a 25-75% vegan diet and females a 50-100% vegan diet. Of course, many cats (both make and female) will thrive on a simple vegan diet and never have any complicatons from urinary tract infections or crystal formations, you need to be prepared to adjust the diet accordingly for cats who may be prone to such issues.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to reduce suffering as much as possible through reducing dependancy on meat products for your companion animals, but at the same time, we also have great concern for the overall health and well-being of cats who are prone to urinary tract problems.

There are plenty of plant based fats out there, but they will not compare to butter or lard when that is something you've been eating your whole life. You have to think of vegan food as something entirely different. Have you tried coconut oil? Avocado oil? Almond oil? You are probably biased against plant-based fats (a.k.a. \"olive oil is inferior to butter/etc.\") \n\nThe same happens when someone goes to a \"low fat/low salt/low flavor restaurant and expects everything to be bland. If you go in with that mindset, that healthier foods aren't tasty on their own, then you really do feel that way.\n\nBy the way, most recipes I make have about 3 T of oil, and that is not low fat in my opinion. But, whatevs. Everyone is different. Try checking out Robin Robertson's 1000 Vegan Recipes. Every single dish I've tried tasted great. You could try making raw foods as well.

I like that you want to become a vegan and I hope you will become one. Right now you are a vegetarian, I'm telling this to you in the most polite way possible, because others won't. It is not good to say you are a vegan when you occasionally eat animal products, because vegans don't eat animal products.\n\nI myself have a very loving grandma aswell, that I visit every saturday for breakfast and sorting her medication, also some quality time. When I made the step to vegeterianism she accepted me for my new me. When two weeks later I said I made the step to veganism she accepted that aswell. She didn't know what it means, neither why I did it, but she was very interested in it. She did not change much of her own behaviour but she knows why I do it and she knows it's a part of me. My grandma is 83 and that she is still alive is almost a miracle at this point. She has very strong asthma and every day I might get a call that she died. This is not an excuse to continue exploiting animals though, just because she is a little confused at times and might not understand my dietary choices. To me this would just be an excuse to continue the exploitation of animals. A loophole that I built myself. And the animals have to pay for that loophole.\n\nNot every vegan has watched dominion, I've never seen it and I really dislike cruelty in every form. I don't need to see it to know that animals deserve compassion, not torture. If your boyfriend does not want to watch it, but instead is open towards veganism and wants to give it a week trial, that's a good start. Don't force it upon him, instead look forward to that week and make plans what the two of you will eat.\n\nKeep in mind that you met your boyfriend when he was an omni. You chose an omni.

Farmers have tried it. Even in recent years, and it's a failure, unless they cheat with things like terra preta.

It's nonsense. What is true is that many plants are dual-use: Part of them goes to feed human beings, and the leftovers are fed to animals. In the case of soybeans, the mass ratio of that is \"20% human, 80% animals\", but the share is per soybean. Not doing animal husbandry any more wouldn't magically make us need less soy oil, it would just make the oil more expensive.
