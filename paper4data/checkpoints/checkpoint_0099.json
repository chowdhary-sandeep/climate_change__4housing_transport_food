{"transport":[{"comment_index":20800,"comment":"Geez, such vitriol.  What a weird perspective.  I do care enough about the environment to buy a pure effing electric car.  That seems like more of a commitment than those who drive PHEVs.  (I used to be one of them.). I've cut the cord completely for this car, unlike the PHEVs.  The way I see it, those who purchase pure EVs are the most committed to the environment.  Those who drive PHEVs are about as committed as the 40 miles a Volt gets you, or the 18 miles a Plug In Prius gets you and are then willing to fall back on their ICE because they are unwilling or unable to take the next step.  EV owners sacrifice the convenience and safety net of an internal combustion engine and rely on their ability to charge up on the road when driving beyond the available range.  This isn't complicated stuff.  One group NEEDS the chargers, one doesn't..\n\nThe electricity at Disneyland is not free.  Those who use it at Disneyland pay for parking, and they pay for the electricity out of the charger.  I gladly pay for the ability to charge up on the road.  I don't think I said anything about ever wanting free electricity.  Did I?  This has nothing to do with saving pocket change.  Nobody is relying on a free away station charge to get me round trip.  In fact, I would pay significantly more to ensure that PHEVs can't use the stations that pure EVs need, but until that is an option, or until there are enough stations for this to not be an issue, PHEVs should leave the charging stations to those that NEED the charge to get around.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13332241013002508,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2193344518568431,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1796381821937261,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0862733562504755,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1355932138795383,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14578318825179792,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.012535284428546825,"ev_1":-0.15093641229380259,"ev_2":-0.20324149592613594,"ev_3":-0.1408330412623218,"ev_4":-0.14981833569363012,"ev_5":-0.16816357212762037,"ev_6":-0.15744387436037263},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

[Hyundai is going to lease one starting this month](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3027144/this-new-hyundai-car-runs-on-the-poop-of-california-residents-and-the-fuel-is-free).  \n\nIt's a game changer- they are electric vehicles but instead of a half ton of lithium batteries to lug around and replace one day the cars make their own energy.  \n\nCheck out this Top Gear review of the Honda Hydrogen Electric Clarity from 2008 http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/honda-clarity  \n\nHonda H20: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tU6vio6xns  \n\nOne day sooner rather than later you'll be able to make your own hydrogen at home with the solar panels on your roof. Honda is working on home solar hydrogen stations and has just recently installed one in Japan http://world.honda.com/FuelCell/SolarHydrogenStation/  \n\nThe Kelly Blue Book chimes in:\n\n&gt;Better Than a Battery\n\n&gt;Since they're basically electric, it begs the question: Why not just drive a battery-electric vehicle? Ronald Grasman, general manager of U.S. fuel cell vehicle operations with Mercedes-Benz, explained the problems with EVs during the conference. \"Battery vehicles are great,\" he said, \"but they have their limitations when it comes to range and charging time. This is where fuel cell vehicles make a great difference.\"\n\n&gt;In theory, a hydrogen car can beat a battery electric thanks to convenient and quick refueling, and a somewhat esoteric concept called \"energy density.\" An EV requires long recharging times, and even with a big battery, the range of an EV is usually limited to 100 miles or so. However, hydrogen can be pumped into a tank similar to gasoline, and that tank full of hydrogen holds a lot more energy than a battery does. The upshot is that you can get zero emissions, the rough equivalent of gasoline-car range, but without the long wait of recharging, or the hassle of engineering a gigantic battery pack into the vehicle. http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/hydrogen-cars-close-to-reality/2000010655/\n\nEdit: To Whoever-Thanks for the downvote.

It's very important to know when your car was placed in service (a CarFax check should show, or call Ford Customer Care with the VIN number) so you know what to expect for warranty coverage.\n\nFor the Focus Electric, the only thing I'd worry about is the 2G modem.   If it has already been replaced, sweet.   Otherwise, figure out how much it will cost to replace out of pocket.\n\nThe electric powertrain warranty is 8 years/100,000 miles, so that's still in effect.\n\nIf I get a other EV before I can get a Tesla, it's not going to be a Ford.  I was excited when Nancy Goia got the global electrification job, but when Mike Tinskey took over and started slow-walking the \"power of choice\" mantra, and Ford did that tease about a 200-mile vehicle in 2016, I knew Ford was going to bring up the rear echelon in EVs for a generation.    The Focus Electric is a good compliance car, and it benefits from all the solid engineering and manufacturing that went into the Focus platform, but Ford chose 3rd place on purpose.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"political tribe","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00048978656802016,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1988255451059331,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1331836519141992,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.05237922196586927,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19452832981785054,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22115435049407858,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2104448223253712,"ev_1":-0.0038657137047266588,"ev_2":-0.0037552278712003804,"ev_3":-0.00043554938019951805,"ev_4":-0.0001943086511649502,"ev_5":-0.0005189554431126453,"ev_6":-0.15830495832361743,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.32967908059557277},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against (Ford is being criticized for not leading in EVs)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (political tribe)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

However, doing that will increase in SG&amp;A and will affect both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings: and therefore stock price.

It's not meant to be an insult, few people can.\n\nSo I have an i4. I spend a lot of time on the i4 and general BMW EV forums. These are the people that Tesla needs to buy the Cybertruck. The people that can afford it, are willing to pay extra for performance, and are willing to eat the depreciation.  However, to say that the Cybertruck wasn't received well on those forums is an understatement. One of the biggest threads on the i4 forums is just people making fun of it. And very little of it was Elon, most of it was the styling, the crappy interior, the cringy \"Cyberbeast\" name, etc.\n\nThese are the people Tesla pulled away from other luxury cars with the Model S and Model X.  So far, that's not happening with the Cybertruck.\n\n>So? Cars are not an investment, doubly so for a new model that just hit the market. People call it the early investor tax for new products, and it's not unique to cars.\n\nI'm wondering if you understand depreciation.    I'm not saying that to be insulting, but your comment makes me think you don't. For a car, depreciation is part of the cost of ownership. The cost of your car is what you pay to maintain it, any financing cost, and the value loss between buying and selling it, all divided by the months you own it.\n\nIf you buy a Lexus LX and drive it for 20 years, it's a cheap car to you because that large upfront cost of the car is spread out over a long time. If you buy a C8 Corvette for $100k and sell it a year later for $99k, it was a cheap car because it only cost you $1k plus financing plus maintenance.\n\nNow you're hopefully starting to see the issue with the Tesla price drop. People bought a car at $50k, expecting it to be worth maybe $30k 3 years later. With the new car price dropping to $30k, suddenly they can only sell theirs for $20k, increasing the cost of their car by 50%.  I traded in my Model 3 one month before the price drop, and the dealer still can't sell it for $10k less than they gave me for it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.013723015474776426,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10518310891461483,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19145071751764275,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2015098000399535,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06174837484622213,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23435845010339595,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10431292889794956,"ev_1":-0.022996861713181715,"ev_2":-0.1961072605778126,"ev_3":-0.006406596051723075,"ev_4":-0.0032490378155974517,"ev_5":-0.0038740602879746198,"ev_6":-0.03467260231263699},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Unfortunately, concentrating solar doesn't scale down well for a handful of reasons:\n\n1) Above a few x concentration, you need a dual-axis tracker and direct sunlight. Unless your device is pointed directly at the sun, the concentrated light will miss the solar cell partially or entirely.\n\n2) Your concentrator (especially high-concentration ones like the pictures you showed) are effectively death rays: you need heavy-duty water cooling on your solar cell to dissipate the heat effectively, and anything you don't want catching on fire has to stay far away from the path of the light--this includes phones and tablets. (Aside: the high efficiency numbers they claim are for the **combined** heat and electricity generated in these systems. By the same metric, fossil fuel power plants are something like 90% efficient, for reference.)\n\n3) If you want 1000x concentration, you need 1000x the area of your cell in mirrors (neglecting losses). To generate 3 watts (enough to charge a phone) you would need about 9 cm^2 of reflector and an approximately 1mm x 1mm cell (at 33% efficiency, reasonable for a triple-junction tandem cell) and a heckuva lot of water cooling. I don't see what advantage this would have over simply using 18 cm^2 of 15% efficient traditional (p-Si) solar cells. \n\nThe main issue here is that the sun only provides a fixed amount of power per area, and small devices just don't have enough surface area to provide a meaningful amount of power from such a small area of absorbance. This is why solar panels are generally so big and clunky: it's not because the solar cells are all that inefficient, it's just that the sun is only so bright.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001250310366837463,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14384166742315757,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2603820754836003,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25092037084201974,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3758875028491578,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16702846078899733,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013321194631619923,"solar_1":-0.021344055780597653,"solar_2":-0.010123142861023856,"solar_3":-0.10130915133760728,"solar_4":-0.08368463292087351,"solar_5":-0.18386462991475128,"solar_6":-0.006823086133711816,"solar_7":-0.014156121736353574,"solar_8":-0.0061130043044007225,"solar_9":-0.03084818813340462,"solar_10":-0.13747579505413418},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

These LG panels have 25 year warranty which includes labor.\n\nWe average about 390 kWh per month; we don't have central AC, just a tiny window AC in one bedroom, and we have gas appliances. That will be your unknown factor; how much AC you will use in the summer.\n\nI'm in San Diego with SDG&amp;E and their policy says I can go on net metering for 5 years (if I get my Permission to Operate by March 31, 2018), so my plan is to go on net metering, wait for battery prices to come down, then get a storage battery when I am forced to Time-of-Use.\n\nI read the requirements to get the $2k rebate on batteries (120 pages) and it's complicated. I read that you give the utility the right to dump your charge when they need it, and you are Ok with dumping 100% of charge daily to get 100% of the rebate. Will wait on that; too complicated and I want to see how the industry adapts before putting money into battery. Also, my solar guy also says if installing a battery in the future, you have to install the battery with at least one added panel. Not sure if that's right; didn't see it in the docs.

When Solar first came out many years ago, the California utilities had tiered pricing; the more energy a home used, the higher the incremental kWh became (kind of like the tax rate).  This was great for solar customers since the panels reduced overall use of net total grid energy, and solar customers were usually paying on the lowest (cheapest) tier.\n\nWhen Net Energy Metering (NEM) 1.0 came out as an \"enhancement\", it forced all new solar customers to a Time of Use plan.  This meant the kWh rate during the sun-up times was cheaper than the \"peak demand\" rate that was charged between sunset to 9pm.  So the excess energy produced by a residential solar array in the daytime was sent to the utility at the cheaper rate, and the solar customer had to pay the more expensive rate to get the energy back after the sun set (and the PV array stopped generating).   \n\nA perfectly sized system matched to a homeowner's annual consumption would still result in a net true up owed to the utility since the energy used was more expensive than the energy saved.\n\nNow, California is on NEM 2.0 guidelines that further taxes the peak time energy so the energy a PV customer uses after sunset is even more expensive compared to the energy they bank in the daytime.  Plus new solar customers have to pay transport fees and interconnection fees not seen under NEM 2.0.  All in all, it's making the proposition of residential solar worse since it's tougher to pay back their investment since the utilities want their cut to help pay for their infrastructure and subsidies to low income households.\n\nCalifornia is going to move to NEM 3.0 next year that will be even worse.  It basically forces a new residential install to also put batteries in place to save the clean energy locally within the home.  Basically a homeowner has to actively pay to get around the expensive net metering rules being imposed in Caifornia.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2559566696462146,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28244901907333286,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11534023511474056,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19618579574820563,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20067837728610358,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.11694871696333091,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2660370083370556,"solar_1":-0.23439413384227978,"solar_2":-0.25253457475255686,"solar_3":-0.34909619752542353,"solar_4":-0.16854644296817664,"solar_5":-0.13322429591275162,"solar_6":-0.22323101029420891,"solar_7":-0.06301003382153188,"solar_8":-0.20586101259230252,"solar_9":-0.051345612233575366,"solar_10":-0.27772491619625617},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro.

My understanding is that it's 26% this year and falls to 22% next year, then goes away entirely.  I did hear something in the news recently about a bill passing the Senate (?) that might affect residential solar installations, but I haven't had time to read about it and get the details yet.  Or perhaps Texas has its own tax credit?\n\nAnyway, I'd suggest that the first thing to do is reduce your consumption every way you can, since any power you don't use is power your system doesn't have to generate.  Another commenter mentioned managing the swimming pool.  Other things to check are whether your heating and cooling system is the most energy-efficient it could be.  Definitely read about heat pumps and see if one might be right for you in your area--can't tell you that since I'm not an expert on the subject.  We found when we replaced our old AC with a new unit that our electric bill went down by about 15% the month we had it done (August), so that can make a difference.  And how old are your water heater and other appliances?  Attic insulation will help, and you might look into adding a radiant barrier, too.\n\nMost installers will advise against putting solar on an old roof, so you might want to compare the expected lifetime of your solar vs the expected remaining lifetime of your roof.  you may find that you want to replace your roof before the solar goes up.  If so, you might consider going with metal roofing, which will likely outlast your solar, meaning that you'll never be in a position of having to remove those panels to replace the roof and then re-install them afterward (not a cost-free process!).  Metal roofing is also cooler, so it could help with your energy usage.  If you go with the kind that has the vertical channels, it's also easier to install the solar panels on.  If you prefer a more traditional look, several companies are now making metal shingles that do a pretty good job of mimicking the look of asphalt, shake, tile, etc.  So you can look into that if you're interested.  Some solar installers will tell you that you can't install solar on a metal-shingle roof, but this is not necessarily true.  If you end up considering this kind of roof, call the company that makes the shingles directly and ask them whether and how they recommend doing it.  This is a fairly new option, and not all solar installers are up to speed with it yet.\n\nBest of luck with your project!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001953152532223612,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2631618114562484,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23669146092264962,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16273769363760948,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.384524681221794,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25392630384870796,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19370615224276358,"solar_1":-0.0507018271649334,"solar_2":-0.20428822260388793,"solar_3":-0.00498989931656979,"solar_4":-0.01167817777786695,"solar_5":-0.001991155283273353,"solar_6":-0.0019493770651024533,"solar_7":-0.0045817383894852055,"solar_8":-0.001954106216847625,"solar_9":-0.05750041655240542,"solar_10":-0.026079827298720677},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I don't think you'd want to plumb it in series with your boiler like that. First, even if your boiler runs at 165-170 supply temp, it probably only needs to run that hot on the coldest days of the year. With solar you might be able to run longer at lower temps and make more effective use of lower temp water. The controls on something like that would get kind of tricky - if you could do an 'outdoor reset' scheme with your boiler where the aquastat temperature limit increases as the outdoor temp decreases, and then you have the boiler just set a 'floor' on the temp of the buffer tank that the solar could *usually* maintain it above. The hydronic zones would just pull water (at whatever temp the solar manages to raise it to, or at the floor set by the boiler) from the tank as needed, and the boiler would only get involved as necessary. Solar thermal setups like that are far more complicated than just having PV panels and a buffer tank with a resistive electric coil in it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-7.092453112515311e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23501970696509217,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12421129271388054,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12341195717453957,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.35797294255280576,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.0730499643632309,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12422166915105966,"solar_1":-0.001335566029107819,"solar_2":-0.006140005119959824,"solar_3":-0.0026697835770998304,"solar_4":-0.0038703158643329516,"solar_5":-0.0008382443241619816,"solar_6":-0.0004630485927918926,"solar_7":-0.0008751036608979726,"solar_8":-0.0004699588365231951,"solar_9":-0.007260763047573467,"solar_10":-0.013200993703018563},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I might turn it back on to test (since I've since upgraded the sol-ark firmware), but unfortunately when it triggers the inverter shutdown into bypass mode that causes our house (b/c it is wired with sol-ark between main service and all panels) to lose power when restarting the inverter for minutes as it boots.\n\nThis tigo article seems to indicate that the optimizers have been tested to ensure no false trips (nuisance arc faults): https://support.tigoenergy.com/hc/en-us/articles/203508327-AFCI-Compliance#h_01GAKPMYSHFQMP6KKW33CNA94G\n\nIt can also be read via the NEC that arc fault detection is not required if grounded metal conduit and boxes are used from pv panels and mples to the inverter. I do have a roof mounted system in California with metal conduit and boxes, which will finally be inspected this week, so this interpretation will be tested in my jurisdiction.\n\nHopefully this is somewhat helpful.\n\nOh, and to answer the original question, we power our tigo CCA on a circuit from the sol-ark loads panel so it all runs when the grid is down. We have had 3-5 grid down events (some lasting a minute, and others hours) and mostly I only noticed because I saw our solar production was dramatically down (since we weren't exporting, in self consumption mode). I do wish the grid down resulted in some kind of alert or event so we had a history just with powerview/pv-pro,  but now I have solar-assistant w/mqtt integration so I can create my own alerts.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003166442390162653,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13795734193092812,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1895676526978997,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18379586997131506,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10739522086074989,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2180362462610379,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0557034945813939,"solar_1":-0.12731943769784052,"solar_2":-0.11323848387799859,"solar_3":-0.033371252261228314,"solar_4":-0.033082631667033034,"solar_5":-0.22679215079794326,"solar_6":-0.028807056303776335,"solar_7":-0.06769624920949961,"solar_8":-0.09819332730936974,"solar_9":-0.034030516616219586,"solar_10":-0.23842093689988056},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

And while sure it would of been better to buy in the long run.. Wife would not let me put out any money, Going into my 4th year.. And has saved a few hundred every year what I would of normally put out every year.. I had 3 years of past electric costs, and I know what I am putting out with the lease cost, and what getting charged by the electric company.. And so far I have saved money.  The one thing the sales guy did not offer up, which he should of is there is a cost to just be connected to the grid from my electric company.. This is like 14 a month, and would have this cost if I used 0 electric.. So that is a 168 a year that I thought I would be saving, that I am not.  But still saving money for the year.\n\nSo my savings are bit lower for each year then the math I did.. Also my electric company while I have net metering where 1 kwh sent, gets me 1 kwh in credit.. The other thing the sales guy didn't mention is they zero you credits once a year.. You can pick spring or fall date.. But any credits you have are zero'd - they don't send you a check (even at wholesale price) or give you a cash credit, they are just gone.. I have lost 100 some kwh worth of credits every year so far.. Now in the big picture, not the end of the world, and your really only talking a few bucks.. But its the principle that ticks me off, I don't care if its 2 bucks..\n\nSo a lease can save you some money on electric, the way I looked at it - is I am locking in cost of electric that my panels produce at price X for the next 20 years.. Now if price of electric goes down, then I am not going to save any money.. But if they go up I make out more every year..\n\nI looked at this way... If you could get a deal where you could buy 500 gallons of gas every year for 3 bucks a gallon.. Would it be worth it.. Sure if gas is above 3 bucks your saving money, at least on 500 gallons.. If you don't use 500 gallons then your not going to save.. But if you use 600 every year your saving money.. If gas goes to 5 bucks, your saving more money.. at least on that 500 gallons.. Now if it goes to 2 bucks, you costing yourself, etc.. \n\nMake sure you do the math, make sure you check the math, triple check, etc.. Make sure you read all the fine print.. For example mine says if panels don't produce X every year they will pay the difference... And sure the amount they guarantee to produce goes down every year, etc.. But in the fine print, its over the life.. So if you over produced in year one by say 1000 kwh.. But under produced in year 2 by 900, your out of luck.. Because your 100+ what the panels should of produced in 2 years.\n\nMake sure you understand what your electric company is going to charge you even if you use 0 electric from them.. Make sure you understand how the net metering works, and if it zeros or you get a credit, or they just rollover.. And then do the math again!!! If you can save money, then go for it.. But sure if you can buy, that is prob going to be bigger bang savings in the long run... But yeah you can save money on a lease.. Just know what your getting into..  \n\nBut then again, don't forget to do the math on how much the cost of the panels could earn over the years if that money was invested.. If you borrow it, how much interest you are going to be paying.. \n\nBut yes, leases can work out for both parties.. Sure the company is going to be making cash, they wouldn't be in business if they weren't - but you can also save money as well.. It can be a win win for both parties involved..","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0054072479251772165,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3923675829234543,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2189919218212618,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1652413977331778,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23470844666489937,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18740905678727562,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20733688624538993,"solar_1":-0.18591780148086173,"solar_2":-0.10823411344071565,"solar_3":-0.11389254551690578,"solar_4":-0.20584676486743328,"solar_5":-0.04051162247439303,"solar_6":-0.17236814722612812,"solar_7":-0.05894071040615687,"solar_8":-0.14689076409063814,"solar_9":-0.04063150316592612,"solar_10":-0.23997664004843244},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I think your overwhelming (and admirable) compassion for animals has clouded your vision and stifled your compassion for your husband, and I don't think that's fair. He's not vegan, and you claim you accept that. He eats a plant based diet with you, and that is a big compromise that a lot of non-vegan partners don't make for their SO. You are lucky, and I think you should focus on recognizing that and appreciating him for what he does do. You don't have to like what he does. You don't have to condone it or support it. But you DO have to support HIM as a person, as a human being, as the man you are married to. Anger at him over actions that he doesn't have a philosophy against committing is, in my opinion, a little immature. Organizing those actions into negative emotions about him \"touching [you] with those hands\" is at best over dramatic and at worst narcissistic.\n\nIt's ok to feel and express displeasure over these actions. But ultimately you have already made the choice to accept him as a non-vegan. Now you either need to re-evaluate that decision, or decide to stand by it. If you decide to stand by it, then you can't hold it against him for choosing to do things that go against your personal philosophy when he never agreed to adopt that philosophy for himself.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0018140587490051985,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27423367755529937,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.32284492937203246,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.32873367106139995,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08845076765856988,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2428904381031714,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.033573509970059,"diet_1":-0.07333639045828022,"diet_2":-0.016582993310294114,"diet_3":-0.06400399868895572,"diet_4":-0.006432000208102788,"diet_5":-0.021059008657175582,"diet_6":-0.019465763308592916,"diet_8":-0.004141992512207556,"diet_9":-0.0027113536392183355,"diet_10":-0.03798026016253667,"diet_11":-0.009754187900398392,"diet_13":-0.013418047531255676,"diet_14":-0.13836796278580246,"diet_17":-0.025752366508337825},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

You're always going to have that small and highly vocal segment of any group - learn to tune them out and you'll find the rest of us are more reasonable.\n\nI'm an anarchist and so is every vegan I know in real life. There is no ethical consumption under capitalism, but you're right, steps can be taken to be more ethical. Being vegan is one of them. You can't stop contributing to human animal suffering, but you *can* easily stop contributing to non-human animal suffering (within reason.) I already contribute to so much suffering just by owning a phone and eating non-locally grown foods. Why would I purposely buy foods that only exist because a being suffered and died when I could just get some beans instead? I want to end all suffering, not say, \"Welp, I guess this is good enough.\" \n\nThe health issues you mentioned are also typically avoidable if the person pays any attention at all to what they're eating. I've lost 30 pounds this year (25 since going vegan) and have 50 more to go. I'm not starving myself, just tracking calories/nutrients and eating mostly whole foods. I can't afford processed foods most of the time anyway.\n\nI just barely don't qualify for food stamps and I spend less on food than anyone else I know. I also have three jobs, numerous mental illnesses, and rheumatoid arthritis. There are few people in Western countries who have more excuses to not be vegan than I do, yet I still do it. The reality is that \"it's too expensive\" or \"it's too time-consuming\" are just excuses, not valid reasons. Neither are true, or my broke, overworked ass wouldn't be able to do this. Of course there are exceptions for people living in food deserts or people who are disabled and cannot go shopping for themselves or others in truly extreme circumstances, but for 95% of the population, going vegan would be so easy and come with few downsides. The hardest part about being vegan is actually other people being dicks about it, not anything about your food or reading labels on personal care items or avoiding leather.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.07511341261361319,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3248119506978181,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15255249710433072,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2425376835742913,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22632649595228335,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2839208051870567,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24473653019716343,"diet_1":-0.09050470838231679,"diet_2":-0.15982198546811474,"diet_3":-0.27507808762585306,"diet_4":-0.10831576543765635,"diet_5":-0.1150041869230402,"diet_6":-0.05123705768005462,"diet_8":-0.013241922836944772,"diet_9":-0.004291850156732835,"diet_10":-0.02662904153112322,"diet_11":-0.04280580300837755,"diet_13":-0.285030593474706,"diet_14":-0.055561424490103185,"diet_17":-0.14825794597466788},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

What adds up is mostly processed foods you will notice so sticking to whole foods and plants will be more affordable. Buying in bulk for items like oat milk, rice and beans will save you $$$. You only really should buy organic for certain products and it doesn’t matter as much for others (e.g. avocado and banana because you peel off the outside that is sprayed with pesticides).\n\nIf you’re having issues with you’re diet and want to pin point what might be not meshing well in your stomach look up “the elimination diet”. You will eat a plain diet at first of rice and maybe beans and then slowly add in other items.

It's definitely gotten better at the average restaurants and venues that you happen to get dragged to by non-vegan friends/family or while doing something not explicitly vegan-friendly like going to see a performance or something. Then I realized it's not even the food that made it a \"struggle\" - it's the people that don't mind seeing you sit through dinner without eating anything and then moving on to the next thing once they're full and dandy, not once thinking about how it might feel to go on *to the next thing* in the plans on an empty stomach (sorry, specific flashbacks to when my friends wanted to go to a steakhouse for dinner on vacation, I couldn't eat anything/just drank and didn't complain during dinner but when they wanted to go do activities on the beach in the sun and then go clubbing/drinking, I'm like *guys... I'm about to pass out, don't forget I'm on an empty fuel tank here*).\n\nBut it's a rock and a hard place - what can we do, insist everyone that wanted to go to/agreed upon one place go to a place they *don't want to* because it's more accommodating? Then people look at us like we're assholes (for wanting to be **included** and not just *\"included\"*? But that's the difference – they **don't want to** eat where we can, and we plain old **can't** eat where they *want* to... and still it's out of the question to consider vegan's ethical restrictions. I almost said *\"people's\" ethical restrictions* but it really is just us that people make struggle like they do, because at least for religious ethical restrictions people consider their guests and loved ones most of the time – which is doubly unfair considering how much more willing to bend/violate one's personal ethics religious folks are than vegans are.\n\nI don't think being a vegan is the struggle. I think the struggle is being within a network of people that don't actually care about what that means.\n\nI laugh when I think of all the times dinner company has told me \"I can't believe you never eat anything, I love food too much,\" with food in their mouths and none in my stomach.\n\n/endrant ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.33970551895569184,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14663941110549267,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20434148291039378,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21334305652578647,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18837055119729484,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2099085989201365,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02345012198202312,"diet_1":-0.05349087644329605,"diet_2":-0.13798955575718233,"diet_3":-0.035134086871037105,"diet_4":-0.0518191753095986,"diet_5":-0.016146440925998224,"diet_6":-0.05933425082669904,"diet_8":-0.0053075538732324885,"diet_9":-0.014910457578177253,"diet_10":-0.12946252579179904,"diet_11":-0.05004527657486809,"diet_13":-0.2191065821837326,"diet_14":-0.18539142452043306,"diet_17":-0.07492485642433167},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
