"comment": "Well, it isn't a lie. It works. There's just a laundry list of severe downsides they aren't upfront about which, when fully understood, render FCEVs objectively less practical, economical and desirable than modern BEVs. \n\nIn the 1990s, FCEVs were far and away superior to the best electric cars. The EV1 originally used lead acid batteries, got a paltry 60 real world miles to the charge, took 8 full hours to recharge without any way to accelerate charging safely, and SLA batteries last all of two years before needing replacement. Fuel cells were **hugely** superior. \n\nLithium batteries drastically changed the equation. It became possible to have an electric car with the same range as an FCEV at a much lower price, which required new batteries less frequently than FCEVs require new fuel cells, and with a far lower financial barrier to rapid rollout of charging infrastructure. A 30 minute fast charger costs a tiny fraction of what a hydrogen filling station does. \n\nFCEVs incorporate large lithium battery packs to buffer the fuel cell output anyway. It's just a question of whether there's any point to having the fuel cell and hydrogen tank taking up space that could be used for more battery, when the hydrogen powerplant only drives up cost, both upfront and over time, while not offering added range. \n\nIf batteries came that far in the span of 24 years while fuel cells made comparatively little progress, by 2040 or so batteries will be so disproportionately superior to fuel cells as a means of powering an electric car that nobody would want an FCEV even if they were still being sold by then.",

"comment": "a)  I'm an 'murican in Texas, so all my info should be taken with a grain of salt.  I know nothing practical about designing on the other  side of the equator beyond that we point the other way.  \n\nb)  west faces can be alright.  we regularly prefer SW over SE, because of two reasons: (1) sun through the afternoon and late evening hours is a wee more 'effective' than early morning sun.  (2)  Load matching.  on a broad scale, (think about applyingthis to the entire utility/grid) a nice thing about the west face is that it gives you peak performance during peak load times.  AC units kick on heavy in the afternoon, and a SW pitch gets the best return in the afternoon.  it does a lot to even out the high's and lows.  on the individual level, this becomes a little less important, since your utility is (likely) charging you by the kWH produced and consumed over a month, and the timing on any given day is irrelevant.\n\nif you're designing radiant floor heating, then I'd highly suggest going with a solar thermal to operate that.  I have a saying: \"Don't ask a butcher to bake you a cake.\" your solar thermal system is best designed to push radiant floor heating.  If you ask your PV system to do that, it could, but you're going to loose efficincies, and the systems tend to include more moving parts, which can only decrease efficinecies and increase down-time and repair/maintenance costs.  A DSW (Domestic Solar Water) system is best tied to your water lines and radiant heating, and your PV is best tied into your electrical panel, and never the twain shall meet.  \n\nRadiant heating is a no-joke load, so make sure you have your numbers run twice on that.  It is much easier to design smart in the beginning than have to patch the system together a year later..  \n\nI'm still out on the instant hot water debate.  I just havn't done the research too intensly.  some hard-line hot water people love them, others hate them.  and the reasons vary.  sorry, i'm no help there.\n\nYour electric car.  go crazy.  just realize that what you're doing is factoring in some level of \"Load Creep\".  Load creep is when people design a system  to account for xx% of their usage, or, even worse on off grid, 100% of their usage, and then they decide to get an alarm clock.  or they just want to use the blender once a week.  or Little johnny grows up and learns to sit his face in front of the hypno-machine for an extra 3 hours a day... Loads will always creep up.  it is very hard to whittle them down.   For this reason, you may want to consider running your #'s on the pv system twice, to make sure you're accounting for extra kWH usage over time. but you don't wnat to oversize too much.  it is really a balancing act.  \n\ncall around to a few companies, send them your plans, and have the quotes done.  they'll be able to give you a much better analysis than me on the other side of the world.  \n\ndo you have rebates and incentives there?  tax breaks?  \n\ngrid failure, just so I touch on this:  batteries are expensive.  very expensive.  and since you're grid tied, they're just gonna sit there and waste money.  it seems you know that, which is good.  i'd be dubious about claims of 'running the house' from the car battery... that seems like a stretch to me.  you might be able to charge a laptop or something like that reliably, but you're not gonna 'run the house'.  fair warning.  \n\nAnyhow, that's what I've got so far.  Good Luck.",

"comment": "Those are massive steps forward though. The Model X is already a couple of years late, and it doesn't fix the fundamental problem of the fact that electric cars still command a significant price premium over their regular equivalents, and are still more expensive over the lifetime of the car especially since gas prices have fallen. And even then, estimates are that they've only taken about 20,000 pre-orders as of September, which would only lead them to maybe 50-60k cars produced in 2015 if the Model X does go on sale in the Spring as is currently forecast.\n\nThe other issue is competition from other manufacturers. Contrary to public opinion, the traditional automakers aren't just sitting on their backsides watching Tesla from afar, but are pumping their own millions into all-electric research and are planning to hit the market with all electric cars in the next 3-4 years when the tech is more refined, to supplant their more affordable hybrids.",

This lowers expectation of future improvements.\n\n- has less supporting infrastructure.

"comment": "Tesla Model S uses a gigantic battery pack. It is between 2.5 times to 3.5 times the size of the Nissan Leaf pack and 3.75 to 5.3 times the size of the Chevrolet Volt battery pack. Clearly and obviously then, the power to energy requirements of the Leaf and Volt are greater and the vehicles must be able to deliver consistent performance across entire SOC range. (Tesla performance is known to vary with SOC - this is not acceptable when a car that does 0-60 in 9 sec already. Tesla Model S cells are therefore completely inappropriate to use in a ~20 kWh EV, as the battery size decreases the power to energy requirement increases and therefore the energy density of the cells must decrease.\n\nShort range EVs have used 18650s before. Tesla builds the powertrain for the Mercedes Benz B-class. While it is not a ground-up EV, the powertrain does not seem to offer massive benefits or improved performance over for example, the Nissan Leaf.\n\n&gt; All three vehicles use lithium-ion batteries. The Leaf and the Volt use cells with a lithium manganese oxide cathode (LMO), while the Tesla uses cells with a lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide cathode (NCA).\n\nTesla is NCA, Nissan Leaf is LMO with LNO (according to AESC), Chevy Volt is NMC (NOT LMO). LG Chem seems be be producing higher Ni-rich NMC cells now, so LG Chem cells are becoming closer to those used in Tesla. \n\n&gt;  This cost advantage will shrink in the future, but it is still fairly significant[4]  \n\nGraph only goes to 2013, in 2015 the gap would be fairly small, and it is getting smaller in the future. Also note that Nickel and Cobalt are much more expensive than Manganese and the Leaf doesn't have a cooling system. Of course, Nissan Leaf cells are known to have poor longevity possibly due to lack of thermal management and sensitive chemistry - but I am not convinced on a per kWh basis Tesla is much cheaper than AESC, if at all. LG Chem is rumored to be operating its facilities at 30%, there CEO is confident they can improve costs.\n\nhttp://chargedevs.com/features/lg-chem-power-ceo-were-the-li-ion-leader-for-pevs-because-of-material-science/\n\n&gt; I think there is a fundamental flaw in the way that GM, Nissan, Daimler, and all the other major auto companies approach safety. Nissan and Chevy approach battery safety like this: let's use the safest cells in the hope that they will be less likely to catch on fire.\n\nI think you don't know anything about the way GM, Nissan, or Daimler design there batteries.\n\nEnd result is pouch cells are becoming closer to 18650s in cost, possibly offer superior thermal dissipation, and chemistry is seemingly converging at a place closer to Tesla. That's even though the energy density might be somewhat lower. Part of lower energy density is due to different performance requirements of Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf. Therefore your statement that \"I think Tesla's lead in the EV space is only going to grow.\" cannot be correct.\n\nI think Tesla will likely deliver an innovative product that will be different from its competitors. I think it will be a product that more people want to buy and it will play to the strong points of battery / EV technology (as the Model S does). I don't think the powertrain will be much more technologically advanced than competitors, if at all.",

"comment": "Hey! Wholesale Solar here. We saw your question about the Enphase micro-inverters and wanted to chime in with a bit of our own experience. We asked Josh, our solar tech guru, about this (emphasis added):\n\n&gt;The current Enphase micro-inverters (M215 and M250) were put through some seriously strenuous testing prior to being made available, to be sure that problems won’t manifest once they were out in the field.\n\n&gt;Both versions have **internal protection for thermal overload**, which prevents the units from being damaged in extremely high temperatures. An ambient temperature rating of up to 149°F keeps the micro-inverters cranking out power even under  the hottest temperature conditions. That’s just the ambient temperature rating; the microinverter itself is rated to an internal operating temperature of 185°F.\n\n&gt;Honestly, if you think heat could be a problem, be sure to allow for adequate spacing and ventilation under the array and around the micro-inverters. Industry standard is to mount the micro-inverter below the panels so they're not in direct sunlight for prolonged periods of time.  Give some space below the array to allow heat to escape. **As long as you take these considerations into account when designing the system as a whole, you should not run into issues even in hot weather.**\n\n&gt;I oversee all of Wholesale Solar's tech support and warranty inquires and I’m seeing a failure rate of less than 1/10th of 1% -- less than 1 in 1000 -- on our Enphase products, which is not too bad considering how much technology is being bolted to the roof of your house. Their failure rates are certainly no worse than any other inverter or micro-inverter manufacturer on the market.\n\n&gt;-Josh, Technical Support Supervisor\n\nAnd here's an opinion from our technician Jeremy, who has an Enphase micro-inverter system at home:\n\n&gt;I have a very strong opinion towards Enphase, as I do have 17 of their micro-inverters on my home system.  Enphase is the best solution for anyone looking to start out in solar and spend less than $5 to $10k.  Their modular setup is flexible enough that you can even add them to homes with existing solar setups, just to offset a new hot tub or electric car. They maximize the power I get from my panels, despite being surrounded by 100-foot tall pine trees. They are easy to install and monitor, and they also eliminate the use of conduit in the attic space since they produce 240 VAC right on the rooftop. Enphase is the easiest system for the local AHJ (\"Authority Having Jurisdiction\" or inspector) to inspect, because the elements are very similar to a simple HVAC System.\n\n&gt;I could go on and on about how much I like the Enphase system. However it does not fit all situations: Larger systems -- say, 20 panels or more -- will usually benefit from a quicker return on investment when using a centralized inverter system, such as a SolarEdge, due to cost. In those instances SolarEdge will save you money, but the installation will be a bit more complicated.\n\n&gt;-Jeremy, Solar Design Technician\n\nAs an added note, the **Enphase micro-inverters come with 25-year warranties**. If you're not sure whether the micro-inverters are the right choice for your setup, check out our [FYI: Grid-Tie Inverters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWOAQ_w2_64) video or give us a call and our technicians will be glad to help you design and fully customize a system according to your particular needs.\n\nOverall, we're glad you're considering solar! We operate differently from Costco in that:\n\n* We specialize in solar, and we've been designing solar systems since before 2002.\n* We sell direct to customers, and every person on our sales staff is trained to help you find the right system -- whether starting from an existing kit or doing something completely custom, and whether grid-tied, off-grid, or some hybrid in between (battery backup or not? payback from the grid or not? roof mount vs ground? etc.).\n* We stock a wide variety of solar systems and components, so we can ship you exactly what you need.\n\nSome of our customers are DIY types and choose to install their own system (we can provide guidance, it's totally a doable project, and it can result in huge savings). Other customers are more comfortable hiring a local installer after getting their system from us. We can do either!\n\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to write back here, visit our website at [http://www.wholesalesolar.com](http://www.wholesalesolar.com), or give us a call at 1-800-472-1142. We'd love to help you find the perfect fit!\n\nSunny skies and good luck in your search!\n\n-Josh, Jeremy, and Roger at Wholesale Solar",

Most of them are awful webview-wrappers around poorly designed websites with little to no integration with my phone. \n\nSo I actually decided to sit down, learn Swift and Xcode and make my own. The result of that effort is SparkMap. It uses MapKit to provide a smooth map experience and the app offers plenty of cool features. \n\n- One-top navigation to a given charging station\n- Read/post comments, ratings, photos\n- Charging station filtering options\n- 3D touch support\n- Responsive map experience\n- All network traffic is SSL encrypted.\n\nI live in Norway so the app is probably fine tuned for Norwegian conditions. I'd love to get some feedback and suggestions from users outside Norway so that I can improve the experience for users everywhere.\n\nThe app is open source but I've decided to charge a small amount for the app through the App Store simply because the Apple developer license costs me quite a few bucks annually.\n\nThanks all and drive safe :)",

"comment": "&gt; So in essence are you arguing that it's the shortsightedness of the states/governments rather than the people's mentality or vision?\n\nYes. Established automakers have failed in the U.S. as well. Let's not forget that the Bolt arrives many, many years after Tesla paved the way and proving to the public that EVs can be desirable and practical. Similarly European car makers have been late due to governments not pressuring them nor giving support for startups. Look to Norway, incentives were put in place and adoption (i.e. demand) skyrocketed. The market is there, old companies just want to delay or ignore them. That's where startups come in and that's where the difference between the U.S. and the E.U. is the greatest, in the U.S. support was given to the tune of 400 million dollars to Tesla, nothing was given to European startups like Rimac to that level. The result? They, Rimac, are not even interested in bringing the technology to lower price points, it's just not possible without huge investments and no hints that they will ever arrive.\n\nCompare European sporadic investments to China\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sflkCVKy5aY\n\nWhere in Europe would you find investments at that level from the local governments?\n\nChinese company LeTv is also set to invest iirc, a cool $1 billion dollars in Faraday Futures. BYD is already doing great things, not just in China. There is just no level of comparison.",

"comment": "I used to work for a competitor for several years, trust me I know what those companies are all about. High pressure sales tactics exist for a reason... \n\nThe only way the local installers can afford to break even on a Sunrun install is to go as fast as possible and cheap out where they can. They only pay like $.50/watt to install, obtain a permit, and buy all of the BOS (electrical hardware not including the panels or inverter). \n\n2.9% is NOT your interest rate. Calculate the total of the payments you will make over the 20 years and you will reveal an implied interest rate of the PPA in the mid-teens. Your payments increase by 2.9% per year, that's not what interest is. As you state, a HELOC or PACE will be in the low single digits for an interest rate with **zero** escalation per year. That means your payment gets cheaper every year because of inflation, and you continue to save more money compared to SDG&amp;E.\n\nAs you state, you don't know if the specs are equivalent. That's OK. Let a local shop educate you on what matters. Personally I think Canadian Solar panels and Solar Edge inverters is the best deal and best value going right now. \n\nAs others have stated, a PPA complicates the sale of your home and gives you no tax credit or tax write off for interest. You're on the hook for all of the interest in a PPA. I don't mean to be combative or talk shit but I am ashamed of having conned a couple hundred people into solar leases in a previous life :/ They may be saving some money but they paid a **huge** premium because of using the company I used to work for. You can and should get a better deal - energy is a commodity why pay more?\n\nYou also state above that HELOC payments would be about the same as a PPA. That's a no brainer - if the payments are the same AND you get the tax credit AND get to write off the interest that's a huge savings compared to a PPA. Maintenance is a scare tactic to get you to pay a premium. There is little to no maintenance required on a typical a solar array.\n\nI'll share a little story here as well. I worked for a small local shop for the past couple of years before moving on recently for a host of reasons. One of my clients reached out to me on Facebook a couple of months ago to let me know how thankful he was for using our company instead of SolarCity (a much more major company than Sunrun). His neighbor got a system through SolarCity. The neighbors' house caught fire because of shoddy wiring of the inverter to the sub panel where the system was interconnected, and had a lot of damage. They were lucky to not lose the entire house.",

And what's being talked about in TFA falls here, not as competition for an existing standard (except perhaps as a better L3, and I don't know what else is in development for what would be a \"level 4\" kind of charge).",

The 30% tax credit makes it easier to ROI, but given that they aren't paying that much per kWh it could take quite a while. \n\nYour model assumes that energy cost will stay the same over the lifespan of the system, and that's highly unlikely. We've had a $0.02 increase per kWh where I live (IL) in the last year. It's difficult to say how much it will go up, so that's hard to model for but it is something that should be included in the model. But all the projections I've seen indicate that energy costs will increase in most markets year-on-year.\n\nAnother potential factor, is that an energy storage solution could increase the value of the house. Solar definitely does, but I'm not as certain around whether it would, but it is something that should be researched and included in the model if there is an impact.",

"comment": "Isn’t Tesla under scrutiny for their battery health “readings” and then “allegedly artificially” plummeting outside of warranty?\n\nPlus EVs aren’t tenable as an only car solution for like most the geographical US due to climate impact on range, use cases like towing, infrastructure etc. the market for EVs is just a smaller segment. I’m not sure who they’re polling, but I’m pretty sure it’s not people cross shopping and making decisions. \n\nI’m not anti EV, I like cars in general and having a somewhat interest in cars like the Taycan and some Fiskers as questionable as they are. Having said that, die hard EV people seem to live in a bubble. They’re not there yet for a lot of the population, at least in the US where it’s not densely populated and we have lacking infrastructure. \n\nEnjoy being an early adopter, man. Theyre neat. I wouldn’t touch a used market EV outside of warranty, and I’d probably by 10 other cars first for the money. The used market on specialty vehicles is indeed seeing some “deals” again, but they’re retaining value better than EVs still. Check out closed auctions on cars and bids or BaT.",

Using those extra cents to subsidise green energy tech (e.g. Tesla EV and rooftop solar) and poverty happens. Do anything with tax (besides reducing it) and poverty happens.  \n\nClimate models are not perfect, therefore they are useless. \nCO2 may be a proven greenhouse gas, but its forcing on earths climate is not proven at 99.999%, therefore it is false. My browser research beats NASA scientists. Hell, my eye balling of temperature graphs [beats most scientists research](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) because ... I am a narcissist?\n\nI think I understand you now except for one thing: Why do you even drive an electric car? You don't believe it does anything good. Is it just because it was subsidised (proving that actually works)? Or maybe an alibi so your kids will think you are one of the good guys?",

"comment": "SPS is great but you can do this with SolarEdge too right now. Check out StorEdge. Without the PowerWall(or other type 300-500VDC battery pack) you can have the SPS you want. Basically you need the StorEdge disconnect and the auto transformer. \n\nAs far as your question about them going under, well you can say the same about SMA. They're having their own troubles right now as well. I'll add more to this reply when I'm at a keyboard\n\nedit: at a keyboard now.\n\nSo, its not an official thing (I think yet...will be soon) but you can do the SPS with SolarEdge. It uses components from StorEdge (the PowerWall kit) but you can do this. Also, you'd be able to get 240V from it, not just 120V like SMA (tho, the SPS on the SMA is awesome).",

You can view the performance of the system [HERE](https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/pv/public_systems/NDuL300492). There is over a years worth of production available on the site I linked.  If you break down hourly production you will get a sense of how the energy production curve works out. Although unplanned, there is a benefit that doesn't usually show up in the calculators out there (at least on my providers plan). Because energy costs more at peak hours, and this is also when my panels produce the most,  I wind up offsetting the most expensive energy of the day.  Not sure what other info I can provide that you haven't gotten already.  Happy to answer any other questions if you have em'.",

"comment": "Well look, to say that your \"storing\" your generation in the grid isn't really the correct way to describe your situation. Your neighbor uses the grid at night in the same exact way as you do. Nothing is being stored. There's energy delivered into the grid by generators, and energy taken out of the grid by consumers. \n\nThis ventures us into a much murkier area of electric generation + sales regulations, which is inherently an unfair process in order to provide grid stability. While the utility wants you to believe that they are the entity whose rights are being infringed upon through net-metering, the reality is that as consumers, we grant grid authorities certain monopolistic rights, and net-metering is a policy that simply asks for a tiny amount of those rights to be re-balanced for a very small class of energy consumers: those who want to own and install on-site, emmissionless micro-generators which produce no more power than what the consumer uses at the end of the year.\n\nLet's say you wanted to generate more energy than you consume, and sell it to your neighbor. How could you? Either your grid is \"regulated\", where there is only one energy seller in town (the power utility). Or your grid is \"de-regulated\", where energy resellers are not allowed to be the generator. So in either case, you're screwed. This has not been of great social concern, because alternative forms of 100% clean energy have been uneconomically feasible. But that assumption has changed given the recent collapse of solar panel prices. So it's proper for the consumer to want to renegotiate that social contract.\n\nLet's shrink the disenfranchised class to a smaller subset: those who don't want to sell electricity to their neighbor, but simply want to sell electricity to themselves utilizing grid infrastructure. How to they get grid access in order to do so? They can't. They're still disenfranchised by regulator policy which promotes a handful of large corporations over small players, again for grid stability. The regulatory hurdles of becoming a power company are simply to large for the owner of an 8kW solar array to participate in.\n\nThis debate was similarly visited when 80MW generators wanting grid-access, resulting in Federal PURPA laws in the late 1970s. Now, a similar policy, net-metering, is being negotiated for significantly smaller \"micro-generators\", which might be 1% of 1% the size of the generator considered by PURPA amendments to federal energy policy.\n\nI want a grid that is powered by 100% renewable power. I want utilities to pay for their total lifecycle costs, including carbon emmissions. And to borrow from Carly Fiorina, one individual offsetting 100% of their electrical energy use with carbon credits won't make a dent in our carbon problem. \n\nSo instead, I'm asking for something much smaller than that: the right to produce 100% clean energy equal to my own usage, without being subject to same regulatory hurdles of a power company trying to power tens of thousands of homes with dirty energy. Net-metering gives me back that ability.\n\nThe only point of contention is one which PURPA also faced: will such a policy raise the price of electricity for a non-participant. But we can't answer such a question, because we aren't on an even playing field. Utilities refuse to value the \"green attributes\" of electricity.\n\nSo net-metering is a policy of compromised consumer protection, which many utilities don't want to give an inch on. \n\nWhen utilities argue that net-metered customers must pay greater grid-access fees, they consistently over-estimate the costs of solar while under-estimating the value of solar. Where is the concession that \"smart meters\" reduced the rights for solar owners (which solar owners were forced to pay for). Where are the \"kwh only, time of day\" electric rates for commercial customers, which \"smart meters\" enable (again with our forced financial support), which is a more fair way to structure \"demand-based\" bills which grossly discriminate against rooftop solar?!!? All of this innovation is being squashed by the fat of the utility.  What utilities promote \"fairness\" with higher fees for residential solar companies, they're really just arguing to have their cake, while eating it too. They don't deserve your support.",

"comment": "The idea here is time-shifting your capacity or smoothing out demand on the grid.  Feeding into the grid while the sun is out is great -- but when power is needed most (evenings) solar power is waning, and the grid is under stress.\n\nBy charging batteries during the day (and/or sending spare capacity to the grid) or late at night when the demand is lower, you increase demand at the trough, and decrease load at the peak -- meaning the existing infrastructure can service more users, for longer.",

Build an EV. Put up some solar panels.  You'd learn that all engineering is about trade-offs and cost limitations.  With unlimited money anything is possible.  So why don't you live in a solar house right now?  \n\nI build and drive electric cars.  I design and use PV systems.  I'm obsessed with alternative energy.

It's impossible to get any solid information about this, which is frustrating because I know there are a good number of households running solely from solar power around here. I feel like tracking them down and asking them myself because two had news articles done on them and both spent under $20K for their complete setup. But at the end of the day, our hydro prices are good and it won't break my heart to just hook up to it. Just trying to find some actual numbers, which seem to be all over the place.",

They had several idea and passed them all.  It is clear that not everyone showed up to the meeting, and most there went quite a bit over board in their discouraging.   \nThis looks similar.   The OPs coops sells green power at a premium price to the members (which they get by purchasing SRECs from others as well as purchasing the power).   So if they can sell solar power at a premium then they certainly can afford to get that power at a rate less than the premium but at or close to retail rates.",

"comment": "&gt;  Real question is, will it cost more than 1.5kwh batteries, yes it will. And more batteries are better in every way.\n\nThat's not quite true. Solar panels gives you trickle-charging while parked, which means it has power that it wouldn't otherwise have. Maybe to cool the batteries or running the AC if it's too hot, without discharging them.\n\nAnd the other question is, will the cost of the solar panels always be significant? It might not be cheaper than the equivalent batteries, but if it one day drops below $100, who cares?",

"comment": "&gt;You end up with a system that taxes the poor to subsidize solar panels on Malibu McMansions and a 700hp Telsa P85D hyper car in the driveway\n\nThere's absolutely no reason why incorporating a carbon tax should have regressive results. A government can simply use the extra revenue to reduce income tax for those on low incomes.\n\n&gt;both of which actually increase emissions\n\nNot even close to being true.\n\n&gt;Look no further the Telsa's market cap... where they are on par with Ford despite selling less cars per year then Ford does in 1 day.\n\nThat's the free market in action. Shareholders apparently believe the company is worth that much based on its potential future earnings. I wouldn't buy at that price, but maybe I'm missing out.",

Even at relatively low penetrations of solar PV/wind Germany frequently generates surplus which is wasted.\n\n&gt; You may have space for 50kW of solar\n\nIf you have 50 kW of residential solar PV you're expecting that there is a grid, and you can continue to sell every surplus to the grid with no curtailment at sufficient price. \n\nIf your car is not parked during the day you're going to need a second battery of at least equal capacity installed in your home, or have two cars you use at half duty cycle each.\n\nIf there's no battery you just dump every surplus into the water electrolysis unit into the stationary hydrogen storage tank, and refuel the hydrogen tank of your fuel cell EV directly, so also no battery.\n\nAlternatively, you inject hydrogen surplus into the natural gas grid with reverse metering, and refuel your natural gas ICE or onboard fuel reformer fuel cell EV from the natural gas line.",

"comment": "Completely untrue. I work in solar. This is horrific news for us and our customers. Americans are less able to afford solar panels than they were yesterday. The fact that fewer Americans can afford it means less solar will be installed. That means less jobs. We're going to lose between 20 and 30,000 solar jobs because of this nonsense, and many Americans who were going to go solar will no longer be able to. There are far more jobs in selling solar, designing solar arrays, the engineering involved, installations, roofers, electricians, etc. Manufacturing was a tiny, tiny sector.\n\nHow does making things more expensive for Americans help Americans?",

"comment": "Due diligence? So you have no respect for what your National Academy of Science said about Jacobson's study? Environmentalist Shellenberger summarises:\n\n&gt;\"Over the last several years, Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo and many politicians have pointed to Stanford scientist Mark Jacobson’s modeling as proof that we can quickly and cheaply transition to 100 percent renewables.\n\n&gt;What is the lie? That we can increase the amount of power from U.S. hydroelectric dams ten-fold. According to the U.S. Department of Energy and all major studies, the real potential increase is just one percent of that.\n\n&gt;Without all that additional hydroelectricity, Jacobson’s entire house of cards falls apart. That’s because there’s no other way to store all of that unreliable solar and wind energy, given the shortcomings of current battery technologies.\n\n&gt;The authors diplomatically call Jacobson’s lie an “error,” but it is in fact a lie and everyone — Jacobson included — knows it.\n\n&gt;In his response, Jacobson writes, “Increasing hydropower's peak instantaneous discharge rate was not a ‘modeling mistake’ but an assumption.”\n\n&gt;What is an assumption? It is “a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof” [emphasis added].\n\n&gt;But what have Jacobson, Gore, DiCaprio and politicians around the world been insisting for years? That Jacobson’s study proves not only that we can power the world with renewables-alone, but also that doing so would be cheaper and more environmentally friendly.\n\n&gt;Upon the big lie rest others.\n\n&gt;For example, around the world, politicians and renewables advocates seeking to close nuclear plants justify their actions by claiming Jacobson’s work proves that nuclear plants are not needed as an alternative to fossil fuels.\n\n&gt;Jacobson himself told the audience during our debate at UCLA last year that California would replace our last nuclear plant, Diablo Canyon, entirely with renewables — and at a lower cost than keeping the plant running.\n\n&gt;Jacobson says these things even though he knows perfectly well that everywhere in the world nuclear plants are closed, fossil fuels are burned instead.\n\n&gt;There are other victims, too, as Environmental Progress Fellow Jemin Desai recently discovered.\n\n&gt;For his summer project, Jemin has been comparing the mining, material use and waste impacts of different energy sources including renewables like solar and wind, which we tend to think of as having little to no environmental impact.\n\n\n&gt;The first thing he discovered is that solar panels in fact contain significant quantities of toxic metals like lead, chromium and cadmium — known carcinogens — and yet no nation outside of Europe has a plan to safely dispose of them. Many could end up in waste dumps in poor communities in Asia and Africa and poison drinking water supplies.  \n\n&gt;How much solar waste is there? About 300 times more per unit of energy than there is from nuclear power.\n\n&gt;As a result, if solar and nuclear waste from producing the same amount of electricity were stacked on football fields, the nuclear waste would reach the height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa (52 meters), while the solar waste would reach the height of two Mt. Everests (16 km).\"\n\nhttp://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2017/6/22/the-case-for-100-percent-renewables-rested-on-a-lie-heres-what-it-teaches-us-about-energy-and-the-environment\nAlso see: Scientists Sharply Rebut Influential Renewable-Energy Plan\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/608126/in-sharp-rebuttal-scientists-squash-hopes-for-100-percent-renewables/",

Then you can send to local installer those details and tell them you are planing to purchase that house and you prefer to install a new solar system and get a cash price. With 2-3 quotes negotiate with seller and with Sunrun, the seller will have to put his hand in the pocket because Sunrun can ask how much they want for the system because is not listed on the lease agreement. \n\n $174.20/month /.195 ( $/kWh)x 12( months) =10,720 kWh/year, a 7-8 kW system will be able to generate that amount of power, you can purchase a similar system under $18K after the federal tax credit.",

"comment": "How much of that 100k is in the hardware vs the site development and city permitting? \n\nA 200kw DC/DC converter is essentially equivalent to an 200kw capable EV drive inverter(in terms of hardware components, and conservatively, cost) and the onsite battery storage would start around 50kwh per stall and go up from there. The Tesla drive unit (including the inverter) costs Tesla less than $2000 according to Munro, and the onboard charger must be less than that. With batteries at 100$/kWh, the total cost of major components is $5000(battery)+$2000(DC/DC converter)+$2000(Battery charger, max)=9000$. Triple this to pay for the grid tie switch, cabling, radiators, enclosures, etc still only brings you to 27k... 72k for site labor, engineering, and permitting seems reasonable for a one-off install on someone elses property, but if the install is repeated vebatium at 100 sites, it will cost a lot less than that. \n\nI had a supercharger built this past year about 3 blocks from my house, almost within line of sight of my upper story office window. I walked by there daily with my dog, twice a day... I only counted 10 days when they had installers on-site, and never more than 4 people working. $50/hour*8hrs*4 people*10 days = $16,000... Even if they had to do custom engineering for the site (they didn't, it was a flat lot right next to a transformer), I can't see them spending $50,000 on it.",

Automotive margins are thin and scaling is capital intensive and takes time. Software scales fast and is nearly all margin. When FSD actually works, it will be worth more than the car. They can monetize the in car entertainment and sell add space on the center screen for stops along your route. They want to be the platform that it all runs on. They use their Autobidder software for monetizing energy storage assets. They're creating virtual power plants. They're probably applying their AI knowledge to a dozen other things.\n\nIf Tesla is able to pull it off, they will disrupt so many industries worth so much money. They don't even have to do it on time, just before everyone else The stock has a lot of room to grow.",

"comment": "&gt;The solution for waste problem is already there - store it in underground tunnels until it stops being a problem\n\nYou should take a look how brilliant this has been working in Germany and France for example. Spoiler: it has not, it's not simple, and it's also quite expensive and destructive. Maybe not ChErNoByL destructive, but it's bad. The now dysfunctional German storage \"underground tunnel\" needs to be emptied, with robots. Because groundwater is getting contaminated and the waste is too deadly to be handled by humans. Such brilliant nice clean technology! \n\n&gt;Solar - Poland isn’t sunny enough to warrant large-scale solar power\n\nIf Germany and Scandinavia can, why shouldn't Poland be able to? No one is talking about 100% solar every day, it's a smart mixture with wind and storage. Easily done nowadays.\n\n&gt;Wind power - what about the birds?\n\nAre you the monkey now? ;)\n\nIf you want to see a smart, sensible and economic way forward to get rid of coal, research a bit more on solar and wind and also on vehicle 2 grid, liquid air energy storage and power 2 gas. That is more or less all the technology any country needs with varying proportions of wind and solar sources. Cheap and renewable. If it all sounds too \"green\" for you (I'm just going to assume your political spectrum...), think about the money that it will earn and save the country and the much bigger amount of jobs it will create, everywhere, not in the one or two \"lucky\" local councils.",

The start and end times for the solar production between them seem to agree, the shape seems to agree (not clipped or offset), but the peak seems lower. I wonder if there's a scaling problem for one of them (like if the current sensor is configured for the wrong current/voltage or one of the phases is missing/reversed). Or if one of them is monitoring in the wrong place (like if some of the solar power is going through the smart meter, but some of it is being bypassed..) Weird. Do you have pictures of the CTs?",

I want the backup feature as well.\n\nIf you have decided to put in a solar system, the battery (after tax credit) costs less than a generator.  I am basing this all on a Tesla Powerwall with controls adds an additional $7.5K after credits and discounts.  This compares to $10K to $12K for a Generac generator.\n\nI looked at it this way.  The solar will pay for itself in 7 to 10 years. They just raised the transportation cost for power by 35%, and natural gas prices have doubled over the last year.\n\nDuring the last freeze, many natural gas wells froze.  There were shortages of gas in some areas (not verified).  Since then, many natural gas generators have been installed.  I worry that there may not be enough natural gas if we get another crazy cold snap.\n\nI am paying over $20K for my system vs. a generator at $10K, but I get a payback on the panels, a cheaper backup solution, and protection from not only the electrical grid, but also the natural gas distribution network.\n\nAs a final note, I only have 1 Powerwall, but I do think I can manage my usage during a grid down situation.\n\nEdit: Distribution charges increased by 35% (1.2482 cents per KW), not 16%",

I've HEARD that their customer service is horrible, so there's that.\n\nSunPower is different than most other solar manufacturers I've seen and worked with. They degrade a lot slower than other commercials available panels, maintaining a 92% efficiency in year 25. Conventional cells range between 60-80% efficiency in that same time frame. SunPower cells are also more durable [As you can see here](https://youtu.be/tesklwVpp-w), which explains why they last so much longer. There are other advantages, but it's pretty cut and dry if you actually do you research.\n\nAdmittedly, this performance does come at a price. So if your chief concern is immediate savings, then SunPower may not be the way to go at all.\n\nAs far as aesthetics, I would say try to get ahold of as many *real* installation photos as possible. A lot of people fall in love with marketing photos and their actual end result is hideous. So be careful.",

The studies that do exist refute them.\n\n……\n\nThe solution to the non-threat to coral reefs and other non-issues, the authors say, is transitioning to “green” energy sources.\n\n“For example, renewable energy is now generally less expensive than fossil fuels, so a shift to clean energy can often save money,” The authors state.\n\nThis claim is demonstrably false as well, relying on a poorly organized report on Levelized Costs of Energy (LCOE) produced by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\n…..\n\nResearch consistently shows as states and countries add wind and solar power to their electrical power grid, the costs of electric power rise sharply.\n\nSimultaneously, and not coincidentally, the reliability of the power supply declines.\n\nFor individuals who make a living studying climate change, the authors of this article in The Conversation apparently know very little about the facts on the ground.\n\nThey make a multitude of false claims, with those concerning the demise of coral reefs and electricity production is arguably the most egregiously ignorant and misleading.\n\nThe aim of IPCC researchers should be to accurately inform the public concerning the true state of the climate. For this article, that would require the presentation of more facts and less hyperbolic claims.",

The panels are the gimmick that justifies the higher price.\n\nThere is just no way a startup like Sonos can build a mass market small cheap EV at a competitive price against huge vertically integrated established automakers. \n\nThe BYD Dolphin is essentially the exact same size as the Sonos. Even established carmakers can't build a B-segment hatch to compete with the Dolphin on price,  so how is Sonos ever gonna be able to?",

Companies that mark up prices like to sell it.\n\nFor solar panels 3.50/watt is a good price. A little lower if you have comp single and a little higher of you have a foam roof. \n\nA panel up grade should be $3500. Smart panels will run a bit more. But that is more for the car chargers or whole home back up.",

Not written (yet) to include vehicle to house. \n\nI think the new CA net metering tariffs will strongly push for storage to be installed. Again, not yet including vehicle batteries. \n\nIslanding setups currently require non-vehicle batteries and a shut-off switch. Those allow you to use your solar power if the grid goes down. \n\nI’m in MD and just added the batteries and backup interface to my existing solar system. Our grid has been pretty reliable since the derecho several years ago. Maybe it’s overkill for me. If was in TX or CA I would have islanding for sure. \n\nMy SolarEdge backup interface has a generator input. It needs a “firmware update” to work. That may be vaporware. If not, that might be the way to connect a vehicle battery in the future.",

Not just a roof top system.\n\nThough being able to directly DC charge from solar panels could be useful for van campers. For example the new eSprinter with 250mi range is attractive, and pretty easy to put 5kw of fold out panels on the top and drivers side as an awning. Still would need to park for a few days to get a charge, as long as you are not running the heat/AC or using power for cooking and starlink.",

What I was saying is that kW per hour doesn’t exist because kW is already power. But using kWh/h as an equivalent to L/h, or to represent how much of the battery storage you’ll be using is okay, as many people might not be familiar as all with the concept of kW",

Get yourself grandfathered in before your state reduces their payout for surplus. Get the battery later, right after they pass regulation but before battery prices rise (from demand).\n\nI like the Franklin WH because it's way more of a \"whole house\" battery than others dues to it's automatic load shedding, and easier black start. \n\n\"Yes, FranklinWH's Franklin Home Power (FHP) solution includes auto load shedding to maximize backup time during outages. The aGate X Smart Circuits Module can automatically shed heavy energy loads during an outage, and it also allows for custom scheduling of unique loads. The FHP also has enhanced black start capabilities, including auto load shedding, to improve success during black starts.\"\n\n\"The FHP is a home energy management system that supports three modes to manage energy supply and battery storage: backup mode, self-consumption mode, and time-of-use mode. Homeowners can set different periods to charge and discharge the battery according to mode and need, which can increase energy efficiency and make the most use of solar energy.\"\n\nHow many are you getting? What prices are you seeing? Powerwall3 13.6kw  is $8400 before installation, Franklin 13.6 is $12,500.",

And yeah I get that I will almost never use 200a, I was using that to compare the capacity of my grid service vs my solar service.\n\nNow, is this difference in flow accounted for in net metering? The reason I ask is because I am charged $0.15/kWh to take from the grid, but am only compensated $0.02/kWh to give back to the grid. So would I have to provide x7-x8 times of the electricity back to the grid to break even, or “equal back”?",

"comment": "hiyo, I was just randoming through reddit using the new button...well, anyways I felt the need to express the position as to why I feel some Vegans are ostracized...I find your comparison of vegans/nonvegans and atheist/chrisitians very insightful and useful in understanding why people react so negative to vegans.  \n\nMy best friends gf is a vegan and she shares what I would consider if not a typical then common traits with other Vegans.(I know generalizations are not reality but rather perceptions...for sake of discussion I will use some generalizations however) The most off-putting of these is a  sense of moral-superiority over meat eaters. Vegans don't hurt animals, carnivores hurt animals. Vegans care for the well being of livestock and pets alike, non-vegans don't care how their bucket of KFC came to be and find pet ownership as something fun and not as a deep commitment and responsibility to another being. Vegans feel one with nature and the majesty of being with other beings, meat eaters are consumers that greedily hunt and devour other beings and resources. Vegans are about sustainability and peaceful coexistence, meat eaters are brutes that don't want to listen to reason. Vegans are goodnick, meat-eaters are badnicks...atleast this is the sense that I get from her. She cannot 'stand' seeing people be ignorant as to animals pain and suffering...which though noble, in my eyes is also blatanly ignorant of how nature in reality works. We are all consumers by nature...nature is not beautiful all the time, there are times of unforgiving violence and savagery in the animal kingdom the likes no human would ever dream of. Think of the massive scales of the genocides ants and termites fight on a daily basis throughout our globe. soldiers devouring their enemies young, decapitating all their 'prisoners' etc. No one holds a moral high-ground in any of these issues really...but like Christians , Vegans equate their beliefs as the one true enlightened way to be one with nature and live in harmony...meat-eaters are lowly brutes--heathens that need conversion to be drawn away from the sins of the flesh.",

"comment": "&gt; Not all animals, though the Animal Rights people never come out and say that.\n\nSrsly?  Most ethical vegans extend their veganism all the way to not wearing pearls, what animals is she thinking of?\n\n&gt; The animals that matter are the ones that are like humans in very specific ways.\n\nAs one of the few vegans willing to do weigh the 'wrongness' of killing X vs. torturing and killing X vs. killing Y, etc - I can agree with that.  Specifically I care most about animals that I believe to be sentient.  Even ugly slimy ones.\n\n&gt; Does it care for its young? Does it have facial features that are recognizable? Does it vocalize when it’s in pain? [These questions]say nothing about, for instance, an animal’s ability to feel pain, or fear, or dread. \n\nUh, huh.  Vocalizing while in pain gives us no clue as to whether the animal is actually in pain. \n\nShe adds the caveat \"AR people would never come out and say it...\" preventing you from responding \"actually, I *do* care about all animals, even the ugly ones.\", except that actions speak louder than words.  We don't eat ugly or dumb looking animals either.  We campaign for octopi too.  \n\n&gt; It is a reflection of human needs and desires, not the needs and desires of animals themselves. The animals, for instance, want to hunt. They want to eat the food evolution has designed them for. Like the vegan who suggested putting a fence down the length of the Serengeti, the ARs end up having a problem with the animal nature of animals because they’re arguing from a philosophical base of humanism.\n\nNo, Lierre - we are trying to stop *humans* from hunting, not wolves.  \"Like the vegan who wanted to fence the Serengeti\" my ass!  You are talking about *that* vegan.  Veganism is about humans making choices about what they eat - *not* about how we feed wild animals. \n\n&gt; It will fail because the diet the ARs aspire to is an environmental nightmare and the planet is out of topsoil. \n\nSo yes, farming spinach will completely deplete your topsoil, but that is because you are getting 28 times as much protein out of the soil than cows are (and sucking up all the rich nitrogen.)  Cows are peeing and shitting out most of that nitrogen.  Solution?  Use much less land and let the rest recover for a few years.  \n\nShe goes on to babble about grains, which I think is completely tangential.\n\n&gt; But it will also fail because humanism contains no philosophical or moral constraints on human activity, no check on human hubris or our destructive capacity.\n\nUh, wha? \n\nFirst of all, I think what we are advocating **is** a check on human hubris (\"we are better than animals!\") and destructive capacity (\"and we will do whatever we want to them!\") What's more, though she has a point about grain monoculture, veganism is incredibly low impact on the environment.  Though grain mono-culture is a mess you could avoid grains as a vegan as well so that is not an argument against veganism. \n\n&gt; Animals kill.\n\nYes, they do.  We are talking about whether or not we as humans have to.\n\n&gt; I used ideology like a sledgehammer and I thought I could bend the world to my demands. I couldn’t. The needs of soil, the truth of the carbon cycle, and the nutritional requirements of the basic human template were a reality of brute, physical facts that would not be moved. I had built my entire identity on death being an ethical taboo, a moral horror, one that provoked a visceral shudder through body and soul. \n\n\nYup, Lierre, it does sound like you were a bit nuts.\n\n&gt; But “death-free” is not an option that the processes of life offer us.\n\nNo one said it was.\n\n&gt; Eventually we see our only choices: the death that’s destroying life or the death that’s a part of life.\n\nDeep, Lierre, deep.",

"comment": "Neither of those things is currently remotely feasible for the vast majority of applications.  Hopefully they will be in the future, and people are indeed working on them.  I feel like these sorts of discussions always suffer from the fact that most of the people partaking of them don't understand how the alternatives work, how far along we are with them, and also don't understand how eager researchers already are to utilize the alternatives we do have when they can.  For example, I work in yeast, and the price tag and the timeline is so incredibly favorable compared to mouse work that if everyone could switch and still address the problems they study, almost all of them would.  There are simply questions that cannot even be *asked* in certain models, let alone answered.\n\nIt's worth noting, also, that cell culture and lab-grown organs are not the sweetness and light vegans and animal rights activists tend to claim they are in these kinds of conversations.  On the whole, it's not hard to go through more animal products doing biochemistry and cell culture than animals in a mouse study, because of the sheer complexity of replicating mostly unknown systems outside of an animal.  Fetal bovine serum, cow and pig trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, and inhibitors thereof, bovine serum albumin, rat tail collagen, cow digestive enzyme hydrolyzed yeast extracts, etc., are all staples of cell culture and *in vitro* biochemistry.  So some of the existing alternatives and some of the alternatives frequently proposed really just push the usage of animals one step further down the supply chain.\n\nAnimals aren't perfect models, but they are far and away better than every alternative we currently have when it comes to studying certain problems and testing certain answers.  Animal models have suffered some false positives and negatives--as every model must, pretty much by definition of being a model--but have also proved invaluable not only in the pursuit of effective drugs but in testing them for safety.  A lot of researchers are trying to come up with workable alternatives for  both ethically-minded and other reasons (animal testing is expensive, which is also why so many researchers use things like cell culture and microbial systems whenever they can--cheaper and faster, *if* they work for your application), but right now, there are simply situations in which an animal model is not just the best tool for the job, but the only tool.",

I think that going vegan doesn't just happen from a singular event, it is more of a journey (as wanky as that sounds). They tend to measure and focus their work on things that are easy to measure, like handing out leaflets. But I imagine a leaflet on its own is not what makes someone change their lifestyle.",

Before I went  vegan I told people \"I dont eat much animal products\" there was never any confusion.  I have a friend  who says  \"I eat vegan at home but I'm not really because I eat meat when I'm out at restaurants and parties.\" People get it and he doesn't claim to be vegan. He \"eats\" vegan part of the time and there's a huge difference. People seem to think they will confuse people if they tell them anything other then \"vegetarian\" or \"vegan\" but I think it creates the opposite effect. A ton of omnivores who think vegetarians eat chicken and fish and that vegans Will eat animal products if they're given to them for free. \n\nIt's a touchy subject. I want them to know I do think it's better they're doing something rather then  nothing. (Because they are) and I don't really correct them, it's not like they mean any harm. Labels are important and make people feel comfortable or part of a group, even if their behavior doesn't match that. I've probably done that in other areas of my life as well. So it's hypocritical of me to tell them otherwise. I wish people were more clear about things but it's a societal problem, there's a huge misunderstanding around all of the different terms from pescetarian to vegan and sometimes I get annoyed that the label seems more impotant than what we actually do.",

I meant going for it with that person you admire, but I'll take it.\n\n&gt;I mean, I've tried, it's an on going process. \n\nGot any questions? Great place to ask. I'm heading to bed very soon, but if you would like some help overcoming some obstacles, ask away and I'm sure someone will pick up my slack. Or you could make a different post just about that.\n\n&gt;I just think it's super cool what you guys stand for and all that. \n\nCool\n\n&gt;I just don't think it's for me, at least not now.\n\nHow about incremental steps? Like starting off by cutting way back on factory farmed meat?\n\n&gt;I understand that when I prepare my food, the meat that I use just isn't coming from a silicone wrapped package. It came from a living, breathing, conscious being. \n\nRight. \n\n&gt;I make it a point to never waste a scrap of meat, use everything. The animal may not have \"given\" it's life. But I put the responsibility on myself that the life that I took, and what it has \"given\" me will be treated with respect and every bit of it will be used.\n\nOkay, I get that. I mean, I don't think that sets any wrongs right, but I understand what you mean.\n\n\n&gt;I'm not trying to paint myself as someone I'm not, I enjoy meat. I know where it comes from. I know how animals are treated in mass-produced factories and even small-scale farms. It's awful, and I do not support those places with my money when I do buy grocery meat. \n\nThat's great. Better than most. When do you buy meat? Or where do you get it?\n\n&gt;I think I skirted through your question. But I hope it kinda gave you where I stand. I am not trying to be inflammatory, so I will apologize if I sound ignorant or dickish, not my intention at all.\n\nI don't think you sound that way. I've noticed you were downvoted at the time of this reply. Just try to ignore that -- thanks for coming to talk with us.\n\nHere's a cool cartoon I wanna pass your way. It's not too long, and it's a pretty good introduction to the philosophical issues related to killing animals for our food. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3HAMk_ZYO7g",

But I would say \n\n&gt; but prominent vegan voices like Vegan Gains, Durianrider, and Freelee, among others have fervently defended their belief \n\nI don't consider any of these folks to be particularly worthwhile to listen to. I know they have influential voices and large audiences(and they've all put out solid content in the past) but they're also very much 'lifestyle Youtubers' who are competing for attention in a saturated market where they are directly incentivized to make bold, eye-catching claims about anything they think will drive consistent traffic to their pages. Which is another way of saying, liberal grains of salt with attaching too much value into much of what they say from an *intensity* or *passionate* or *fervent* standpoint. It's the name of the game to be *fervent*, regardless of the content. \n\nBecause here's the thing: there's really only so many videos one can even make about promoting veganism directly. Once the basic premise has been explained, there's really only so much additional explaining that even *can* occur. But when your livelihood requires you to constantly be making videos (and specifically to be doing so in a contested and highly competitive space) that inevitably leads to pushing further and further into whatever areas are likely to illicit strong responses, period. I mean, Vegan Gains straight up had a video a while back laughing at someone for dying of cancer. Meanwhile, last I saw, Freelee has basically retired from making vegan-centric videos because that content well started to dry up for her. That's the level to which their lifestyle flattens them and pushes them to extremes. In the process, generally moving away from the core/practical underpinnings.",

Started thinking about why it was that I found vegetarians annoying and realised that I just felt threatened.\n\nSpent about a year being basically pro-vegan but still eating meat before I realised that if you're pro-vegan you're one of two things: a vegan or a hypocrite.",

Can be just as nutritious as using fresh ingredients but takes way less time to prepare. Tofu is another great source of protein and can be eaten from the package if you have no time lol (r/shittyveganfoodporn) but it's super easer to just throw on some spices and bake for 30 min. Some starches that are very quick to prepare include microwaved potato/sweet potato, white rice, pasta, couscous, ramen, oats.\n\nAs an example, when I want to prepare food quickly, but still want to eat healthy, I will eat whole grain pasta with canned beans and frozen veggies with some spices and hot sauce. And some fruit for dessert. Takes 10 minutes and I have plenty of leftovers for the following days. \n\nFor me, cooking meals is so much simpler, quicker and healthier than before I went vegan.",

Small wins but it's something, doesn't change my hatred of them but whatever helps is good.",

The only thing that the label ‘atheist’ tells you about a person is that they are not convinced there is a god (or a similar variation of that expression). It doesn’t, for example mean they think that the ‘universe came from nothing’.\n\nSimilarly, being vegan just means avoiding animal exploitation where practical; it tells you nothing else about that person’s beliefs.\n\n(I know that *you* most likely know these points; I’m commenting for the benefit of those who may not).",

To be clear, I don't think over-agression is a big problem in the vegan community. Unfortunately, standing firm on an issue of justice is often misconstrued as unreasonable aggression. There is a lot of tone-policing of the vegan community to the point where the pendulum too often swings the other way, causing most vegans to be apologetic and soft-spoken when it comes to this topic (and we see the \"not like other vegans\" type stuff).",

Listen we do t really have the moral high ground because although we're plant based. Lots of the people involved in farming and agriculture are compensated poorly. \n\nI had a person tell me. I don't care if illegals get paid pennies to pick my potatoes.  I care about animals.\n\nKind of how some religious people use their religion to mistreat people.\n\nBeing Vegan is not an excuse to be a jerk.\n\nApologies for formatting Im on a mobile.",

It doesn't matter that individual sheep need to be shorn--currently living sheep should be shorn for their comfort and you won't find vegans who would complain about a sheep on an animal sanctuary being shorn. But we should not continue to breed more sheep. This is the same argument for chicken eggs. Well, they lay eggs anyway! But we don't need to continue creating more chickens to lay those eggs. We can just stop breeding animals to exploit them for profit. Buying things made with animal products supports the continuous breeding of those animals.",

"comment": "Hey everybody! That astroturf post on reddit in the vegan sub triggered someone with half a brain to reply, let's all jump on there and downvote immediately. Lol. I think, \"Killing it\" is perfectly appropriate for them, since their primary business is as a retail outlet for the animal terror, torture, death and dismemberment industry and nothing they do is fucking vegan. Dairy alternatives. Sure but not a damn thing this vile fucking corporation does is vegan and this fake fucking post is evidence to what lousy fucking scumbags they are. Boycott industrial prepared retail foods, shop locally, purchase raw agricultural produce, cook from scratch, order bulk, reduce waste, share with friends and put these fuck-os out of business. Have a nice day!",

"comment": "He is right that ethically speaking, eating locally grown food is the best option for a wide variety of reasons. For example, Quinoa farming/harvesting has put it out of the price range of their local communities and agave harvesting is causing a couple endangered bat species populations to further decline. Moreover, the sheer carbon emissions from shipping food all over the world is insane. You can still be vegan but your diet would be more limited. Moreover, when it comes to environmentalism, decreasing meat consumption is the way to go, but getting rid of it completely is not necessary. However, if you are against the killing of animals and animal farming in general for other ethical reasons, then of course you would cut it out entirely.",

When I tell someone I turned vegan they always ask why that was necessary when I was already a vegetarian and didn't kill animals that way. Just like them I didn't know what was going on. Also people acting like vegetarians aren't true to their beliefs. Veganism is about ending animal exploitation while vegetarianism is about not killing animals but still using them.

Usually bee farming is quite humane, lots of flowers/sugar water, free from threats, safe housing, etc? I don't get it, where is the harm done? Bee farming seems to exclusively benefit both parties in the trade, even at commercial scales. Is it the theft part? This is valid but I see as kind of strange seeing as how the bees steal the nectar (and by extension, all animals will have to steal to survive..?)

"comment": "Alright, guess I've got to start somewhere...\n\nFirst of all, Dr. Greger. Saying that he is not a \"\"vegan\" per se.\" makes little sense, because no matter how qualified or respected he is, he can still have his own biases that can affect his work. I looked up some criticisms of his work, and it seems he might have a tendency of cherry-picking his sources (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-not-to-die-review#section1). Another thing I found slightly concerning, when I looked at the page on his site for fish, it made it out as if eating fish has no actual health benefits, which some research seems to contradict(https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/omega-3/art-20045614). And the point of the video you pointed out, while somewhat shocking and entertaining, didn't actually tell me anything, what negative effect does this \"endotoxemia\" have? The set of reports didn't provide any answers either, other than \"it can lead to diabetes\". He definitely seems very knowledgeable, and I'm sure he's right about most things, but that doesn't mean that he has no flaws.\n\nAnd I doubt that every study that shows some benefit of any animal product is funded by the meat industry. Just out of curiosity, one journal I found recommended a \"Mediterranean diet\", I'm curious if that was also funded by the meat industry, but I don't know where to look: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4153275/\n\nAlso, importantly, the fact that studies showing health benefits of meat might be wrong, that doesn't mean that a completely vegan diet is necessarily right.\n\nAnd in the end, even if veganism has some benefits, it simply isn't clear exactly how big they are, and I don't think they are significant enough for me to consider becoming vegan.\n\n\nSecondly, I do know that animal consumption has a massive negative effect on the environment. And factory farming is indeed a problem, and the amount of meat we are consuming is not sustainable. But I disagree that everybody going vegan is the only way we can combat this. I believe that if everybody reduced their meat consumption and made better choices when choosing meat, choosing organic etc., that could be enough. Maybe we'd only have meat once a week or once a month. But cutting it out completely doesn't seem necessary. And a few people going vegan doesn't seem to make enough of a difference either.\n\nAnd when the claim is \"maybe if 100 people ate meat, it wouldn't have a negative effect on the environment\", then \"our ancestors ate meat\" IS a valid argument, and not a fallacy, because millions of people have been eating meat without it having a significantly negative effect on the environment.\n\nWhile there are some environmental reasons as to why you should become vegan, it is not enough in itself to convince me to become vegan.\n\n\nAnd lastly, the ethical reasons are still as subjective as ever. Sure, you could argue that rape or child beating isn't abuse, and some people do, especially the latter, but as a society we have generally decided that doing these things are not ethical. The reasons for this are probably many, but I'd assume it mainly has to do with the idea that we shouldn't cause unnecessary damage to other humans. And this philosophy has carried over to how we treat animals, but not completely. And when it comes to eating animals, it deals with one of the most important aspects of our lives: eating. It is one of the most fundamental things for humans, and changing a fundamental part of how we eat is solely because of a relatively uncommon idea, that animals deserve to be treated better, is going to be difficult. Because animals are not equal to humans. If you had to chose between killing a man and a dog, almost everyone would chose the dog, and it will probably always be like this. And a lot of people are going to be OK with painlessly killing an animal bred for eating that hasn't suffered, and that's fine.\n\nIt's all subjective in the end. \n\nAnd to a lot of people the environmental or health considerations are not enough to convince them to become vegan. So it always ends up being about your own personal subjective choice. And I don't believe that choice means whether you're a bad person or not. But that's just my two cents...",
