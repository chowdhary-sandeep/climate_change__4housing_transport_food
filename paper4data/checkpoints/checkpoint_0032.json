Such a deal!\n\nYou're right, it's not well suited to journeys of over 8 hours. Consider yourself a winner.\n\n&gt;And yes, Tesla will be able to buy better batteries, but so will real car companies. You know, the kind that don't blame the customer when the car craps out on a winter day? Could it be that Mercedes and BMW are willing to stick a toe in the water, but are waiting until the battery technology is somewhat better before selling a Model E or Model S or 3, 5, or 7 series that doesn't meet their traditional performance standards? You mean the Germans aren't wild 'n crazy fad-driven Californians? Who knew?!\n\nThe difference between Tesla's multiple small standard form factor cells placed in their own pack and other EV's bespoke battery module designs is they need very little lead time to switch over to what ever new battery development arrives, and the volume pricing will be supported by laptop manufacturers as well.\n\nI'd pay attention to what mazda do in the next few years, as they have not yet made a significant mass market push into the EV / Extended range EV market.\n\nThey do have [this](http://www.mazda.com/mazdaspirit/env/ev/) which is very similar to the Tesla Model S in battery module design thinking.\n\nAnd there is also a [hydrogen/gasoline electric hybrid](http://www.mazda.com/mazdaspirit/env/hre/) which looks interesting, but I think advances need to be made in safe hydrogen storage before many people would want something like it.\n\n&gt;Tesla and its Model S is the in-line roller skates of the automotive world. No staying power unless they come up with something genuinely new or different, which they have yet to do.\n\nTesla has much higher risk of failure than a larger car company, but a lack of willingness to take risks will potentially leave the large car companies struggling to catchup in EV design and production.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.008424057004352411,"1.1.1_stance":-0.104074626596298,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22406302372028095,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.10706300536791484,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32573198567060346,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24256697008423753,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11610322969499975,"ev_1":-0.11479528271104823,"ev_2":-0.12402507645795897,"ev_3":-0.15325885370839387,"ev_4":-0.04006263106930182,"ev_5":-0.07385281538396764,"ev_6":-0.1529496166165734},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It's stating the obvious that they feel they are making the best decision for their company. Of course they are.  That's what businesses always do, whether the decisions are wise or not.  \n\nYou are also right when you say that just because I think they are making poor decisions doesn't mean that there is a conspiracy or that they are out to fail on purpose.  They may just be incompetent.  The people who ran Apple into the ground when they fired Steve Jobs weren't trying to fail, they just made poor decisions.  Perhaps it is incompetence.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it's not incompetence.  There are reasons why a legacy automotive manufacturer might not want EV technology to succeed.  As an example, The maintenance costs of BEV technology appears to be significantly less so far than it is for ICE cars.  If EV technology really caught on, it would have a huge impact on their dealer networks which make the bulk of their money from service.  Another thought is that the leaders of the automotive industry and the leaders of oil and gas industries surely know each other.  Is there a possibility that some personal pressures and reassurances are made behind the scenes around either of these scenarios?  Sure it's possible.  \n\nHate is such a harsh word.

Here are some silver linings to a reduction in the ITC for your care, comfort, and consideration:\n\n1) True solar distruption is stimied by the 30% ITC. The 30% ITC pushes more tax dollars into utility-scale + corporate owned solar arrays. Utility-scale solar is a majority of installed solar capacity in the USA. It was less than 10% of the USA market pre-tax credit. Residential solar financing has languished, when it could otherwise be creating a sustainable, unsubsidized solar market. Solar power is something that could power 100% of the USA, but we'll only get their through demand from the consumer market. A less subsidized solar market is one that is even harder for the utilitieis to stop. \n\n2) The 30% ITC argues against cap-and-trade. Our current policy of penalty-free, unlimited, \"safe emissions\" dumping creates an uneven playing field between for emissionless vs. emissions-heavy technologies; excessive subsidies counter-balance the playing field. Whereas a 10% ITC is on par with what other large energy projects get (such as multi-billion dollar oil refinery expansion projects). Leveling out the ITC will re-emphasize the uneven playing field that exists due to lack of carbon regulation.\n\n3) The ITC != the Residential Energy and Efficiency Tax Credit. While it is unlikely, the ITC could be reduced while the REETC remains at 30%. This would be a very smart policy which the tax payer could support. Residential projects are more valuable to the tax payer, because they increase property value, create more jobs, and invite more local investment than commercial projects. Essentially, we get more collective bang for our buck.\n\nResidential systems are removed from the above-market value tax manipulation schemes that are risked with large-scale solar and solar leasing. Depreciation is not claimed. The tax credits cannot be off-loaded via inverted lease structures. SolarCity claims the ITC; a residential solar lease is still owned by a corporate structure. Plus, residential systems are less likely to participate in cap-and-trade infrastructure. So keeping the REETC &gt; ITC could be viewed as balancing the residential vs. corporate ownership structures.\n\n4) Selfishly, solar experts who specialize in reducing project costs will do better financially in a less competitive market. Sure, the solar market will contract when the ITC steps down. But poor business models + amateurs will be shaken out. Business practices will get closer to mainstream design/construction.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006706043107745548,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13598907568939467,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24691770025144485,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2616530693041532,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27939733820473334,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21299447780313696,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3026956780425583,"ev_1":-0.11554745005847167,"ev_2":-0.15371625939573838,"ev_3":-0.08180456806561172,"ev_4":-0.12159684256645657,"ev_5":-0.021877208683387533,"ev_6":-0.19194049796469545},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

This certification isn't as necessary in the utility scale arena as much, but commercial and residential it is important.\n\n* What would you like to do in Solar?  Design, procure, installation or support?  Knowing what you enjoy and like to do will help focus your search.  \n* Is there a particular state you'd like to live in?  I'd recommend looking at the the states with the most activity: http://i.imgur.com/GC2bxj4.png (source: www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/64720.pdf).  \n* If the state isn't as important to you, perhaps look at the top 500 Contractors here: http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2015-top-500-north-american-solar-contractors/ and use this as a list to investigate job postings directly on the company's site.\n* The engineering degree will likely get you further than the NABCEP, but the combination of the two and your experience should get you visibility for jobs.  \n* The salary question is really harder to nail down, because that'll be dependent on what position you're going after.  A residential installer position would likely be less than design job.  I'd likely cross-reference a site like www.glassdoor.com to determine the pay range.  If the company you're searching doesn't show up, try a similar job title in that area/region w/o specifying the company.\n* Are you on LinkedIn?  Many HR people will scour that site to find potential candidates.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007171321728189165,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07655762979811698,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2837579182038705,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3006430957466364,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19227138935502808,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27794520263943373,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1784822589252144,"ev_1":-0.016008359370365117,"ev_2":-0.02567979091448554,"ev_3":-0.002159694799047429,"ev_4":-0.004129324626167848,"ev_5":-0.003452081116847694,"ev_6":-0.007435977206718292},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

I found the same thing with Toyota and the Prius Prime which at that point hadn't arrived in Canada yet.  \n\nDealers knew what was on the lot and were focused on selling those models and just didn't know or were they interested in what models their dealership would offer a few months later. Not only to move what is on the lot but because there is a chance that someone who change their mind and buy something else.   \n\nThat said, while digging around I eventually found a Hyundai dealership that realized there was growing interest in the Ioniq Electric and put together a newsletter. Any time there was an update on different trims and pricing from Hyundai Canada, they would send out the info in another newsletter. They also shared info of the dealership getting and installing a charging station.  \n\nIt was a fairly large dealership and it was basically one dealer who was aware of the Ioniq Electric and had set up the newsletter, realizing the opportunity. If you wanted to talk about the Ioniq Electric, you needed to wait until he was free as number of others didn't even realize the car existed.  \n\nSo if you are interested, take a look at a number of Hyundai dealerships online. See if any of them mention anything about their upcoming EV line-up or even existing EVs.

At the very least, charging at home or a destination is incredibly cheap.  I would pay about $0.09 a kWh when charging at home if I didn't have solar, so a full charge would be around $7 - and even that isn't really what's happening because my car isn't ever needing a full 0-100% charge anyway.  My utility also has a $30/mo unlimited charging plan for EVs, so there is another free charge right there due to the fact that the $30/mo is a sunk cost not related to the trip.\n\nBut in fairness, let's do exactly what you said and add in $50 worth of home charging, which I think is bullshit and even you charge your PHEV at home for nearly nothing, but here we go:  \n\\-Cost to charge for duration of trip: $150 (edited for your never-gonna-happen-scenario of me paying $50 for non-DC charging, but whatever)  \n\\-Cost if I had my last car that would do 30mpg: $300  \n\\-Cost is my car got 40mpg (highway isn’t where hybrids get their best mileage): $200\n\nI think you're fooling yourself a bit about charging an EV, and what a \"normal\" trip is.  If I visit any friend or family, the charge is indeed free for me.  Home charging is also free.  This would likely be the same for you if you had an EV.  I also select hotels with included destination charging if I go that route.  It's actually very \"normal\" and awesome.\n\nI think this is my last reply.  We're on an electric car sub and I'm the only one in this conversation with a BEV and I think we've gone far enough.  Your car gets fantastic mileage and you can happily drive it into the ground and then decide what you want next.

They make some crazy effective pad material these days.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005971232167212293,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13070832370406152,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.39262517789999646,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09608720863858859,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29971772256222223,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2169089178285955,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.030998502857983112,"ev_1":-0.0014298674383705172,"ev_2":-0.0003182082436978817,"ev_3":-0.0005676019403229778,"ev_4":-0.0003659141608901943,"ev_5":-0.00029117276426404715,"ev_6":-0.03614016220186992},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (referencing Flipsky and some people in the context, but no possessive indicators)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

A single DC charger with cars charging for an hour each (per your earlier reference) would still get to the first car in line within an hour. Four DC chargers with cars taking an hour each would have a car leaving an average of every 15 minutes, and eight DC chargers would have a car leaving every 7.5 minutes. And that's for people taking their time charging, which they would be pressured not to do if there was a three-hour line of cars waiting. \n\n>\"I was walking around for 4 hours and still only got like 10 %. \"\n\nAgain, not credible unless we're talking about very slow AC chargers. Even a modest 50 kW DC charger would give most EVs close to a full charge in an hour or less, and faster 150+ kW chargers would have some people on their way in as little as 15-20 minutes. Divided by the number of chargers to get the average wait time for the first car in line. \n\nWhat stories like this show (the verifiable ones) is that EV sales are outpacing infrastructure development in some areas, and this can particularly be a problem for busy holidays.

I think you'll find you're on the same page with virtually all vegans &amp; the environmentally conscious alike in that respect. We understand our planet is going through irreversible &amp; undesirable climate change due to carbon emissions from human activity (animal agriculture, transportation, food waste, industry). However, you seem so pessimistic about our options.\n\nI think we agree 100% that burning fossil fuels &amp; coal for energy &amp; transportation is not sustainable or feasible for our species &amp; entire ecosystem. You're suggesting we revert back to pre-industrial revolution methods which, although valid for eliminating large amounts of greenhouse gases, is just not viable due to the economic fallout you described &amp; the fact that humans will continue to rely on our modern conveniences regardless of their catastrophic consequences.\n\nLucky for us, fossil fuels is not our only option! Our sun gives off more energy in an hour than the human race uses in a year! And the best part, we can safely predict that it's going to keep supplying us with massive amounts of free energy for billions of years! We also have other natural renewables like wind &amp; water that create energy. This is great!\n\nWhat's even better is that we're starting to get really good at capturing this free energy &amp; using it in an emission free way (Solar panel -&gt; battery -&gt; Electric vehicles). This is what Mr. Musk is attempting to accomplish with his companies. He helped start Solar City (making efficient &amp; affordable solar panels) as a way of obtaining the Sun's energy. He founded Tesla so he could make batteries to hold all the captured energy &amp; to produce emission-free vehicles that use this captured energy.\n\nYou see, I don't think we have to cheat Mother Nature. I think we're cheating ourselves by not working with Mother Nature. For years we've been going about obtaining energy in the most cumbersome, inefficient &amp; asinine ways possible &amp; our booming global population is exacerbating these the consequences of these practices. But it's not too late. We can take steps to help transition from our archaic &amp; harmful ways into a controlled &amp; sustainable future. Top industrialists (like Musk) understand the only way to make real change is to use the power of the free market, which is why I believe a carbon tax should be instilled ASAP.\n\nI see you're passionate about our global crisis, so I enthusiastically invite you to be more optimistic about these technologies even if you think guys like Elon Musk egotistical liberals.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1451774849556363,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1790907700372905,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2504969057813335,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.15834032466438414,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20908664316600228,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24030941337906897,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2400889577425603,"solar_1":-0.11002457644389807,"solar_2":-0.16821434203611244,"solar_3":-0.06623857280782078,"solar_4":-0.09043601516943307,"solar_5":-0.15347646709876656,"solar_6":-0.12887118987661475,"solar_7":-0.10949167422950268,"solar_8":-0.037820381758366564,"solar_9":-0.040284875283095545,"solar_10":-0.1243286584479506},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

I've done 48 off grid systems myself, all by myself, designed, Permitting, installation, etc.\n\nSo here's the deal, it all depends on what you are trying to accomplish. If you want to have solar as a toy, do some good for the environment by producing some solar power/be a good citizen, and save money, then you don't need batteries--you're fine with microinverters. \n\nIf on the other hand you want to be extremely environmentally friendly, and totally independent of the grid and be on your own \"island\" so to speak where you are producing all your own power, then batteries are a must and nearly the only way to go. In off grid systems, batteries and a more expensive inverter and a charge controller all add cost- about $5,000 but easily can increase to $15,000 depending on your energy needs. \n\nIn other words, in an on grid system there are 2 parts to the system - the solar panels and the microinverters (or old school socks inverter) . In off grid systems there are 4 parts to the system - solar panels, charge controller(s), batteries, and a inverter. So you have more components when you do batteries and even the comparable components between the two, the off grid inverter is more expensive than the on grid inverter (or micro inverter generally speaking. So a battery based system is significantly more expensive with added parts and added labor while not being necessary if you just want solar in some usable form. \n\nIt's nice to have an off grid system for power outages but most US citizens only experience 1-3 power year that are fixed within a few hours. \n\nLast thing is, it's WAY more complicated to do a battery system than an on grid system - a lot more electrical engineering, permitting is more difficult, and just a ton more electrically that the majority of installers (CA &amp; UT where I install at least) have no clue or experience on how to install. So it's more than possible that your solar contractor is pooping in his pants right now because he has no idea how to do a battery based system and he doesn't want to lose your business after working hard to get you to go with him in the first place. Everything construction wise and solar /electric wise is tougher with off grid- more conduit to run which means a wider trench to dig, more lines and connections which have to be hand done which means increased labor cost, drilling from the outside to the inside of a garage /house to have a good space for the batteries, helping the homeowner find the necessary space for the batteries, finding a battery enclosure that your city will sign off on, I could go on and on- an on grid system has none of these challenges of an off grid /battery based system does. And also, most electricians, even master electricians have no clue how to wire a battery based system. They are frightened by it. I have yet to have a master electrician be willing to do an install simply because of lack of technical knowledge. \n\nAlso, as a contractor you end up making less and spending more time doing an off grid system. Because of the  increased parts price you generally end up decreasing the labor portion so that the customer can simply still afford it. So for all those reasons your contractor probably doesn't want to do an off grid system.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.019082245358731598,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10528623043153304,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16153765804852885,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1558548681711302,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10335519682962513,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21632010763125753,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.018700905124812078,"solar_1":-0.22455286943824304,"solar_2":-0.29095746238996106,"solar_3":-0.19056786451568541,"solar_4":-0.07965155361595112,"solar_5":-0.09090334196476067,"solar_6":-0.20010613537371186,"solar_7":-0.08186082033110627,"solar_8":-0.06946099217263206,"solar_9":-0.0311048678982786,"solar_10":-0.1301288399920395},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for those who want to be extremely environmentally friendly and independent of the grid)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

So essentially, just make sure the car is charging at XX Amps that's typically comfortable depending on the output and whatever the solar doesn't provide, just have the battery provide it. Then when the car is charged, the batteries continue to recharge from the solar array? That would cause a bit of wear on the batteries though, wouldn't it? Or maybe it's negligible, not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso gets me thinking - with a 13kw solar array, I'm going to have a LOT of excess production. Water heating is a common dump load, but our water heater is gas and that's negligible since the tap is 85F in summer already. What else would make a good dump load or possible cheap battery storage?

The article says that  the amount of power produced will offset costs up to your monthly usage, however on our bill it is dependent on time of day usage. The first two paragraphs below from that article are correct, however the third paragraph states electricity produced over the course of the billing cycle. In reality on our bill we're seeing that even if we produce more over an entire billing cycle than we use we will get credit for that, however if we use at night then we are still being charged for the amount used at night. Or better put, the amount we produce during the day doesn't offset what we use at night when we're not producing.\n\n\"Under Entergy’s solar buyback program (which they call ‘net metering’), the energy your solar panel system produces will be used by your home, which reduces how much electricity you take from Entergy, thus lowering your electricity bill. \r  \n\r  \nWhen your solar panels aren’t producing electricity, like at night, that’s when your home will take electricity from Entergy (the grid) to cover your energy usage.\r  \n\r  \nIn some cases, your solar panels will produce more electricity over the course of the billing cycle than your home uses.

Not only are all the trains electric, but they're also all powered by clean energy. According to the [SBB website](https://company.sbb.ch/en/sbb-as-business-partner/services-rus/energy/sustainable-energy.html), 90% of the electricity comes from hydro power, while the remaining 10% comes from nuclear and solar PV. That's still not good enough for them though, and they're actively working on phasing out the nuclear portion to make it even cleaner.\n\nI know Switzerland is a very small country and they already had a fantastic rail network to utilise, but they're a perfect demonstration of how freight travel can become sustainable through electrification.

Everytime someone doesn't eat vegan analogues they get decried and quite often voted down in this subreddit like I am above. The operating circlejerk here is that everything else is way too hard, makes veganism look boring, bland, difficult and untasty. Here is a reply I made in another thread in response to a vegan complaining that others castigated veganism as only for the relatively privileged:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2po9vx/there_was_a_post_on_rdocumentaries_the_other_day/cmyon39?context=3\n\nWell this sub, certainly does nothing to declaim such an impression from my participation. I can only imagine how it would look to my coworkers if all I ate was Tofurky, Vegannaise, Gardein, Beyond Meat, they would think vegans are all obsessed with the taste of meat, eggs and milk still and hopefully they would never look at the prices of those items at the supermarket! \n\nThreads about very serious subjects are barely commented.

It truly felt natural and right and unforced to me, to be vegetarian: my father had returned to eating meat occasionally after a period of vegetarianism, so it's not as if I was brainwashed into it (!) by both parents having one very rigid value system.

Harming a human is bad, because it's your own species, you can identify with them. You can't identify with a pig for example (comment: I can, they said they can't)\n  Ask them if they've ever spent time with a pig, cow, chicken, or sheep before. If they haven't, they can't use this argument - how would they know if they could or not? Also ask if they've ever \"identified\" with their dog or cat (or other domestic pet). Chances are they have. Personally, I believe identifying with another species beyond \"hey we have the same basic needs and desires: food, shelter, mates, freedom\" requires a lot of anthropomorphism. But we can all identify with other species when it comes to those basic needs all animals have.\n\n2. Humans are \"above\" other species because they are the most intelligent and capable of living together in a complex society.\n  This one is very easy all they need to do is look at ants. It's simply false to say they don't live in a complex society.\n\n3. Killing a domestic animal is bad because either you, or another human, has a bond with that animal. Therefore if you kill an animal someone has a bond with, you hurt the people having that bond and you can identify with them.\n  All food animals are domestic animals - so they have said that they believe killing a food animal is bad. Plenty of people have bonds with sheep, cows, pigs and chickens. The reason most meat eaters consider their food food and their pets pets is because they don't ever meet their meat. And if they do, they forcibly try to not form a bond with the animal they'll eventually kill (and most people who raise food animals sell the animals and have someone else do the killing).\n\n4. Why is taking a life of an animal wrong? They die either way, naturally or by us. If you give them great food, enough space and protect them from dangerous predators, why is it wrong to take their life? Why is their life worthy?\n  This was really answered by your opponent in 1 and 3. They have weak arguments. They explain why killing an animal can be wrong and then ask why it's wrong. I've given my dog great food, space, and protection, now why is it wrong that I kill my dog for dinner? Keep in mind too that in many parts of the world dogs are eaten daily. The worthiness is completely arbitrary and is assigned by society in the way that we view animals. Your opponent has pointed this out to their self, although they probably don't realize it. An animal kept as a pet is more worthy of living a full, natural life because someone is keeping it as a pet. An animal kept for food is less so because it is kept for food. It is only this philosophy that assigns worthiness - no outside factor. This is why going vegan is so difficult for some - it requires that you adjust the way you think about animals, and that is pretty difficult for many people.\n\nAs an aside, all the word \"domestic\" means is that the animal has been selectively bred to live among humans in order to serve some purpose toward humans. It doesn't mean \"pet\" or \"companion animal\" as your opponent seems to believe.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2019419195619922,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08261857210276276,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.32452836515099376,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17161924309597443,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17537420348958221,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1823211294911128,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20535873466481766,"diet_1":-0.025370689672556068,"diet_2":-0.1764263772710338,"diet_3":-0.080475633599292,"diet_4":-0.051802547634089535,"diet_5":-0.22400274688455588,"diet_6":-0.03665772453435542,"diet_8":-0.08068374704938226,"diet_9":-0.01662099375001465,"diet_10":-0.24810351726288596,"diet_11":-0.21939573807564253,"diet_13":-0.07454468434055646,"diet_14":-0.17023371974937618,"diet_17":-0.30683897012622446},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes (for descriptive and injunctive norms related to treating animals with care and respect in certain social groups)","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Words are defined by how they're used.\n\nIronic you think I don't understand what dictionaries are for, whilst refusing to use the actual definition of both the words  '[definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/definition)' and '[dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/dictionary)'. It's kind of sad that you resort to denying the legitimacy of the oxford dictionary just for the sake of winning the argument.\n\nThe entire purpose of a dictionary is that it records one **official** and **definitive**  meaning for a word as reference point. If you don't have universal agreement on the definitions then the entire fucking purpose of words is lost. Which is partially why I'm against this movement of 'enlightening' people on **your** definition of the word as the 'definitive' definition. Which is outright spreading misinformation.\n\nAnd I never denied that we shape words and their meaning ourselves, but unless your meaning is officially recognized as a definition, you can't say it's the factual and absolute definition, especially not **over the official definition listed in the dictionary**. Not to mention that your definition is rarely used at all. You people are literally complaining that 'no one knows the actual definition of veganism'. So in what way exactly is 'my definition' objectively wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Nothing about trying to limit in the OED definition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; you: \"Veganism just means you have a plant based diet and sure if you try to limit the use of animal products\" \n\n\"...*regardless of result, that's definitely a good thing but for all practical purposes you're not a vegan.\"*\n\nGood job on the strawman. I never said that was the definition of being vegan. In fact I stated that that isn't the definition of being vegan just after the part you quoted. It was a response to the OP about whether a certain lifestyle should be considered vegan or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The OED definition also just describes the act, not the motivation but it doesn't preclude veganism being a philosophy or motivated by one.\n\nAre you intentionally using fallacies here? Because wow, five fallacies in such a short comment is admittedly pretty impressive.\n\nNo shit being vegan doesn't exclude being motivated by a philosophy. Still, definitions define what words are, nothing else. The motivation isn't the definition of veganism itself, saying it can be 'motivated by philosophy' would've been an arbitrary statement. And no, the dictionary not saying it's not a philosophy doesn't mean it is. Do you want dictionaries to register literally everything the word is not? That would be a pretty long list.

My recommendation is to get a second opinion (from another professional) and genuinely see what’s best for you. Do not sacrifice your health to avoid the fish oil. I am sorry but sometimes meds contain animal products and you still need to take your meds anyways. We can do our part to eat vegan, take vegan medicine while possible, and advocate for more vegan options in the medical space. At the end of the day if you have to take fish oil for medical reasons and you did your due diligence to genuinely try and find out an alternative I think that you’ve done your part.

I know lots of people who joined the military because there was no other jobs available or it was the only way they could afford post secondary.  If you’ve never been in either category then you have privilege. \n\nOP- if it’s really the only way then I certainly wouldn’t hold it against you if you had to delay veganism in order to get yourself an education.  You could eat a plant based diet whenever there is the option available which would be your entire not work time, and certain times even when at work, plus still not use nonfood products made from animals /tested in animals and avoid zoos circuses marine parks etc. \n\n Everything that I have that is good in my life stems from having completed a university degree, and I had to do it totally on my own without any help from family etc. But I’m friends with lots of rich kids who just don’t understand what a privilege it is to live at home for free while in school and/or have parents pay your tuition and books and living expenses.    I am in Canada though so definitely have a privilege over any American in the sense that we don’t have the wild tuition prices that are in the USA.  \n\nMy advice is do whatever you must to get a degree. In a field that has reasonable career options.  Life is better and easier when you don’t have to struggle every step of the way financially.  My degree was an investment in myself. The best one I ever made and every day I am grateful for it. I have a meaningful career I love and make over 125k annually with a great pension and benefit plan. I never thought in my wildest dreams as a kid growing up poor or as a young adult working 3-4 different jobs to barely be able to pay for Kraft dinner and hot dogs and enough gas in my car to get to my different jobs that I would be where I am at financially. It’s not all about money either, it’s about stress, and enjoying life, and stability and security; all things I didn’t have growing up. And as a 38yo in this situation, I am able to donate generously to animal advocacy organizations that I support, to local sanctuaries and rescues. I am able to volunteer for animal advocacy issues, I even sit as a board member for one. I run a TikTok channel on animal advocacy. I would not be able to do any of this if I still had to work 3 jobs to pay rent. Financial stability opens doors.  And post secondary opens the doors for financial stability. \n\nAll that being said, have you inquired about if they can accommodate a vegan diet?  Sometimes it takes a person to ask and write a few letters. It’s surprising how things can change.  Another thought (which is a bit shady) but maybe you should consider claiming religious rights- pick a religion that follows a vegan or near vegan diet and put that as your religion on the form, asking for religious accommodation.  It’s funny but sometimes avoiding the big v-word makes it easier.  \n\nAlso not sure if u looked into it, but a good affordable option for college for many Americans is to attend school in Canada.  Montreal is full of American students who take advantage of controlled tuition prices and many Canadian universities and colleges do not charge Americans an international student rate.  My first year of uni was full of Americans who could not believe they could attend a top rated school for less than their local community college. If you avoid Vancouver and Toronto cost of living is pretty reasonable too. Montreal is a big spot (and yes there are two English universities there- Concordia and McGill) for Americans but they are increasingly in the prairie provinces too. Check into it, maybe it’s a good option for you.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005614749311083263,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24941826910451115,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2136893578215826,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19353757422580686,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1819540292993037,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22879869129241914,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3145039178403284,"diet_1":-0.08657580997515879,"diet_2":-0.30838761326352443,"diet_3":-0.19370458942124363,"diet_4":-0.06419440888053743,"diet_5":-0.11358899708769361,"diet_6":-0.09741151189033796,"diet_8":-0.006317870396742364,"diet_9":-0.005584218842462481,"diet_10":-0.08990944977335857,"diet_11":-0.32306092547111315,"diet_13":-0.35712076785663766,"diet_14":-0.14123299022184743,"diet_17":-0.1317462502368068},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

They appreciate animals as individuals who see their own lives as an end in itself, not as food producers.\n\nThe reason why eating eggs is seen as normal is because it's so easy to find eggs and products with eggs as ingredients in any grocery store asides from the very few that specialize in vegan products. But producing so many eggs to satisfy that much demand is logistically impossible without going against animal rights. Use of animals for a primary goal that's something that isn't focused on the point of view of the animals themselves almost always implies going against their interests.\n\nWhen hens are commercialy exploited for eggs, that activity has to be profitable, but trying to get profits from selling eggs without going against the interests of the hens themselves sounds like an absolute logistical nightmare. That would mean not killing male chicks after their birth, giving enough space for hens, and not exploitating their body's biology to lay as much eggs as possible. Laying an egg is very energy-intensive for a hen, and laying a lot increases the risks of deadly complications like ectopic eggs. So according to this logic, if the hen's interest comes before the profitability of the business of selling their eggs, the egg laying should be kept to the lowest possible. With all of that and probably more, in my mind anything that would be close to being an \"ethical\" egg would be a luxury item.\n\nAs I said the normality of eating eggs exists because hens are abused for it. My theory is that when people realize the cruelty implied by commercial egg production, they stand against it. But because the eggs themselves are not attacked, eating them is still normal and natural, and people still don't want to drop them. As such they try to find more \"humane\" farms free of cruelty, where animals live a happy life and just happen to give us food. The problem is that it's in practice pretty much impossible to get animal products from farms with happy animals that \"just happen\" to give us food; every time there's conditioning of the lives of animals that goes against their interests. Because eggs aren't a vital necessity, vegans just stop eating them to protest against animal exploitation. They do not eat them in order to show that they care more about the welfare, happiness and health of hens and comparably don't care about trying to find very specific situation where eggs can be ethically acceptable even though we have no need for them.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"yes","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.12407502624334181,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28620741803667626,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23232508171832372,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17164892921357688,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.5055885437210513,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2914008036873933,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.33289400007607517,"diet_1":-0.2410577874385126,"diet_2":-0.1638038940290727,"diet_3":-0.17320303457923558,"diet_4":-0.26183029865820157,"diet_5":-0.23201309495785405,"diet_6":-0.18710984207350023,"diet_8":-0.03295765311789486,"diet_9":-0.00629375144004977,"diet_10":-0.19275697072347006,"diet_11":-0.17797343689523323,"diet_13":-0.18042298816518662,"diet_14":-0.24504450546492787,"diet_17":-0.20273693207656235},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.
