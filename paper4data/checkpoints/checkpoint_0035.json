"comment": "Calm down... Take off the foil hat, there are no black helicopters coming after you, this is just a discussion about a car. \n\nActually, I am kind of ashamed of myself at having been drawn into this ludicrous argument with you hyperventilating about a *teeny-tiny-theoretical-thing-that-may-or-may-not-happen-under-some-rare-circumstances-and-possibly-provide-maybe-up-to-10%-of-the-energy-in-a-technically-complex-manner-but-only-if-you-look-at-it-the-right-way argument.* It is a bizarre non-issue. I drive my Volt 90% of the time as a pure EV. When I need to go further or travel on the highway, the generator provides the electricity that I need to turn the wheels. It's an Extended Range EV and it is unlike a Limited Range EV, Nissan Leaf or True Hybrid, Toyota Prius. There is no confusion or argument about what makes these vehicles move. When a Leaf battery dies, it stops moving... Call a tow truck. When a Prius battery dies, go to a gas station and let the engine drive the car. The Volt is a bit of each of these, but not exactly like either. As such, you can never shoehorn the car into either of these categories. \n\nLook, I just like driving an electric car and not having to worry about being stranded, or owning/maintaining/insuring multiple vehicles or predominately ICE powered vehicles for different purposes. I am completely satisfied with my Volt and even if what you are describing actually happened in 1/1000th of my days of driving, I do not see how any of it will hasten the end of the world as you seem to be suggesting with your shrill and fanatical position. If it adds 10-15% efficiency to the flow of energy, I really don't care about how YOU think that this is being accomplished. It's an electric car that also has a generator and anything else claimed is minuscule and a complete distraction from what counts.",

"comment": "Bush uncapped the 30% tax credit for residential houses, so that's as rooftop as it gets. He probably didn't do it personally, but it was under his administration. \n\nObama signed off on the Solyndra / Uni-solar loans and plugged thin film technology in state-of-union speeches. This disappointed me because his DoE was very familiar with solar, and any installer could tell you those were not cost-effective technologies. China kicked our butts by subsidizing traditional technology instead. Then, the import tariff makes traditional modules more expensive, creating an utter disaster from a policy-driven install cost perspective. \n\nThe sunshot program isn't helping solar meet its cost-parity goals - if anything, China + mainstream design + labor are the primary drivers of the solar price drop. \n\nOther than manufacturer loans, the main solar policies of Obama, in my opinion:\n\n1) Section 1603 grant - which allowed large-scale solar to be built on other people's taxes instead of the array owner's taxes. Maybe inconsequential at the end of the day, but not a very good PR move. At the end of the day, it helped solar get built before the module price drop, which was happening independently of the grant.\n\n2) Expanded funding for federal projects + federal mandates. This allows for some rooftop solar, but it primarily funds larger projects (500kW+) on military bases. That's not going to create a lot of jobs, but can create a lot of $100 hammers. Likewise, his emphasis on use of public lands for solar will only result in utility-scale arrays. So much of what Obama is doing is promoting large-scale arrays, when much low hanging fruit (30 year financing for small arrays through a variety of measures) remains on the branch. \n\nRooftop solar = increase labor, real estate value, more sales tax, less depreciation, reduced transformer costs, less line loss, more private buy-in, etc. etc. etc. Utility-scale solar results in increased electricity prices and less consumer control. But I think you know all this.",

"comment": "Of course. It's not like you need a license to apply for tax credits. You can just do it yourself. Go to your state website and search for \"solar tax credit\". \n\nIf you're willing to consider my suggestion then I'll go into a little more depth. You can get the panels on-line and the inverters. In California there is a list of approved inverters so you can shop around and you should definitely shop around. \n\nYou can also get the wiring yourself. MC4 connectors, for instance, are a place where many ripoff installers try to make a buck. I bought ten male and female connecrots for US$15 on Aliexpress. \n\nHere is 500 feet of the wire that goes with them for fifty cents a foot. That should give you more than you need for the whole job twice over.  \n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/500-10-AWG-PHOTOVOLTAIC-PV-Solar-Power-Cable-Wire-UL-4703-2013-/171404277605?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27e87db765\n\nOkay, so now you have the panels, the inverters, all the wire anybody could possibly use for the job and so besides the actual electrical hookups what you have left is a solid frame. \n\nThe standard 250 watt polysilicon panels you get these days usually have holes that happen to fit perfectly on slotted angle iron or \"L\" beams. It's easy stuff to work with that doesn't need to be welded. It's full of holes to attach big heavy screws. I'd have a welder bid on that job if looks are key and you have some special attachment issues or need a stand-alone frame. Otherwise, just do that yourself too. An angle grinder would be nice for cutting the steel but a hacksaw can work in a pinch and a 10mm wrench is pretty cheap and common. That's all you need for some big jobs with slotted angle iron.  \n\nAt that point all you would need is an electrician to make the final connections and you can find an electrician who will do that for more than it's worth but still a hell of a lot less than a solar installer. There is no such thing as a solar installer really. You've got electricians and you've got plumbers. You don't need a plumber and if you hire an electrician to do carpentry or metalwork or even worse to act as your purchase manager then you're most likely not going to get a low price.",

Until then, there is just way too much money to be invested in dehumanizing animals and making meat \"cute\" (foster farms chickens, chik fill-a, happy cows, etc) for the consumer to make an unbiased decision; not to mention the subsidies (at least in the USA) that the government pays to meat.

I went as far as saying that they are [not planning enough production capacity for the program](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/3b6r4u/gms_chevy_bolt_outpacing_tesla_in_cheaper/csjihef). I think they will themselves be surprise be the demand.\n\n&gt; Why do people like you have to position things like this as some sort of colossal battle?\n\nLike me? I completely reject that claim. I am an EV advocate and wish for all EV to succeed. You talk of \"battle\". The point of the article was that the media are claiming a battle between the Bolt and the Model 3. You know the whole \"Tesla killer\" thing - the whole point of the article. \n\nMy point is that they don't compete. I never said the Bolt will not sell. Just that it won't compete with the Model 3. \n\n&gt; Recently some media have been implying that the Bolt might be a “Tesla killer” or more precisely that it is going after Tesla’s third generation vehicle currently in development, the Model 3. These claims are unfounded and derive from **this bad habit of seeing all electric vehicles as one big car category**.\n\nAs far as making assumptions, I clearly state that they are and that I'm only basing this on \"currently available information\".\n\nBut I stand by this:\n\n\n&gt; If we rely on currently available information, the gasoline-powered counterpart of the Model 3 is **shaping up to be** the BMW Series 3, while the Bolt’s seems to be the Chevrolet Sonic.\n\n[...]\n\n&gt; In other words, GM is making a $37,500 car that would sell for $20,000 if it wasn’t electric, while Tesla **is trying to make** a $35,000 car that would sell for $35,000 if it wasn’t electric.",

"comment": "Im not talking about thermal management of batteries, im talking about thermal management of the electronics controlling charge rate to the battery.  All the electronics are onboard the vehicle because they are specific to the battery.  Every manufacturer is different and their batteries all have different capacities and different charge curves.  That is why the electronics are onboard the vehicle.  Externally, the charger has electronics to verify voltage source quality before they close a contactor to provide voltage to the plug.  \n\nAc/dc conversion is done onboard the vehicle.  Also like i mentioned previously, thermal management of the electronics is not a trivial issue.  Imagine the supercharger rate of 120kW.  Imagine a 90% efficiency on your onboard charging circuit.  At the peak charge rate, you will have 12kW of heat to deal with, on a stationary car with no airflow.  Just some food for thought.  \n\nEven on dc charging, you need to regulate voltage and current to the battery.  You cant just stick voltage straight on the battery terminals and call it a day.  There are specific curves and battery cell temps you need to follow for the health of the battery.  You also cant just charge at a steady rate.  So there is a lot of circuitry to handle this onboard, all with efficiency losses, mostly in mosfet rds on losses and cable resistance.",

The Alley is one house away from my house so I had to run about 200 feet of conduit from my breaker box out to the alley!  We'll be putting in a fence/rolling gate this month or beginning of next, but that only deters the walk-bys that might glance over and see \"Oh, electonics to steal\" type of transients...\n\n[I've put in a locking box](http://i.imgur.com/bmQppM4.jpg) (Will cement all new pad and secure better to ground when fence is put in) and when I pull the charge cable to charge, [I also toss the extra in the trunk and lock the car](http://i.imgur.com/p00W5GQ.jpg?1).  So the charger and cable are locked to a degree, however, anyone can cut the cable and pull it from the trunk and steal the copper cabling.\n\nIf this was *'double'* plugged into my car, what prevents some *'transient'* walking down the alley, just pulling it out and running off with it?",

They could have improved that technology to bring the cost down.  Tesla starting with a $120,000 car, then the S was down to 60% or so the cost, and now the Model 3 50% of that.  GM had a shit load more resources, capital, man power, etc and they could have done the same in the less time.  But they did not want to because for them, PROFIT is the only motivation.  Short Term profit at that.  They, like many companies, look only to the next quarter, or next year tops to eeek that stock price up so the executives can make more cash and then move on.  This is the way companies work, and this is why they stifle innovation.  You're 100% right, why should they take a loss... If you see it as a loss, and not an investment into the future of a company for the next 100 years.  Had they \"taken the loss\" its possible by now they would have \"Model 3\" type cars already in mass production instead of just rolling out the Bolt in 2017.",

"comment": "Yes, in short you can use a battery with microinverters.  The most commonly known product out there would be the Tesla Powerwall (if you can get your hands on one).  Since a microinverter on the back of each panel immediately inverts the energy into AC, you would need to install a battery that can AC couple.  (AC vs DC couple batteries really just refer to if you are connecting the battery directly to the PV or not).  \n\nThe durability of the optimizers is still an unsettled question in the industry.  Realistically, SolarEdge has only been a major player for 3 years and as such there is a relatively short runway of field data on their performance.  From my experience they are reliable.  On the other hand, micro inverters are an 11 year old technology and Solarbridge invented the 25 year warranty.  You will read about many failures in the first generation micros but not much since.  \n\nI know the tax is not part of the cost.  But look at it this way, your out of pocket is the entire price, then it is up to you to capture the ITC value in order to justify the price tag.  Effectively, the tax incentive allows the installer to charge you a higher price when I know they should not be paying more than a $1/W for the equipment.    \n\n$3.55/W before the battery is not a bad price, but in my experience I thing you could haggle at least another $0.25/W reduction.  \n\n12k for one battery also seems high.  The MSRP on the LG Chem RESU10 is $4500... and that thing can be installed in 3 hours.  \n\nAre you getting an attached or ballasted tilt mount racking?",

"comment": "Ethanol burns way cleaner than gasoline, I've got a lot of friends who managed to cheat California emissions testing while running E85 and no cats. It also has the benefit of having an octane rating of about 105, and gasoline motors can run E85 or higher if properly retuned for it. You are right that it has lower MPG due to being less energy dense than gasoline, but if it's produced in a carbon-neutral way, and we reduce out total consumption by investing in more public transit, then I think it's a more promising power source than having to produce an entirely new fleet of electric vehicles.",

Not arguing for or against being a vegan. That's a personal choice and your person choice matters very little to me, because in the grand scheme of things it does not effect me. I'm arguing the environmentalist argument above. \n\nBut excluding this previous point there are about a thousand different activities that, using this same logic, would mean you're not an environmentalist. Do you use electricity? You obviously do because you posted on Reddit. Where does that electricity come from? If it's not from wind, solar, geothermal, or hydroelectric facilities then you are contributing to the problem. Do you drive a car or use public transport? If so then you add to emissions unless you drive an electric car. Now if it is an electric car, once again, do you know how that electricity is generated? And regardless of what car you drive the creation of the car left a carbon footprint. So buying a car and buying meat are really pretty similar. It's the same for every bit of manufacturing. So pretty much all of the world are not environmentalists based off of this argument. \n\nI drive a car, I eat meat, and I use electricity. So by this argument I'm not an environmentalist. But here's the thing. I'm currently a college student angling myself along a course of study that I hope will lead to the development of a greener world. Am I not an environmentalist because of this? I am conscious of how much unnecessary energy I waste, we all waste some but minimizing that amount will go a long way if everyone does the same.",

While that doesn't really make any precise statements about the new Leaf, it at least narrows things down a little. If the Leaf isn't making a profit, then some of the group's other offerings must be doing so. And they must be making more profit than the Leaf is losing.\n\nConsidering that those other offerings are all built on older technology with heavier and more expensive batteries, and the new Leaf is literally selling as fast as they come rolling off the assembly line, it is more reasonable to assume that it is cost-neutral or profitable than to assume that it loses money.",

This is a win-win situation for them. They can get companies to install them for a low price or for free (same business model as above), and this will attract customers to their shop. Waiting 20-30 minutes to charge isn't that big of a deal if you can do useful things while you wait.\n\nAnother factor is that people move around. People who already own Plug-ins or EVs will avoid apartments and condos without charging options. This will lower their market value.

I had to drive my wife's ICE this weekend and it felt sluggish both accelerating, and braking.\n\nResistance to the Tesla brand is here for good, just as resistance to iPhone. Regardless, higher demand for DCFC due to more EV drivers will result in more Fast Charge stations, good for all EV drivers! And, it will encourage more car makers to invest in the technologies, resulting in better and cheaper batteries, and ultimately a smaller differential between ICE and EV sticker prices.\n\nWhether or not the rest of the industry \"catches up\" with Tesla is not as important as getting in the game. Many have been successful for many decades offering functionality that is clearly not up to Mercedes or Cadillac standards, the same will hold true for EVs. I wouldn't be surprised by Tesla being gobbled up as a premium brand by one of the big auto makers by 2025.",

What do you mean I'm supposed to plug it in every other day? My current car I only have to fill once a week or so.\"\n\nSales people aren't stupid. They know all of these facts. You're also assuming that every car buyer is acting rationally. Yes, there some advantages to EV, but that doesn't mean the average person cares about them when you weigh the whole package. I also think the cost angle is a bad one: most people sure don't seem to care about mileage since they're buying big SUVs and pick-up trucks. It works for cost-conscience people, but not much else.\n\nI'm of the opinion that most EVs are currently not suitable for mass consumption yet. They are getting there, but it's going to take another cycle or two before the infrastructure is good enough and the range issue is solved (either with much larger packs or much faster charging, or both). People will also need more exposure so that they have a more accurate picture of what EV ownership involves.",

The Neutral pin is useless for applications that don't need 120V and 240V (Like an EVSE).\n\nI would strongly recommend getting a Tesla EVSE (Modified or Unmodified), as /u/paulwesterberg noted theirs is quite excellent.  It's highly adaptable (can get any adapter for any plug) and provides a high amount of power.\n\nYou can purchase an unmodified EVSE directly from Tesla and get an adapter [like this one](https://shop.quickchargepower.com/JDapter-Stub-Tesla-Charge-Station-Adaptor-JDPTRSTB.htm), or you can do what I did and get a modified Tesla EVSE so you can plug it directly into your car [like this one](https://shop.quickchargepower.com/JESLA-JR-is-THE-32-amp-J1772-portable-charging-solution-JESLAJR.htm).  Once you get one of these, you can get adapters for everything from RV Campground Plugs to Dryer plugs, and you can plug in no matter where you spend the night.",

"comment": "Looked at (drove) the leaf, Tesla (M3), i3, Corsa e, e-Niro, Zoe and considered but didn't drive (for lack of access to one) the polestar. I went with this for a few reasons; I was coming from a BMW 4 series (GC) and part of the move away from that was wanting something smaller now my commute is only a few miles (in fact for the past few months I have cycled it), and my wife has a bigger more utilitarian car which is only a year old, so we don't need two big cars.\n\nThat ruled out the polestar and model 3, which cost wise also made sense as both are around the 50k mark and the others 25-30k. I've driven a model S a few times and although the wow factor of the acceleration is great, for me (my opinion only) the rest of the cars quality didn't hold up for me. It's hugely improved in the model 3, but I want a hatchback (spoiled by the GC) so the Y would appeal more, and that's not available here yet, and I have reservations about Tesla's ability to disable things like supercharging on a whim (don't irritate Elon on Twitter!).\n\nAs for the rest, the Pug is the only one of them I got in and had proper fun driving it. It's well set up for UK roads (much better than the Corsa despite being the same platform underneath), it's nippy and agile, I liked the interior (although admittedly it won't be to everyone's taste, especially the streering wheel and driving position) and it was a decent compromise on convenience and range - the Zoe has a greater range but fast charging is an optional extra and not as fast as the 208. The e-Niro has the best range of all of that sector, but a long waiting list and I found it a little dull to drive compared to the 208. It's certainly not perfect, but for me the choices fit well with the Pug. If you are considering it though I would highly recommend driving one first - purely to see if you can get on with its unique driving position setup. I love it, but many don't!\n\nAll in, definitely worth considering as a company car, but any electric as a company car is financially a sensible option at the moment.\n\nI just like that I filled up to full on a free charger (podpoint) whilst shopping today - can you imagine that as petrol!?",

That is not the case for the Y which is significantly more efficient then the comparable 3.   This is even though the cars share a huge amount of similarities.      I mean the Model Y is significantly more efficient then a Leaf or Bolt or most anything else that you want to compare it to.   And that's even though the only Model Y that they have on that site is the performance version with 21\" wheels.    Once the standard dual motor or RWD version is on there they will be even more efficient.\n\n[https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=42474&amp;id=42562&amp;id=42191&amp;id=42089](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=42474&amp;id=42562&amp;id=42191&amp;id=42089)\n\nEDIT:  I got to ask - so when you make a comment that gets pushback why do you delete it?

"comment": "Yes they are a consideration in basic physics, because basic physics is litterally the function of everything in our world including our own lives- The law of entropy. I don't mean to be pedantic too often, but that statement specifically irked me. \n\nEvery single person who uses the road and sidewalk is equally responsible for their own actions. The same for drivers, riders, and pedestrians alike. Cyclists get hit 3 times as often because they move fast and get complacent. Also potholes are a concern for bikes too if they get big or deep enough, I've seen cyclists get thrown too, often straight into the road and traffic. I've helped people and directed traffic and called ambulances because I trained as an MFR and it's in my blood to help if I can safely. \n\nIt's personal responsibility and accountability. Cyclists, scooter riders, drivers, we all have to be responsible for our selves and others on the road so we all can use them safely, that's how it's designed to work. Laws exist to limit personal freedoms for everyone's safety, so being as careful and cognizant as we can be when we travel is part of that. \n\nThere are scooter riders who will mod them and ride unsafe, same as Cyclists I see on e bikes with no helmets or wearing long flowy skirts! \n\nI agree with limiting speeds for safety, I agree with sharing bike lanes, I agree with helmets being mandatory for any sport on wheels, I even agree that the design of scooters does make it more likely to throw you if you get unlucky or aren't paying attention as you should so safety gear should be the first priority of any rider before you ever step on it. Cyclists are more likely to suffer fatal accidents from vehicles though, and that's just another reality of physics. You can't disengage from the vehicle as easily so if a car hits you youre wrapped around the frame if it's broad side, and you go flying if it's front or back. The force of a vehicle is greater so the impact and damage is greater. For a scooter to do the same damage you would have to be moving at super dangerous speeds and not paying enough attention. \n\nIt's more fun knowing that you are doing your best to be safe, what makes them scary is people doing insane things that they know they shouldn't. Like vehicles passing me on a solid line when I am going the posted speed limit of 30k in a school zone, riding close to the sidewalk. That's just stupid! \n\nVehicle operators such as cars or motorcycles, electric personal vehicles like scooters and e bikes and regular cyclists have a personal responsibility to everyone around them, same as pedestrians have to use sidewalks and cross walks freely as directed without threat of being run down.",

"comment": "That’s my feeling as well. It’s not just the lack of a smaller hatchback, it’s the sheer variety of different offerings, if Tesla made something which was the same size as the ID.3 it would do very well, but you’ve still got the e-208, Zoe, Mini, Honda e, Fiat 500, i3, Citigo, Smart cars, Corsa, and a good few others, all catering to different styles, price points, sizes and elements of practicality. Then going up in size, between that and the Model Y you've got so many other models, currently available and to be launched in the next year. In terms of a conventional car market, I think the genie’s out of the bottle, and Tesla won’t go above 15-20% again in this market.\n\nHaving said that, Tesla so far has maintained its same market share over the last few years in terms of global sales, so you never know, or maybe the robotaxis come true and the whole market is blown up!",

"comment": "Thanks for sharing! Yes I did the same thing and got a few quotes from local companies through Energysage. It seems to me that Solar Optimum and NRG might be two other good options, offering cheaper prices for the same high quality panels (REC and Panasonic) and would have better customer service than Tesla.\n\nSun Power is saying that since they do the upgrade themselves, their upgrade estimate is cheaper, so $2500 would cover most of the upgrading cases (and it typically would cost $5000 if you find your own man). I don't know if I can take the sales word for it, if it is true and I add that $5000 to the local company's quote, it is actually pretty much the same as Sun Power.\n\nI would hope that Tesla offered a default option between 4.8 and 7.2. 7.2 might be an overkill for me so I am actually comparing the Tesla 4.8 ($9600 after tax credit) and Sun power ($15000 after tax credit + $1000 refund when registered at Sierra Club for $15).  Again that upgrade fee makes a difference here and I am not exactly sure if I can take the sales word for it since it is not listed in the proposal.",

It would appear that battery swapping is not going away as more EV makers have signed on.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_Inc.#Battery_swapping  \n\n>In November 2023, Nio and Changan Automobile signed a strategic agreement on battery swapping.[44] On 29 November 2023, Nio and Geely Holding signed similar agreement in the battery swapping sector,[45] as well as with JAC Group and Chery Automobile in January 2024. These agreements including carrying out cooperation on battery standards, battery swapping technology, battery swapping network expansion and operation, swappable model development, battery asset management, and develop swappable vehicles.[46]\n\n>As of 31 December 2022, Nio has built 1,305 battery swap stations over all provincial administrative regions in China. They were providing an average of 40,000 daily battery swap services, and have completed a total of 15 million battery swap services.[42] In August 2023, seven swap stations were operating in Germany.[43]",

"comment": "Ahh, ok. That is quite a different story. But if youve got vehicle acces, why not build a solar trailer with foldout rigid panels. You would only need three or four of the big grid tie panels.  Go sunpower high efficiency if you want to keep it small. If your smart about your fold out system, It would probabably be faster than connecting and arraying a whole bunch of those flex ones, and the money you save on panels would pay for the trailer. You´ve got all your batteries, charge controller, inverter in the trailer, everything´s all connected up, etc. If you put some thought into your rig, setup would be almost instantaneous. If you are smart, you would have a manually adjustable angle, and you face the trailer towards the sun to maximize ouput. OR get really fancy and add some active tracking. Make the trailer itself the Az axis , with a little electric motor to turn it around. Shit, I just realized I really want to design a solar trailer!\n\nJust google \"solar trailer\" for ideas. I think this would be a much better investment, and provide you with a much more solid system that will provide a reliable power output and last for years and years. The only downside is the whole vehicle access thing, but if you guys are rolling in with all that other shit, it doesnt sound like an issue.",

"comment": "So I'm looking at building a Mppt controller from an ATTiny85 (A small IC) the step child of /r/arduino. I understand this controller and what it does from a DC-&gt;DC relationship. i.e. to maximize volt/current with the goal being maximize charging of batteries.\n\n**What other systems or controllers are used in solar power set ups?**\n\nI was thinking a phase matching circuit for different Ac inputs from 50-60 hz. i.e. combining power from the grid, generators, solar panels, and batters into one household line. Yes the expense here is high do to large amperage components, but assuming I'm keeping it under 50 amps with 120. **What is this called? / Where can I learn more about them?**\n\nI have already built a very simple solar tracking sensor (i.e. 4 three inch parallel tubes with ir sensors where the base is very very slightly brought toward the center. I.e. the \"tops\" are all pointed \"out\" just a bit. This allows a simple circuit to \"pinpoint a direct source of light.\" a small computer takes Readings every so often and than takes a data point, these points are used to keep the panel moving even if no \"usable data\" comes in, i.e. it gets dark from overcast etc. **How can I move real solar panels around with this type of device, i.e. powered hydraulics etc. And is it worth the cost in $ and in Watts to move the panels?**\n\n**Assuming I want an off the grid system, what are the components I would need to string together.** i.e. an answer might be, solar panels, mppt, batteries, inverter, X, Y, Z. this is so I can learn about x, y , and z which I might not ever have heard of this can include things to move the panels to track the sun etc.\n\nThanks all.",

"comment": "Trying to save money on \"green\" things is annoying. If you buy an electric card, they tax you on missed gas revenue. If you buy solar panels to save on utility costs, they tax you, and charge you fees for selling excess power over their infrastructure. Subsidize it, and then tax it. Why not leave it the fuck alone?\n\nThis isn't really relevant to the article. I have no real point. The older I get, the more pissed off at the world i become. I'd like to go back to being 18 when all I cared about was trying to fuck everything that walks.",

I agree that we should work toward moving away from centralized coal. And net metering is a great way to incentivize home solar installations, but somebody needs to pay for it.",

"comment": "I'm recommending the middle ground. Find a reputable installer in your area (if you give me your region happy to suggest a couple). They will present you with an option or two (many even offer both leases and financed purchases), do all procurement, system design, etc. Laymen shouldn't be designing their own solar arrays anyways, though many on this sub love to recommend building your own solar array via wholesale ordering of parts and hiring an electrician I think that's pretty nuts. Way bigger project than most people are interested in taking on.  \n\nA lease is in no way \"easier to get out of\" than a financed system. Both take a big hit with no net metering, but at least on an owned system you are retaining the system cost as equity. \n\nFeel free to ask me any further questions.",

"comment": "I think your math might be off by a factor of 1000.\n\n45 kW x 8hrs x 365 days x 30 years = 3.94 *million* kWh.\n\nPlus the avg capacity factor for solar systems is a bit lower than 8/24. Closer to 4.5/24.\n\nUsing the rest of your values, if we do:\n4 billion kWh / (4.5 hours x 365 days x 30 years) we get ~ 81MW.\n\nEDIT:\nAccording to [The US EIA](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=667&amp;t=2), the energy from 500,000 tons of coal is 9.6x10^8 kWh, which is a lot lower than your source. To match this number, we'd need only 19.5 MWp of solar. \n\nThat's about 1,348 tons worth of solar panels. However, most of that weight is the glass and the frame. A Maxeon cell from Sunpower can produce 3.3 Watts and weighs just **7 grams**.\n\n19.5 MWp / 3.3 Watts = 5,900,000 tiny Sunpower cells. \n\nSeems like a lot, but they weigh just 41 tons. Still not down to the magical 1 ton figure, but hey close enough. Let's just assume panels will keep producing for millennia :)",

"comment": "What has happened (as Germany pointed out earlier this week) is that Solar has reached the tipping point where it is cheaper than coal for producing energy.   Wind has also reached this tipping point.   (Large scale - it is no contest)\n\nNot only that, oil costs are just going to increase over time while Solar is expected to drop 10% year over year.  \n\nTelsa has shown that electric cars can be \"cool\"...the last time oil dropped (1998-2000) there were no equivalents.    \n\nOil decreased in price - SUV sales increased and that is what US car companies focused on and eventually lead to their own bankruptcies.    SUV margins are REDICULOUS - they focused on short-term gains rather than long-term.\n\nYou also had Bush (big oil) as President...can you imagine if Gore had won how different things may have been today?  (At least on that front)\n\nPlus, now you have companies out there actually making money from Solar and there have been breakthroughs in battery technology (if not tech - the new Giga-factories will reduce the cost just by their sheer volume)    \n\nOnce you have storage (think PowerWall) and solar on your roof to charge your car - people/investors are seeing a time where they can make $$$ off of solar.    In 2000 - we couldn't even see the tunnel - and now we see the light at the end of the tunnel fast approaching.",

However solar edge makes up for this as panels aren't power clipped, it's cheaper to buy, there are less parts prone to failure up high on your roof (warranty on enphase only covers the part itself.. Getting on a roof can be expensive),potential for more efficient battery storage.  I supply and install both however my recommendation is usually solar edge (it's not as easy to install mind you). Enphase is great for small jobs where only a couple of panels or inverter space is limited",

"comment": "because they have pioneered the auto industry, solar industry, energy storage... People fucking hate car companies, buying cars, high presure sales tactics, getting raped at dealerships. GM had that whole airbag problem, knew people were dying, but because it was cheaper said fuck it. volkswagon cheated the emissions system, and it goes on an on with car companies sucking.\n\ntesla model s/x is one of, if not the safest car on the road.\n\n[here is gm vice chair](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/feb/03/tesla-roadster-sport-electric-car)\n\"Robert Lutz, vice-chairman of General Motors, has been quoted as saying that \"all the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us – and boom, along comes Tesla. So I said, 'How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can't?'\"\n\n\n\nIf tesla didn't come along, the ev space would look completely different than it did today. This is also a good underdog story which everyone always likes. \n\n\n\n\nhere is a list I found from an owner\n\n1. Range Extension – I can go 1,000 miles in my new Model S for the same price as going 250 in my ICE.\n\n2. Design – Model S blends the intuitive and artful with the scientific and demonstrable.\n\n3. Performance – The combination of the lowest coefficient of drag and center of gravity of any production vehicle.\n\n4. The Quiet – Oh Model S, I can’t hear you…\n\n5. Simplicity – The flow from inside to out – sorry to many but this car had to, had to forego excess console and cupholders to get to a new state of elegant simplicity that matched aesthetics with engineering.\n\n6. The Touchscreen – Why haven’t people who have been making cars for 100 years figured this out?\n\n7. The Stores – Love ‘em!\n\n8. The Marketing – Do you recall the Leaf generating one thimbleful of the excitement that Model S has?\n\n9. Elon – This feels like buying one of Edison’s first light bulbs.\n\n10. Made in America\n\nThe model s/x is truly the first car that came along that was actually better than their counterparts. The gm bolt is probably a fine car, and I would totally drive one, but if I had to pick now or wait a year or two, I'd still wait for the model 3.\n\nIf you really wan't to understand why people love tesla maybe you should watch all their \"reveals\" on youtube. \n\n[Tesla model s reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWyH9yw0LXg)\n\n[Tesla model x reveal ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mURbzh9t0_0)\n\n[Tesla model 3 reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBuTElFMOvA)\n\n[Tesla powerwall reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKORsrlN-2k)\n\n[Tesla solar roof reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sfwDyiPTdU)",

Meanwhile Solar installers like to get creative with the truth.\n\nAnd, sadly, those environmental reasons are way overhyped, too. Unless your PV array is directly reducing power consumption from a utility that gets it energy from coal or maybe fracked natgas, the sunk environmental costs of making and shipping the PV panels, copper wiring, metal conduit, metal racking and inverter(s) are going to take a while to pay back. Living in such a sunny area does mitigate that, though, as the system will be working much more of the year than, say, Washington State where I live.",

"comment": "Hejsan, I am guessing you are situated in Skane?\n\nAnyhoo, it is better to approach a proper installer because you might need permits in Sweden to install one. And how big is the farm?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to work as a mechanical engineering in Landskrona and it was a pain to work on a project if you accidentally forget anything from the regulations hence why I ask you to approach a proper installer. On an average, you will have to pay around 20,000 Krona for a 50KWp installation (Labor) on top of the cost of the BoS (Panels, inverters, wires, Structure etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are planning on doing it yourself, again it is quite easy to do it. Just need some basic understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould it be an idea to cover unused farmland with solar panels, e.g.  instead of individual households investing in panels - you have small  scale systems that can reduce the energy cost for the whole community?  Would it make sense for a community to invest in such projects?\n\nCan you PM me or reply with more details on your location and energy requirement?",

"comment": "I have a setup that I'm trying to figure out if it is setup as best as possible without redundancy.  It's a bathroom trailer that allows for 30A external power to be plugged in. We have setup it up with Solar (setup before I got here) and I think it is setup incorrectly. Currently the solar panels (2x 100w panels) feed two AGM batteries that are tied into each other and connected to a solar controller. From there it goes into a 2200W power inverter to convert the power from DC to AC. Then connects externally to a plug which then connects into the 30 amp port on the outside of the trailer which feeds into the electronics already built into the trailer. Which then includes a power converter to convert the electricity back into DC. I have a hunch the 2200 watt power inverter is unnecessary but I have no way to confirm or idea of how to wire the DC directly into the trailers electronics. Has anyone dealt with this before?",

"comment": "I have a 5400 sq ft. home with an electric car. We use generally 100kWh per day. My 8192kW system produces about 50kWh per day, so about half my electricity comes from solar. On-peak demand during summer is 2-8PM,  and we keep it at or below 3kW. We use a Demand Management System from Inergy systems to monitor our dryer, 2 AC units, and water heater. We produce about 6kW from 11-2, then it starts dropping (I have 16 panels facing South and 10 facing West). We generally don't see any issues with the AC units until about 6PM, then our demand manager kills one or both of them. We sometimes move up a couple degrees ni the house, but it's barely noticeable unless you are working out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were playing around with the thermostat this month (May usage) and accidentally hit a demand of 4. Our bill (which closes today) will be $125. I have graphs and historical stuff I can email if you want. Of course it has been a wonderful May, weather-wise, so everyone's bills are going to look great compared to last year.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy financial models didn't justify the powerwall (I didn't look at Lead/Acid pricing). If Powerwall 3 goes to 26kWh at $7000 it makes a ton of sense. You could just do powerwall and no solar with SRPs E27 price plan and save a ton. Heck, we went to the E27 price plan BEFORE my solar was installed and saved a bunch of money by managing demand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cost (DIY) was $10,000 after rebates/incentives. I am saving about 55% on my electric bill. DIY was hard, but now that I have done it once, I could bang out my next house quickly.  I could do it a little cheaper, I used premium roof mounts and ran all conduit in the attic (I have 4 roof locations, so a lot of conduit!).",

So we climbed a couple of the tallest trees and topped them down to make a nice stable based and then attached a pole mount system to the top of the tree with the panels mounted on that where they would get direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day and that was enough to recharge his batteries.\n\nWhere there is a will there is a way!",

"comment": "Just because you get a \"quote\" doesn't mean that is all you can deduct. All that matters is what is enforceable by the IRS. What matters is your paid invoice that will be used as evidence for your costs. Every solar installer purposely does not itemize the financing fee... so that it CAN be included on your taxes. They probably SHOULDN'T do this, but the IRS/Federal government hasn't stopped them, so it's allowed. Now, if your invoice says \"finance charge\" ... no that is not deductible.",

"comment": "This is great!  And kind of confirms my assumption that the batteries should maybe be in reach of where the solar lines are coming in.\n\nTo address something about my installer: he's a great guy, seems extremely knowledgeable, has been doing this for years, and I'm getting a great price. The reason I'm posting here first and not just picking apart his plan with direct questions to him is that I just want to be prepared, and I don't want to waste his time.\n\nIf you'll bear with me, I'll provide some added detail/reasoning on the whole system. And hopefully you can elaborate on your recommendations :D\n\nI'm in BC, Canada. BC Hydro has standard Net Metering. Any excess generated will count as a credit - all reconciled at the end of one year. They won't credit more than consumed, and won't roll credit over into the next year. This system basically wipes out my bill, except for the $15 connect fee on each meter.  BC Hydro does have something called \"Adds To Metering\", which will allow you to combine two net metering bills, but not in the case of a legal suite with a civic address, which is my case. Dumb & useless.\n\nThe home is a primary unit + full suite (decked out like a condo). Two 200A lines feed the two side-by-side panels, but as mentioned the panels have mixed usage between units. We set it up as two lines because a single 400A line at the time would have required an alternate route at the street, resulting in having to get an \"overhead trespass\" permission/avadavat from the neighbor, or some junk.  Plus, it saved about $5k on the cabinet at the time.\n\nI do plan on upgrading the meter base in the future (it might be required, for compliancy). Already had it verified as a possibility and quoted ($14k CAD). I'll come back to this in a sec.\n\nThe home is a full ICF envelope. The garage is heated and attached - it has a gym off it so I kept the trim and amenities the same as the rest of the interior. While the mechanical room is adjacent to the garage, it's also separated by the same 14\" ICF wall. \n\nThe solar is a ground mount/rack. I have a single-slope roof that slopes downward north, so not ideal for solar. Nor does it have enough roof space.  But I do have a perfectly south-facing slope in the back half of the property. I wanted to generate 26000kWH per year to cover the combined usage of both meters.  I have very detailed consumption data (using Eagle-200 monitoring bridges) for the last couple years, and with just a couple tiny changes across the two panels, I can get consumption to nearly 50/50 on each electrical panel/meter. It's an all-electric house, including on-demand hot water, 3 EV chargers, heat pump with backup coils - as the big consumption items.\n\nI opted to split the array 50/50 (so, 40A to each meter) so that I wouldn't have to upgrade either panel, since the current bus wouldn't support anything higher than the added 48A, if I'm remembering correctly.  And there was no point in trying to split consumption 60/40, and upgrading one panel.\n\nThe 22kW system lines will run down to the garage, punch through one ICF western wall, then run across the ceiling and then punch through the next ICF wall into the mechanical room on the eastern side. The two lines will run into the two panels.\n\nTHEN, on a future date, 'phase 2' will consist of: upgrading the meter base, adding a splitter below the two panels - that will resolve the compliancy issues, and get me one meter. This is where I have a hard time imagining the optional future batteries.\n\nI had figured it would be best to have the solar go to the controller first (maybe?) which would be at or near the batteries. I had assumed DC-to-DC would be most efficient, but if the HoyMiles microinverters are outside, I'm guessing the power coming in is AC... making the whole thing a moot point, yea?\n\nI don't have any extra room for batteries in the tiny mechanical room. Plus, for aesthetics, I'd want to mount the batteries in the garage. So, since I'm using microinverters anyway, does it even matter what I do with the solar line right now?  Will the batteries simply (and only) connect to a controller, then bridge, then the panel?  How does the bridge come into play with the solar already connected?\n\nThese are definitely questions I plan on asking the installer next week. But I just wanted some opinions before I get into it with them.",

You mention Israel, and yes there are extremely generous incentives currently for what is called a Feed In Tariff (FIT) or production credit of 0.12 EUR per kWh for a period of 25 years. However it’s limited to rooftop systems and 100kW size and below. Some description is [here](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/10/weekend-read-poes-gloomy-outlook/).  This scheme was similar to what Germany offered back when PV panels were $5/W but now global module prices are like $0.5/W so this is a really lucrative incentive if you can get it.",

Imagine going to a dealership to buy a car, and whoever greets you decides how many you'll pay for the car.\n\nSunrun uses panels and equipment offered by every other solar company. Their workmanship warranty is less than most other solar companies. They train their salesmen to lie about being sent by the utility company to \"qualify houses to go solar.\" Their installers are full of guys trying to undercut/steal the job for themselves.\n\nWhy in the world would anyone go with Sunrun?",

"comment": "Okay, that makes a ton more sense. So in this case Trinity is your installer Trinity has to set up everything when it comes to your design plans your engineering permitting as well as submitting all of that to sunova because with a PPA suNova is going to be the owner of it so suNova gets to look over everything submitted and make sure that they're happy with everything as well. That's slightly can extend the timeline but the vast majority of it at this point until PTO is controlled by Trinity taking care of everything. Once it's installed then sunnova takes over completely as the owner of the system unless you decide to buy out the PPA at some point.\n\nI'm not trying to say that this is definitely one company's fault or another company's fault, just giving you info on who normally run the show the most part in a different portion of the project timeline. They're a great number of posts here come out for outcomes from either sunrun or Trinity so neither were big surprises.",

I waited two weeks and sent them another remove by date with a notice that I will removing them after and leaving them by the road for them to collect. never heard back and the date came and went. a month later I sent an email saying I have removed the panels and will placing them at the end of the drive way for them to collect.

As for wind, there was a one-week period last winter when an area of Western Canada a thousand kilometers across had no wind for the entire week.\n\nThere are a *lot* of people who haul RV trailers around in the summer going to lakes or national parks.

"comment": "The definition of what is and is not vegan has some gray area.  If you push far enough, you'll find harm to animals in almost anything you buy.  Mechanized crop harvesting kills countless field animals.  Tallow rendered from animal fats can show up in everything from wax paper to tires.  Stearic acid, also often rendered from animal fats, has a wide range of uses.  It simply isn't possible to be perfectly, 100% vegan in contemporary American society.  We do the best that we can, but we should be under no delusions that we're living lives entirely free of animal products.  It's all a matter of where we choose to draw the line of what we will and won't consume, and I think bone char filtered white sugar is one of those products that is knowingly consumed by many good vegans.  With this in mind it is perhaps worth writing a letter to the store encouraging them to be more specific with their labeling, but I also don't necessarily think that the presence of bone char filtered sugar makes the cake clearly un-vegan.",

Properly, that would be a ovo-lacto-vegetarian.\n\nA vegan goes beyond diet and abstains from animal products wherever possible.  Clothes, shoes, makeup, hair products.  But colloquially vegan gets used to mean someone who doesn't EAT animal products.

"comment": "From context, I can only reasonably assume that you agree with me when I say it's a prescriptive attitude -- whether that's appropriate, or for the best, is basically the same argument as you could witness between people of different religions, concerning how they should proselytize. You could say I take the classically buddhist attitude, not because I am a buddhist, but because non judgement is considerably more beneficial (or at least, less outright counterproductive).\n\nIn the long run, an overt attitude of moral superiority makes vegans look self-righteous for the same reason that Christians look self-righteous when they hand out bibles and tell you you're a sinner. Does it endear you to Christianity when they do that? Also, if you need to judge others what does it say about your motives for being a vegan? Your sense of moral superiority will definitely make you feel good about yourself and better than others but that's it's primary purpose - that same attitude of superiority will alienate others and be counterproductive to the propgation of your beliefs.",

"comment": "&gt;you could make the same argument about child rearing. do you think the very institution of parenthood should be abolished as they keep children in captivity?\n\nDo you believe that children are the property of their parents? Certainly that has been the case in some times and places, but that is not how they are seen legally in the U.S. and similar countries. There is a big distinction between being the guardian of someone and being their owner. And if someone truly does believe that their children are their property and has kids in order to exploit them, then yes, perhaps we should question whether they should have children at all. \n\n&gt; this woman i know views these chickens as her children. she makes them as happy as she possibly can.\n\nNo matter how happy she may say she makes them, they should not have been hers to begin with. If she truly views them as her children, then she, again, has some very messed up views of parenting. Do you think it's mentally healthy for someone to keep their children captive and dependent on them so that they can eat/drink their secretions? \n\n&gt;what problem could I possibly have with eating those eggs?\n\nSince you say you're a vegan, the problem you should have with them is one of being complicit with animal exploitation -- the antithesis of veganism. \n\n&gt; the difference with slavery is that those slaves were being treated as beings of lesser intelligence when they weren't. the things with bees is that they actually are less intelligent than us. they aren't even in a position where they can comprehend the fact that honey was stolen from them while they were asleep.\n\nSo you think whether slavery is right or wrong comes down to how intelligent someone is? Is it o.k. to enslave a mentally handicapped person? What if they don't know they are being stolen from? Is it o.k. to steal from them? Was/is human slavery only wrong when owners underestimated their slaves' intelligence? Many slave owners knew their slaves were intelligent. Human slaves have been used for thousands of years for many highly skilled tasks. Many were bought precisely because the owner prized their intelligence -- and that doesn't make it one bit better.\n\nBees, in fact, are much more intelligent than most people give them credit for, but whether they are as smart as dogs or humans or slugs makes no difference in whether it is alright for us to exploit them. Veganism does not rank animals in terms of intelligence. \n\n&gt; they are living the best life a bee could live.\n\nA convenient but unprovable statement. The point is that it is not up for us to decide how bees should live. \n\n&gt;and by the way exactly how captive could you keep a bee? we could keep them safe and warm in a beekeeping facility where we only take an amount of honey that doesn't disrupt the bees lifestyle and reproduction. or we could let them free and they will put in all the effort to build a new hive on the other side of some arbitrary fence before getting attacked by a bear for their trouble.\n\nPlease read the link I provided you before. Bees are kept captive by various methods, some of which are described there. There is plenty elsewhere online on managing beehives, as well. Why is it worse for the bees to get attacked by a bear than it is for us to attack them? Their food is stolen and their lives risked, either way. At least the bear has fewer options for calories. And yes, stealing their honey does impact them. They don't store it for nothing. \n\n&gt;i don't eat store bought eggs because i know that a corporation will not care about the chickens wellbeing and will force it into terrible circumstances in order to save money. contrary to this beekeepers well being depends on the well being of the bees. if the bees are killed they lose money. if the bees are harmed they lose money. their business depends on the bees being allowed to do what they want to do. \n\nBeekeepers are no different. They often kill off most of a hive to save themselves money. They can quickly repopulate the bees and it's often cheaper than feeding them through the winter (after they steal their preferred food that they worked so long and hard for). Beekeepers care no more altruistic in their motives than chicken farmers. Both will do what it takes to stay profitable and that absolutely does include harming the animals, their property. \n\n&gt;and that's all a bee cares about: its function. they are very basic life forms (at least in terms of mental complexity) and don't have the kinds of desires that mammals like chickens have so as long as they are alive and doing what they want to do then they are essentially as happy as they can be. that's as good as it gets people.\n\nFor someone who seems to know an appalling little about bees and the conditions they are kept in, you seem awfully confident that you know exactly what bees want and how they think. When did you acquire this psychic ability to commune with bees? What are your methods of surveying them? Do you find that bee attitudes vary across state lines? Or are you just telling us all the convenient lies you tell yourself hoping that we will be just as gullible?",

Giving an animal food, shelter, and a happy family is not against veganism.  \n  \nIn the case of cats, I agree with you.  Cats \"only\" provide companionship and love, which in and of itself is enough, as they become a loved part of our family.  I have several cats, and dogs, too.  I love animals.  They are part of my family.  In the case of dogs, they provide security and protection in addition to the above.  I agree that it's not exploitation.  But what does a goat do?  They are useful for clearing fields, and as a result, they produce milk.  I fail to see how this is considered \"exploitation\".  \n  \n&gt;There is no need to ride horses.  \n  \nPerhaps not today, but humans have been in a symbiotic relationship with horses for many thousands of years.  Horses can be ridden in a way that it's not harmful or exploitative to the horse in any way whatsoever.  They are more than strong/sturdy enough to support the weight of a person, and then some.  It's good exercise for them and they don't mind.  A lot of horses enjoy being ridden.",

After talking about the supposed connections between the oppression of women and animals in some detail, the author goes on to chide those who would compare. . . the oppression of women and animals,  quoting an activist who criticizes those who 'use animal rights claims on our behalf' as having insufficient concern for the safety of women. \n\nThis reads like something written by a college sophomore who just discovered socialism,  feminism,  and veganism,  but is unable to discern the internal contradictions in their argument. \n\nMods,  this blog spams daily.  Can we do something about it?",

And they would ask me, when they know I'm vegan b/c I've explained it to them many times, \"Hey you want some of this quesidilla?\" And I would politely reply \"No thanks. Pls go ahead.\" And when I just don't feel like getting into a big convo about nutrition outside of work and someone offers me food, I tell them why I'm vegan and that I already ate a big meal earlier and slink away smoothy out of the area.",

It's a way of life in that I try to stay away from all animal products including leather, but I am also only loosely vegan compared to many people here, and don't mind eating dairy products over holidays or once in a while. I find that it easier to commit long term to a life with almost no animal products than one with absolutely none.\n\n2. I would never feel emotionally damaged for accidentally eating something non-vegan. No one and nothing is being damaged by me accidentally taking a bite of cheese and there's nothing I can do about it, so why get upset?",

It needs to start being about the animals.  We need to speak for them with the conviction and moral authority that the animals would, were they capable of doing so.

"comment": "You bring up an interesting point about the arguable vivisection of animals with obesity studies.  I think the key difference in this instance is that by buying sugar you are not supporting these studies.  By buying splenda, you're paying for the product which produces a demand in that market.  Myself personally, I do not buy things unless they have been marked cruelty free.  However, I do recognize that there is a grey area and that it's close to impossible to live 100% vegan.  With splenda, it just seems pretty obvious how much death and suffering went into it, so I really don't understand how UV can rationalize it when she ultimately wants to cause as little animal suffering as possible.",

It works really well for me, because I get these cravings several times a day - during December I had a total of 93 cheat hours, for instance, but I don't have to feel guilty cause I was a vegan every day, except for the 3 times a day I cheated.",

The truth is, being a vegan today will do little for animal rights as a whole, but I cannot continue to support the meat/dairy/egg industry.

Here's some examples: peas + rice + beans+ Avo, spinach + pasta + tofu + cashews, pumpkin + quinoa + nutritional yeast + pine nuts. \nThe combinations are endless and it makes meals so easy.

She is a very emotional person and I believe she knows that killing animals is wrong (only did chickens for meat 1 year because it was too sad to see), which is why she started to raise her own animals because she didn't like factory farming. Now they have to do it because they think they owe it to their clients. It's been impossible to have any sort of conversation about veganism because she will just shut down and get very mad and defensive. My dad is always working because those animals need to eat every day and he owns his own seperate steel business, it also seems like she makes sure they are always too busy for any fun (no vacations in 6+ years).\n\nBoth my sister (vegan) and brother have stopped talking to both of them. I maintain a \"relationship\" because she buys me alot of food and since I live in my van I need a permanent address and a place to store some things. I pretty much just pickup some food (Kale, spinach, tempeh, oatmeal) every other week, couple kisses and small talk and it seems to satisfy them and I get free food, not the worst deal.\n\nProbably not the healthiest relationship, but to each their own.\n\nCheers!",

You ask why people who went vegan because of morality why they changed. It's not going to be because they miss seaw*rld or because they wanted a belt.\n\nIf you wanted to actually garner a discussion I feel it should have been a broader, more sincere question to former vegans in general.\n\nYou also say\n\n&gt; you previously made the moral choice to stop supporting *all* forms of animal cruelty\n\nSo if someone cannot be vegan they then fall into this bucket since they started supporting some animal cruelty.\n\nThis is a community that would never advise someone to decline life saving anti-venom. We should try not to paint picture with such a broad brush of the people who cannot avoid *all* animal cruelty. Or assume they don't care about animal cruelty.",

You can also get \"high strength\" vitamins that contain more, but I wouldn't recommend those unless you talk to a nutritionist about it.\n\n\nFortified milks and foods also include B12. \n\n\nNutritional yeast does have B12 - make sure to check the packaging to see how much. It will not make you fat I have no idea where the person who told you that got that from. You will add it to sauces, soups, pasta, etc. If you don't like the taste or don't cook stuff to add it to then look into vitamins or B12 mouth sprays.\n\n\nIn general, you only want nutritional advice from someone who is qualified. If you have concerns about your health and do not see improvement after adding more B12, then go to a doctor. \n\n\nEdit: Important note. B12 deficiencies usually take years to develop - if this has all happened very quickly then this isn't just because you went vegan. Some people struggle naturally to absorb more B12 which is why I recommend a vitamin for everybody. Again, I am not qualified in anyway.",

"comment": "If you'll humor me, I'd like to turn this question back around on you. And I'd like you to answer my question with your gut instinct, your visceral momentary response to my question fueled mostly by emotion. After listening to your friend explain veganism, do you feel that he was accusing you of being morally inferior, or that he was claiming to be morally superior? Now, I'd like for you to put aside that emotional answer to my question. And answer it again, but this time with your intellectual consideration of it. Is your logical response to that question the same as your emotional response to it? If there is a difference between your two answers, I think it would do you well to seriously reflect on why that may be.\n\nIt's not at all uncommon, when I engage in online debates with meat eaters, for them to claim I think of myself as \"morally superior.\" Even when I'm just stating objective facts about the animal agriculture industry. And I find that fascinating. It's fascinating that when I state simple facts supporting my case, they interpret that as an attack on their moral character. Almost like, on some unconscious level, they realize that the facts of this subject paint a pretty damning picture of who's morally in the right. But instead of accepting that they may be wrong on this subject, they lash out at the vegans.\n\nAll that said, I will answer your question. I don't think that all meat eaters are inherently amoral people, or even less moral than vegans. I think many of them are just ignorant about the true atrocities of the animal agriculture industry. However, if someone has actually taken the time to research what happens in slaughterhouses, and they continue to eat meat despite being well aware of its consequences, then yes. I do think they're morally inferior. But I would never state that so bluntly to meat eaters less open minded than you.",

The washing up certainly isn't 'fun'.\n\nDo I appreciate 'good food'? Of course, who wouldn't but at the same time I rarely go out of my way to obtain such over something that might keep me going.\n\nWe aren't religious, don't have young kids so don't do xmas (environmental reasons and simply CBA). So 'xmas dinner' for us (made by me) could easily be whatever needs using up. In fact, I bought some extra vegan stuff because it was out for veganurary that I though I might put a bit of effort into doing over the period but still haven't.\n\nBut for me this is logically consistent. I was never suckered into 'fashion', wasn't suckered into smoking, or religion (although my parents tried), wasn't suckered into going to Spain for my holidays every year, or being bothered about what car I was driving.\n\nI was suckered into eating animals though and bitterly regret it taking me so long to realise it. ;-(\n\nAs a kid I dreamt of a 'Space food pill' that would fulfil my dietary needs and I could swallow and go ... and that hasn't really changed. I want to put as much effort into inputting it as I do getting rid of it and not many societies also make that a social event (well, not since the Romans possibly)? ;-)\n\nBut as a species we often take everything further than is designed / needed. Not only our need for sustenance being mutated into a big and social / religious important /  thing to \\*racing\\* everything that moves (racing cars rather than just using them for transport) and demanding levels of detail and control in our lives that costs the planet.\n\nLike being able to set the temperatures differently on different sides \\*inside\\* a car!\n\nSome may well read the above and consider me to be neurodivergent and I may well be, that or always confident enough to not care how others (I didn't know or respect) judged me?",

"comment": "Gerson therapy is indeed unproven and multiple people have died choosing to forgo chemotherapy and/or surgery and instead trying to just use Gerson therapy.  \n\nIMO spreading info that promotes it as a \"cure\" to people isn't just stupid, it's unethical.  If someone's pet got cancer, we wouldn't encourage them to just feed the pet certain foods and give them enemas multiple times a day and ignore the vets advice or recommended treatment.  We would be like fuck, there's no proof that will heal your pet, it's animal abuse, you'll kill it *and* make its quality of life absolute garbage in the time leading to its death.  But somehow suggesting this same shit course of action to people gets a pass.  It's ridiculous.\n\nPeople can consent to things, but it needs to be informed consent.  One cannot consent to a procedure they don't fully understand.  The danger of spreading bullshit like Gregor therapy is that they *don't* fully understand, *but they think they do.*  People are led to think through unproven pseudoscience that these therapies will cure them, not require them to go through chemo, not require surgery, make them even healthier, and better their chances.  The fact is *none of that is proven.*\n\nWe *can* ethically promote what has been proven as true.  Namely, a plant based diet has proven effective for helping prevent cancer and many other diseases.  A plant based diet statistically is likely to improve how long you live.  A plant based diet paired with chemotherapy has shown significant promise in treating cancer and appears to be better than chemotherapy alone.  A plant based diet is good for your immune system.  There are so many *facts* we don't need to exaggerate or embellish the truth, to do so is to take advantage of people in a very vulnerable place.  \n\nIf someone says they are refusing all of a doctors recommendations to pursue instead healing through veganism, they should be aware in no uncertain terms that they are essentially experimenting with their health at the risk of their own life, and if they choose to add chemotherapy later the cancer may have spread and made it far too late for any hope of remission regardless of diet or medical intervention.\n\nSorry for the rant but this thread is insane.  \n\nTLDR: Gerson therapy has killed people and is unproven.",

"comment": "I’m torn between not giving a flying f*ck about what people do, and trying to change their minds. In my experience, people are going to do what they want no matter what you expose them to. They have to be ready, it doesn’t matter what anyone says. They have to want to change. And I never wanted to try and change till I saw the abuse. So that’s the only way I know how to spread the word. I went vegan within a couple weeks of seeing the kinds of things I shared on the vegetarian page. I never considered vegetarianism as a middle ground because I refused to wait one second more and allow one more animal to suffer. Those are the kinds of people I’m trying to reach out to. Not the wishy washy ones that just can’t imagine having to give up cheese.",
