Right now, though, I suppose there is a need.  \n\nGoogle will give you the vertical profile of any route.  From there it's just a matter of correctly characterizing the typical vehicle's power and regen versus incline at speed.  I could patch something together.  \n\nI realize in my own long trip calculations that undulating terrain throws in a lot of uncertainty and keeps me from being a hypermiling genius and letting me pull into every station with exactly the energy I expect to have left.  So, I could try to fix this problem, and be a total EV road trip badass.  \n\nOr I could just put some extra in my calculations so that I don't end up on the side of the road, even with the terrain uncertainty.  That's what I mean when I say it won't even matter when all road trip EVs are 150 miles or more--at that point, range will be like gas car range, and more fat will go into drivers' calculations, just like gas cars allow you lots of cushion today.  Undulating terrain effects a gas car's range, too.  But because the overall range (and availability of stations) is greater, we don't think about.  (..any more.

Mostly from *FRACKING*. So hydrogen does not solve environment issues (unless you think fracking is good for environment), and nobody will produce hydrogen on large scale with electrolysis while cheaper alternative is available.\n\nAs for getting hydrogen from water, for hydrogen you have to put in 100kWh of energy to get 23kWh to move the car. In EV, for 100kWh, you get 70kWh to move the car. So hydrogen station creating hydrogen on site will use so much electricity that it could charge 3-4 times more electric vehicles. For example, electricity used to fill up 1000 fuel cell vehicles for 300 miles, could fill up 3000 electric vehicles for the same mileage.\n\n1$ per gallon? No, price is 50$ for 300 miles. That is more expensive than a petrol car, and this is with 'cheap' hydrogen that is coming from fossil fuels, it can only get more expensive.\n\nWho loves hydrogen? Big oil companies, because they produce it from fossil fuels, and fuel cell cars would let them keep their monopoly.\n\nYou can say, we will put solar panels, wind turbine or any other renewable and make hydrogen that way for 'free', but that also does not make sense, because with the same solar panels or wind turbines you can support 3-4 times more electric than hydrogen vehicles.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"frustrated but still pro"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.053640413718909485,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08798995117346446,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23446854318367766,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21365452460052126,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1601265152074869,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.007165996668239434,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10918395262948859,"ev_1":-0.16360701026725386,"ev_2":-0.2625045005789544,"ev_3":-0.10550401119880917,"ev_4":-0.23751783125529377,"ev_5":-0.04045664193108678,"ev_6":-0.15471332866329993,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.028760690781837184},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I don't expect it to be common for quite some time(my tech company has zero electric chargers, if they installed level 2 chargers with free charging they would quickly become overwhelmed.) My company doesn't want to install chargers because that would just incentive vehicle who use expensive parking spaces. Bike and bus commuting does a lot more to save resources for my company &amp; the planet.\n\nRight now electric companies make a lot of money by charging businesses more for power generated during the day. I don't expect this to change quickly even if daytime wholesale prices drop. \n\n120V charging which adds just a few miles per hour is easier/cheaper to implement and the amount of juice provided is small which makes giving it away as an employee perk the most painless option for businesses.\n\nLevel 2 charging at 10+kW will become the norm for most electric vehicles and businesses will be reluctant to pay for equipment/power for such systems so this will mostly be outsourced to companies like blink/chargepoint who will charge a time+kWh fee which will limit widespread adoption.\n\nIt is going to take a long time to shift the electricity pricing structure, with solar/wind installations and decommissioning of older power plants. By that time we will have self driving cars that people use as ride sharing commuter vehicles. Order a ride to work, step out your front door and a vehicle will be there in 5 minutes and cost about as much as a bus ride does today. It may pickup or drop off other passengers traveling on the same route which will increase vehicle ridership and ease congestion, you won't have to worry about car payments, fuel, insurance, parking. These vehicles will use automated charging locations installed throughout the city. We can reduce the amount of land used for parking in cities and develop that property or convert it to greenspace.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3035023255631674,"1.1.1_stance":-0.049010517463898395,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2356718142270411,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21521025665916332,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10439766427771247,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29403381021247066,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3429128601759051,"ev_1":-0.17385864497529538,"ev_2":-0.01695095227478305,"ev_3":-0.030879114914569072,"ev_4":-0.08729286766417015,"ev_5":-0.008734769052049765,"ev_6":-0.004335922574680258},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Even if the goal was to trash EVs, I think I could have done a better job at it.\n\nThe article takes another swing at the old \"EVs aren't really better for the environment\" meme.  This from the Wall Street Journal, which hasn't exactly been a leading champion of environmental causes!  This time the argument is a little more sophisticated, though. . .  Instead of blaming all EVs, now they're pointing an accusing finger at the bigger-and-faster EVs that are proving popular with car buyers.  If only people would buy tiny, penny-pinching, super-green EVs, then they would be good for the environment.  In other words, WSJ is begging for exactly the sort of cars that kept getting no traction before Tesla came along and showed the world that EVs could be appealing (big and fast and long-range).\n\nAnd you know, if the industry was, in fact, producing a lot of those EV econo-boxes, the WSJ would be right there railing against the bad ol gummint forcing everyone to drive punishment cars!\n\nBut it's not just \"these EVs are bad for the environment\".  It's also hitting the themes of \"EVs are too expensive\" and \"government policies promoting EVs are wrong-headed\".  But these are different issues and don't always dovetail together nicely.\n\nEVs are, in fact, expensive.  I mean, all cars are expensive right now, but getting into an EV is particularly tough.  It takes time, but this is exactly the sort of problem that our free market economic and industrial system solves so well.  You'd think the WSJ, of all possible sources, would show more faith in this dynamic.  Many companies are working hard and investing vast sums to scale up production and cost-reduce the product.\n\nAnd as for government policies being messed up. . .  Yes.  Yes, they are.  IMHO the whole history of mandates and incentives and credit trading systems, worldwide, has been one failure after another.  That still leaves the question of whether car companies would have ever moved to EVs without that pressure.  I'd argue Tesla has done more to transform the industry than all those government programs put together.  Tesla has also transformed those government programs, since it provided a counter-example for all those lobbyists crying that \"We just can't do it!\"   If anything, the regs may save legacy car makers from simply being crushed by Tesla and other startups, forcing them (however grudgingly) to compete in EVs instead of dying on the ICE hill.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1175661397476991,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07047881588930523,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20444333407549828,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26708455652732865,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.37647753718605137,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25149558166878094,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1728833410112808,"ev_1":-0.12506972853129525,"ev_2":-0.05076707773453867,"ev_3":-0.00967664255828519,"ev_4":-0.006897621467942372,"ev_5":-0.0024007321383881695,"ev_6":-0.009521252923150314},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Lots of people who aren't scientists like to claim otherwise, as this subreddit frequently demonstrates, but arguments against climate change are frankly laughable to scientists. How do I know this? Most of my family members are scientists, several of them climate scientists. Most of my family friends are climate scientists. I, (though not a climate scientist myself), work with climate scientists every day. When climate scientists see the sorts of arguments than deniers trumpet, they just kind of laugh and sigh. It's the equivalent of someone going to an oncologist and saying \"but Dr., there's no way I have terminal cancer because my temperature is normal,\" or taking your car to a mechanic and saying \"dude I don't need a new engine, all the interior lights work.\" So argue climate change if you will, but there's simply not much more to be said there.\n\nSo that's the first point: burning fossil fuels emit CO2 which is largest driver of the current greatest threat to humans. But even if we were to ignore that...\n\n- Fossil Fuels are a finite resource. To be sure, there's probably still a lot left, but the problem is that it's getting harder and more expensive to extract it. Back in the day (1900-1970s), it was pretty cheap and easy to extract huge quantities of oil, which meant that regardless of the price, oil companies were probably making a profit and everything was fine and good. Now we have to resort to more expensive options like fracking and offshore drilling to get our oil. These processes are very expensive, often dangerous, and as those oil deposits become scarce, we'll have to resort to even more expensive options. Most of the technological advances in oil extraction have been made to extract oil in trickier, more expensive ways. \n\n- By contrast, the technological advances in solar have been to make solar panels cheaper and more efficient. Same goes with wind. It's never going to be more expensive or difficult to utilize solar or wind because they are steady, infinite (for several million years at least) resources. So while oil gets more and more expensive to extract, solar and wind get cheaper and cheaper. Solar panels are 100 times cheaper today than they were in the late 90s. That's crazy. My neighbors have a pretty big solar array that they paid 8k for in 2003. Just last year, they broke even. Average savings for today's homeowners, however, is about $20,000 over 20 years. In Hawaii it's $60,000. That's amazing. \n\n- Also take into account the fact that every stage of the oil extraction, refining, and burning process is fairly dangerous and very messy. You need highly trained people working basically every stage, and a ton of maintenance. Solar just requires manufacturing and installation. Wind requires a degree of maintenance, but not nearly to the extant that oil does. \n\n- Then there are the non-climate environmental factors. There's a long history of negative, sometimes fatal impacts of oil/coal plants/refineries on nearby populations (of people as well as animals). They emit harmful gasses, harmful byproducts, harmful waste etc etc. And that isn't even mentioning oil spills. The only thing solar panels and wind turbines emit is electricity.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006436358516225482,"1.1.1_stance":-0.019323115314667422,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1927569724268375,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19492204444196118,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07621356503290144,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.024401864735409617,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12618010595906526,"solar_1":-0.12622603258155699,"solar_2":-0.19541030856098587,"solar_3":-0.06760624945277509,"solar_4":-0.05128841274770057,"solar_5":-0.08466830280667637,"solar_6":-0.004878534952392026,"solar_7":-0.015698156489330966,"solar_8":-0.014293637968269953,"solar_9":-0.09848035082298641,"solar_10":-0.18232063464952475},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

My fees are 3-4x yours, so with your usage I'd be spending about $600 per month! \n\nIn any case I think it makes sense to look at usage patterns first to reduce consumption than to make the consumption renewable. Once you do that, you won't need as many panels, either. Consider that reducing consumption can simply mean doing exactly the same but more efficiently. e.g. installing more efficient light bulbs, a more efficient washer, or insulating your home. (which won't help much for electric but improves the gas bill). \n\nFor example, if you have an old home where the bulbs haven't been changed in a long time, you might be way overusing. Traditional bulbs gave you about 15 lumens per watt. (with lumens being the amount of actual light you'd get from the bulb when it's on). Now we have average LEDs which are in the 100 range, and a top rate of 300 was recently broken (not commercialised yet, but it exists) and it was more than 300 lumens per watt. So even a 150 lumens per watt means that you're using 10% of the electricity for exactly the same amount of light. And if your electricity bill is 25% lighting, then just changing your lightbulbs can save you about $40 per month, or close to $500 per year. Given lifetimes of LEDs at more than 10 years now, you're talking about a $5k saving from switching bulbs.\n\nNow of course that's a best case scenario, but my point is that dropping $25k on solar panels is a great idea so that in 8 years from now you can break even, but there's a lot of low-hanging fruit you can do instead like the one I mentioned above.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.03137126564979553,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24626977189585714,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22995211957345396,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21954327510344818,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18374972585546787,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16121061817247156,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2730840221045554,"solar_1":-0.17650717778605501,"solar_2":-0.09041820965941169,"solar_3":-0.163068572182965,"solar_4":-0.1381495593038077,"solar_5":-0.015581886959504724,"solar_6":-0.014383316454768647,"solar_7":-0.01307987914090821,"solar_8":-0.04138476392654411,"solar_9":-0.030674170147037216,"solar_10":-0.16393628327432452},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

These ideas apply equally to all countries. For example, to keep the discussion away from emotion, I am not saying climate change is only man-made; it can be both natural as well as man-made; I don’t want to debate this issue. However, assuming CO2 emission need to be minimized, the fuel type used for the energy source needs to be considered. So keeping the discussions to energy sources that have the lease impact, I suggest looking at the “life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources” and make some deductions for how best to shape an energy policy: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources Life-cycle \n\ntakes into account the construction to operation and waste management; coal or solar panels use material that must be mined using machines that generate CO2, while hydroelectric use machines to make the dam and/or make and place concrete.\n\nSources of energy such as Wind and Solar PV have the least CO2 emissions but are not reliable for on-demand use. If not on-demand, the excess energy not used must be stored or “destroyed” by sending to ground. Wind and sunlight are in abundance and free in some areas, however they need land, a source of wind or sunlight which in not usually near site of use, and the generation is not on-demand reliable. Fore example, windmills have a small range of wind speed that can be utilized.  Not fast enough and there is insufficient power to turn the blades; too much speed causes the windmill to shut down to prevent cratistopic damage due to excessive blade tip speed. There is also the daily cycle of wind/no wind due to solar heating differentials.  Solar has the problem of clouds or overcast, periods of darkness, and solar angle due to season changes of sun angle position due to tilt of earth and latitude position. Solar panels (as well as windmills to a lesser degree) require minerals like arsenic, bauxite, boron, cadmium, coal (for steel), copper, gallium, indium, molybdenum, phosphate, selenium, silica, tellurium, and titanium. China is the “major” source of most of these, which puts a reliance on a single country. From an energy policy standpoint, this should be avoided. When life-cycle of electronics is taken into account, the overall cradle-to-grave expense is very high due to up-front costs for materials/mining, and costs to recycle waste.\n\nElectric quality is very important.  Known as reactive power, it can be thought of efficiency of the power at the point of use.  Because of the variability of generation, the quality and therefore the efficiency decrease.  Think of electricity in the wire as liquied in a pipe.  As long as the fluid is uniform, the driving force on the liquid (i.e. by a pump) can be applied to achieve a uniform pressure.  If the fluid is not uniform (i.e. foam in the beer), then the pump will cavatate and cause fluxuations in pressure (i.e. flickering on tv’s or surges on computers).  When the site of generation is far away, this fluxuation is exaserbated to a greater extent.  Electric grids require maximum reactance in order to achieve maximum efficiency and reliance.  Typically, a conventional source of power is recuired in the amount of 90% of the installed capacity of solar or wind energy, to offset the reduced reactance. This is a huge duplication of generation, which must be taken into account when calculating life-cycle costs. \n\nThe cost to generate electricity in various countries can be found at:   \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing.\n\nBelgium, with the highest number of windmills has an electric cost of 29.08 cents/kWh.  They must purchase hydroelectric power from Sweden to support the variable wind power.  By contrast, the Cook Islands cost is 34.6 to 50.2 cents/kWh which is mostly generated by diesel generators.  Canada costs which are mostly hydroelctric range from 3.75 to 14.6 cents/kWh. Sweden’s (mostly hydroectric but recently installing windmills), costs are 8.33 cents/kWh.\n\nHydroelectric is a renewable resource that can offer several benefits. It is a source of water for drinking, agriculture and recreation. An important benefit when designed as a pump-storage is that it acts like a giant battery to store energy. Example: Hover Dam continually generates excess energy, which is used off-peak to pump water up hill at various locations. During on-peak demand times, water is used to generate energy but stored in a lower reservoir to be pumped up hill during the off-peak hours using Hover Dam power. Pro: Water source for drinking/recreation, energy source, can be used a “battery” to store other sources of energy such as wind and solar, and provides excellent quality of electricity for the grid from remote locations. Con: Needs land and source of run-off most seasons.\n\nCarbon fuels efficiency is measured by how much CO2 is emitted per unit weight. The amount of carbon in a molecule and the type of bonds determine the energy released (measured as energy density) and the amount of CO2 formed when burned. Natural gas is best as it creates only one CO2 molecule, while coal generates multiple CO2 molecules with some increase in energy output. Based on energy density and CO2 emission, NG is best followed by oil, then coal, which is worst for CO2 emission due to long carbon chain molicule. Pro: Generates high energy output when burned, relatively cheap, currently abundant, and transportable with vast infrastructure in-place. Con: Concentrated in few countries, must be transported to point of use, large source of CO2 emissions (electric generation, transportation, industry), must be refined for specific use, infrastructure costly to construct/maintain, environmental impacts caused by spills etc.\n\nNuclear is in a class all by itself. It can generate huge amounts of energy with relatively no CO2 emissions. Pro: Clean, reliable, huge energy density, very low CO2 emission for the large amount of energy generated. Con: Construction, operational costs high, potential environmental high (partially mitigated by new designs and operations), high “fear factor”, and on-going long-term storage issues with waste materials.\nFor an environmentally friendly energy policy, the source of energy (based on above) should be prioritized as follows (first being best): Hydroelectric (with pump-storage), wind, solar, geothermal (where available), nuclear, natural gas, fuel cells, diesel, heavy oil, and then coal. If nuclear is not an option due to political reasons, then use natural gas. Natural gas can be used throughout the infrastructure (cars and transportation, home, industry as well as generation plants) and would require some expansion to accommodate transportation by replacing gasoline. Note: gasoline engines are 25% efficient; coal generation plants 33%, and electric cars are 50% to 80%. To run an electric car it must be charged so overall efficiency is 33% times 50% to 80% giving effective efficiency of 16% to 26% which is close to gasoline with CO2 still being emitted at the source of power generation. Life-cycle waste from disposal of electronics and batteries from electric cars can be higher than traditional cars.\n\nAnother thought for discussion: Not-In-My-Backyard Tax. If a natural resource in a given location is not utilized (example water, geothermal, methane from landfill), and needs to be imported (i.e. power generated in another location), there should be an importation tax due to the burden being placed on others. If a resource is to be utilized by others in a way that is different than those owning/controlling the resource, than compensation should be paid to the owners.\n\nAn example would be owners of water rights wanting to build a hydroelectric plant to provide local residents with drinking water and pay for the project by producing electricity (or for local use). If river rafting industry (usually from other areas) wants to prevent the owners from construction a dam, thus denying the use of the resource, then the rafting industry should be taxed to compensate the local owners. The resources of our planet are limited and need to be utilized in a way that benefits all. It is time for all countries to develop comprehensive policies that use our resources wisely. Only through policy changes can this be done.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010759885190054774,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15010564031952278,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16973529507716498,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.01481406243207554,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4436147814815152,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19709033841286708,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11220492562036573,"solar_1":-0.16081377603373798,"solar_2":-0.15834162555496167,"solar_3":-0.16032539791922318,"solar_4":-0.10308470323919512,"solar_5":-0.17768114582819786,"solar_6":-0.04563577126440993,"solar_7":-0.048445701004917886,"solar_8":-0.07285793122537143,"solar_9":-0.049667573133667986,"solar_10":-0.16390539576150331},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Out of sight is out of mind. I guess virtue signalling in this way gives clemency to outsourcing both pollution and impacts.\n\n&gt;(Oh, and I talked to an atmospheric physicist, who told me that more CH4 is NOT good -- tracked at source or not -- as we're going to feel the impacts. My point on \"what's not measured is not managed\" (and is thus bad) stands, AFAI'm concerned :)\n\nI've never said more CH4 won't cause more warming. I've said:\n\n- If there is more in the atmosphere than is being measured, then it hasn't resulted in more forcing, because we aren't seeing temperatures rise that quickly. So if there's more than we thought it means that CH4 and/or CO2 are *less* opaque to IR than previously believed.\n\n- CH4 resides in the atmosphere for only a few years. Hence, as CH4 emissions taper off in coming years, we are likely to see a peak then decline in atmospheric CH4. Concomitant with that decline will be a reduction in atmospheric opacity to IR radiation. \n\nNot to overstate it, but policy that subsidizes intermittent energy sources also subsidizes CH4, as it is a requirement to \"firm up\" intermittency.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.26867718746934904,"1.1.1_stance":-0.31446974415842177,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1475396348100004,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3328534931406324,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30793720094617655,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2667646730312015,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10731505896546878,"solar_1":-0.16418657136433504,"solar_2":-0.23682405845211374,"solar_3":-0.05058726525036892,"solar_4":-0.011617915208036574,"solar_5":-0.021284366726994058,"solar_6":-0.028212748446524372,"solar_7":-0.029863927016082908,"solar_8":-0.010048825572079501,"solar_9":-0.003476148192724793,"solar_10":-0.15937879299653895},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

This means that if you fully charge a battery and draw no power from it, the battery will eventually lose all of its charge. Better batteries have a lower rate. As batteries age, their capacity goes down and self-discharge goes up. \n\nIf you put in a massive battery bank, its self-discharge (which occurs 24/7) will outpace your 600w solar array (which charges only when the sun is shining). This means that even though you're charging the batteries, they'll self-discharge faster than the array can keep up. In practical terms, this would be a huge battery bank as self-discharge is a few percent per month typically. Probably not a significant factor in a practical sense, but you can't keep adding batteries forever. \n\nYou need to calculate everything in watt-hours to determine battery and array size. Determine the load of your heat pump and how long you intend to use it. If it draws two kilowatts and you want to run it for ten hours, that's 2 x 10 or 20 KWh. So you'll need at least that much battery. Divide KWh by the voltage of your battery string to get amp-hours. \n\nThen figure how long it will take to charge those batteries from your 600-watt (0.6 KW) array. You'll need to figure on cloudy days, hours of sunlight, etc. The 600-watt figure is under ideal conditions, so probably less in real life. As a total wild guess, figure maybe an average of 300 watts for ten hours in the winter. A lot depends on your specific installation, latitude, temperature, array orientation and angle, etc., etc. So guess 3KWh per day (300 watts x 10 hours). To replace the 20 KWh your heat pump uses you would need 6.7 days of sunlight with zero consumption. \n\nEven then, nothing is perfect. You've got some inefficiencies in the charging circuit, inefficiencies in the inverter, etc. so ten days is more like it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001356759870153231,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06790878017193336,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21091939776555418,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.310805199475453,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22493486897249004,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3202960831230798,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07134645112091675,"solar_1":-0.17624393385873796,"solar_2":-0.01777884784920995,"solar_3":-0.23593038701790114,"solar_4":-0.19358720962440046,"solar_5":-0.0035302592174654515,"solar_6":-0.02763105625490425,"solar_7":-0.02313415161430991,"solar_8":-0.03947128020809032,"solar_9":-0.06840294421320436,"solar_10":-0.18350157672973783},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

A good one will answer all of these questions for you, especially for shading. I am also in MA and I used Mass Renewables - I sent you a PM.  They were very good, I really like their master electrician. I see so many ugly shitty looking solar installs that were just thrown up in a day or two without paying attention to details. They spent about an hour on my roof taking measurements, and their estimates for production were a little conservative (which is good).  They spent a couple hours desigining the system with me - determining where to put everything and how it'll be wired, and how any conduits would be obscured from street view, etc.\n\n$19.2K for 5.1kW is ~$3.76 a watt.  That is high for Massachusetts. And to be honest, for your usage the system sounds a little small.

This might even be a better application since some of the hydrogen could be replenished from seawater using solar panels.\n\nFor trains I was mostly talking about BEV. In France (where I'm from) almost all passenger rail trains are EV. But for something like a TGV to work like a BEV, it would take so much batteries that the battery would be the train. I know that there some places were diesel is still used even in France though. And there are places where electrifying the whole system is just too expensive. For instance a grain terminal might only see a few trains a year so why would you electrify that? Diesel train are awful polluters, now, I live in the US (Seattle) and I have not seen a single electrified railway over here. But every time I bike along the train track and a train starts I find my self in a toxic cloud and try to hold my respiration as I push through it. Overall I think that the US will be a faster adopter for FCEV trains because they mostly don't have an electrified railway system. I bet that it'll take longer in Europe.\n\nEdit: Also, I didn't think about niche as negative. I just thought it wasn't the right work. For instance, metal studs are a thing, you have most likely never seen one because residential construction uses wood. None the less, they are behind virtually every wall in commercial buildings. So, I don't think that they as a niche product.

Summer power bills when using A/C can easily be $650 U.S. in their existing house built about 6 years ago and uses individual room units.\n\n2) They are going to be building a new house/bed and breakfast place later this year.  Most B&amp;B places in the area close in the summer as the cost of A/C is prohibitive compared to revenue.  So dual residential/small hotel power usage.\n\n3) As they are building on the coast they will have to deal with salt spray in the air and the occasional hurricane (2014 was a category 4) that destroys the power grid for weeks at a time.  So they would like to be able to run when the grid inevitably collapses during any kind of storm for hours to weeks.\n\n4) CFE, the Mexican power company has said they cannot allow any more net metering in the area due to capacity issues.  So it would seem (for now anyway) they either use their solar power or loose it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as I see it the main problem will be the summer power load which requires the A/C to run pretty much all the time in whatever room you are in.  There is a small local solar power company, but I question their expertise given their comments on power storage is to not use batteries to store power as they explode.  In the winter, A/C is not needed, but they would love to be able to heat their water and/or pool since it seems they will have a large surplus amounts of energy.  Any problems with water heating as a dump load since they can't put power back in to the grid?  Are there any problems with battery systems in Mexico?  Since they are on the coast, is supplementing solar with coastal wind power feasible?  Seems like Tesla Powerwall's are the top of the battery power storage systems, but are hard to get still.  Is there anyone else close to them or have a more modular system where they could look at expanding it as they go?  How solid can solar panels be attached to a roof in Mexico (which tend to be concrete or cinder block and concrete).

They also say this,\n\n&gt;\\[Carbon Brief\\] The continued growth of wind and solar means **renewables**, including hydro and bioenergy, would displace coal as the largest source of the world’s power by 2025, says the IEA’s report.\n\nWhich is also *exactly* correct, as the IEA reports,\n\n&gt;\\[IEA:\\] **Renewables** will overtake coal to become the largest source of electricity **generation** worldwide in 2025. By that time, they are expected to supply one-third of the world’s electricity. Hydropower will continue to supply almost half of global renewable electricity. It is by far the largest source of renewable electricity worldwide, followed by wind and solar PV.^(1)\n\n...\n\n&gt;\\[Parsons:\\] Hahaha, reading the articles reveals the trick -\n\nAh yes, the well known \"trick\" of making clearly defined, precisely quantified claims which accurately quote a source. I'm unsurprised that you're unfamiliar with the concept.\n\n&gt;\\[Parsons:\\] No qualification about it only referring to peak capacity that only occurs for a fraction of the day. Just the straight out lies that wind and solar will overtake coal and gas as the largest source of power. A big red line showing wind and solar WINNING\n\nBut the report *literally* says that by 2025 renewables will provide more electricity generation than either coal or natural gas! And this is *literally* the claim made in the CB article, as I quoted above! So while you're guffawing at the idea, and crying foul that Carbon Brief is using 'tricks' to take their source out of context, you are doing exactly that.\n\nSo let's summarize, the headline is accurate, solar and wind capacity will exceed coal and natural gas. The statement about renewable generation in the article are... accurate, because the IEA does indeed state that renewable generation will exceed either natural gas or coal by 2025. And by the way, the vast majority of that increase in renewable generation (77%^(3)) comes from solar and wind!\n\n\\[1\\] [IEA Renewables 2020 Executive Summary](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2020#executive-summary)\n\n\\[2\\] [IEA Renewables 2020 Forecast Summary](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2020/renewable-electricity-2#forecast-summary)\\[3\\]\n\n    Change in Total Renewable Generation (2020-2025) = 9743-7486 = 2257 TWh\n    Change in Solar + Wind Generation (2020-2025) = 4177-2444 = 1733 TWh\n    Fraction of Change Due To Solar + Wind = 1733/2257 = 76.8%","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.044981115808089576,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24254581332206726,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2562394476833549,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21403182284201522,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.41435996323992225,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2965245865584052,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18821473404871844,"solar_1":-0.11277544921125066,"solar_2":-0.15117088658119274,"solar_3":-0.08502916007958877,"solar_4":-0.01710747899703043,"solar_5":-0.08362176140216966,"solar_6":-0.13185483153210953,"solar_7":-0.04163488874605479,"solar_8":-0.034615992036771535,"solar_9":-0.1417893844868636,"solar_10":-0.2104531063320994},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

You're relying on outdated economic data. Simple economics would tell you that renewables should overtake fossil fuels since they are now cheaper in many places of the world:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; until very recently electricity from fossil fuels was far cheaper than electricity from renewables. This has dramatically changed within the last decade. In most places in the world power from new renewables is now cheaper than power from new fossil fuels.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The fundamental driver of this change is that renewable energy technologies follow learning curves, which means that with each doubling of the cumulative installed capacity their price declines by the same fraction. The price of electricity from fossil fuel sources however does not follow learning curves so that we should expect that the price difference between expensive fossil fuels and cheap renewables will become even larger in the future.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The learning rate of solar PV modules is 20.2%.16 With each doubling of the installed cumulative capacity the price of solar modules declines by 20.2%.17 The high learning rate meant that the core technology of solar electricity declined rapidly.

Utilities like Florida Light & Power have tried to simply ignore them but we're forced to the bargaining table. This kind of give and take will continue.The rapidly falling price of battery storage will influence this by taking the time pressure off both utilities and consumers. This is also a new phenomenon. The energy sector has never been so dynamic, with so many options. This makes the century old fight between Edison's DC and Westinghouse's AC look quaint by comparison.\n\nin economics term, utility companies are natural monopoly, it doesn't make sense for 2 utility companies laying 2 power line to compete for customers. that's why they are so regulated and can't increase price at will. solar power is shifting the power to the consumer side.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006283882850160201,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2432770987820375,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2318321160284337,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26870957275680424,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19960213849130273,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2379958084970929,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06753877665808734,"solar_1":-0.20376588754879776,"solar_2":-0.18068625480615688,"solar_3":-0.1780220635307479,"solar_4":-0.03535012648353586,"solar_5":-0.013102334978611907,"solar_6":-0.0005117890189770454,"solar_7":-0.0014015504105676275,"solar_8":-0.003047243889644354,"solar_9":-0.1665879877715876,"solar_10":-0.10907289345171496},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.

Basically, how often do you need to charge the car and what size battery that you need to charge. This can amount to anywhere from a 10kW to 90 kW a day.\n\n3.      You will be under NEM 3.\n\nI live in just a little East of El Cajon. I had a 7.2kW system, facing due South, all at 17 degrees tilt, installed about 7 years ago. SunPower system that was purchased at the time it was approximately $31k before tax credit. House is 2 stories at 2000 square feet. I am under NEM 2. The system is ground mounted with no shading until about 5:30pm in the summer. \n\nLast year I produced \\~1000kWh of “extra” power, for this I received a $28 credit ($0.0266/kW), from SDGE. I still paid SDGE for non-bypassable charges approximately $160 for the year.\n\nMy AC is the highest user of electricity. No EV, No battery. I have a dual zone system, I set the downstairs for 73 all day. My upstairs is set for 76 between 8am to 4pm, 80 between 4 to 12am, and 70 between 12am to 8am.\n\nFrom January through June each year I generate approximately 2700-3000kWh more than I use. From July through October I under produce and draw approximately 2000kWh more than I produce. November to December I generate about 400 kWh extra. All of this is highly dependent on the outside temperature, specially how many high heat days (high 90’s- low 100’s). \n\nWith the 6.8kWh system your HIGHEST production day will get you about 45kWh. Should be in May or June depending on the temperature and panel angle. Your lowest producing days someone in January or February (excluding rain or overcast days) will probably be around 28kWh.\n\nThat information should give you some very specific data to use. Now looking at your situation one of the big things is the NEM 3. In order to offset usage with production you would have to produce about 25-30% more power. You basically get 75% for each extra kWh. Under NEM 2 it was 1 to 1. You should charge your battery during the lower rate part of the day and discharge it during peak hours (4-9pm).\n\nYou will need to chose a TOU plan from SDGE, usually for those not having an EV or battery this would mean choosing a plan that has the minimum difference between off peak and peak rates. This is because solar is generating during off peak hours. Also consider when you use your power, as this is true for those that use a lot of power between 4-9pm.\n\nIf I was you, I would consider the biggest system I could afford, have space for, and can get approved. SDGE will continue to control the CPUC and get higher payments from their customers. You are intending to get an EV so go bigger.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008921869739424437,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25625964150181063,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19027192413317,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22254149106270205,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24945352736573445,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20313529817285225,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13144630442063013,"solar_1":-0.17197674617194686,"solar_2":-0.20035179179675872,"solar_3":-0.18558695737102548,"solar_4":-0.043435842070667766,"solar_5":-0.10934932623146348,"solar_6":-0.02508982638634431,"solar_7":-0.019332233011179294,"solar_8":-0.032672027533635316,"solar_9":-0.13970767339565424,"solar_10":-0.1796853726231752},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

But even so, I can't help but think that a definition based on suffering minimisation should trump a definition that doesn't consider sentience or capacity to suffer. I would even say that the cause of veganism is harmed by those who rigidly insist on a particular definition of veganism, *simply for the sake of the definition*.  I think we should approach it rationally, using evidence-based enquiry. \n\nFor example, if the evidence strongly suggests worms don't suffer, vegans should question their reasons to avoid harming one. After all, the evidence also suggests plants don't suffer, and we have no problem harming plants in order to eat. Why do worms get special treatment? Is there a special magical essence that the entirety of Animalia possesses? Or have we just arbitrarily decided that this particular biological Kingdom is the one to avoid? Of course, it all follows from the definition. \n\nThe problem is that, from an ethical point of view, it's a flawed definition. It puts an entire biological kingdom on a pedestal, without regard for sentience or the capacity to suffer. I think ethical vegans should be empowered to label themselves \"vegan\", even if they consume animals that do not suffer (if the evidence is clear). These are people who are acting because they care about the suffering of the world, not because they are purists and want to serve a definition.\n\nHaving said all that, I would say it is still not very clear which animals have the capacity to suffer. Perhaps we will never know for sure. We might think that the fact that some animals don't have a brain is a clear indication that they don't suffer. The same argument could be made for plants -- or anything, really. It will always be partially an assumption. The best we can do is make educated guesses based on observed behaviour, brain complexity and similarity to human physiology.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005700394637339438,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1339535326731493,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2720501460516114,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26281372509605916,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3309782018073141,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.257840220069576,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16715034728194175,"diet_1":-0.07421181260491494,"diet_2":-0.21681673390449419,"diet_3":-0.09079391648197088,"diet_4":-0.04108722998595719,"diet_5":-0.07945162046720118,"diet_6":-0.035795797732134815,"diet_8":-0.03485116851697967,"diet_9":-0.014800059983826941,"diet_10":-0.12415332558157388,"diet_11":-0.013488941667067897,"diet_13":-0.09691431873943657,"diet_14":-0.2435393725245376,"diet_17":-0.012022151109704282},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

That is not to say that all hope is lost nor is it saying that I will not work hard to reverse the bad habit that has formed. I find it easy to grab a (processed) bar of some sorts and eat it (or 2). I realize I could do this with fruit. I believe I have tried it. I feel that I failed to moderate my fruit intake. Whenever I eat, I eat in excess (not in the I am obese form of excess, just large quantities, I am 6'2\" (1.8796 meters) and 155 lbs (70.3068174 kilograms)) because the food is typically available and ready.\n\nEating 6 slices of bread or half of a jar of peanut butter is easy because it is there and ready to go. I realize that if I am serious about being a vegan, cooking will be involved. This is ok.

Im not saying intelligent = sentient but communication has to do something to move that slider closer, no?\n\nWell, it's not like a dog on some other planet would have the means to send message across interstellar space. So yes, we would/should look for signs of an intelligent species because an intelligent species is the only type of species that could send messages that distance. That is a practicality that doesn't seem to have much to do with sentience.\n\n&gt; &gt; Vegan principles are about eliminating harm as much as is possible and practicable. Starving to death really isn't practicable. Due to the inefficiencies of converting plant energy into meat energy, it still would be best to eat low on the food chain.\n\n&gt; I would hope no one would starve themselves! And I dont think this makes a difference in the do as little harm as possible category but I can see where a new version of vegan will sprout up eating some sort of paste or some other odd food source.\n\nWell, it absolutely would make sense to try include plants in the idea of limiting harm if it was shown that they could be harmed in a relateable way.\n\n&gt; &gt; If it actually turned out that plants were just as conscious as a cow\n\n&gt; Thats more the way I was thinking.\n\nIn that case, eating low on the food chain would still be a substantial mitigation on the amount of harm caused. Other ways to mitigate harm would be based on the specifics, like I said.\n\n&gt; Here is an article that talks about the study were plants talk and listen, Im at work and blocked out of the site from college I use normally. Scientists Confirm that Plants Talk and Listen To Each Other, Communication Crucial for Survival\n\nIt's been known for a long time that plants react to stimuli, produce pheromones, and so on. There's nothing that different if sound is used as well. From [the article](http://io9.com/5919973/plants-communicate-with-each-other-by-using-clicking-sounds) I found, it doesn't seem like they exhibited any particularly complex behavior: the plant simply grew toward the sound. Plants grow toward light also.\n\nThe real question is: Do plants experience things subjectively.\n\n&gt; &gt; You can't prove that specifically\n\n&gt; Thats kind of the problem, it comes down to personal beliefs and experience. I know animals can feel \"pain\" of some sort, I get that. But what living thing wouldnt rather be left living? \n\nMy individual cells are alive but they don't \"want\" anything. They can't experience anything. \"Want\" is used to describe a subjective experience of desire or preference. It doesn't make sense to apply the word \"want\" to a rock or one of my skin cells.\n\n&gt; &gt; There needs to be a subjective experience with positive/negative affect.\n\n&gt; In regard to plants we just figured out they talk, isnt it possible that they also feel than and we are just getting to the point that we can agree that \"The neural substrates of emotions do not appear to be confined to cortical structures\" So isnt it possible they have some sort of sentient life?\n\nI think it is possible but quite improbable. Based on physiology and behavior, there's not much similarity between humans and plants. There's also a lot of other details which make it seem less probable.\n\n* Animals use a *lot* of energy to power their brains. Plants don't have that kind of energy available.\n\n* What survival benefit would a subjective experience give a plant? Plants can't really react to their environment in real time.\n\n* Plants react to stimuli and communicate in some ways, but they haven't been observed behaving in complex ways.\n\nIt's not something that can be ruled out entirely (in fact, even sentient rocks cannot/have not been ruled out. Maybe [panpsychism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism)/panexperimentalism is true). However, I accord likelihood of things being true according to how much data I have, and the idea of sentient plants really isn't supported by the data.\n\n&gt; I prefer to freeze lobsters and then slice them in half to make it as quick as possible. I eat meat, that doesnt mean I dont care about things. Not that, that was your point just an example.\n\nWell, that is preferable to some alternatives.\n\nOne thing I find interesting, though, is that at the same time you deny animals have an experience that is relateable to human experience you say you think it's wrong to torture animals or cause them unnecessary pain. To make that sort of statement requires a relateable aspect of their experience, otherwise you couldn't tie it to a human concept of good or bad or harmful or not.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.023185513603190582,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26037371795814157,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2148863357995246,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20577647183866551,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3350118465048301,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23995153837094824,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16233418880892714,"diet_1":-0.15439509653183342,"diet_2":-0.3477819904536823,"diet_3":-0.322808804087515,"diet_4":-0.31104648517052913,"diet_5":-0.16883959824675115,"diet_6":-0.057336937871944514,"diet_8":-0.3500128188867772,"diet_9":-0.2753428940216873,"diet_10":-0.2839726569465805,"diet_11":-0.1543171240691842,"diet_13":-0.29476263728319924,"diet_14":-0.1871145072367724,"diet_17":-0.10279107365859062},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.
