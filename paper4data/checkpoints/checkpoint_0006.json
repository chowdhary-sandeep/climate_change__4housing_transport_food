The idea is to level the ground so that it is more economically sound to buy hybrids and EVs, and this way attract more interest into them from car manufacturers. However, I think that investments in R&amp;D instead of handing out subsidies would most certainly have a better effect.\n\n&gt;Biofuels\n\nSame thing. The idea is to help the technology mature by increasing their use, even if they are not competitive from a purely (shortsighted) economical perspective.\n\n Again, R&amp;D is more important than merely subsidizing existing technology. Also, it should be made sure that biofuels are not made from non-sustainable sources or use (at least, too much of) arable land that would otherwise have been used for food production. We don't want people being hungry just because we want to use more biofuels.\n\n&gt;Windmills\n\n&gt;Solar panels\n\nSolar panel industry is maturing fast and the prices are going down swiftly, which should soon lead to a situation where they are competitive even if there are no subsidies. Wind turbines are slowly getting better and cheaper as well. Once again, subsidies are useful for helping the industry mature, but R&amp;D should be top priority. \n\nIt should be noted that fossil fuels and nuclear energy* are subsidized too, and therefore it would be merely fair that renewable energy should be subsidized on at least the same level per unit of energy. The fossil fuel industry also recieves numerous indirect \"subsidies\" through infrastructure, geopolitical actions, and by being exempt from numerous external costs.\n\nIt should also be noted that there are many forms of subsidies, and some forms will surely work better and be cheaper for certain situations and certain targets. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_subsidies\n\n&gt;Fluorescent lightbulbs\n\nSubsidies are not necessary. The EU and several countries have already banned sales on incandescent light bulb, and therefore the only choices are fluroscent light bulbs and LED bulbs.\n\n*As a side note, I support nuclear energy, especially the newest smaller reactor technology, and wouldn't mind seeing more of nuclear energy in the future energy mix.

People without degrees in Catholic theology keep coming in and saying that theology is complete bollocks. \n\nAnd yet if you ask people with degrees in Catholic theology who have succeeding in getting at least half their articles published in peer reviewed Catholic theology journals in the last year 98% of them all agree that it is the absolute truth\n\nhttp://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/07/18/about-that-overwhelming-98-number-of-scientists-consensus/\n\n&gt; So where did that famous “consensus” claim that “98% of all scientists believe in global warming” come from? It originated from an endlessly reported 2009 American Geophysical Union (AGU) survey consisting of an intentionally brief two-minute, two question online survey sent to 10,257 earth scientists by two researchers at the University of Illinois. Of the about 3.000 who responded, 82% answered “yes” to the second question, which like the first, most people I know would also have agreed with.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then of those, only a small subset, just 77 who had been successful in getting more than half of their papers recently accepted by peer-reviewed climate science journals, were considered in their survey statistic. That “98% all scientists” referred to a laughably puny number of 75 of those 77 who answered “yes”.\n&gt;\n&gt; That anything-but-scientific survey asked two questions. The first: “When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?”  Few would be expected to dispute this…the planet began thawing out of the “Little Ice Age” in the middle 19th century, predating the Industrial Revolution. (That was the coldest period since the last real Ice Age ended roughly 10,000 years ago.)\n\nI'd agree that temperatures have gone up about 0.8°C or so in the last 100 years.\n&gt;\n&gt; The second question asked: “Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?” So what constitutes “significant”? Does “changing” include both cooling and warming… and for both “better” and “worse”? And which contributions…does this include land use changes, such as agriculture and deforestation?\n\nI'd agree with this too. The odds at the moment are that anthropogenic CO2 is a significant contributing factor to that 0.8°C rise, i.e. more than half.\n\nBut if you look at CO2 emissions the big gainer is China. Cutting CO2 emissions from the US and EU is not going to change the fact that we'll have a lot more CO2 in the near future. \n\nI also don't believe models based on cherry picked data that show a catastrophe in future.\n\nSo I'd answer yes to both questions and yet I oppose all the policy preferences the warmists are trying to push.\n\nMind you I'd definitely support more nuclear power use in the US and EU. But that's nothing to do with CO2. Actually I think the world will transition away from hydrocarbons in the slightly less near future because cheaper alternatives will become technically feasible. I don't know what those alternatives will be, but there are so many promising technologies one of them is bound to work.\n\nWe could run cars on algae biodiesel now and generate all our power with nuclear powerstations. The reason we don't is simply that oil and gas are so damn cheap compared to the alternatives. However that will inevitably change - oil and gas will get more expensive and the alternatives will get cheaper.\n\nIn fact if you look at the UK its CO2 emissions dropped because of the switch from coal to gas for power generation. That was done because gas cheap and it was done very quickly. At some point gas will cease to be cheap and we'll have LFTRs, fusion or even just well designed PWRs. Or algae biodiesel. \n\nIf it hadn't been for fracked gas we'd probably have stopped using gas already. As it is gas is likely to stay cheap and indeed get cheaper for another few decades.\n\nBut look at those technologies I've mentioned. Fracked gas and nuclear were both been opposed by the green lobby. They put punitive taxes on diesel too in places like Sweden. Even though diesel has always been more CO2 efficient and modern diesels are no worse environmentally than petrol. They supported things like electric cars even though electric cars will [need new batteries every seven years or so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster#Battery_system). They supported solar and wing and caused them to be commercialised long before they were economically viable at a cost of massive amounts of public money in subsidies.\n\nStill in the long run solar is going to [hit grid parity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_parity#Reaching_parity) and that means places like the UK with free market power generation will switch to them quickly - just like they switched from coal to gas. But guess what? The environmentalists opposed free market power generation too. They want a planned economy and yet it is obvious that the people doing the planning - banning some things and subsidising others - know less about power generation than the people actually building and running power stations.\n\nI say we leave decision up to them.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.08237100889285405,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21511176269903254,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2509249765310327,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24831751593033172,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.222448664866405,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2160834475294053,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26554984974726265,"ev_1":-0.17258812953956001,"ev_2":-0.221498910184083,"ev_3":-0.305698551472756,"ev_4":-0.31793189712096326,"ev_5":-0.20206582325477762,"ev_6":-0.30790547636427024},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I'm making a simple factual rebuttal to your statement that Tesla's batteries have greater energy density. They do not. They are just bigger batteries. That's not the same as increasing the energy density.\n\nThe underlying point remains the same. I firmly believe that, for EVs to reach the mainstream, we will need **both** lower costs and improved energy density. Tesla's Model S is not a mainstream car. It's a bauble for the wealthy, or for those enthusiasts willing to go deep in hock to get one. That's not a criticism either, any more than it'd be a criticism of a Mercedes S class to say that it's not a mainstream car but a bauble for the wealthy. I once owned an S class. Before I crashed it into a highway barrier, it was a great bauble.\n\nWhether the Tesla Model S is \"good enough\" is a matter of opinion. I think it's a snazzy and cleverly done vehicle that takes a lithium ion-powered sedan to the limit of its capabilities, but in spite of Tesla's efforts I don't think they've produced a true road car yet. To do so will require a leap in energy density.\n\nMaybe the molten metal batteries that we'd heard about from M.I.T., which are said to have double the energy density of lithium ion, will actually hit the market. That would give Tesla's Model S an honest, all-weather range of 350 miles, putting it at the lower edges of \"road car\" performance, although the \"superchargers\" would need (IMO) a lot more \"super\" in the charge. Or maybe Southern Illinois University's latticework anode/cathode concept is real and will multiply lithium ion density by 1,000-fold, and its charging speed by 2,000 fold (given a monster charger), in which case the game changes completely and forever.\n\nBut we're not there yet. Not Think, the bankrupt Ford spinout that made my car, nor Nissan, nor GM, nor BMW, nor Tesla. None of them. In my opinion, it's entirely a battery game, and we're still in the early stages. Get mad if you want, but having drunk soon Kool-Aid in the past on this or that technology, I'm not going to do it again for Tesla.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00019041241224234304,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09239518374354105,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1343815382471993,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12182590117057164,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24867562396052803,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17248224615184043,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.054088366392534226,"ev_1":-0.2068183291599056,"ev_2":-0.0334252155929183,"ev_3":-0.0023045547495712526,"ev_4":-0.002400340211655324,"ev_5":-0.0014368963869249758,"ev_6":-0.01460526320443023},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Still I like to learn by this kind of back and forth discussion so I'll have another crack.\n\n&gt;We didn't have ecosystem collapses due to massive amounts of change in temperature over short periods of time.\n\nWe also weren't producing pollution in the form we have over the last century and we weren't causing deforestation on a mass scale. I'm sure these two things combined aren't helping the natural situation of climate cycles(?).\n\n&gt;There are people who give up owning a car and are spending much more of their lives commuting by mass transit, or riding a bicycle rather than using their own, comfortable and safe private transport vehicle. No one forces them to do that, no law has been made in that regard.\n\nThis does happen and I'm sure there are many people who have made small changes but the problem is bigger than these small changes. The city I live in hasn't changed greatly since I was growing up. Definitely more cars and houses so there is that contributing I guess. And as far as I know the offices I visit (I work from home) have desktops running all day and sometimes lights and other powered systems all night. Basically on a mass scale my city has increased traffic, houses &amp; businesses by a larger factor than the actions to reduce the effect.\n\n&gt;I am spending a bunch of money leasing an electric car. It's the most expensive car I've ever had\n\nYou're lucky I guess. I know many people in my part of the world that don't have the luxury to do this.\n\n&gt;I personally drive about one sixth the distance that I used to drive each year\n\nMy city is also not well equipped for efficient pubic transport. It's getting better but certainly not great just yet.\n\n&gt;Remember that without growth, there is little problem. The industrialized nations are pretty much all at or below their peak in emissions, and will not grow any more\n\nYou don't think there's population grown on a mass scale in developed countries? All the new housing alone calls for more power supplies, new construction and changes to infrastructure.\n\n&gt;except for China, which really is an Industrialized nation\n\nI'm not sure but I think China just made a new agreement to reduce their contribution to GHGs.\n\n&gt;This does NOT mean that we should continue doing business as usual, or increase our fossil fuel use, or anything like that. What it does mean is that the shouts of doom and the call for immediate action based on their scary stories might be misplaced. What we need is to continue to improve our use of energy, because efficiency is better than waste, and continue to increase the use of renewables like wind and solar where they make sense. They don't make sense everywhere, and pushing for them to be used everywhere is foolish. Use them where they have the greatest effect, continue to improve the technology so that they are more cost effective, and we will have a better society overall. Don't do it because CO2 is evil, or because greedy oil companies make a profit (because profits are evil) or anything like that. Do it where it improves the lives of people.\n\nI'll have to agree with this. I'm not sure how urgent the threat is but this seems a good idea either way. Apply our knowledge for greener power where and when we can cheaply and efficiently. My problem I guess is people who *totally* deny there exists a problem with GHGs even if it's not as terrible as the end of the world.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2441816245017659,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09621336118129734,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18365123640153913,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18950969617431343,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22514352529730572,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21295257005449716,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15354395347336927,"ev_1":-0.1310071471561019,"ev_2":-0.12214323766206589,"ev_3":-0.11537800585695852,"ev_4":-0.15013550628403513,"ev_5":-0.08465234819838467,"ev_6":-0.1522469144013788},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Either lithium ions intercalate into the graphite (the intended pathway) or they are reduced at the surface of the anode, forming lithium metal, which then reacts fairly rapidly with electrolyte (this is why charge rates during regen are higher than DCFC, because a regen event is normally followed by a discharge event which strips the lithium before it can react). Both of these reaction paths happen every time lithium ions are attracted to the anode.\n\nLow anode potential (caused by increasing charge rate/high SOC/low temperature) favour the second reaction. High temperatures increase diffusion rate, favouring the first reaction by increasing the anode potential for a given charge rate. This is why charging at sub-zero temperatures is so bad and why BMS algorithms limit the rate heavily at these temps. The overall charging current is the sum of the two reactions.\n\nAn important distinction is that different cells have different anode impedance (ie different charge rates for a given anode potential). Cells exist that can charge at &gt;20C for thousands of cycles.. Anode impedance also increases over the life of a cell (which is why charge rates are often limited after a set number of DCFC events, or sometimes based on SOH\n\nThe flip-side of high temperatures is that they also cause intercalated lithium to react with the electrolyte, so there's a tradeoff. This happens regardless of whether a cell is charging/discharging/sitting there doing nothing.\n\nAs such, it's critically important to remove the heat as fast as possible \\*after\\* the charge session (and part of why Nissan Leaf batteries suffer so much especially in high ambient temps)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProbably missed some bits, but this covers most of the points i think","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001246344885051561,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10374306799058104,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.03589136153459549,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06114736944437027,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2908783681063672,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19731952022545715,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01864532956581873,"ev_1":-0.16872304993364562,"ev_2":-0.0037611920924973674,"ev_3":-0.0117820434376578,"ev_4":-0.007851431248127483,"ev_5":-0.0009945367831581582,"ev_6":-0.08228147943494453},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

The Panasonic and LG are nice, but quite a bit more expensive. In my experience the modules over time are rarely going to give you a different experience. I run into modules that were twice as expensive as anything else at their time that have have issues 15 years later, and middle of the road ones that have never had a problem. My point is nobody can say you will never have an issue and will have a better experience just because LG costs that much more. In fact I find most all modules (that are not crap) will likely work fine over the expected life span. I work with aging modules every day and I couldn't predict which module you could by today that would be superior.\n\nKeep in mind you care comparing a 8.141kW system that should offset 105% of your use to a 9.4kW system which in that case would be somewhere around 120% of you use. Unless you are expecting your electrical usage to go up, there is no financial benefit to over sizing the system. In fact, just from a financial basis you would be better off a little undersized. Might want to consider removing 3 or 4 from taht system if you dont expect a big increase in usesage.\n\nSoalrEdge is considered an optimizer system vs a string inverter. Dont get me wrong, it has a single inverter, but it is a \"dumb\" inverter without power point trackers so usually when people say string inverter they are referring to something else. I am not a huge fan of either SolarEdge or Enphase, but if I HAD to go with one or the other I would chose Enphase for their superior support and warranty  (IMO).\n\nOverall, both of those options you listed are going to give you a very similar experience overall as far as inverter and module options go. What will make the biggest difference in your experience is the company you chose. Tesla will be very communicative upfront, but post install you will have a hard time getting support. If the other company is a local installer you may be hit or miss on their quality, but if they are good maybe it is worth $5k more to you.\n\nWhen it comes down to it the race to the bottom is hard to get away from. It is difficult to justify $5k more for a system that is likely going to give you an identical experience at the end of the day.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00011668969455058686,"1.1.1_stance":-0.04278506311800356,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21472654243310293,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2657358684882999,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.05834488689538375,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.39736569071724925,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.014455268797367657,"ev_1":-0.0366272642640979,"ev_2":-0.03939189630667291,"ev_3":-0.0009608959953766316,"ev_4":-0.0005357328360939088,"ev_5":-0.0007481617625065459,"ev_6":-0.1457833807556502},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

The Volvo is more isolating. Pretty much what you'd expect from BMW/Volvo. To my personal tastes, the C40 interior somewhat disappoints (the interiors in the bigger Volvos is nicer) but isn't a deal-breaker. The Volvo is, however, notable less efficient and overall range is compromised versus competitive models. But if it's enough for your use needs, that's not a big deal.

We have impositions made on the populace based on a science that has failed to provide (after great expenditure) any model that has reflected the real world temperatures in the last 18 years. We have had a number of variation theories thrown out, but they are all based on datasets of impossibly short collection periods with no actual history to compare them with and we are told that they are accurate. \n\n\nI am not a scientist, but have experience in the areas and know that this is not how good science is done. When you look at the smoking argument, you could see vested interests and their influence because their is no alternative for them to supply their product. The AGW tribe goes on about the vested interests of coal and fossil fuels but fails to understand that they players at the high end of these conglomerations are also funding the leading edge of other energy production because they make money from supplying power. They know that poor solar electricity production will be limited and inconsistent because as businesses they do the hard yards of modelling impacts on their businesses and do not progress with projects that are not profitable.\n\n\nBP was for a long time the largest supplier of solar panels. They led the charge and yet even with significant resources the areas such as battery robustness, charge cycles and panel output levels made them ultimately question how effective it could be. We have massive reflective solar farms that concentrate heat into salt for continued power production without considering the problems that creating a huge heat sink on the surface of the earth will do. We have massive geothermal projects that cost heaps and fail. The fail on stable continents like Australia due to the dynamic conditions well below the earths surface and yet we get smoke blown up our arse about how geothermal is a stable industry. We know they consistently fail and yet they continue to accept government funding when the issues they face are not ones that can be engineered out. \n\n\nI hate the waste of money and hate the hysteria that is injected into the discourse, we have been told that we will have the hottest summer this year(for Australia). It will not be hard to break the record because the BOM has already deleted information from Bourke and Cloncurry and then homogenised them with locations hundreds of kilometers and in different environments so as soon as it hits 44.7 in Bourke we will hear about how bad it is. If it is going to be that bloody hot, I wish power was cheaper so I could run my aircon to keep me cool. \n\n\nI applied to work with ANARE many years ago. The chief scientist was totally unwilling to answer why with the weather in Australia that fundamentally travels from the West to the East of this great land, why do the emissions from Sydney contribute to the drought that was occurring in the Murray Darling Basin. When you travel around you fly into cities like Melbourne and Sydney and you see less smog than you did thirty years ago. We got rid of lead in our petrol and have seen the benefits. This was science done that correctly hit the rules of science. The Question was asked, the hypothesis stated, the gathering of consistent data and the production of the test and results for others to undertake and prove independently. We have seen time and time again, agencies such as Penn State and HadCRU deny freedom of information requests to enable the testing of all elements of their stated hypothesis. They have fought tooth and nail to prevent external independent revue and only ever had internal and friendly reviews undertaken to provide validity to their position. This is not science because it fails the fundamental rules of independent corroboration of the stated hypothesis.\n\n\nThen, as lay-men with an interest we are treated with abuse and called skeptics in a clear tie in with the Holocaust just because the above conditions raise our eyebrows and we have the temerity to ask reasonable questions. After enough abuse, we are no longer bothered with niceties because they were never extended to us in the first place. I call it out when it is obviously BS. When someone post to a newspaper blog saying he was right and the hosts graph is incorrect but the person making the claim has incorrectly built his presentation on Wood for trees , then I will call him out and also down grade my opinion of them.\n\n\nWe have many major issues in this world at the moment. ISIS, global growth, the Ukraine and Ebola are all clear and direct threats to many people in the world. That AGW demands to be placed on an equal pedestal, especially given the issues I raised above, is laughable. We have a number of scientists who have ridden this train for high profit and very low actual valid outcomes. But they are wasting money and time and none of them promote by example the lifestyle that they demand we undertake. \n\n\nWhen they launch the AR6 report and demand that it is only by video conference, then the may begin to gain credibility. When the major conferences held each year globally are online only affairs, then they may have some credibility. But when they have Copenhagen, Rio and Bali as their destinations then they lose credibility by dragging 10000+ people from all over the world to sit in agreement that it is occurring and they need more money for it is shameful and not a valid method for conveying their message. \n\n\nWhen their only solutions are social engineering, pricing power away from people to restrict use, impacting on the fuel price so that the poor will drive even less and have less social interactions, then I get annoyed. I have said elsewhere, why if the science is settled are we still in science mode. We should be in engineering mode with real and valid solutions. We would be if the issue was truly serious, the idea of carbon sequestration is laughable because the idea of pumping concentrated CO2 underground and expecting it to be fine is remarkably ignorant of structure and substructures in geology. The idea of getting strong particulate filtering going, especially for cities in China and the major cities of Asia would be the number 1 thing I would be promoting. Hell, I also like the idea of getting some boats out into the northern pacific ocean and dealing with the plastic land mass that exists up there.\n\n\nBut we do not see real solutions from the leaders of the AGW position. We see conferences and rhetoric, imposts and social engineering. Because of this I seriously question the component of A in AGW, how much we impact and affect our environment and how the environment handles the crap we do to her in the first place. I am a practical man, I like to work out what  is broken and then what we do to fix it. Leaded petrol, fixed done, smoking, known about but removing them from sale would seriously damage most economies due to the high levels of taxation and people are allowed to chose their poison. But AGW proponents offer no real methods of getting rid of the problems apart from wild levels of investments in dodgy schemes that do not pass the smell tests of responsible businesses. Businesses look to ways of making money and if there was a real buck in it, it would have been done by now.\n\n\nSorry for the novel and my headache from sinus's has made me ramble a bit but I think I covered most points.

We've had this conversation.\n\n&gt;By the end of 2012, 4.516 GW had been installed, and that year 8.169 TWh of electricity was produced.\n\nYeah, see the difference?  In your other comment you noted capacity, not *Wh of production.  If we multiply 4.516 GW by 365 days by 6 hours per day, we get 9.890 TWh, so those solar panels aren't even producing for quite six hours every day, on average.\n\n&gt;Most power consumption is during the daytime, solar matches the needs of that peak.\n\nBaseload is about half of peak load in sunny climates, more than half in other areas.  It's incorrect to say that \"most\" is during the day.  Also, there's a secondary peak in the evening when people get home, fire up the microwave, TV, etc.\n\n&gt;The agenda isn't to replace all fossil fuels with solar by 2015, its to move things in a positive direction.\n\nI'm fine with this.  I've advocated this very thing.  If that's all you are saying then we are in general agreement.\n\n&gt;The root of the issue is that politicians love being dependent on oil. \n\nHeh.  I would say politicians love being reelected.  Oil money, money from G.E. (wind turbine producer), they'll dance to anyone's tune.\n\nBut more to the point, oil doesn't generate much electricity.  See the Sankey diagram above.  The choice for electricity is natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and wind.  There is a place for all of those, but if you want to remove coal and nuclear, for example, you've got a real problem.  If you want to really kick oil producers in the balls, advocate more nuclear and coal so we can divert natural gas to transportation and not baseload generation.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00032272766111418605,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05560489475731174,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14870325351754823,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.027891161541144054,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28024461809612833,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17293007827357232,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06463334245684867,"solar_1":-0.17151059605384944,"solar_2":-0.107650818607537,"solar_3":-0.12821915733729838,"solar_4":-0.03167288000622648,"solar_5":-0.2295258421145263,"solar_6":-0.0020451204636628972,"solar_7":-0.011133618428478561,"solar_8":-0.004530521641451439,"solar_9":-0.013310771632013996,"solar_10":-0.08305649430985795},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other - The reference group in this text is not explicitly stated using possessive indicators.

This may be along the lines of creating virtual modeling and data collection and analysis.\n\nSales and proposal departments use other types of software to help design preliminary concepts.  These might be programs to help a company figure out costs and margins as well as more creative programs like CAD and associated plug-in modules specific to the industry.\n\n\nConstruction groups have their own set of tasks that utilize software as well.  There are companies that make equipment to determine where solar modules can be placed in relation to surrounding obstructions and produce software to help determine how much energy is lost due to long DC runs and other factors that impact the design and performance of a proposed system.  There are also many applications that are either customized for the industry (asset management, construction scheduling, logistics, etc..) or created from scratch to support a specific task that existing software does not do.  \n\nIn maintaining solar, there is a TON of data being created, compiled and analyzed.  I worked for a large commercial and utility scale solar developer and it is no easy task to monitor hundreds of megawatts on a granular level that allows you to dispatch techs to make repairs at the component level.  This requires a strong ability to gather and parse data quickly and efficiently.  \n\nThere is so much more to it as well.  The solar industry is made up of engineering and construction, which is sold and supported by sales, marketing and lobbying, all using software.\n\nAs for unmet needs, I'd say that improvements are always welcomed.

Homes selling back excess power is a burden on utilities.\n\nFor example, lets say the utility is selling at 10 cents/kwh. They are buying at a few cents less.. say 7 cents/kwh. With net metering, they buy at 10 cents/kwh and then sell at 10 cents/kwh. The transaction uses the grid without producing any profit for the utility. So it is essentially a free service that the utility provides. Not all net metering laws are as simple as my example, but all of them do require utilities to buy at an artificially high rate. \n\nThat's why utilities want to add a flat fee for homes connected to the grid.

A new law that took effect July 1, allows third party financing for the first time that helps people \"go solar\" without paying the upfront cost. This is particularly important for nonprofit entities who can't use tax incentives that make solar more affordable.

From what I've read years ago, most of the power plants do have scrubbing systems in place, but just never turn them on because it is more expensive and cuts into profit margins (or makes them run at a loss).\n\nWait a second, I'm not very familiar with the details of how coal scrubbers work, are they so elaborate that running them actually costs enough to send coal plants into a loss of profit at standard electricity rates?\n\nSeems like they'd have to increase the rates to cover it. In which case, it's really a question for consumers. Would you prefer healthy clean smog-free air and slightly more expensive electricity, or slightly cheaper electricity with air that can literally kill you? \n\nI think, at least for people living in the area, it's a clear choice.\n\n&gt; While solar power lags behind conventional power production in terms of efficiency, it has great potential for the future and for applications not suitable for other conventional sources of power (mounted on small toys, vehicles of any size, satellites/spacecraft, space stations, lunar/planetary bases). Some of these applications are still far off, but becoming a market leader is a long term goal.\n\nYes, for portable / remote locations, solar is awesome. It makes camping and hiking far more enjoyable, as I can recharge my electronic devices while out in the wild or even on the move with solar backpacks. Or solar roofing on cabins in the wilderness for hunting and fishing, and so on.\n\nIt's just not ready for large-scale power production. I don't want to be germany, paying $0.40 per kw/hour. \n\n&gt; The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.\nI'm with you on that one. The EPA employs close to 16,000 people. And while I do credit the EPA for a lot of good (such as clearing up skies over many American cities), it has indeed expanded beyond its original mandate and should be pared back.\nI would be interested in a neutral audit of the EPA.\n\nI think a lot of people would agree that the EPA has grown out of control, but it won't be scaled back easily. I'm not a huge supporter of Trump, however he may appoint someone to the EPA who wants to shrink its presence in the country; and that's a good thing.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23948204129632808,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13369727360234124,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17514453000476865,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21687477299322686,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06562192910766858,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22595522536255935,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21581115014851093,"solar_1":-0.1089622693576783,"solar_2":-0.1947963222457619,"solar_3":-0.05496945227502318,"solar_4":-0.04163377931521003,"solar_5":-0.023823458565544797,"solar_6":-0.02900909798821279,"solar_7":-0.05638578824679522,"solar_8":-0.15732037933776155,"solar_9":-0.036886110291142415,"solar_10":-0.0932907280182596},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (for the first comment regarding shared expectations about the use of scrubbers in power plants and the associated costs and profit margins; and for the third comment regarding the shared belief that the EPA has grown out of control and should be scaled back).","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Which means if they go solar, even with net-metering and tax credits, they're still looking at a 15+ year payback. That's not really a good, and we don't sell a lot to those customers because of it. MidAm can offer such a low rate because they've put up tons of wind this last decade and brought their price-per-kWh to half of the other nearby utilities. \n\nThe same thing is happening in solar. It's becoming more cost effective for the big utilities to just start building solar farms because they get a huge discount on materials when they buy MW scale orders. \n\nI wouldn't doubt at this stage the utilities see fighting net-metering as a plan B that ices the cake, when the whole time their just gearing up for tons of their own solar farms.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0020811593470474086,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1538770544855098,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2149304004953109,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3368622944557313,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1375814397409556,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.10523084985713164,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19556181369954706,"solar_1":-0.4094044224087459,"solar_2":-0.021284556062407017,"solar_3":-0.15422023372250096,"solar_4":-0.12203085593620679,"solar_5":-0.0010723795439844253,"solar_6":-0.0003361295008896074,"solar_7":-0.001177523842973945,"solar_8":-0.00035244513613482315,"solar_9":-0.06385759888507891,"solar_10":-0.09378850185506356},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (utilities' solar farms are good, net-metering policies are opposed)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Any chance you may need or want to upgrade the system size in the future? What's more important to you, cheapest cost up front or total system ROI? How long will you be in the house? \n\nOne thing I'm leery of regarding SunEdison is their current financial status. They've been in a whirlwind of trouble financially lately and it's important they stay in business to make good on your warranty if anything goes wrong. If you're looking for lowest cost up front you may want to shop around a little more. If you're looking for the most efficient and aesthetically pleasing panel, with a strong company (and big local presence) backing it, go with SP. \n\nEdit: if you decide on SP, PM me which dealer you're working with and your name (if you feel comfortable with that) and I may be able to get you a decent discount on your system.

However, this cannot be done without the complete cooperation of the client, and a thorough understanding of on-site assessment. I teach classes on this topic, and believe that mastering the remote site assessment can bring the project tremendous cost savings (enabling general contractors to perform the install with the help of solar designers / technical support).\n\nFirst, let me start off with the fact that I advocate for doing things by the book. That means structural engineering stamps, fire code offsets, airtight performance estimates, and proper construction documentation. I've found that on-site assessments actually impede this process - the installer displays enough on-site knowledge to look impressive, but skips over a couple of these items.\n\nStrucutral engineering: this is actually the hard part. The client needs to be able to go into their attic and take photos documenting the truss, cladding, and attachments. Check out Solar Roof Check for an idea of what you need to know.\n\nArray layout: first off, remote site assessment has been tested by NREL to be within 3% accuracy of a performance estimate as on-site SunEyesque photography. I believe it's more accurate however, because you need to use software to accurately model tree growth, effective rate structures, and even voltage drop and transient shadows. Even without LIDAR, your 3D model can be quite accurate.\n\nSecond, I don't go for squeezing every square inch out of the rooftop. IBC requires 3' offsets from the top and sides of the roof, so you should never be designing down to the exact roofline anyway (except for rare exceptions and New Jersey). Besides, I support aesthetic, rectangular arrays. The major hitch is when the satellite data is smudgy. At that point, I instruct the client to walk about 100' away from the roof and snap a photo. All the smudges are now clearly defined roof obstructions.\n\nThird, 100% of the electrical can be done ahead of time with the proper design. Personally, I'm a big fan of supply-side interconnections so I don't need to worry about the load side of things. The client will want a supply-side connection in a few years when they add-on battery inverters anyway.\n\nSo far as software goes, Helioscope and SolarDesignTool will let you create free account for a couple weeks and play around with their tools. Aurora Solar and EnergyToolBase will give free trials as well, but you gotta give them payment info. All are unique in their own ways. /u/butchdeal commented to me once that he uses all of them for different reasons, and I'd say that's a pretty accurate assessment.\n\nSpecifically, SolarDesignTool's NEC report is worth checking out, and it's single line diagram tool is the best at residential level. Aurora Solar is unsurpassed on LIDAR and aesthetics, and is probably the most robust. Helioscope is a great overall value, and is probably the most popular. EnergyToolBase is a superior economic modeling tool, including demand charges and battery bank load leveling.\n\nIf you'd like to try these softwares out, PM me. I'm happy to make an introduction, which may result in an extended trial on your end.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.019325024137894314,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2517496280405821,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15780839514116052,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1949405247198482,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22192682709280798,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32746652150870215,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18778961486576612,"solar_1":-0.15991809249773184,"solar_2":-0.24047058915198655,"solar_3":-0.21991227065639882,"solar_4":-0.05498276306389518,"solar_5":-0.025069929303640492,"solar_6":-0.060490018637991576,"solar_7":-0.05497646195975616,"solar_8":-0.09986230721551692,"solar_9":-0.01719450416457846,"solar_10":-0.07547168881832951},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

The vertical integration of solar panels and roofing seems like it makes sense and I think the economics will start to come into play more as panels drop in price. \n\nLets say for instance you were planning to install a roof ($15k) and then a 10kw solar array ($25k at $2.50/watt installed).\n\nYou get a tax writeoff on the $25k to help cover the costs but if you go with a $35k solar roof instead (in theory) you save $5k through the vertical integration but is the entire $35k still a tax write off since the roofing is combined into the expense?\n\nIt seems like even though the same company is installing and billing you the $35k they should still bill you as 2 line items for tax reporting purposes. One for $25k for the solar aspects of the roof and one for $10k for the roofing parts of the roof. \n\nI'm not sure how difficult that would be but it seems like something that will need to be accounted for. At some point the government/IRS will probably say you can claim 100% of the value of a solar panel install and like 75% of the cost for an integrated solar roofing solution or something so you don't have to track and report them as individual line items.\n\nRight now it's just a really small niche but breaking out the bill into 2 components (or coming pretty close) seems to be a sufficient enough workaround for the tax reporting aspects.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00036088477160471183,"1.1.1_stance":-0.32499271800900453,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18224099895179868,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2894580944967273,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23307011832967708,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23574839373889286,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2705776746345994,"solar_1":-0.2048591710198909,"solar_2":-0.14988214460915592,"solar_3":-0.03362636265986415,"solar_4":-0.17639432345276873,"solar_5":-0.0034197868347594826,"solar_6":-0.0034707044518048256,"solar_7":-0.008251496642818287,"solar_8":-0.006583368360224995,"solar_9":-0.17700711865351573,"solar_10":-0.16103033628067148},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

CO2 is only bad if it comes from fossil fuels. If it's pulled from the air, there's no net impact on the planet.\n\nI tried to cover that with \"fuel-intensive\", implying the resource and energy cost.  If you're gonna totally disregard the impact of CO2, then why use electric planes at all (like the comment I was responding to said)?  This subreddit, submission and the comment I was replying to were all basically predicated on zero-impact biofuels/Sabatier methane not being a thing, and atmospheric CO2 being a thing.\n\n&gt; That might not be realistic, but at least they've thought about it, and you should include that in your argument.\n\nI'm not saying that Elon Musk is crazy to suggest the BFR being used for intraplanetary transport, I'm saying that Elon Musk is not suggesting that it replace *all long distance air travel*.  \n\n&gt; A rocket burning pure methane and oxygen is not polluting. CO2 is not a pollutant, it's a greenhouse gas.\n\nGreenhouse gases are a type of pollutant.  If I understand you, you mean that CO2 isn't toxic or noxious to humans.  That is not a necessary condition for pollution- see light pollution, sound pollution, thermal and even *fog* pollution.  Cooling towers produce pure water (disregarding the salt pollution they also create) and in very rare cases the excess humidity has caused adverse weather changes.  It's only happened a few times IIRC but the worst ones involved causing droughts when the fog caused precipitation to fall on other areas.\n\nOn top of that, CO2 *is* toxic- it increases ocean acidification, killing marine life.\n\n&gt; I don't know what will happen in the future, but I really hope we have more or less solved the energy problem, either with solar+wind+storage or fusion or a combination. In that case, taking a rocket across the planet might not be too bad.\n\nBattery solar is a better bet than fusion, since fusion pegs the price of energy to the price of labor.  Somebody will have to build and maintain the plants and it'll never be easy.  My dream is that sandcrawlers will drive back and forth across deserts, sucking up sand and spitting out solar panels behind them, fully automated.\n\nI would prefer hyperloops everywhere, floating a ways below the oceans surface.  They could be nearly silent, approach 100% efficiency, and you could just hop on board rather than waiting to pile into a rocket so an explosion can happen under you.  Course, the 800 mph vs 18,000 mph difference in speed isn't great.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00018985641023997837,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09492608189561906,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17099392916802297,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3634239390607472,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29739152794631774,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2234036738770712,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03826463815251676,"solar_1":-0.14737962574145058,"solar_2":-0.12710718251764774,"solar_3":-0.05793048429829165,"solar_4":-0.01017949105334992,"solar_5":-0.003925775295404795,"solar_6":-0.00673324416311516,"solar_7":-0.005101445857386959,"solar_8":-0.00611698434598414,"solar_9":-0.14794907919106967,"solar_10":-0.1578821730002602},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Your battery can either contribute to your house, or - and this is the clever bit - the grid. And it is connected to the internet too. The power company (Sonnen, in this case) manages your battery for you. So at 9pm, it tells your battery to give some electricity in to the grid, so that someone up the road who's just turned on his oven can get a bit more power than he has available in his batteries. So essentially your battery turns into a battery for everyone connected to this power supplier.\n\nThis is clever, since if managed well it could mean that Sonnen never have to buy any wholesale power, since it's all being generated by solar (during the day) and peoples' batteries (during the night) and they therefore have very low costs if they've balanced it right. Of course, someone has to pay for the grid!\n\nIn Australia, at least, we have a daily electricity access fee ($1.70 from memory) and then are charged for usage on top. On a very sunny day, my solar panels generate more electricity than I use, but they still need to export $1.70's worth of power for me to have totally free electricity.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3793427298552832,"1.1.1_stance":-0.34129809106854614,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19770046514304082,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24511609496225487,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19821214686288535,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3291568043652225,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.35257114469796136,"solar_1":-0.22555709603771618,"solar_2":-0.15052991356144788,"solar_3":-0.23476840018664494,"solar_4":-0.093278363332948,"solar_5":-0.10531346889188443,"solar_6":-0.023544502453053912,"solar_7":-0.10631857987764785,"solar_8":-0.053769162251727336,"solar_9":-0.06959720600318064,"solar_10":-0.19325668519488362},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Hope I’ve stumbled onto a community that has lots of answers. I have a few factors floating around my brain as I’m trying to make a good decision re: my new plug in hybrid (Ford Fusion Energi - 20 mi EV range), SCE’s Time Of Use (TOU) rates, and an EVSE installation rebate offer.\n\n**TOU Rate issue**: I am currently in the older domestic tiered plan. My annual SCE Net Metering (NEM) bill has been between $450-$500 over the past few years. SCE advises me to switch to TOU-D-A, suggesting that I can save another $350. Wife and I are both teachers, so the whole family is home by 4. We are home for good chunks of summer, too. So, during hot spells, we’re running A/C for a good chunk of the peak period—$.47/kWh—July &amp; August, it is often on from 11-6 or so. Ouch. I’m not clear if SCE’s TOU calculator tool takes our summer schedule into account or if it just looks at our annual kWh consumption. Once we switch to TOU, WHEN we use the power is suddenly very important. Obviously, I’ll be generating solar power at the same time, so I won’t pay an effective .47.  I’ve read elsewhere that TOU-D-A is a good match for solar folks, but I don’t know if my schedule makes me an exception to that idea.  \n\n*Are my concerns valid re: peak hour A/C usage killing my NEM totals if I go TOU-D-A*? \n\nOr, in other words, *is a SoCal teacher whose family is at home during the warm summer and likes the thermostat set to 78-79 degrees a good TOU-D-A candidate?*\n\n**EV Charger issue**: I’m a borderline candidate for a quick charge/240v charging unit since my range is short (though I may do EV short trips later in the day if I was charged). I have 2 options:  \n\nI can have a 240v outlet added in my garage for $200-$300.  \n\nOr, I can have a second, EV-dedicated panel/meter installed. This will net cost me $350-$500 because SCE has a $1500 rebate to subsidize installation costs. The catch is that you MUST put that meter on the TOU-EV-1 rate plan: \n\n* 9pm to 12pm: 13¢ per kWh\n* 12pm to 9pm: 37¢ per kWh\n\nThis puts me in a bit of a Catch-22. The main reason I want a quick charger (Level 2) is so I can charge up after work for later-in-the-day errands. However, that peak rate will cost more than the gas equivalent (I realize there are green benefits beyond the raw cost). If I’m only going to charge overnight at the off-peak rate, I might as well just stick with the slow Level 1 charger. I like the idea of upgrading my home with a second meter for this car (and maybe longer range cars in the future). And I love rebates. But to take advantage of the rebate, my daytime charging price will go up. So maybe I just go with the straight outlet addition (sans new meter, sans rebate). The downside is that simpler/cheaper job is only for a 20 amp circuit, so no future-proofing that outlet for a longer range car down the road.\n\nPutting my 2 issues together seems even more complicated—if I switch to a TOU rate with .47/kWh peak rate, I really won’t want to charge my car for a mid-day quick trip. But maybe I’m overthinking everything given the fact that I pay very little for my energy since I’ve gone solar.\n\nAny thoughts out there are appreciated. Sorry so long, but I thought I’d throw it out there so readers would have the whole picture.\n\nThank you in advance.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0014989807192857068,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23536727513277356,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20944397883188046,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2204079064199129,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.36786023713630367,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29309913636869656,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2316562146930087,"solar_1":-0.2620305334388765,"solar_2":-0.15785822326665938,"solar_3":-0.049655682955508006,"solar_4":-0.04044492540067361,"solar_5":-0.03844102295337442,"solar_6":-0.024765447498704973,"solar_7":-0.012654762023823688,"solar_8":-0.01904525065703419,"solar_9":-0.012514369715269424,"solar_10":-0.2607478932949482},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

The following is my own thoughts:\n\nIt's interesting and difficult to try to figure out what should happen to uneconomical constructions.  I think it's good that society takes risks and experiments, even expensively.  This work drew together a pool of new talent.  Without knowing the details of the case, the basic presumption should be beneficent.  Some of the people involved probably had beneficial life experiences, and some of them will find work elsewhere in an industry, with stronger resumes despite the failure.  Land values are low in the desert, so the risk that something more valuable would have been done with the land is strongly mitigated.  Las Vegas has large power demands and an advanced economy, so the chances that something useful can be done with potentially inferior infrastructure is better than usual.\n\nBankruptcies it should be noted discharge liabilities against an asset, and weak assets when shorn of liabilities often perform adequately well; in this way bankruptcy is not only a means of destruction, but also a means by which weak assets are renovated for the usage of society.  Very large investment costs are normal for utility-scale constructions, and those are no longer encumbering the asset when it is shorn by bankruptcy.  Thinking therefore about what should be done with the technology as constructed:\n\nCould this still displace any of the power generation in the vicinity of Las Vegas?  Concentrated solar is a dispatchable form of renewable energy.  The elevated costs shouldn't strictly be taken as lethal to the concept, since it functions analagously to Peaker plants, which always have higher costs.  Modern endeavors towards dispatchable energy have been turning towards the utilization of photovoltaic with battery-based \"virtual power plants\", but even if it's a little behind the curve, this is something that we've already built.  Note that Las Vegas is still using coal in part of its energy mixture, which is from an environmental perspective the climactic climate flop, as well as quite a bit of natural gas.\n\nTry selling the obsolete facility to the companies trying to use AI technology to advance the state of the art in solar concrete.  Concentrated solar can't be directly applied to solar concrete technology, but perhaps that AI guided mirror technology could renovate concentrated solar by increasing its energy collection efficiency.  The kind of people who use AI optimization tend to redline the infrastructure in other ways too, so they might either be better managers, or be capable of hiring better managers, as well as being inclined to identify and utilize new technological potentials in the construction of the system.\n\nThe following is a wild speculation:\n\nConcentrated solar has high maintenance costs.  I don't know what's involved in maintaining it, but I would expect that it takes some effort to keep all those mirrors clean and shiny in a dusty desert environment.  I wonder therefore if it would be economical to run an electric fog harp over each mirror.  The fog harp could operate to gather water for usage in a self-cleaning module built onto each mirror.  Any excess production of water could be sold to the grid as another form of utility, or alternatively, if the electricity is more valuable than the water, the fog harps could be powered only on minimal scheduling thereby functioning to save maintenance costs.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.35680709034204483,"1.1.1_stance":-0.286465474667853,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.07793462638073834,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17945664011448803,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3771455194120017,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29868169603126465,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1997613099700478,"solar_1":-0.12257533173834892,"solar_2":-0.08363059730892372,"solar_3":-0.30447400259251517,"solar_4":-0.06578622370520126,"solar_5":-0.10006917037851405,"solar_6":-0.06386271750490442,"solar_7":-0.08973871654236841,"solar_8":-0.03597819100993798,"solar_9":-0.034033523406563404,"solar_10":-0.29764257572261676},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Most likely the deal is neutral.  You may save some money or you may lose some money.  You are not going to lose the $162/month.  So if you took $18,000 and invested it at 8% you could make this payment every month.  So the worst this deal is going to cost you is $18,000.  I can almost guarantee you Vivint is going to want $20 to $30k to buy out this contract.  If the payment is fixed every month you are better off just sticking it out.  You want the house and sounds like it is worth the extra money to pay for the house.\n\nSo let’s say it is not a sellers market and you forced the owners to buy out the contract.  I will be really nice and say that he is paying $162 a month, and he saved $200 /month.  So he got $40*12*48 = $1920 or $2280 if his rate of return is 8%.  Now he has to pay vivint $20k, not a good deal at all.  He just lost $18k by getting a solar PPA.  \n\nThis is why I say Solar PPA’s in most parts of the US are a risky deal.  You could and probably will save a little money by having a PPA.  $10k over the life of the system.  The downside risk is this payout of $20 to $30k if you need to get out.  I just do not think it adds up.  If you want better numbers,  I would need the following - estimated system production in kWh per year, what are your net metering terms in your area, what does electricity cost from the utility, what rate does the utility buy your production that goes into the grid pay out, what percentage of the solar do you think you will consume either directly or through net metering.\n\nIn addition how long till the utility can change the net metering rules (how long are you grandfathered in for)?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0018014862046887477,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17218069294030547,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2924138945576278,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2469787643028308,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.35780437287984057,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16739207464459493,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09580787771847099,"solar_1":-0.3147677331090506,"solar_2":-0.07504898625473168,"solar_3":-0.13942926930758404,"solar_4":-0.06510302351012849,"solar_5":-0.00358019357372541,"solar_6":-0.027795301265238475,"solar_7":-0.02093193902207228,"solar_8":-0.070162349087845,"solar_9":-0.035305183596591405,"solar_10":-0.25124193457163757},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Biofuels derived from feces and garbage make sense but cannot on their own fuel all the vehicles needed. \n\n\nHydrothermal liquifaction is 90% efficient. It can be put in a solid oxide fuel cell and when mixed with a small heat engine using waste heat from the cell has a total thermal to electric efficiency of 85%. If one uses NYC daily garbage and sewage from 2016 with 85% efficient heat engines it's good enough to provide 7 times NYC electric needs but only half the transport costs. NYC already has a high population density. \n\n\nSo with an even higher population density and exclusively electric public transport and no more then an electric bicycle for private transport, then and only then can biofuels sustainably power the given civilization. Anything less and they are only supplementary. Also 100% of the food would need to be imported. Any vertical farms in the city is a net loss. \n\n\nAlso SOFC is expensive and requires lots of repair. \n\n\nWith liquid ammonia alkaline fuel cells that filter out atmospheric CO2 with all that ammonia produced from sunlight or fission, specifically small modular dual fluid breeder reactors or concentrated solar thermal, then and only then would fuel cells actually be economical. Solar panels would work too as would wind turbines, but since solar panels and wind turbines are both actually solar and since concentrated solar is more efficient it makes more sense to go solar thermal. Liquid ammonia since water and nitrogen are plentiful and it turns into water and nitrogen when used while also having a higher volumetric energy density then liquid hydrogen at room temperature with a moderate pressure same as your off the shelf propane tanks for the grill. \n\n\nUntil then, batteries charged by fossil fuels plants are more efficient then putting fossil fuels in a car. Hydronium ion batteries are not yet commercially available and have half the energy density of lithium ion, but they do charge very quickly. 30 kilowatts a kg. At that point it's an electric grid limitation and not a battery limitation. Non flammable non toxic abundant sustainable materials. Iron air fuel cells also have a decent energy density per mass and even better per volume. Recharging is difficult and mechanical recharging even more so. \n\n\nWhat I think is economically impractical but still technologically possible is to just us aluminum bricks water and a furnace with an external heat engine. Grind up the aluminum to combine with oxygen in the water producing heat and hydrogen, which burns in oxygen producing heat and water. In the end you have aluminum oxide left over. When refueling swap out the aluminum oxide for more aluminum bricks while water stays constant. But then gas stations are more like large factories. Think a sam's club gas station but with the entirety of the sam's club being the refueling station and refinery to turn alumina back into aluminum. Lots of metals can be used for this but magnesium has a lower volumetric energy density, iron has too low of a mass energy density lithium is too volatile zinc isn't competitive etc. \n\n\nTldr as it stands now without fall out fusion cores or dedicated nuclear fission/solar plants creating liquid ammonia, batteries are just our best option.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0017749224401389558,"1.1.1_stance":-0.34131982221865365,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23107822752612858,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.273669649225832,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3255189228254771,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.33301768742464416,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23213908457338733,"solar_1":-0.25954166636317194,"solar_2":-0.07344048575578868,"solar_3":-0.22003475718035284,"solar_4":-0.09342938647690364,"solar_5":-0.07555135371512733,"solar_6":-0.0021880947448759494,"solar_7":-0.002094476509228116,"solar_8":-0.005744748292878891,"solar_9":-0.041840772074813515,"solar_10":-0.02477797029375021},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed (with a slight lean towards pro, as the author expresses support for biofuels derived from waste and solar thermal power)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

You can make it about health. You can make it about economics (I have considered the possibility of social-engineering vegan eating in low socio-economic demographics. In their interest it's about saving on their grocery bill but in my interest it's about the reduction of suffering.) Or you can make it about animal rights, which is very valid.\n\nI do think the advocacy of animal rights is great but I don't see it as the root of veganism the way you do. As I said before, rights are a human construct; culturual. Humans had fully evolved before human rights arose as a concept. I think that sympathy and empathy precedes the conceptualization of rights.  It is by sympathy that I don't allow for the torture of other biological creatures. I don't need to think about these sort of platonic ideals to be decisive about where I stand on the issue.\n\nClearly some people lack this capacity for sympathy though. I can't imagine the sort of people that would have first started moving animals from the fields into tiny cages in the interest of their profit margin.  What I can imagine is that some of them would believe in absolute, objective morality. That's the problem. They'd disagree with you about what that absolute, objective right/wrong is. \n\nIn the end it's going to come down to personal sentiment.\n\nKeep on fighting your moral crusade. Go try to convince everyone that there's this platonic ideal of animal rights and that you have The Truth and that people need to convert. How has it been working out so far? On the other hand, if you actually want those animals to stop suffering my humble (I have no claim to activism) suggestion would be to stop thinking about why people must go vegan and instead consider how practical means to get people to become more vegan. Why vs how.\n\nThis may involve compromise which will no doubt blemish your idea of an objective standard. But the upside is that if you start getting more practical and less theoretical, less animals will suffer. And I'm pretty sure that will make all of us on /r/vegan *feel better.*","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-9.468409310405453e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1073258301394148,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3162734645108382,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08598133424917857,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23797686122320555,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14460361251469558,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.33584108230570564,"diet_1":-0.03295099738170393,"diet_2":-0.2001786665496584,"diet_3":-0.13638661854686993,"diet_4":-0.007475152097564812,"diet_5":-0.012515471954732979,"diet_6":-0.007841883690465087,"diet_8":-0.0027231160705317357,"diet_9":-0.0010516822124676157,"diet_10":-0.0030960783163512437,"diet_11":-0.00263825085615584,"diet_13":-0.00463001541114257,"diet_14":-0.006105583721364383,"diet_17":-0.03693102216736103},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (the author is addressing the vegan community in general, not a specific personal group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.","1.3.3_second_order":"none.","diet_1":"NO.","diet_2":"YES.

I have to ask you to forgive me for the tone of my text. I don't have time to edit it to sound nice. The arguments you give are hard to respond politely to.\n\n&gt;shouldn't you hate all carnivorous predatory animals?\n\nAfaik (I could be wrong of course) carnivores are a necessity and an unavoidable evil in the animal kingdom. Hating them is futile. I see carnivores as the doctors of animal kingdom, among other things of course. If you're having a bad time you're going to get eaten. The weak, sick and the old are the easiest to catch. \n\nAssigning responsibility to animals that don't possess our mental capability and therefore hating them for their evil deeds is silly. They do what they've been born to do. I 'hate' the fact that there is a system like that but then again it is the way it is and it has its benefits too. Even for the prey. Without carnivorism we humans probably wouldn't exist now.\n\nYes and no. It's futile and irrational. Hate is usually not a good feeling to have. Should we hate carnivorous omnivores such as the majority of humans? Would that be nice? Hate/dislike the action, not the actor.\n\n&gt;So that leads me to believe that vegans think eventually all animals will evolve to that point.\n\nYou are putting words into your friends mouth. It's very uninformed to believe so. \n\n&gt;Ridiculously hypocritical.\n\nYou are one of those people? Our hypocrisy frees others from doing anything? Everyone is a hypocrite but we do our best to be ethical. Would you sacrifice yourself for your ideology? For feminism? If you were on a desert island and had to mistreat women to get food, would you do it? If you wouldn't do it you would die from starvation.\n\nOur very existence causes harm to less fortunate humans and other animals. Should I kill myself? Absurd. Do you expect us to be the next Jesuses, perfect? Isn't that ridiculously perfectionistic? Should we also donate all our money to charity and all our free time to animal work? \n\n&gt;So just because you are dying and need sustenance to stay alive, then it's okay to eat animal protein?\n\nOur whole ideology or following is crap because of some unrealistic scenario that will never happen to any of us? That's the message I'm getting.\n\nDo you think it's better to do something than nothing towards a good goal? We are trying and demonizing us for it is in my opinion not nice.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2666539868273522,"1.1.1_stance":-0.052940891988009754,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23329062622596736,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14609727117709093,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18261258574693784,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19434385796520415,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23178077217010537,"diet_1":-0.08061254837153342,"diet_2":-0.20032882988393913,"diet_3":-0.107087994083516,"diet_4":-0.09192674238875043,"diet_5":-0.019076003959829297,"diet_6":-0.11039963193373599,"diet_8":-0.014108159599951856,"diet_9":-0.005649155068870944,"diet_10":-0.08916355591403165,"diet_11":-0.03525838845962426,"diet_13":-0.047705656480199345,"diet_14":null,"diet_17":-0.0825180933235697},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (for the shared belief that vegans believe in the evolution of animals towards veganism and the belief that hating animals is irrational).

Livestock animals are even fed the remains of other livestock species that perished before reaching slaughter. \n\nThe evidence is stacking up in favor of the idea that our omnivorous digestion stems more from our heightened curiosity when compared to other species than it does from our ancestors being carnivorous originally. There is value is dispelling myths and our omnivore roots likely have more to do with the discovery of cooking food than some genetic mutation that happened to improve our odds of survival. \n\nBut again your conclusion is the most important for practical purposes in the vegan debate.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00038843318907311186,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08700058793528882,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18878526689547478,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.036407375087340675,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1625682713519425,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06675605908033333,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04385227569097575,"diet_1":-0.3046554499548317,"diet_2":-0.003378253559882675,"diet_3":-0.12429236008573147,"diet_4":-0.00550316079594874,"diet_5":-0.000880614764658579,"diet_6":-0.0048226948686836595,"diet_8":-0.0008066427047500232,"diet_9":-0.0014764684747206047,"diet_10":-0.003021080995191975,"diet_11":-0.002360337314409359,"diet_13":-0.0017389079099909093,"diet_14":-0.028300463481476374,"diet_17":-0.003323209005126652},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
