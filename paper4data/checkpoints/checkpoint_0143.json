Don't forget that the *actual* new price people pay is nowhere near the MSRP after you account for subsidies like the $7500 federal tax credit and $2500 CA state rebate (and myriad other state incentives.) With very few exceptions, none of these subsidies apply when buying used.\n\nFor example, you mention a used Volt can be had for $15k-$25k. Well I'm currently seeing new 2014s advertised for $30k, and after the $7500 tax credit and $1500 CA rebate ($2500 is for full EVs), that's only $21k. Of course you'll pay a little more in taxes, since those are assessed on the pre-subsidy price, but still it makes those used prices sound not so hot.\n\nAs another example, my Rav4-EV has an MSRP of $50k, but I got it for $27,500 ($7500 tax credit, $2500 state rebate, $10k Toyota discount, $2500 dealer negotiation.)

I can't even tell you how much I love mine.\n\nThe RAV is the hidden gem of the EV world. The Model S looks like a gleaming space car from the future, the Leaf screams \"I'm shaped funny because I'm green,\" but the RAV4 just looks like a RAV4. The drivetrain is totally Tesla but it doesn't say Tesla on it. It's a full EV, but it looks like a normal, full-size crossover SUV. Nobody gives it a second thought.\n\nThat anonymity has worked against it when it's really the only EV in its class, and that class is actually pretty attractive. It's the only electric with a rated range of over 100 miles (and much more than that if you drive conservatively) under $40k, and the next step up is the $65k++ Model S. It's the fastest EV on the market that isn't the Model S. The RAV is certainly the largest consumer EV. But you really wouldn't know all that from Toyota's minimal advertising, Tesla's near-silence on their contributions to the car, or seeing one on the street.\n\nToyota's nearing the end of the production run just as people are starting to figure out what the RAV4 EV really is. Production is capped at 2600 units ending this year, and it sounds like there are only a few hundred more to manufacture. Since there's nothing else like it on the horizon (the Model X will start over $70k, the Model 3 is years and years away, and nothing else has been announced with similar size or EPA-rated range), I suspect many people are going to find out about it too late.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.013004609538863102,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17300680167244784,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15620923474073983,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12186108902096748,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2114139845555998,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14615098924888792,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22115898223632055,"ev_1":-0.2361029354700174,"ev_2":-0.025109518435783684,"ev_3":-0.003150048180638502,"ev_4":-0.0016277880810283325,"ev_5":-0.15958014372967924,"ev_6":-0.05516965691154496},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

It will always take more energy to produce hydrogen, transport it, then distribute it that it will to simply use the electricity to charge a battery.\n\n2) There is no infrastructure to accommodate a hydrogen economy. This infrastructure will be expensive, take a long time to install, and it's really just another way for oil companies to have something to sell to consumers. Hydrogen fueling stations have none of the advantages of charging whenever you want wherever you want, and the costs involved will likely always be greater than with electricity. We'll always need electricity in our homes, so we might as well use that infrastructure to power our cars too.\n\n3) Hydrogen as a fuel still has considerably more negative environmental impact, which is a key advantage of adopting electric cars. Producing hydrogen by electrolysis from water requires huge amounts of energy and will be extremely hard to accomplish on an industrial scale, so the hydrogen would most likely be obtained from natural gas. In that case, you might as well just use the natural gas to power the car in the first place. Electricity still has the option to be made from renewable sources cheaply and easily (even if it won't be 100% for a while); that's not the case with hydrogen.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008292289542926786,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2529640644788742,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20024322470029196,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.34832111453512354,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29461983289079047,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.004041374350587527,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17304734838850913,"ev_1":-0.11005839790369283,"ev_2":-0.10945052851578414,"ev_3":-0.20927780748388977,"ev_4":-0.04911104704903361,"ev_5":-0.009525562786924032,"ev_6":-0.18359669443104848,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.0722796645325919},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

Then the whole thing [dissolved](http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2011/04/19/judge-electric-car-bodies-belong-to-the-guy-who-didnt-build-them) in a legal mess.\n\nDetails on the battery are a little sketchy. Archive.org has a [cached copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20100510160449/http://www.envisionmotorcompany.com/vehicles/index.cfm) of their site. [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/2010/04/14/envision-motor-company-to-launch-with-trio-of-electric-vehicles/) states the battery is a sodium nickel 24 kWh unit that gives a \"(seemingly optimistic) 200 miles of range\". The [corporate blog](https://envisionmotorco.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/envision-motor-company-inc-launches-family-of-electric-motor-cars-emc/) claims 260 miles of range from the \"EVBX-1 sodium based battery\".\n\nAuto Rental News [caught up with the company](http://www.autorentalnews.com/blog/auto-focus/story/2011/10/kicking-the-tires-on-the-latest-alt-fuel-vehicles/page/4.aspx) at the 2010 Santa Monica Alt Car Expo and obtained some claims for the battery.  \n\n* 200 mile range, or 160 miles loaded with a lead foot\n* 8 hour charge from a standard 120V outlet\n* proprietary level 2 charger that delivers a full charge in 45 minutes\n* 380 pound battery weight\n\nBeing somewhat generous, it seems these cars would have struggled to compete with the Nissan LEAF at best; a standard 120V outlet (NEMA 5-20) can deliver up to 19 kWh in 8 hours, which at 90% charge efficiency is about 17 kWh into the battery.\n\nEMC reminds me quite a bit of [Coda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(electric_car), though Coda was significantly better funded and organized. Code started with a Chinese chassis and showed some promise to be a range leader. The initial car was offered with a 31 kWh battery and claimed 100-125 miles of range at a similar price to the Nissan LEAF; EPA testing showed very poor efficiency, and it was eventually rated at 88 miles of range. Coda promised a 35 kWh upgrade to boost range, but the company went bankrupt before the upgrade was available.\n\nUnlike EMC, Coda did sell a small handful of vehicles before dissolving. They were also one of the first companies to sell a vehicle with a 6 kW onboard charger, which is mostly standard now but unusual in 2010. Maybe a good thing too, since early Blink EVSEs would frequently overheat or melt when delivering 30 amps!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.03815712849609554,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06317199795917076,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23878404705104497,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06703323932985465,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2623748779913599,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20786362339810008,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10380962673419465,"ev_1":-0.22245884507204158,"ev_2":-0.015775548745295964,"ev_3":-0.013199406118170979,"ev_4":-0.004746227722835765,"ev_5":-0.006577376921387194,"ev_6":-0.006773158111779291},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

How are you going to get a decent battery that can provide that much range and still fit in the chassis of the car but still be profitable for them to make? \n\nMaybe they had battery supply issues, maybe they have no experience in making BEVs or no alliance / partnership with someone who does. Maybe they figure that the car is unconventional enough that they should stick to convention on some things to make it feasible for them to make, and convention thus dictated an ICE engine, transmission, etc. Not to mention it is really lightweight and a battery would've been heavy, shifting them away from what appear to be their design goals (super light, extremely efficient 2 person car). There could be all sorts of reasons, and only they know, but personally I don't think it's really fair to be frustrated that they're not making it electric (Or hybrid). Not everyone, quite honestly, can do that right now. At least it is an option to compete with something like a Chevy Impala or Ford Crown Victoria on MPG, and a further step down the road to reduced emissions and more sustainable transport. Not the step we want, but a step regardless.\n\nHeck, maybe their plan could be if this is successful to bring out a family of similar cars, one of which could possibly be an electric a few years down the line.

If you can't afford an electric car, then it isn't any easier than avoiding plastics. You can't do either. That's the predicament that people are presently in, and that's why they must continue to use products like gasoline despite being a vegan, an environmentalist, or whatever else that conflicts with gasoline usage. \n\nThe definition of veganism instructs changes 'as far as is possible and practicable', and while driving an electric car would definitely be the better choice it presently isn't possible or practicable for everyone. That doesn't mean \"avoid all oil and lose your job/home\" it means \"do the best you can and carpool, take the bus when you can, etc\" and make the choices that *are* possible to you. That's really all I was trying to say, which is my understanding of why there isn't a hard call to boycott oil usage as a vegan. *Hopefully in the future* this financial barrier comes down, because as you say all we have to do is \"just buy a Tesla\"... so hopefully more affordable options crop up soon. Honda is trying to get 2/3 their automobile sales to be electric vehicles, which could make things interesting.\n\nThis is all just my personal understanding of what the definition of veganism actually calls for. So someone else could have a different view of it. I guess to tie it back in to your original thoughts, the \"line\" would then be at the point where you can't really consistently achieve more than that, for whatever reason. There is this \"line\" at oil consumption because the vast majority of people can't practically do much better.

So that's what you have to beat... $18,250\n\nUsing a tile roof cost calculator the cost for a brand new Terracotta finished tile roof at 2000 square foot in central California would cost between $20,000 and $30,000 after all tile and installation costs. \n\nYou are already above your number.... \n\nEven if your roofing friends could charge half that for tile and you can charge bare bones and sell the Solar for 2.5 a watt (using a 5.5kw system to generate $150 in electricity), you still would be above 18,250\n\nSo how in the world does your math work?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007188323749384532,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06552967920947594,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1904998085953015,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2961548260920808,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2970872155014861,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2925556444093436,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.015445651059659818,"ev_1":-0.1582502638583189,"ev_2":-0.23012174973184674,"ev_3":-0.17467502846993893,"ev_4":-0.032490458038713164,"ev_5":-0.000979114614892751,"ev_6":-0.007811120798578486},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

The losses come from inefficiencies in battery storage (no better is 100% efficient) and motor performance (no motor is 100% efficient). That 80% is a minimum efficiency number; most cars do better.\n\nConverting the electricity from, say, solar into hydrogen is already less than 80% efficient. Converting it from natural gas means there's inefficiency PLUS the cost of the fuel PLUS carbon dioxide emissions. Then, there's converting hydrogen back into electricity- again, a process that never exceeds 80% and in fact rarely exceeds 60% efficiency and now the car uses that electricity.\n\nThe physics of hydrogen are just plain less efficient and potentially far more polluting than just sticking with electricity throughout the process.\n\nBack to politics and the environment; oil companies want to keep selling fossil fuels so it's to their benefit to keep pushing hydrogen. And in a few edge cases where electricity storage isn't up to the task, hydrogen might make sense. Someone above said ships, for example. Another edge case is cleaning up diesel exhaust by converting trucks, tractors, construction and farm equipment to run on hydrogen in internal combustion engines until production of electric replacements catches up. These cases will themselves disappear as better battery technology becomes available.\n\nConverting energy from one form to another always costs efficiency. Doing it as little as possible is more efficient and less complex.\n\nI hope that helps.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001289623833145015,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1143203902215177,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17726692335256625,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2017404578315715,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21721544963100942,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2256996608115614,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013224294414006485,"ev_1":-0.24692846927791834,"ev_2":-0.0008888844119307274,"ev_3":-0.015265798593948906,"ev_4":-0.00038463350635235355,"ev_5":-0.00016919731994372947,"ev_6":-0.03011291457733023},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Seems they are well-treated.\n\nAlright, this isn't the place to debate socio-economics, but I'll just point out that those incidents, lawsuits and unionization attempts paint a very different picture than them being \"paid and treated fairly\".\n\n> I don't really care about the right to repair concerns, as I stated earlier. It doesn't affect me. You can find examples of extremely costly repairs for any car\n\nIt does affect you though, said costly repairs are why right to repair is such a big concern that's been gaining traction, to bring down cost.\n\n> But it was not the company's policy to abuse customer video.\n\nNot in writing but by being a culture that managers were involved in it was de facto policy.\n\n> you can, for example, turn off the remote-sentry feature.\n\nThat was part of the issue, they could turn it on remotely to pull video. It shows a lack of care for security on the part of the company that they didn't properly set this up to prevent abuse and have management policy rules against it.\n\n> But I still see all of this as essentially insignificant when stacked against the monstrosity of Dieselgate. It's like two different universes of malfeasance. Dieselgate appreciably harmed the bodies of everyone on earth.\n\nI could make the same arguments for those labor abuses though not globally I suppose. You view the harm of Dieselgate as greater for that reason, I'd have to agree in an objective calculation.

People lacking the self control to not eat meat is a human selfishness problem, and has literally nothing to do with infrastructure.\n\nTechnology also won't save us - just because lab grown meat could potentially be an option that could reduce the amount of slaughterhouses and livestock feed farming plots, the actual solution is just stopping meat consumption on a personal level.

Almost all of his criticisms are aimed at ITER. He spends half the time attacking the D-T reaction, and the other half attacking the tokamak design's shortcomings.\n\nThen in the footnotes he replies to a Slashdot comment with the following, in which he shows an astounding amount of ignorance of how basic science works, and outright dismisses every alternate fusion concept.\n\n&gt; A reader on Sladshdot noted that the article above refers entirely to problems with DT fusion. I don’t believe that’s really true – the economic arguments remain no matter what the fuel is – but generally many of the nastier problems above are due to the neutrons and their handling. There are fusion cycles that use fuels that don’t produce (as many) neutrons, and therefore don’t suffer from exactly these problems.\n\n&gt; Ok, so let’s deal with that. To start with, even the simplest of these “aneutronic” cycles are orders of magnitude more difficult to accomplish than DT. We really don’t have any idea how to build a machine that can burn these fuels. If that weren’t enough, they produce less power output. So basically there doesn’t seem to be any possibility that these could be made to work economically in any future where anyone reading this is still alive to see it.\n\n&gt; The topic keeps coming up, however, because proponents of a number of fringy fusion machines claim they can do it – in spite of failing to get even close to working even with DT. A common example is the Polywell, a near mythical device that would almost certainly work if they could just get a bit more money. But they cant’s, it’s being kept down by The Man. Actually, it’s being kept down by plasma physics, but in spite of this, supporters keep grasping at it as tho holy grail of fusion. Similar machines like focus fusion and a host of others are similarly fawned over. Keep smoking that hopium!\n\n&gt; What’s more astounding is that the favoured aneutronic fuel is Helium-3, which is not even available on the Earth. Supporters propose building moon bases to mine it. The obvious ridiculousness of this concept is out of this world. Nevertheless, it’s worth looking at the math yourself.\n\nFinally, [Maury Markowitz](http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/u/maurymarkowitz) is clearly not a qualified source of information on nuclear energy; he works for solar power firms, and as he readily admits [on his Wikipedia user page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Maury_Markowitz): \n\n&gt; The quick-n-dirty description of me is \"failed physicist\" - **I took physics in U but I completely bit at the heavy math**. So now I'm a programmer, like all the other physicists out there. Eh, I don't mind that too much. I'm also a pilot, so unsurprisingly most of my edits are on science, tech or aircraft.\n\nNow while I despise ad hominem attacks, in science it's perfectly valid to question the credentials of a self-proclaimed expert. Put simply, Maury, if you don't understand the \"heavy math\" per your own admission, then what business do you have claiming \"the Polywell is being kept down by plasma physics\" when [their own, published, peer-reviewed papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0133v1) indicate that the physics are sound?\n\nMoving further, he's also completely oblivious to other potential fusion concepts like the Dynomak and General Fusion's magnetized target fusion design. Lockheed's [concept is a bit further out there](http://www.ipp.mpg.de/3787558/cfr?c=14226), but still by no means fringe - when I think fringe, LENR, Andrea Rossi and the E-cat come to mind.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010442693213311334,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3566170948977167,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21326573565888043,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25320246042390243,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20605765850316402,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.01953436100545029,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18411464114130163,"solar_1":-0.12421706508770507,"solar_2":-0.1484167670144719,"solar_3":-0.22848886334505225,"solar_4":-0.19988858697373266,"solar_5":-0.15815547076393463,"solar_6":-0.10668633373704021,"solar_7":-0.060113901656829206,"solar_8":-0.06917228795524959,"solar_9":-0.09420916707829008,"solar_10":-0.11659224763592219,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.08184801414608955},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author's stance is against solar specifically in this context, as evidenced by their criticisms and dismissal of alternative fusion concepts.

I'm in PG&amp;E territory, but I think it works the same in SDG&amp;E.\n\nWouldn't you go on Time of Use billing?  If so, your $/kwh is not a fixed rate.  $/kwh varies widely depending on time of day, season, and what rate tier you are in.\n\nAlso, SDG&amp;E should buy back electricity at full retail rate.  For example, if you generate excess electricity at 2 PM during summer peak rate hours, they will pay you $0.46/kwh for that excess electricity, not $0.04.  The $0.04/kwh only comes into play if you generate more electricity over the entire year than you used. However, you should not be designing a system that generates excess electricity over the entire year.  It should only cover about 80-90% of what you use.  80% if you are not using much electricity during summer peak hours, 90% if you do use a lot of electricity during summer peak hours (for example if you work at home).\n\nYou should not be getting battery storage.  Here's how it works.  During the day when your system is generating excess electricity, the utility pays you peak rates for that electricity.  At night, when you take electricity from the grid, you pay off-peak rates, which are about 1/3 of the peak rates.  That means if you generate 5 kwh of excess electricity during the day, you can use 15 kwh of electricity at night and still break even.  Also, this ratio varies throughout the year.  In winter months you might not generate much, if any, excess electricity during the day, but the TOU rates are cheaper in the winter.  In the summer when the TOU rates increase, you will make back your money.  You can also greatly benefit if you shift your electricity use during off-peak hours.  Wash dishes/clothes and run pool pump at night, for example.\n\nHere's real world example from my system in PG&amp;E territory.  After first full year of use, my 5.8 kw system generated 11,205 kwh of electricity.  I still pulled an additional 5,400 kwh from the grid.  However, I only paid $330 to PG&amp;E for the entire year for that electricity, which means I only paid $0.06/kwh to PG&amp;E. This is because they pay me more for excess electricity that I generate during peak hours than I pay them for electricity that I take from the grid at night. Installing batteries can not compete with $0.06/kwh.\n\nThe utilities realize they are being taken advantage of and AB 327 is designed to stop this, so make sure you get your system installed before July 2017 so you can get grandfathered in under the current rules.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0024065810963899517,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27391505021296325,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1942969496007048,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27441536326965404,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08619231258191715,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17450055529414366,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08553181192837656,"solar_1":-0.23413778483491052,"solar_2":-0.19744757510616368,"solar_3":-0.050365361307844206,"solar_4":-0.16485811370137893,"solar_5":-0.11069839423645882,"solar_6":-0.034722643215597294,"solar_7":-0.014965518159442581,"solar_8":-0.0648163059571137,"solar_9":-0.04684977755081121,"solar_10":-0.2617645951926605},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

When you take a statement of possibilities and state that it *will* happen, that's editorializing.  You doing so is no better than a news reporter reading a study about a slightly higher correlation between, say, apple consumption and cancer, then writing the headline, \"Scientists say apples cause cancer.\"  You are overstating what the IPCC has actually claimed and you know it.\n\n&gt;We are back to the precautionary principle. We have a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk...\n\nOf course.  But we know that increasing energy costs is not just a plausible risk, it's a documented risk to public health, safety, and welfare.  So the principle tells us that we must first cause no harm.  \n\n&gt;If you think that the IPCC (and scientists from governments around the world that make up the IPCC) are wrong in their conclusions then that is a different argument. In that case I must ask why do you think that?\n\nBecause economist Richard Tol, one of the lead authors of the report, resigned over how poorly they handled the economics portion of the report.\n\n&gt;I do however agree it will be the poor that suffers.\n\nI am glad we have some common ground.\n\n&gt;The hidden costs of energy article is interesting, but what makes you think the IPCC didn't factor those costs into its GDP calculations?\n\nThe report was after the AR5 cutoff.  Moreover, the IPCC is very selective with what they do consider.  Consider the many peer-reviewed papers that demonstrate that we lack the fossil fuel resources to legitimize the IPCC's emissions projections.  The IPCC opted to pretend those don't exist.

And my guess is, probably performance too, since solar thermal is more efficient than pv.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00118348477796341,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21999027726883003,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24334867325397447,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.32063882756094875,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23714542262732047,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20875117234382012,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02460502675967291,"solar_1":-0.1964304670641447,"solar_2":-0.10670865529046761,"solar_3":-0.20361300275787167,"solar_4":-0.14250791796421153,"solar_5":-0.08492292910142667,"solar_6":-0.0038347437948687,"solar_7":-0.120150164856265,"solar_8":-0.07955075465822178,"solar_9":-0.036630497991765765,"solar_10":-0.06036807185349365},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

In quick charge mode, the inverter is by-passed and the station is in charge of the correct parameters, (voltage, amps, etc).  Since lithium batteries are around 3.1 volts when low and 4.05 full (in EV's anyway), in my e-golf when a quick charge session is initiated, it'll display around 318volts in when I start.  Toward the end of the charge the voltage will rise to 358 or so volts.  The station has to be able to do this precisely as to not damage the battery.\n\nThe solar inverter would need all of this advanced circuitry in order to safely charge a car, and the costs would be extremely high (DC fast charging stations start around $20,000 and up).  The safest and easiest way is to feed the car 120/240 volts AC, and the onboard computer varies the inverter depending on the voltage of the pack and state of charge.\n\nIn theory, it could be done.  But your solar inverter would suddenly go from $1,500 to $5,000 probably, while all EV's come with an AC-&gt;DC inverter onboard already (most 6.6kW, some 3.3kW).  The added cost wouldn't be feasible for the negligible amount of efficiency gained.\n\nGood analogy is blood.  When blood is donated, it goes through a lot before it gets given to a patient in need.

It doesn't pay to produce more electricity than you consume because our utility company will not pay the consumer. Your power bill will also never be $0.00 as you still have to pay the utility a base rate to supply power to your house.\n\nAnother point to consider is how often you will have to replace the solar panels.

That's lower than the $60/MWh for the lower bound of coal, and substantially below the ~$100/MWh midpoint between the bounds.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010992853979890544,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20060244998603546,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18818415773356356,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.214518075188001,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19270237599718493,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2191958277253434,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3285531907652815,"solar_1":-0.0590542329403609,"solar_2":-0.13606680199435933,"solar_3":-0.02491597306652693,"solar_4":-0.11244979479549026,"solar_5":-0.033970863728124336,"solar_6":-0.0018364562953744705,"solar_7":-0.004728134488686919,"solar_8":-0.005409756071458105,"solar_9":-0.061514659660147686,"solar_10":-0.08014642643684056},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for solar and wind in this context)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

And, there's a few potential benefits here - in areas where running an additional 20 amp 240 volt service could be highly costly, with trenching for hundreds of feet (looks like EV ARC is set up to do 3.8 kW, hence the 20 amp circuit), it could help. And, in areas where demand-sensitive pricing is in use, it could be *vastly* cheaper to offer solar power that's not grid-connected.\n\n(Edit: That 3.8 kW may be outdated, or it may be 3.8 * 2, though, looking at the website - there's two EVSEs on the current EV ARC 4, apparently.)\n\n(Edit 2: Holy damn, I found where they were bidding on some contract in 2015.

For a project like you describe attending would allow you to evaluste a lot of alternatives.  Look at pv with fixed and tracking options.  Tracking more expensive but will get you far more hours of peak power.  Do you need to invert all your energy or might DC better fullfill many of your needs. Battery storage for industry can use a variety of systems/ different chemistries and flow batteries that may have cost/life/performance  advantages over vehicle batteriee like Lithium Ion.   Other energy storage like hydrogen or compressed air might have value in your industry since both might enhance your processes. Hydrogen production would also produce large amounts of oxygen.  Maybe in addition to pv concentrating solar thermal with heat storage  might have some advantages. Beginning your transformation to solar might be best done by using a variety of small test projects. Wonderful feature of solar is modular design of all components such as modules, energy storage, inverters.  As long as you want AC or DC power or thermal energy every component can be added to in the future as product availability, quality, costs improve over time. Building total project at one time won't allow you to take advantage of newer technologies in the future.  Step by step transformation towards as much clean, renewable, affordable, long lasting, job creating energy is effective for the bottom line of your business and the environment.

At UC San Diego, Project Scientists (https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-311.pdf ) are academic researchers who are expected to make significant and creative contributions to a research team, but are not necessarily leaders of the research team. Project scientist positions are similar to postdoctoral fellow positions, but carry more responsibilities, a higher salary, and are typically of longer duration. Project Scientists are not required to carry out independent research or develop an independent research reputation but will publish and carry out research or creative programs with supervision by faculty. University and public service are encouraged but not required, and this position does not have formal teaching responsibilities.\n\nUC San Diego will build a large research facility for distributed energy resources (DER) control and testing over 5 years. The DERConnect facility will serve as a national testbed for autonomous energy systems, distributed control algorithms, and electric vehicles, solar power inverters, smart buildings, and battery energy storage systems. This networked cyberphysical facility will enable the transition of the electric power system from a few centralized fossil generators to a renewable energy system with millions of interconnected, independent DERs in residences and businesses that would dramatically reduce costs and increase efficiencies.\n\nThe Project Scientist should have expertise in one or more of the following technical areas:\nDistributed controls including theory, algorithms, topologies, and implementation (Importance: high)\nHardware, e.g. through physical experiments and embedded programming (high)\nElectric power simulation systems such as Real-Time Simulators and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) (medium)\nCloud-based database systems, data workflows, and maintenance of open-source analysis tools (medium)\n-Power engineering including Phasor Measurement Units and Real-Time -Automation Controllers (low)\nDistributed communications including IEEE protocols, security, and synchronous operation (medium)\nAppointment durations vary depending on the length of the research project, availability of funding, and level of appointment (Assistant, Associate, or Full). We envision an appointment duration of 4 years total for the construction of the facility. The Project Scientist would be the intellectual lead during the construction and oversee an engineer, two postdocs, four PhD students, and a project manager. During transition to operations, we envision that the Project Scientist would become the director of the facility during operations. The Project Scientist would then have the opportunity to collaborate with partners across the US in proposal writing, experiment execution, and research papers.\n\nSince the work will be highly collaborative, excellent communication, team-building, and leadership skills are essential.\n\nRequired Qualifications: Doctorate degree or its equivalent. Appointment level depends on academic experience, scholarly achievements, and funding record.\n\nPreferred Qualifications: Postdoctoral or equivalent experience and commitment to independent research and funding, mentoring/training, university and community service, and to building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment.\n\nSalary is commensurate with qualifications and based on published University of California pay scales. Applications (CV, Research Statement, and Cover letter, at minimum) must be submitted to the UCSD on-line application collection system, AP-On-Line Recruit, at: https://apol-recruit.ucsd.edu/JPF02527\n\nThe Office of Research Affairs at UC San Diego is committed to academic excellence and diversity within the academic, staff, and student body. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\n\nRequirements\nDocument requirements\nCurriculum Vitae - Your most recently updated C.V.\n\nCover Letter\n\nStatement of Research\n\nStatement of Contributions to Diversity - Applicants should summarize their past or potential contributions to diversity.

The facts say otherwise.\n\n……\n\nThis is obviously untrue, but lets pick it apart.\n\nFor starters, the transition, even if it worked, would do nothing in the short term to address immediate problems.\n\nA better plan to alleviate immediate cost of living stress would be to build new coal plants. The Australian government plans to spend $13 billion on new grid capacity, enough to build 4 new coal plants. If this money was instead spent on coal plants, and the coal plants were sited next to coal fields, the coal costs would be pretty close to zero – the coal just has to be dug up and shovelled into the plants. If the planning approvals were fast tracked, and construction started immediately, within 2-3 years Australia would have a flood of cheap energy hitting the home consumer electricity market.\n\nSo renewables are already behind the cost of a conventional network upgrade, just on the cost of the network upgrade they would require.\n\nThen there is the cost of the battery backup. The Australian solar battery index suggests the cost of battery + inverter costs $1200 (AUD) / KWh.\n\nAccording to the Australian Government, Aussies consumed 265,232 GWh in 2020.\n\nDivide by 365 gives an average 726 GWh / day, or 726,000,000 KWh / day.\n\nMultiply 726,000,000 KWh / day by $1200 / kWh, and the cost of a single day battery backup is $871 billion dollars.\n\nOf course Australia would need more than a single day of backup, Australia experiences widespread wind droughts like everyone else. If we assume 7 days, we already have a cost of $6 trillion dollars, just for a week of battery backup.\n\nBatteries don’t last forever, so if we assume an average life of 10 years, that is $600 billion Australia has to come up with every year, just to maintain that $6 trillion battery pack.\n\nAnd we haven’t even started building and maintaining the required solar panels and wind turbines – at 20% loading we would require renewables capable of producing 726GWh / day + whatever additional power was required to cover battery losses and transmission line losses.\n\nOops I almost forgot – power use goes up in winter, just as renewable output drops. So the real figures for battery backup and renewable capacity are probably a lot higher than my rough calculation.\n\nI’ll leave that cost to your imagination.\n\nOh I almost forgot – the Climate Council also wants us all to switch to EVs, so we need a lot more power. Australia consumes around a million barrels of oil per day, so convert to GWh.\n\n1700 KWh / barrel of oil x 1000000 barrels of oil = 1,700,000,000 KWh / day, 0r 1,700 GWh / day, which has to be added to the 726GWh in the original calculation. If you think EV batteries could stand in for battery backup, think again – people need their EV charge to drive to work or whatever. So we really need at least $20 trillion dollars worth of battery backup, and $2 trillion per year to maintain it.\n\nDoes this still seem like the low cost option, climate council? People who are struggling to pay their energy bills don’t have the spare cash to buy an EV.\n\nObviously you can play with these numbers, assume the government would get a good bulk deal on batteries (though with Lithium prices skyrocketing, maybe not).\n\nPresident Obama once explained that the cost of the renewable transition would cause energy prices to skyrocket, because that cost will be passed on to ordinary consumers. But he never made it clear just how unaffordable it would be.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007424823670589831,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3849053515587002,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23425304364338342,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22214867599750435,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2848471477082028,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.11403493645290534,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.020634492990211584,"solar_1":-0.1773157908346942,"solar_2":-0.20715399469190743,"solar_3":-0.12482913971460702,"solar_4":-0.2304862244202918,"solar_5":-0.11000457322802967,"solar_6":-0.07508433279872406,"solar_7":-0.08882807475068451,"solar_8":-0.10912642824405339,"solar_9":-0.025675090150080848,"solar_10":-0.22463873404569767,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.16790007737775645},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I want a system where I can drop in a battery 5 years down the line if I needed to with minimal headache, and also a battery that can recharge itself. You need the IQ8's for that. If the grid is down for 48 hours, you need specific tech for that battery to recharge when the sun rises on that 2nd day. Most microinverter systems don't have that ability. It's 1 discharge and done until the grid is back. That's a luxury and a gimmick I'm willing to pursue someday.

They aren't even chargers. An EVSE works in conjunction with the car's on-board charger. I suppose the best way to describe them is that they are smart switches. In the case of the Zappi, from My Energi, for example, you can set it to the fastest charging circumstances will allow, or slow it down. Or, if connected to solar panels, grid, house battery, etc... the Zappi can make sure no energy goes to waste, by directing it to the car, back to the house/house battery, or back to the grid.

They had panels that degraded by .25% per year, while everyone else was at .55%, and .7%. It got them a lot of sales (I know, I sold them). But REC and Maxeon, (Panasonic are made on the same assembly line as the Maxeons), caught up. Lots of other companies like Hanwha Qcell popped up too. The conversation drifted away from degradation of one component, to overall efficiency and support of the system (in other words, do you buy a car because they use Goodrich vs Goodyear tires? No.)\n\nSunpower kept with that, though, and made some other poor choices, eventually selling their cell technology to Maxeon, who took over the manufacturing. Sunpower was relegated to selling systems with their direct sales force. Later, they added a \"dealers\" channel, and expanded their financing options. \n\nCash starting leaking, people weren't put off by a difference of .25% vs .55% degradation. Then this week they announced no more leases and PPA's because they have to have the cash on hand for them. Loans they didn't cut off, because that cash comes from the \"solar banks\" - the Mosaics, Sunlights, Sungages, etc, of the world. \n\nGet the datasheets off the Sunpower site or the Maxeon site, same thing.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003840330706831689,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07036978985540827,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.44050457576910657,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07400953397154808,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24767171402956045,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24934577302415123,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.024584093339702424,"solar_1":-0.019876101117309492,"solar_2":-0.0070719242770186,"solar_3":-0.1585278905222367,"solar_4":-0.006565929672736577,"solar_5":-0.0010381058612741374,"solar_6":-0.0010052704856207129,"solar_7":-0.0014351443266302037,"solar_8":-0.0027406441046575005,"solar_9":-0.011939553996247318,"solar_10":-0.013649782334444657},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other: The comment does not mention a personal relationship with Sunpower, REC, Maxeon, Hanwha Qcell, or any specific group.

I can't find any recipes that compare to my experiments, so here are some quick tasty meals:\n\n**Hash browns:**  In vegan butter, brown the hash browns on one side.\nAdd diced tomatoes and onions after you've turned the taters over.  \n\nNext add a lighter scattering of the following:\nSliced olives [any, but marinated kalamata olives are best]\n\nArtichoke hearts [again marinated are best, peel the outer layers off and eat them until you know you're only using the soft bits, dice the core of the heart and add it]\n\nDiced jalapenos if desired\n\nSliced radishes if desired\n\nSeason after cooking with garlic powder and parsley.  Top lightly with balsamic vinegar.\n\n\n**\"BLT\" Sandwich:** Vegan bread is the hard part here... Apply mustard to both slices of bread.  I prefer to use a spicy mustard [or horseradish] on one side and a sweet on the other.  \nIngredient layers:\n\nFresh spinach leaves\n\nTomato slices\n\nApply TVP \"bacon bits\" liberally [get them into the tomatoes, they do well with the moisture]\n\nSandwich sprouts [alfalfa/red clover/radish recommended, but any are good]\n\n\n**Spinach Pesto Pizza:**  [If you can find an acceptable pizza crust, or dough recipe.  Note that this is not the most healthy item in the vegan/vegetarian arsenal, but it'll quench a junk food craving without messing you up much.]\n\nSpread pesto sauce very thinly over pizza crust.  Add a layer of fresh spinach leaves.  Put on a second layer of pesto [it'll come out thicker over the leaf texture].  Add any toppings from the hash browns recipe or anything else you like on pizza.  Tomatoes [and basil] are essential, artichokes are great.  Cook until the crust reaches desired firmness.\n\nSpicy bean dips are another fun experiment.  I don't have a recipe that's solid enough to share, but if you can DYI it in a crock pot, your imagination's the limit.

The idea is ideal in that it proposes not wasting food (though I do not believe you've not wasted food simply because you ate it; if you're full and do not want anything more, then you're still \"wasting food\" by eating when you're no longer hungry); however, it also creates an incentive for omnis, who get a kick out of toppling the ideology of your lifestyle, to not finish their food and give you some of their leftovers, which will almost certainly include something a vegan would not eat. In their eyes, the bigger the slab of meat the better. Now of course I'm stereotyping and not every omni friend of yours would do this. Remember that episode of Seinfeld with the lobster? Kramer refused to allow Jerry's girlfriend, who kept kosher, to eat some lobster even after she begged. That's a true man of values.

There are countless possible scenarios in which they would no longer cause someone to refrain from abusing animals...but most strikingly, the environmental perspective does not, in itself, prevent one from walking onto a farm and stabbing a cow in the neck (just as the political experience perspective doesn't morally prevent the 1960's politician from secretly murdering a black guy). I need not give examples on the nutrition side of things, as the science is always changing.\n\nWe can therefore say that being vegan for the sake of the animals makes someone *more* of a vegan than someone who is vegan for other reasons, not only due to the motivation but because the principle is of non-harm morally precludes one from being justified in abusing animals. \n\n\n&gt;There is a difference. The difference is minimal though. Outcomes matter much much more.\n\nOutcomes matter \"much much more\" in a material sense, of course, because motivations are intangible. But there's no denying that the difference between manslaughter and premeditated murder is *huge*, due solely to the intention behind the occurrence. Intentions are of fundamental importance not when judging the effects of a crime, but when judging the moral character of the one who committed it.\n\n&gt; I get what you are saying, but again i don't see it beneficial\n\nI never said it was beneficial, I'm just trying to get at the truth.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0011495071327469002,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09104419955292542,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18634722974268314,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2676319479942322,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4195178511242072,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22958437971435208,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1986913798803774,"diet_1":-0.03862755917119406,"diet_2":-0.1798329483476664,"diet_3":-0.04568600629257465,"diet_4":-0.010752419447574843,"diet_5":-0.0036583808814611984,"diet_6":-0.007071252114352926,"diet_8":-0.004948774563672487,"diet_9":-0.0011438689834903926,"diet_10":-0.004114739710833722,"diet_11":-0.0009623983933124691,"diet_13":-0.0031762358703417704,"diet_14":-0.016479447059585556,"diet_17":-0.00321099911040316},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Some Jain scholars and activists support veganism, as the industrial production of dairy products involves violence against cows. Strict Jains don't eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most root vegetables involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees. Jains are also not supposed to consume food left overnight because of contamination by microbes. Most Jain recipes substitute for potato with plantain.\n\n[Negative utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_utilitarianism)\n\n&gt;Negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism that can be described as the view that people should minimize the total amount of aggregate suffering, or that they should minimize suffering and then, secondarily, maximize the total amount of happiness. It can be considered as a version of utilitarianism that gives greater priority to reducing suffering (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing pleasure (positive utility). This differs from classical utilitarianism, which does not claim that reducing suffering is intrinsically more important than increasing happiness. Both versions of utilitarianism hold that morally right and morally wrong actions depend solely on the consequences for overall aggregate well-being. 'Well-being' refers to the state of the individual.\n\n[Deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology)\n\n&gt;In moral philosophy, deontological ethics or deontology (from Greek: δέον, 'obligation, duty' + λόγος, 'study') is the normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action. It is sometimes described as duty-, obligation-, or rule-based ethics. Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to consequentialism, virtue ethics, and pragmatic ethics. In this terminology, action is more important than the consequences.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23118218917988997,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2273046794908207,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16197995029655185,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3201614398318187,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3062683020101896,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2108345629209991,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2661437997947362,"diet_1":-0.10683773908870837,"diet_2":-0.35882596243885523,"diet_3":-0.183751386487971,"diet_4":-0.030529106630638125,"diet_5":-0.052410606889073584,"diet_6":-0.05410411949863677,"diet_8":-0.003699175982243711,"diet_9":-0.010448117676181331,"diet_10":-0.046821638798670996,"diet_11":-0.012966554432447689,"diet_13":-0.08216388082259954,"diet_14":-0.18379682269854433,"diet_17":-0.0411503409583626},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.
