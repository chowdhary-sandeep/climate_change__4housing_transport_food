I'd like to see beter EV's but I'm pretty tired of these kinds of press releases that have nothing to show but a spreadsheet and some predictions. Show us something that works, has range, and actually exists. To use your analogy, they keep announcing their flying car but I haven't seen anything airborne. At the rate they are going Tesla is going to launch a electric aircraft before we see any of these things on the market.",

But in the same breath it is understandable that the gigafactory will drop demand of batteries on the market. So a drop in price wouldn't only happen for Tesla now the question is more on the lines of how probable is it that the impact will be enough to push the price to $100/kw on the open market. Atleast thats how I see it.",

"comment": "&gt;One big upgrade on the performance front is a 25-percent boost in output from the hybrid powertrain that marries a pair of electric motors to a 1.4-liter inline-four gasoline-burning generator. The increase is said to be enough to drop 1.5 seconds off the 0-60 time, now quoted at 6.4 seconds. It'll travel for up to 39 miles on electric mode alone, but with the generator spooled up will go up to 330 miles before needing to stop.\n\nStill underwhelming for the asking price. Might as well kept the original price and upped the electric range to 100 miles and 400 or even 500 miles total with the ICE generator. That would have made it a lot more desirable and could have been marketed as a more practical car than the first entry level Tesla.",

No alternator going out and draining your battery.  Its also cleaner for the environment.",

They sell cars that barely make a profit, thats pretty normal- but setting up batteries for the big boys could be a huge profit center since hes got the infrastructure.  In the end, BMW can afford it, and they better do it now because at some point soon, the game will change quickly.  Some crisis in the middle east, or, some other manufactured \"refining\" bullshit will skyrocket gas prices (probably right after the election,) and people might finally be willing to make the switch since there are some options.",

The brains are actually the software that sends commands to control power flows between the DC bus and the AC bus, deciding when to charge or discharge the stationary batteries or the mobile batteries (the car), or in the future to do demand response (DR) or act as a distributed energy resource (DER) for a utility.\n\nI don't know if Tesla has their own controller with their own software, or if they use someone else's, but I suspect they will do their own software eventually since it's the key to all they want to do with power.\n\n(I don't work at Tesla, but I do write that kind of software for a competitor.)",

"comment": "From an article about this in 2014 by Thom Hartmann\n\"Things were going well for the Post Office. They were making money. They were even seriously considering replacing a large part of their fleet – the largest fleet of vehicles in the nation – with electric vehicles. It would be a huge boost for the electric car, and a huge slap in the face of oil barons like the Koch Brothers.\n\nThe Post Office had to be stopped, and Republican Congressman John McHugh (NY) was the man to do it. He had been a member of the Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council or ALEC, and was deeply in the pocket of right-wing interests. In 2006, he succeeded in proposing and then watching pass the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. It was passed by a voice vote in a Republican Congress and signed by Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nWhat the law did was ram a poison pill down the throat of the Post Office. It required the USPS to pre-funding its Retiree Health Benefits Fund for more than seven decades out into the future – and do it all within ten years. With this law, Congress forced the Post Office to set aside money for the health benefits of future retirees who aren’t even born yet.\n\nIt’s an obligation that no other private business or government agency has ever had to comply with before. And it costs the Post Office $5 billion a year.\n\nSo the news media thinks ending Saturday delivery to save $2 billion a year is worth reporting on. But a Congressional requirement that sucks $5 billion out of the Post Office annually doesn’t even receive a mention.\n\nThe Post Office was regularly running surpluses prior to this poison pill legislation. But every year since, the Post Office has lost more and more money to that retirement fund for people 75 years from now. So they're now ending Saturday delivery, looking to close offices around the nation, and will likely lay off tens of thousands of unionized workers.\n\nOf course, the big winners in all of this are private mail carriers like FedEx and UPS that eventually won’t have to compete with the Post Office and its ability to send a letter from Florida to Alaska for less than 50-cents. Or its ability to offer Saturday service at no extra cost. Private mail carriers charge between 50x and 100x more than the USPS when it comes to paper mail delivery.\n\n The passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act in 2006 was the culmination of a relentless effort carried out by Conservative Koch-funded think tanks like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), CATO, and the National Taxpayers Union, that had spent years writing papers and lobbying Congress to privatize the Post Office.\n\nA common misconception is that the Post Office is a government agency funded by taxpayer dollars. That’s not true. In fact, the Post Office has largely been self-sufficient since the 1980’s and only recently has been forced to appeal to Congress for help since it swallowed that Republican poison pill in 2006. But the Post Office does have to fulfill a requirement by the government to provide universal service. It also was given a monopoly over most paper mail delivery.\"",

This is 10 billion euros more compared with last year’s planning round.\nThe company's supervisory board voted on Friday far-reaching capital spending plans to begin mass production of electric vehicles in Europe, the most radical strategy shift since VW's diesel cheating scandal in 2015.\n\n&gt; VW said it could build up to 15 million electric cars over several years on its new MEB electric vehicle platform. Management this week outlined plans for converting Germany car plants in Zwickau, Emden and Hanover to build electric cars, providing job guarantees to workers until 2028.\n\n&gt; The I.D. Neo hatchback, the first of VW brand's I.D. family of affordable electric cars, is due to roll off the production line in Zwickau in 2019, as the plant ramps up to a production capacity of 330,000 electric vehicles.\nMass producing electric cars will help VW reduce the cost to the same level as current diesel vehicles, VW Group CEO Herbert Diess said at a news conference in Wolfsburg, VW's home town.\n\n&gt; \"Very emotional vehicles, high economies of scale, I think we will be the most profitable company in electric vehicles,” Diess said.",

"comment": "&gt; but is this a heating problem\n\nYes\n\n&gt;is this a a mechanical issue\n\nYes\n\n&gt;is it a chemical issue in the electrolyte?\n\nYes!\n\nLol sorry had to do it. Here’s the non-ELI5 version:\n\nThe battery is an electrochemical device that can only absorb a given amount of energy. Charging Li-ion occurs by intercalation of lithium ions and electrons on the electrodes. Trying to push more energy into Li-ion than it can effectively absorb creates an over-feed condition. Metallic lithium builds up on the anode, resulting in lithium plating that forms dendrites which compromises safety and shortens battery life. The same symptoms also occur when charging Li-ion at cold temperatures when the intercalation is slowed.\nCharge acceptance is governed by cell design, and Li-ion comes in two versions. The Power Cells with its large surface area permits high load currents and fast-charging. This cell is used for power tools and less for EVs because of low specific energy. The more common Energy Cell has a high specific energy (capacity) but its current handling is limited; it also requires longer charging times that the Power Cell. The EV battery is a hybrid gravitating towards the Energy Cell for high capacity and long range.\n\nThe exception is lithium-titanate, a lithium-based battery that can be fast-charged. This is made possible by replacing the carbon anode of a regular Li-ion with lithium-titanate nanocrystals that offers far greater surface area, allowing electrons to enter and leave the anode quickly. Li-titanate is used by some Japanese EVs, but the battery system is expensive and has a lower capacity than regular Li-ion.\n\nTo achieve fast charging and long driving ranges, the EV battery is being oversized, and the Tesla S 85 is such an example. Supercharging its 90kWh battery dumps about 90kW into the battery. This represents a charge C-rate of 1C for a time. As the battery fills, the C-rate falls to a more comfortable 0.8C, and then goes further down, avoiding harmful battery stress that is related to ultra-fast charging.\n\nPeople ask, “Why does an ultra-fast charger only charge a battery to 70 and 80 percent?” The simple answer is, charge acceptance is best in mid-range; battery stresses are also reduced in mid-range.  \n\nWhen putting the battery on charge, the voltage shoots up. This behavior is similar to lifting a weight with a rubber band in which the weight, or charge, lags behind. Depending on charge times, Li-ion is about 70 percent charged when reaching 4.20V/cell, a voltage threshold that is common with Li-ion. At this phase, the current begins to taper and charge acceptance slows.\n\nUltra-fast charging Li-ion must meet these conditions to minimize stress and maintain safety:\nThe battery must be designed to accept an ultra-fast charge.\nThe battery must be in good condition. Aging slows charge acceptance.\nUltra-fast charging only works to 70 percent state-of-charge (SoC); topping charge takes longer.\nAll cells must have low resistance and be well balanced in capacity. Weak cells are exposed to more stress than strong ones. This worsens condition of the weak cells further.\nCharge at a moderate temperature. Low temperature slows the intercalation of lithium-ions, causing an energy over-supply. Unabsorbed energy turns into gas buildup, heat and lithium plating. Some large batteries include heating and cooling systems to protect the battery.\nIncreasing the charge current is simple — assessing how much energy a battery can absorb is more difficult. An analogy is a high-speed train traveling at 300km per hour (188 mph) on a good track. Powerful motors are easy to build, but it’s ultimately the track that governs the speed. In the same manner, the condition of the battery dictates charging times. \n\nA well designed ultra-fast charger evaluates the battery condition to match the charge current with the abortion rate. The charger should also adjust to temperature and observe cell balance. Furthermore, the recommended ultra-fast charger should have three settings: Overnight Charge (0.5C); Fast Charge (0.8–1C) and Ultra-fast Charge (above 1C). This allows the user to limit ultra-fast charging to only when needed and at a suitable temperature. While such a charger may not yet exist, basic battery knowledge and common sense should prevail when charging batteries in an unconventional way.\n\nIt is best not to fully charge Li-ion. Every reduction in peak voltage of 0.10V/cell is said to double the cycle life. (See How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries.) This is why EVs only operate the battery between 30 and 80 percent SoC when new. The BMS widens the SoC bandwidth as the battery ages to maintain the desired driving range. Equally important are cool temperatures and moderate charge rates.",

"comment": "Something like 60% of households have off-street parking, and electric sales have stalled at something like 2% of the market, I’d be reluctant to accept that as anything close to a total explanation.\n\nI suspect it’s more to do with cultural differences in the small market niche that buys electric cars, i.e. well off people who are able to buy electric cars are not necessarily as a generalised group so politically engaged with climate change as the equivalent person in the Netherlands or Germany. It’s the Top Gear / Alan Partridge effect. I expect British people will need a bit more of an economic incentive.\n\nAnd it could also be that right hand drive cars lag behind left hand drive, so the new, interesting cars which are driving the increase are less available than in other countries in Europe.",

So still 8kwh or ~10% missing.\n\nSo obviously there is more going on. He speculated it might be due to worse thermal management from Audi or maybe a more careful one because the data Tesla already has allows them to play it less safe.\n\nBut then looking at the EQC, Merc with a similar weight and similar tyres seems to get very close at 90km/h. So for the difference between them I wouldn't be surprised if it's almost entirely due to worse aerodynamics.",

Seems like driving a PHEV into the ground would be even better.\n\nThat being said, the incentives may be messed up.

Takes about ten seconds to swap your batteries. You see and hear Gogoros everywhere now, all around the country. Someday (hopefully sooner rather than later!) the swarms of stinky and polluting petrol scooters will be fully replaced by electrics.\n\nTop speed of the scooter is 90 km/h and it rides real nice around 70-80 km/h even with a passenger. Great acceleration, fun styles, cost is around $3k USD or $2k after subsidies. Monthly battery subscription plan from $10 to $40 per month depending how much you ride.\n\n“Range” doesn’t really matter since battery swap stations are so common and only take ten seconds to swap. But as a matter of interest, I get around 50km real world range between swaps.",

There are multiple standards within which there is a decent amount of 'play' for each of the vendors to implement things slightly differently.\n\nOne of the more progressive charging networks here in Spain just rolled out plug and charge on their network. It seems to have been quite successful but at launch its only available for *some* vehicles on chargers from a single manufacturer. All the VAG cars currently incompatible as they use a different, slightly older protocol and if I remember correctly, number of their older chargers don't have any plug and charge support.\n\nIf it can eventually be implemented reliably I think it's the ideal payment method. Having card terminals would be great for travelling and infrequent users. But plug and charge actually improves on the petrol station experience as you literally pull up, plug in and that's it.",

"comment": "Clearly, some things are no longer up for discussion.\n\nIn a current TV ad from the Clean Energy Council, there is an old guy on a seat who sees a battery the size of carry-on luggage wheeled into the local country fire station.\n\nHe comments, ‘As if that battery’s going to make that much difference!’\n\n‘Well, it’s going save us some money. When the sky is black and the bushfires are rushing in,’ says the guy with Yackandandah Firefighter emblazoned on his work shirt, and with a meat pie in hand, ‘that battery’s going to help us save lives. Nearly 30 per cent of Australia’s power is renewable. And soon it’s gunna be 50’.\n\n‘Yeah but…’ says the old guy.\n\nHe is cut off by the mellifluous narrator saying, ‘No more, “yeah but…”, renewable energy is here now’.\n\n…….\n\nIn the ad, the company logo is indicated on the battery, but it is not clear whether its usable energy is 6 or 12 kWh. Our national electric energy use per year is 229 billion kWh which is about 24 kWh per person per day. So the fire station battery might indeed be useful in keeping a light on and recharging some phones for some hours.\n\n…..\n\nBatteries! Bjorn Lomborg points out that ‘all the batteries in Europe could store power for just 1 minute and 21 seconds of the continent’s average electricity demand’. Utility scale battery storage in the USA increased rapidly to a total of 2,600 MW last year, still about 0.5 per cent of its combined wind and solar at 495,000 MWh production.\n\nAustralia is the ‘great leader’: in 2017 we installed the largest lithium-powered battery in the world with 100 MW capacity, then pressed on to 150 MW so it could power Adelaide for 3 minutes rather than 2 minutes if the network failed, as it had before. Hornsdale can now hold 194 MWh of electrical energy, but Australia needs 627,000 MWh per day.\n\nThe Victorian Big Battery outside of Geelong, with 300 MW power capacity and 450 MWh of energy, uses 212 Tesla ‘megapacks’ each the size of a shipping container. After a protracted fire led to updating its safety procedures, it is now running. The Victorian government renewable energy page assures us its 450 MWh, if fully charged, could power 1 million homes for 30 minutes. How many homes are there in a state of 6 million people?",

"comment": "Lots of good explanations about how electricity works here, but I don't find that I need much of an understanding of those concepts to shop for or own an electric car. Similar to how you can own a modern gas vehicle with zero understanding of how fuel injection works, what a turbocharger is, how many liters your engine is, etc. Those details are there if you want them, but you can treat the engine as a black box that demands gasoline and periodic oil changes and you'll get along fine.\n\nWhen shopping for an EV, I basically only need to know the estimated range and charge speed to understand the EV portion of the vehicle. Range is a factor of battery size (kWh) and efficiency, but as a bottom line, I just need to know how far the car can go on average before needing to be charged. If road tripping, I need to know how fast it can charge, and how easy it will be to find chargers. I can then compare range and ease/speed of charging as a factor when shopping various models.\n\nNow that I own an electric car, I just need to know the approximate remaining range and how long it will take me to charge at home (level 1 or level 2) or on the road (level 2 or level 3). Both of those things are very easy to grasp, the car will often directly tell you this information, and there are apps that help you plan road trips. Owning an EV is really simple, especially if you can plug in at home.",

The bottom line is that they're willing to take risks while established automakers are much more risk averse. \n\n10 years ago when you ask the *consumers* what features an EV should have - you sort of just end up with the Leaf/Bolt/i3 etc. \n\nIf you tried to pitch a high performance $40k+ EV with high tech 'cool factor', most board rooms would have laughed at you. No, market research indicates that potential EV buyers heavily intersect with Prius owners. Ergo - design an electric Prius. \n\nThe research wasn't necessarily wrong either - the market segment simply didn't exist yet. Or in other words, consumers didn't know they wanted a high performance 'luxury' EV with that high tech cool factor. \n\nSo in comes Tesla - they figure they'll just make this market segment if it doesn't exist. Fools! BMW/Audi/Lexus etc. owners would never buy an EV?! Are you nuts? Most $40k+ EV owners nowadays came from much cheaper ICE vehicles - these consumers migrated to this segment. And that's the sort of risk taking that was required to make a completely new market segment.\n\n> If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses  - Henry Ford",

Tesla does themselves no favors by intentionally confusing a term of art/marketing like self driving or more precisely Full Self Driving, which doesn’t mean anything specifically, with the engineering specific/certifiable [Autonomous Driving Levels](https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html). \n\n There is that big jump from level 2 to 3, from driver responsible to vehicle responsible. I took a quick search and nothing definitive either way but the tea leaves suggest they are farther away from level 3 than a number of peers. \n\nI personally don’t care about it. I want to be involved a little in the driving experience but am interested in it generally since it’s very interesting technology",

"comment": "Electrek certainly covers a lot more topics these days with their expanded staff.  However, that doesn't mean the bias is gone.  I think a lot of the additional coverage isn't even automobile related.  \n\nIn a recent article, I think it was this week, Fred was covering Tesla's referral program updates and mentioned his Tesla referral code and asked people to email if they want it.  I believe the only reason he didn't put it in the article is because Tesla put the kibosh on EV content creators putting their referral codes directly in the articles / videos.  Maybe because it made the shilling way to blatant and turned people off.  Maybe because last time it led to \\~50 people earning free Roadsters.  Both Fred and Seth included.  That's $500k worth of cars in rewards they earned... and ironically are still waiting for.  I imagine they've earned a lot more free stuff from that program.  \n\nAt one point after this supposed falling out, Fred began covering solar more, except that he almost exclusively posted Tesla solar articles, not even bothering to cover other solar companies.  When I called him out on it... he said something to the effect of, \"Tesla is the largest solar installer in the US\".  Actually, they weren't, I believe they were around 4th or 5th at the time... yet you didn't see him posting articles about Sunrun...(#1 at the time) or any other top solar installer.\n\nIt was also after this supposed falling out that Fred started doing the \"TSLA\" ticker in his Tesla articles.  They can fall out all they want, but when a man's got a lot of money riding on that company's stock... he has a reason to continuously bring publicity to it and keep eyes continuously locked on the brand.\n\nWhether it was a real falling out or not... it certainly didn't stymie the amount of coverage Electrek dedicates to Tesla even today.\n\nBTW, I just posted a direct example of him editorializing in his article headlines as late as yesterday in defense of Tesla.\n\nOne issue I've always had with this reporting is the overwhelming number of Tesla articles these EV \"news\" sites put out.  For a company only producing 4 vehicle models... and with so many other companies putting out as much new stuff as they are or the amount of developments in their supply chain and technology, it still amazes me that Tesla alone still likely gets about the same volume of overall coverage as all of the other OEMs combined.  \n\nTesla's still getting dozens of articles per week per site, and have consistently gotten dozens of articles per week for going on 6+ years now.  What's Ford, GM, Hyundai, VW, Mercedes, BMW, etc... get... like 1-2 articles per week if they're lucky?  No wonder the narrative is always \"Tesla versus everyone\".",

Although the competition is starting to catch up, I still don’t think the value is nearly as good.

I was trying to get at the point that even if every single panel on the roof fell apart at the end of the warranty, for $1.15/watt (the price delta mentioned earlier), you can get a full set of panels reinstalled.  Since I can say with strong confidence that panels will not fail in that frequency, that extra money *really* isn't buying you anything.  \n\nWarranty-wise, every time someone buys a non-SunPower panel, they are guaranteed to be saving money.  That might sound a little harsh, but that's how the numbers work out.  =)",

The bus routes I used to drive for my undergrad University ranged from somewhere on the order of 200-450 miles per day.  At best, with a batch of solar panels on board, the buses on the shorter routes could make it through a single service day by more or less draining their batteries.  Even with that, the longer routes would have to charge or trade off vehicles twice per day (assuming a fullly charged vehicle every morning).\n\nWould it be worthwhile from an environmental and operating cost perspective?  Probably.   Though the Proterra documentation implies that the thing would have to take a 5% hit in power...",

Also, my understanding is that existing solar users will be grandfathered in for 20 years.\n\nGoal of most solar users is to save money.  Also, going off grid doesn't make sense. Going off grid would mean you'd have to generate enough electricity to meet your daily peak demand on a rainy day in the middle of winter, or have an insane amount of battery storage.",

"comment": "Yes well we see what we want to see and we hear what we want to hear. I see things in a different way and I'm okay if you disagree but I'm glad you replied because I want to introduce another factor here. \n\nSo as /u/CommercialSolarGuy pointed out, among the surfaces that they simply avoided including was parking lots. As we know, many parking lots are already being covered in solar with today's technology so this is not some wild speculation to point out that they are erring on the conservative side in using restrictive definitions. \n\nThe extended point I wanted to bring in is this one: what about walls rather than rooftops? No solar installer today is going to advise you to install solar on the walls of your house even if you have south facing walls with good sun exposure. This isn't because there are no walls on any buildings which get a few hours of sun a day. No, there are no doubt hundreds of millions of square yards of built space with walls which receive sun for several hours of the day. The reason the installer wouldn't dream of installing solar on those walls is because of the current pricing and the imagined need to maximize the effectiveness of the panels. That is the trap of thinking in terms of a snapshot of today's market and trying to extrapolate into the future. \n\nIn fact, there is nothing at all wrong with putting a solar panel on a wall which gets a few hours of sun a day if the price is right. The question is: how much? This is the moving target that I'm referring to. I would sure as hell put panels on the walls of my house if the prices drop to $0.30 a watt and you may notice I am a bit stuck on that figure because from my own calculations that is the point where PV crosses over into solar thermal's territory. \n\nAt that point I wouldn't care about storage anymore for local HVAC needs because every PV panel would be cheap enough to simply dump the current into resistive heating elements for heat storage and compressors for ice storage and I'd put panels everywhere including the north side of the roof and the walls of the house. That's the future that NREL doesn't seem to want to imagine. They don't seem too eager to get too far outside the box but when you're talking about the future you have to imagine that things might be different than they are now because it will no longer be now.",

You generally have to get approval for the interconnect before you start construction.    When the system is installed and inspected, then the utility will come out and check things out.   They will then change the meter if needed for their purposes and issue you PTO (Permission To Operate).",

What % should each party bear?\nI don't buy the argument that solar replaces the need for peaker plants. Peaker plants are on the way out, at least in California. \n\nResearch the 'duck curve' pattern for loads. This pattern would become more pronounced as solar installations increase. It is a valid concern for utilities in recouping the money invested in the grid.\n\nI think a fixed monthly cost of 30-40 dollars for grid connection and charging consumers a slightly higher rate than energy wholesale prices would be fair for all parties.",

The primary one is the rather expensive SMA grid tie inverters which have a secure power mode that will generate power without the grid and without batteries.   \n\nThe issue is that it is very expensive for the power you get and requires extensive over production to get the power you need.  A battery system would be much cheaper.   \n\nThere are many people with small batteries off grid as /u/mbfire is looking at.   \n\nThere are people with single use systems that are off grid as I already stated.

"comment": "I've been thinking about your post for awhile, and I think your best bet would be to find off-takers for the electricity that your solar farm could produce. Let's just assume you do a 100MW solar array on your land and you have transmission lines adjacent to your land which you could interconnect to. Finding a developer to build and finance the 100MW project is the easy part, if you have buyers for your electricity.\n\nDirect corporate purchases of solar power is on the upswing, and Texas has a de-regulated electric grid, which means you can develop a power plant, interconnect it, and sell the electricity to a buyer. This buyer could be in Houston, or it could be local manufacturers/farming operations, or even community members when it comes down to it. \n\nNo matter how you cut it, the next step after confirming your proximity to transmission lines in your project development will be to find a buyer willing to purchase your electricity if you can deliver it at equivalent cost.\n\nYou could familiarize yourself with ERCOT's regulatory structure. You will be selling the energy, with transmission and distribution charges added on top of that. While you will need a consultant to put it all together (I don't know how you overcome the hurdle of selling to a customer that needs 24/7 access to energy and you not generating electricity 24/7... you may need other power generation partners on this), in theory, if you have the business contacts you should be able to put a deal together. \n\nWhat bothers me about the your consulting agreement is not the $3k of the contract. That's chump change and I've charged much more than that for similar development services. What bothers me is that there's no mention of how they're going to identify a buyer of your electricity. Before you contract with TSES, you should ask them that question.",

I don't think you understand how expensive the actual quotes would be for that kind of a project. I'm sure you could find some online calculator that could bend the numbers enough to make it appear that cheap, but once you actually get the quotes for the project it will be extremely close to what Tesla is offering.",

You could  spend $2-3K on energy efficiency upgrades (smart thermostats, LEDs, better insulation, etc) to SAVE the equivalent amount of kWh per year compared to double or triple that cost to GENERATE that kWh with solar. \n\nFrom a business perspective, people would much rather sell you that additional $7K worth of solar at a 40% margin compared to $3k worth of energy efficiency products at a 25% margin.  \n\nThat's why you generally don't see solar companies offering energy efficiency.

"comment": "What is the long term financial benefit of Powerwalls in 1:1 net metering areas? Do you have any sources to back up your claim that they are worth the money in the long run? If so I would love to read them. When I talk about Powerwalls not being \"worth it\", it's because battery backup typically adds 4-5 years to a solar PV system's ROI. I have a BSBA in Finance and Sustainable Energy and have worked my entire career in energy policy and residential solar project development. Rest assured, if the typical customer were only into money for solar, the market would be nowhere. There are plenty of other investments that yield a much stronger return than a small-scale residential solar array. The typical customer does, in fact, care about the environment and doing more to protect our planet. At the same token, the typical customer does not have an additional $8,000-$10,000 for battery backup, which is the typical all-in cost for a Powerwall.\n\nIn addition, LADWP already committed to full coal divestment back in 2016 and plan on full divestment by 2025. OPs decision to purchase a Powerwall would have very little to no impact on shutting down coal fired plants as the energy mix with LADWP is largely due to federal and state policy, and less so with typical supply and demand compared to other parts of the US.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

"comment": "Number one thing you always want to know in Solar is what is the net meter agreement and is that agreement now a grandfathered agreement. AKA new net meter agreements are not as good. With a bill of $0-$7 you likely have a very good net meter agreement. It is possible you CANNOT expand the system and maintain this agreement. Possible up in MA they are still offering this agreement. \n\nI don't understand how the monthly payment is the same every year but the price per kWh escalates? \n\n$112\\*12 months\\*17 years so payoff is a maximum of $22,850.  Personally, if you have the funds I'd contact Sunrun and ask for a buyout price. Also make sure the system has a working monitoring portal or a production meter so you know how much the system is producing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Understand that there are extremely poor people who are not able to pay for their electricity bill, let alone invest that amount of money. \n\nDo you realize the size of system you would get for $40,000 to $70,000?  We have an 8.7kW system (grid time, no battery storage) that cost us $16,530 before any incentives/tax credit.  It more than offsets our yearly average power consumption on a 3200 sqft house in FL.  A $40k system would have gotten us a system with enough battery backup that we probably could have gone off-grid.  \n\nAnd people don't actually need to have money stashed away to put in solar.  There are plenty of companies that will do leasing or financing, just like a car.",

"comment": "Just closed on a house in the bay area and we'd like to put solar + battery on it.\n\nLooks like we should plan for ~15kWh / day. Our last place was 11kWh / day avg on the year, but new place is bigger and we'll now be charging our EV at home, and we need 20 miles per day, @250Wh/mi ~ 5kWh (correct?).\n\nSmall part of the house's electricity is still knob and tube wiring (including the garage), would it be a good idea to redo that at the same time and to install the EV charger, or does it make more sense to do that separately? How long does it take and can we live in the house when all the work is being done?\n\nBy default we're thinking Tesla solar + PowerWall as easy, no research option, but there might be smarter choices? If we go with some other choice, can we still have all the nice reporting in the Tesla app? What am I looking for in a quote? What should I ask?",

"comment": "I sell solar for a highly reputable company based in Bris that has been going for 10 years, i have worked for them for 3.5 years. \n\nEven if your mum is using a decent amount of power at night, solar is definitely a good idea. The system might take slightly longer to pay back if the solar is not utilised fully during the day but you can still stick the hot water on a timer to curb the hot water bill and any power she doesn’t use can be sold back to the grid. It will eventually pay itself off and it’s money that is already being spent on power anyway. \n\n$300 a month is a decent amount of power, i’ll assume she’s single phase so a 6.60kw system on a 5kw inverter would see a reduction of maybe 35 - 40%, an 8kw system on a 6 - 8kw inverter would see possibly 50% - 60%.  She could save more, depending on just how well she can utilise the solar power. \n\nDon’t worry about batteries right now, they’re too expensive we are one of the countries leading battery installers thanks to a QLD gov solar and battery grant in 2018. Give it a few years, pretty much all inverters are battery compatible. \n\nBest things to look for when doing your research is company reputation, not just panels and inverter. The length of time a company has been in business is important, knowing they will be around in the future for serviceability is very important, solar systems often have problems, cheap ones almost always. Knowing the company will be around and also do a good job in the first place is paramount. \n\nDon’t buy a $3.5k 6.60kw or something, spend at least $5k as long as the company is reputable. \nListen to the salesperson and see if they ask good questions about your situation and energy use and give you good information on the products, their services and if they care enough to give you some advice on how to use the system rather than just fire a quote out and hope you buy. Definitely get a hot water timer on that hot water system, that sounds like half your bill right there. \n\nSungrow is an excellent budget inverter with some panels perhaps from canadian solar or jinko, they’re decent mid range products, maybe around the $4.5 - $5k mark with a reputable installer. $6k - $7k for better gear like Fronius-Phono, $8k+ for Fronius-Qcell or sunpower etc\n\nThere is the vic government rebate going at the moment of $1850 i think it is (we’ve stayed out of vic since it launched. The whole thing was a giant cockup to begin with) plus you still get the federal rebate on the purchase of the system which is $3600 - $3700 on a 6.60kw, about $4200 on an 8kw or thereabouts. So systems are very cheap out of pocket right now in Vic. Use this to your advantage to get a decent system from a reputable installer, this is a power station on your roof, don’t cheap out, it’s a lot of electricity. \n\nHappy to answer any questions you might have :)",

"comment": "Nice username BTW, gave me a good chuckle.\n\nI don’t think there is really much difference between grid tied and backup hardware these days. With so many houses going solar, grid tied inverters are everywhere and getting cheaper, my solar inverter is  10kw. It’s even easier when the DC voltages from the EV exceed that of the grid which they almost always do. You only need a pure inverter at that point. And realistically, you wouldn’t need much of an inverter either, maybe 2-5kw, as you will only provide a little useful power for the hours needed, or it would drain your batteries too quickly.\n\nV2G also has the possibility of easing mass power storage issues that renewables create. Really an amazing opportunity for utility companies to decrease dirty generation and peaking. But we would need a bunch of solar/wind over-capacity and EV’s in every driveway/garage to make this happen at any appreciable scale. One can only hope. Good strong incentives on Time of use and time of back feed will greatly increase the demand and implementation of V2G.\n\nI really think it’s a win for everyone, but I’m not sure how much of an impact it would realistically have until adoption is widespread, and whether or not it’s worth the trouble. Definitely still firmly believe that on-board chargers need to and likely will go away.",

"comment": "You have already gotten a very detailed answer, and a very short answer.\n\nPerhaps you are interested in doing this as a learning opportunity.\n\nYou can purchase a small solar panel and 12 V solar regulator kit from Harbor Freight. You will need to supply a smallish 12 V, deep cycle battery, also available from Harbor Freight.\n\nWhen you connect the solar panels to the battery, through the regulator then you will have a magical battery that charges itself when the sun shines. Any 12 V accessory, such as a USB charger will take solar power from the battery. \n\nThis is not a set up to run your house, but it certainly would make enough power to keep your phones and probably your laptop charged up.\n\nSo, if you feel like spending a couple hundred bucks and perhaps learning a bit about these things then go ahead. Otherwise just get a prepackaged unit from Amazon or wherever.",

"comment": "Looks like your water pump is 230 volt and 8 amps, resulting in 1.84 kilowatts.  A single Tesla Powerwall can output up to 5 kilowatts peak with a total potential output of 13.5 kilowatts.  So if your pump is running at maximum for a sustained period it can pump about 7.33 hours continuously using one Tesla Powerwall.  The question then becomes how much water can the pump deliver in that amount of time?  Is there a reservoir for the pump to deliver to, to give you a reserve with possibly a gravity-feed to point of delivery?  If you don’t have a water reservoir, or if it is too small, then two Powerwalls would provide on-demand water supply for nearly 15 hours if your solar system is capable of charging 27 kilowatt hours in a reasonable period of time, and also assuming that there is sufficient sunlight on that particular day when you need it based on weather patterns.\n\nWe have three Powerwalls and a self-installed 10.6 kilowatt solar system, and it is nearly enough to charge a Model 3 and a Model Y as daily drivers and to also power our home’s total electricity demand including high-efficiency air conditioning, a pool pump, two refrigerators, and a high-efficiency washer/dryer.",

"comment": "I've started an answer but erased it all because it's become quite difficult to come off clearly. That said, I think I'd have to recommend a few things:\n\n1) Check [ERCOT pricing](http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/prices) for the Houston Hub. You want the Historical RTM Load Zone and Hub Prices. Download the file, each tab is a month broken down into 15 minute intervals. You want the Houston HUB. Prices are $/MWh, so divide by 1000. \n\n2) Based on my 14.9kW system in the same area (installed in May), you're probably going to average about 47-48kWh per day in the summer.  That's enough to fill the 3 powerwalls with about 7kWh leftover that will probably cover your base loads during the day (fridge, etc, not A/C if you're running it at home). Peak  summer days about 65kWh. Winter will be less as angle of the sun will drop production, I don't have data on it yet, so can't help you there. However, I believe best RTW rates are in summer GENERALLY due to increased A/C usage. This may be incorrect as there may be just as many power plants online to meet demand, so it may be steady year round. Rates have been described the last few years as averaging $[0.022 (in 2020) - 0.038 (2019)](https://electricityrates.com/texas/texas-wholesale-electricity/)/kWh. That's full year, all times of day. \n\n3) Depending your personal consumption, you may not be selling much back to the grid at all. You may be selling a lot.  Theoretically you would be selling at the end of the production day (3p-6p) when I believe ERCOT pricing is highest (largest demand as people kick on A/C). As I state \"I believe\", I'm suggesting verifying, but I feel more confident about than peak pricing by time of year. \n\n4) I'd recommend looking at what your daily consumption is during the summer as well, since that's the best proxy I can provide so far. If you think you're producing a ton compared to use, you'll have an idea how much money is to be made and if it will matter that you're paying $10 in monthly fees ($120/yr). \n\n5) Obligatory, if you're underproducing your load, MP2 would be a better option. No cash out, but no monthly fee. \n\n6) I have heard some people going with a cheaper rate without buy back and doing a free nights plan. I don't think that's your best option, but could be.",

"comment": "Yeah Net Metering is definitely a plus. \n\nOne thing that I realize and sucks a lot for me is the direction of my house. My house is East facing and my Neighbor’s house is facing North. My house will be needing 23-24 panels, whereas the neighbor only needed 16 for his house. They were able to install all 16 of them on the south facing side as that gets the most sunlight. That was surprising on how that works and they have a bigger system than us. Their cost is 7K less than us 😅\nSorry about the rant. \nSo from what I understand, the solar inverter hub is needed to feed the Tesla directly from the solar panels. Also you can charge any vehicle, not just Tesla. I am not 100% sure yet if that’s the right way to go.\nSo I have heard about Nema 14-50. When I contacted local electrical companies for installation, they are quoting 1000-2500 for installation for Tesla wall connector or The Nema. That seems nuts. How much did you pay for the installation? Also our electric company has a 1K rebate for an EV charger. Dumb question, but is Nema technically considered an EV charger like the Wall connector?",

People exhibit some greed everywhere, but differences between places usually aren't that meaningful. That said, the credit probably does have effects, which I'll get to...\n\nSome factors I see:\n\n1. Panels are indeed about double the global average ($0.38/$0.199 in [June](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15062023/inside-clean-energy-solar-panel-prices-drop/)), apparently mainly due to tariffs. Trump created these for idiosyncratic reasons, and Biden has kept them presumably because they're popular with labor. Other components of the system which come from China are similarly affected.\n2. The US has long had an energy policy that heavily subsidizes fossil fuels in a number of ways. This held back the growth of the solar industry for a long time, leading to there being fewer companies in every segment of the industry today than there normally would be. This limits supply.\n3. The federal tax credit (and others) pushes up demand substantially. In the long run we should expect the supply to increase, but in the long run we are all dead (RIP JMK). At present this increased demand couples with #2 to bid up the price. That means that solar installers are capturing some of the subsidy...but certainly not all of it (or likely even a majority) and not for any nefarious reason; they're just charging the market rate. This is a pretty textbook short-term result of a large subsidy.\n4. Nominal price comparisons for nontradeable goods are often misleading because of exchange rate effects. PPP comparisons are better for this purpose. In the specific case of Australia-US the difference isn't large (Australia PPP [adjustment](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/PA.NUS.PPPC.RF/rankings) is 0.97) but there's another 3% or so.\n5.",

Atleast in germany there it seems no progess has been made in that regard.  Several issues in germany:\n\n* You get a flat charge for putting electricity back into the net, you won't get compensated for \"stabilizing the grid\" in peak hours\n* No cheaper charging during night times, even when electricity should be cheaper\n* Warranty issues at car manufacturers and politcal problems which prevents manufacturers from finally releasing the capability (Afaik even the first ID.3 theoretically has the capabilities.)",

"comment": "It could be theoretically possible by installing grid interconnections (especially east to west across time zones since peak demand will be distinct at each time zone), deploying energy storage at scale, and using energy utility demand side management (e.g., using off-peak hours for energy intensive activities such as EV charging). However, this is still a highly controversial area of research as while modelling shows that it could be possible, countries that have increasingly moved towards greater renewables usage have faced challenges with their energy transition (see Germany and their Energiewende policy). Here's some of the modelling work that has been performed: \n\n* [Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark Delucchi's work on modelling the US electrical grid using 100% decarbonized sources of electricity generation.](https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/21-USStates-PDFs/21-USStatesPaper.pdf)  The study examined a number of grids and isolated state variations, finding that grid stability (avoid blackouts) can be maintained using a supply of 100% wind, water, and solar, with the addition of 4-h of battery storage. [Counterpoint to this work.](https://www.roadmaptonowhere.com/)\n\n* [Dan Tong and Ken Caldeira looked at wind and solar exclusively,](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26355-z)  finding that reliable renewable electricity systems are wind-heavy and satisfy countries’ electricity demand in 72–91% of hours (83–94% by adding 12 h of storage). Countries can further improve reliability (up to 100%) by overbuilding generating assets (1.5 to 3x) and building interconnections.",

And if the engine is still good, then it will become a whole home backup generator, and can comfortably be parked on blocks for eternity.",

He likened it to \"rape fantasies\" which he said were immoral to act out in a roll-play game even with a consenting partner.\n\nI on the other hand am also vegan, but have no problem with fake meat and cheese.  I'm also very much against rape, but I feel that if you have a partner who you trust and want to act out rape with (and you have taken the necessary precautions -like a safe word- to ensure the play does not actually turn into rape) then that's fine and healthy. \n\nI don't tend to call things \"fake beef\" but I do find \"fake sausage\" or \"soysage\" or \"tofu sausage\" a useful construct.  The first conveys cow, the latter convey a spiced patty that is yummy with vegan gravy and biscuits.  \n\nI think it comes down to whether or not the word is helpful.  I can buy vegan sour cream, and it tastes just like non-vegan, so why confuse things by introducing new names?\n\nAlso, I find the ridiculous number of downvotes you are getting obnoxious.",

Participants in the study ate a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables for three days and saw a 60% drop in the level of harmful BPA in their system.\n\nThe key here is *fresh*. It's not necessarily that the foods are vegan, if they even are, it's about packaging.\n\nFrom the study abstract:\n\n&gt;We selected 20 participants in five families based on self-reported use of canned and packaged foods. Participants ate their usual diet, followed by three days of “fresh foods” that were not canned or packaged in plastic, and then returned to their usual diet.\n\nAgain, this is a study about *packaging*, not vegan diets.",

Perhaps we have a different understanding of caring, for me, most of the time, caring is a feeling. I cannot help it if I do not care just as I cannot help it that I do or don't feel an emotion. I can bring up an emotion to a degree, but that would be fake and I don't want to be fake. So to me I either care about someone/something or I don't. That doesn't mean I don't think how my actions affect others. So here's an order of \"what comes first\" for me:\n\n1.Me (emotional caring as well as rational caring)\n\n2.My loved ones (emotional caring as well as rational caring)\n\n3.Everything else (rational caring). Here's where veganism comes in. I can rationally explain to myself why being a vegan is good and that it also doesn't conflict with anything that's more important to me.\n\nHowever according to that, my dog (to me) comes before anything else. Including other dogs that I do not care about.\n\nAnd no, not neutering a dog doesn't directly kill/hurt dogs. The same way me not donating all my money to a animal charity doesn't directly hurt dogs. People who decide to buy a dog and then, once they realize they cannot handle a pet, throw them out or take them to a shelter - that is the behavior that hurts dogs. People who are unable to look after their pets - that is the behavior that hurts dogs. \n\nSo why not focus our finite resources on fixing the problem at it's root, rather than fixing the dogs. All you're doing is mitigating the problem, which just provides better statistics which in turn contributes yet more to misbehavior. So yeah, it may help on some level, but it could be more hurtful than good, even to other dogs(as a group), and it definitely isn't the way to solve the problem.\n\nYou shouldn't punish your pets for the actions of other HUMANS, even if it does mitigate the pain. You're supposed to bring happiness to your pets life as  it's your, the owners, responsibility.\n\nHonestly, the more I argue with what seems to be the whole of /r/vegan, and the more I think about this issue, the more I seem to dislike the idea of neutering animals.\n\nI can assure you though, to calm your mind, that I won't be promoting either of these causes unless I've thought about this much more thoroughly. I still may be wrong even if it seems unlikely and people have failed to provide reasons why my train of thought it flawed.",

Sudden change to vegan after illness was contained, also mid twenties. \n\n* I grew up with food being the centre of families: the meeting point, the conservation, hanging out in the kitchen, it all revolves around food. For me, though, it's not the food that is important, it's family.  I'm not a foodie. I like good food, but it's not the epicenter of my life. My veganism is about more than  just food.\n\n* that's sad. I wish them well in the future. \n\n* I don't support eating animal products. I don't care what you do in your life, I have bigger fish to fry (to use a completely inappropriate cliche)\n\n* absolutely it can spread. I don't force my ideals on others, but I remain optimistic that a lot of people are eating meat products.

My blood pressure is low, my heart rate is great, my liver triglycerides are low, my glucose response is normal, my skin is clear, I don't feel bloated or mucusy, my LDL is low. All the factors diseases of lifestyle are absent in my health profile, and they all appear in high rates in my family medical history. \n\nI hope these responses help you understand vegans better.

For far too long I wanted to be the cool vegan who accepts everyone else's choices and teaches by example and only defended veganism when people questioned me. Well now I regret that, because I'm sure I could have gotten more people to go vegan if I spoke up about the issue more.\n\nThere is no doubt that just being vegan and setting an example is important to the cause in itself. It's the most important thing anyone can do for animals, but it's not enough. We need to talk to people about the issue every opportunity we get, and if some people think that makes us preachy then oh well.",

I'm afraid I'll have to stop again for a bit; I made the mistake of combing over these comments and I'm pissed off all over again.\n\n&gt; In the context of white people talking about events regarding black people/culture, if you say \"This is offensive\" or \"This is cultural appropriation\" you are effectively saying \"You don't get to talk about this because your skin is the wrong color\".\n\nThat isn't about skin colour, it's about whether you have the proper context for the conversation you're trying to have.\n\nIt's probably worth mentioning that I'm not black — black people in America aren't the only people in the world who were subjected to slavery.\n\n&gt; I believe this has been brought up indirectly elsewhere in the thread and the response was something snarky dismissive like \"Oh, so now black people are the real racists.\"\n\nThere's a limit to how much I'm willing to rise above the fray. I saw a comments section where anyone who was suggesting there might be anything wrong with this approach was getting shouted down by a bunch of people who clearly didn't understand what issues were at stake. It pissed me off and I expressed it. I'd be more inclined to apologize for it if I saw anyone other than you making a serious effort to recognize the issue here.\n\n&gt; It could be very helpful if you wrote and posted an essay in /r/vegan about the correct, sensitive way to do this. \n\nI don't feel comfortable doing this. I've had a privileged life and I haven't had to deal with a lot of racism. I feel comfortable talking only about fairly specific issues that I can understand. This is one of them.\n\n&gt; Hopefully this is redundant and we were already on the same page.\n\nI think we are. I can sympathize with the frustration you feel and my response can only be this: *you are not the problem*. You're fine and dandy. From what I've seen of you, you're a-OK to talk about these issues provided that you approach them in pretty much the way you've approached them with me.",

Yes, she apologized but if that was truly the reason she dismissed you, she's not a good doctor or at least was heavily blinded in this case.",

If that became a widespread trend it would really help. \"Vegan\" is still a scary, grim or politically charged word for many. The important thing is to bring people into contact with new foods they enjoy.",

Some people can make the jump from vegetarianism to veganism in no time while others need years. I don't think a judgmental attitude towards people who wants positive change is beneficial to anybody. If I were you, I'd just consider the negativity to be frustration. If you want to, or think that you'll go vegan you'll get there.",

And it's sad to say but we deserve the diseases that kill us and the suffering that climate change will cause us. The few good hearted and strong minded ones between us, vegans, are collateral damage. And even if all wild animals die because of our stupid consumption habits of corpses and their fluids, it will be less suffering than what is caused by us as a species if we keep on going as we do. This virus should be calling people awake and make them realise it's fucked up to treat animals as slaves. But no one bats an eye at animal consumption. They just try to \"regulate\" it more. Just goddamn stop it! That's the solution!",

The main function of bone char is to whiten the sugar, which is less of a concern when a product is already heavily processed.\n\nMy own (admittedly imperfect) understanding is that this only applies to sugarcane-derived sweeteners. If you have something with corn syrup, maple syrup, beet sugar, etc., it shouldn't be processed. (If anyone knows better, please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nYou can also look for the Vegan certification label here (see it here: [https://vegan.org/certification/](https://vegan.org/certification/)). One of the stipulations for certification is that certified foods can't be processed with animal ingredients, which includes bone char.\n\nAs far as processed foods go, Amy's is generally pretty vegan-friendly. When I lived in the US, their burritos were a standby in my house.",

Therefore, hunting meant improved survival of our species and population growth. We did not have access to any kind of agriculture at the beginning of our species. The human species came into being roughly 100-300 thousand years ago, while agriculture only began around 11 thousand years ago. It’s only thanks to modern agriculture (access to a large variety of plants we bred to have large edible parts and higher nutritional density, as well as modern fertilizer) that the vegan diet is feasible.",

Take comfort in what YOU are doing for animals.  There will be many more chances to open other peoples eyes to the injustices animals face.  You will help other people become vegan through the years.  There are many many more vegans today than when I began my journey in 1993.  Take a deep breath you’ll be ok.  Cheers.",

Surveys consistently show this too -- when you ask people how they feel about animal cruelty and factory farming, people are overwhelmingly against it. Their actions are just out of line with their beliefs. We have a system that makes it very easy for people to ignore and never think about the impact of their choices. Educating people and showing them the reality is effective at getting them to change. \n\nJust an anecdote from my own experience. My cousin is an avid environmentalist and self-proclaimed animal lover, and my sister is also someone who tries to reduce her impact in many ways (reusable shopping bags, refusing plastic straws, carpooling to places when possible, etc). While they haven't gone vegan yet, both of them have significantly reduced their consumption of animal products after I have shared information with them about how the animals are treated and the impact it has on the environment.",
