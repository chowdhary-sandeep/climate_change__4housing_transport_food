Less than 40% of the nation's grid power comes from coal.  Then you go on to say, \"those inefficiencies\" as if you've identified some inefficiencies already, which you have not.  Large electrical power plants are basically big steam turbine engines.  They are very efficient.  Of course, they can't compare with hydro-electric, which uses the sun's natural effect on water to move water uphill by evaporating it and allowing convection to move it into the sky, which eventually causes rain to drop the water onto higher ground.  \n\nBut, compared with other ways of generating motion, such as the 15% efficient internal combustion engine in most cars, a large power plant is very efficient.\n\nIf coal is responsible for around 40% of the nation's electricity, that means that 60% of the electricity generated is NOT coal - and your objection to coal is more than half accounted for.  Burning natural gas produces less emissions than gasoline, and using natural gas in huge, highly efficient power plants rather than burning gasoline in small, inefficient internal combustion engines is more efficient and less polluting, no matter how you crunch the numbers.  Add in the hydro-electric and nuclear sources of power, and you get a lot of very clean, efficient driving in an electric car.\n\nMy Nissan Leaf goes 90-100 miles on 20 kilowatt hours of electricity.  Charging at night, when the electric company is desperately trying to shed excess power and only charges a nickel per kilowatt hour means that my driving is done at close to a penny a mile.  If it was so inefficient, why is it so cheap?\n\nThe car gets an estimated 129 miles per gallon equivalent energy rating from the government.  The batteries do degrade with time, but they can be recycled, so they are not \"worthless\" after 10 years.  It's true that the cost of the batteries will degrade the value of the car, but since I'm leasing, it's really the car company's problem, not mine.   For me, it's driving around for a penny a mile in \"fuel\" costs, versus 13 cents per mile in my other car.  \n\nAlso, I have no scheduled oil changes, tune ups, transmission fluid checks, engine air filter changes, or other costs.  I don't anticipate doing anything but rotating the tires and washing the car.\n\nIf you can't see that this is a cheaper way to drive, then I suggest you should be happy paying whatever it is that you're paying for your driving.  Me, I'm happy to have paid nothing for gasoline since the middle of December.  At an equivalent of 129 miles per gallon, I'm driving at somewhere between 20% and 25% of the energy used by my other car.  I suggest that a 75% to 80% more efficient ride is better for everyone.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1958094371172289,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17140206694602966,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2880419852495727,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20018014805172923,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3436054735243777,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2801055223195461,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.28750092814548606,"ev_1":-0.18408500250384893,"ev_2":-0.281754006003401,"ev_3":-0.19720432244638442,"ev_4":-0.12203352596528323,"ev_5":-0.035416460547518604,"ev_6":-0.08260487266306378},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

See above.\n\n&gt;\"Conclusion: it is much easier, faster, and more efficient to move molecules of gasoline or molecules of hydrogen to fill car tanks than to move electrons to charge a battery\"\n\nTesla's currently adding automated battery swap robots to their supercharger stations. A swap takes 90 seconds: http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/   \n...Which will probably be obsolete by the time it's rolled out: http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/storedots-bio-organic-battery-tech-can-charge-from-flat-to-full-in-30-seconds/ \n\nBut, let's take your links as gospel for a moment, for the sake of argument. By the time the first FCEVs hit the market they will offer about the same range as a Tesla Model S, shorter filling time (except for battery swaps, which are inarguably faster) but it will cost tremendously more money (Try to find the total cost on Google for the Hyundai Tucson FCEV. It's been replaced everywhere with the monthly leasing figures. There's a reason for that. IIRC it was something like $150,000.) \n\nNow, are you aware that fuel cells wear down, die and need replacement over time? Slightly faster than lithium batteries, and they cost more to replace? Are you aware of the leakage problem, wherein a Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle left sitting will be completely empty within a month? Finally, where does commercially produce Hydrogen come from today, and why do you suppose it's made that way instead of hydrolysis? \"Let's just make Hydrogen from solar!\" At 10% efficiency? Why not just use that power to charge EVs directly?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006600630683048317,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10473569732203032,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20367513837969792,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.32451929653702516,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3163171070047416,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2421164949691581,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06887916783064914,"ev_1":-0.12906833777370477,"ev_2":-0.14451861065502114,"ev_3":-0.07516358884318834,"ev_4":-0.07591843496144672,"ev_5":-0.08074985979086098,"ev_6":-0.08783643108683527},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

At that price, if Audi wanted to sell an A3 eTron (not the plug in available about now, but a pure EV version), they could charge up to $42,500 for car and have the next cost be about the same to the consumer (assuming the consumer has the tax appetite to claim the full $7500 credit).  \n\nBut given that the plug-in A3 already starts at $37.9k, it's hard to imagine they're going to be able to put a full electric A3 eTron out for that price. \n\nBut we'll see.

The car in the original article is quoted to have 150 kWh and it's still not enough to finish each racing day without recharging. Idk how far it needs to go, if someone knows maybe we can guess estimate when energy density will be good enough. The energy consumption was mentioned \"45kWh per 100km\" (sounds insanely inefficient but it is off road so maybe it's correct, idk enough to dispute the number) in worst case scenario, that's around 340 km plus or minus on a full charge.\n\nThere are a few things they could improve, like get rid of the 6 speed transmission and use 2 or 4 motors with half, respectively 1/4 of the power of their current one. This solution should eliminate the power loss caused by the gears. They could also try to quick swap the pack or  improve the charging time drastically, one hour it's just not realistic if they compete against ICE cars that refuel in minutes. Maybe stop more times to recharge but just for a few minutes at a time instead of an hour maybe 15 minutes distributed across 3 x 5 minutes stops. Just enough to get them to the finish lines. If they could do this maybe they could dump part of the battery pack since they couldn't charge it all anyway. The bottleneck really is regulation and how many times they are allowed to charge, if they can modify the battery pack, etc.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00030996999945879605,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29953175354971245,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1660020920032687,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22366500428628452,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13938429428243582,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.010924137197434902,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21649632831880203,"ev_1":-0.21984464085895356,"ev_2":-0.08323946554810391,"ev_3":-0.051873341009923024,"ev_4":-0.04626780612306902,"ev_5":-0.14669753036772212,"ev_6":-0.25795853369979027,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.051711302758485546},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\nExplanation: The author expresses concerns about the range and charging time of EVs, implying that they are not yet advanced enough for racing applications.

It's the older NiMH battery chemistry which have a memory effect and need to be discharged to a low level each time. One of the biggest advantages of Lithium ion is that it's best to regular charge this battery type. \n\n&gt;Fire risk\n\nAnything that stores energy is a fire risk, and lithium ion can store more energy than any other home battery type on the market (that I'm aware of). This sounds anecdotal, I don't think there's any statistical data showing that lithium ion has higher risk than nickel metal. But regardless of battery type, it's always good to design a system with a smoke detector nearby and some basic mitigate plans in place.

The Bolt is not much more than that, even without factoring in lower maintenance costs and the cost of gas vs electricity.\n\nWhile it is not a drop-in, all-purpose replacement for a new ICE of similar form factor because it lacks a fast charging network, it is a very viable vehicle for local use for the 2/3 of the country who live in single-family dwellings.\n\n&gt; especially compared to spending $6000 on a used Leaf instead.\n\nThere are cheaper choices, yes, especially if you're considering used alternatives, but that's a bit of a side dodge.

They are all Tesla’s. They use one of 3 standards... Tesla’s North American connector, modified Mennekes, or GB/T. In Europe, Tesla vehicles use the exact same AC charging standard... Mennekes plug. In China, they use a combo with GB/T as that became the standard. None of the non-Tesla plugs were Level 3 capable until 2018. Just exactly what standard was Tesla supposed to use from 2012 until 2018?\n\nIn what year do you think CHAdeMO or CCS reaches greater than 50% installed base of Level 3 DCFC in the US? It won’t be 2019. Nor 2020. Nor 2021. Nor 2022. As a result, Tesla’s plug is the standard. In the US, there are almost 300,000 Tesla’s. Tesla is outpacing the rest of the EVs combined. How long do you think will take CCS level 3 capable vehicles to achieve that volume? The I-Pace is not level 3 yet. The Bolt, Niro, nor Kona are Level 3. The Leaf is CHAdeMO. Likely the first Level 3 capable CCS type 1 vehicle in the US is either an I-Pace or an E-tron. By the end of 2019, there might be 10,000 of them combined, but likely far less. Tesla by then would have well over 500,000. Which is the standard?\n\nFurthermore, there are zero cars on the market that can actually use Tesla’s Superchargers in the US even if they had the right plug. That’s simply because no one else can handle the charge rates yet. And most can’t make the jumps between the locations reasonably. The Bolt cannot handle the charge rate. The Kona cannot either. The Leaf cannot. Reality is that all Level 2 DCFC was a waste of money. It will all go away. But the plague of slow charging Level 2 vehicles clogging up Level 3 infrastructure will continue for years. A colossal mistake by the industry.\n\nIn the computer industry, plenty of standards exist by adopting something a company established. At this point, Nissan/Renault’s use of CHAdeMO essentially is proprietary also. But the rest of industry won’t out ship Tesla + Nissan in the US until well into the 2020’s. That’s just reality.\n\nAlso, there is nothing about Tesla’s plug that holds back EV adoption. Nothing says there has to be a single standard for DCFC. AC charging, where the vast majority of energy is transferred is all J1772. Even there, the standards bodies were slow to adopt higher AC charging current leading to incompatibilities. Beyond that, the ratio of L3 DCFC capable cars to charging network plugs and locations matters. Not so much compatibility.\n\nThe simple truth is that Tesla’s Supercharging network has been superior to non-Tesla charging networks. That’s due to technical superiority, financial commitment, and corporate commitment. I do not see that changing anytime soon.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00025015592594475794,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13827309135549484,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19130386477786426,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3238697320865716,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26615370410660766,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13389542732463958,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.010971843575437864,"ev_1":-0.12409937043940458,"ev_2":-0.20555468987801362,"ev_3":-0.09458656885861273,"ev_4":-0.10900976822094155,"ev_5":-0.04750175188140323,"ev_6":-0.24144123583576726},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for non-Tesla EV owners regarding Tesla's Supercharging network)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

The \"legacy\" manufacturers said for over a decade that the EV revolution would start around 2020, because then battery costs would be low enough and battery energy density would be high enough. I've been on this sub for what, 7 years now and constantly people were claiming that these manufacturers just \"don't get it\" and that they would be bankrupt well before 2020. \n\nWell, now here we are and the EV revolution is following the \"already bankrupt\" companies' timetable. Turns out that once it makes business sense to make the switch those \"tanker ships that can't change course quickly\" actually managed to change course practically in an instant in the middle of two of the worst crises the industry has ever faced.\n\n&gt; I think the only company Tesla has to worry about at the moment is BYD. \n\nThey don't really compete in the same market segments. I don't see how Tesla has to really worry about anyone. Especially not because they have such a strong hold on North America, where no one else really bothers to make a big push right now. \n\nBut if I was CEO of Tesla, if I were to worry about anyone it would be VW.

No matter the method, what they're providing is an educated guess. Your best bet in this case is to look at a few other factors while trying to disregard the production figures they give you\n\n-Performance Guarantee\n\n-inverter type (String or Central vs a Solar Optimizer or Microinverter as this will be the biggest factor in differentiating 2 otherwise identical systems. They do tend to be a bit more expensive but almost always have a 25 year warranty that matches the panel warranty rather than a 10 year version.)\n\n-Linear performance warrantee/guarantees\n\n\nThe last one is something I havent seen mentioned. A production guarantee is a separate matter. Basically a production guarantee is the solar installer guaranteeing that said system will produce at least x number of kWhs in the first year. After the first year they've done their work. A fact of life in Solar PV is that panels degrade over time, the peace of mind comes from a manufacturer providing a linear performance guarantee. What this does is state in contractual terms that the system production will not degrade more than x% each year for 25 years.  These figures are based on your first year production figures and are exempt from environmental factors in 99% of cases.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008900358807295561,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0993942978788482,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20028922011631853,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2381817230705303,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17381582607415788,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20226441479926294,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3202255731448531,"solar_1":-0.14628046114402057,"solar_2":-0.2377955770329922,"solar_3":-0.1871285407076227,"solar_4":-0.07604226505393959,"solar_5":-0.10083243238417101,"solar_6":-0.15364133531879814,"solar_7":-0.11955408113357505,"solar_8":-0.16419959901492562,"solar_9":-0.1194897836800485,"solar_10":-0.18095774652643093},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

The answer to that is to learn to defend ourselves against this zombie invasion. Those who breed without being able to feed their brood must face the consequences. It has been this way for most of our existence: if you cannot sustain your life you will die.

I suppose I could have used advances in dentistry just as well as I could have meteorology.\n\n&gt;Who's really making money?\n\nIt's more like, who depend on the money for their living, and when you look at it that way, I'd imagine that Koch industries is a lot more likely to be market-agile than some scientist who has spent 20 years in a very narrow field with little application outside of itself. How many research scientists have the guts to say, \"This is all I know, and now I know that it's not important; take my funding away\"? I'd like to think they'd be honest, but one of the very reasons we use science is because we don't trust people.\n\n&gt;We are already seeing the beginnings of the catastrophe, today.\n\nWe have different definitions of catastrophe then. I'm not saying your definition is invalid, but I fail to see a dramatic impact on humans and life as we know it - so far. I see more dramatic impact from the regulations (economic impacts, mostly) than I do anything else.\n\nAgain, this is not to say your definition is wrong, but when I say catastrophe, I mean, entire populations of people losing their land, or thousands dead due to extreme weather... not some incredibly narrow definition of a unique species dying off with no real impact on the essential food-chain.\n\n&gt;at this late date \n\nCare to elaborate? Honest question. Why do you consider it a late date? What data convinces you that it's late? Again, it might be. Certainly, if we've done something to change the entire climate of a planet over the last 100 years, that's a LOT of change to turn around... But 100 years ain't so much in geologic time, so, why do you consider it \"late\" in the change?\n\n&gt;We're too addicted to fossil fuels to change anything in time.\n\nPerhaps that's tangential but is anyone really \"addicted\"? Like, if something better, cheaper, and more efficient came along, they wouldn't change because somehow they're drawn to their love of burning hydrocarbons? Maybe the geopolitics of it all could be considered an \"addiction\" of sorts (with oil acting as currency, basically) but if someone came along and said \"good news, I've figured out how to manufacture solar arrays that are 100x more efficient,\" wouldn't people be buying up Elon's new battery and going off the grid, like, tomorrow?\n\nOverall, though, thanks for your comments. I probably disagree with you less than you think I do.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00021193685582450902,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05324242936455903,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.09242887731813837,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06262279953807592,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29876326079968185,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18256939441743014,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.054240320151924,"solar_1":-0.2818930316910458,"solar_2":-0.0816352154377134,"solar_3":-0.09497789504772906,"solar_4":-0.02224100620454313,"solar_5":-0.010565128993524317,"solar_6":-0.0043218627833994105,"solar_7":-0.012099994644813705,"solar_8":-0.009988138962701973,"solar_9":-0.13340721391189922,"solar_10":-0.28043554186903447},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

From there, it's 2 strings of 15 inverters to a junction box that aggregates their connections (Since the inverters are at the panel, it's all AC power down each strand from there, rather than DC power to a central string inverter).  The junction box is on the roof by the panel array, then it's just conduit to the edge of the roof, then down to the bottom near the gutter where they punched a hole through in the bottom picture.\n\nFrom there, the conduit runs down the edge of the trim, then low near the ground to the square box, that has two 20 Amp breakers in it - one 15 string of inverters through each 20A breaker, seen in the middle 2 pics.  From here, it enters the box under the old Production Meter (showing total power produced through the life of the array), which is just a manual shutoff switch to disconnect the array from the house and grid.\n\nThe shutoff has 2 conduits out - one goes down and through the siding (my house breaker panel is just through the wall there) and connect to two 20A breakers that are installed in my house breaker panel to allow power to flow into the home from the array.\n\nThe upper conduit you can see goes into the utility power meter - this is actually the original meter that was on my home.   New digital meters, only read power throughput without direction taken into account, so until I had my Net meter installed by the power company, the array was shut down, since it would read power from both the array and grid as billable power being consumed.  \n\nThe Net meter you can see is to the far right, it has 4 arrows.  One for when power is being generated from the solar array, one showing the home is using power from the solar array, one showing when power is being pulled from the grid, and one showing the home is using power from the grid. \n\nThe Net meter also cycles back and forth between how much power I have exported and how much I have imported from the ulitity.

The truth is that while the prices are nominally higher,their monthly bills aren't as high due to a variety of factors, such as periods where the price of electric power is below 0.

Likewise, labor or other costs are vastly higher in the US market compared to other markets. Since a lot of Americans apparently don't have choice in that matter, Sunpower thrives in a niche where some (even if not all) customers *will* have Sunpower panels as their best *rational* choice.

Right now I would say financing should also be part of what you consider. Are they charging that low of a price because they are doing a 3 or 6% rate? Rates are as low as 1% now. If you were to install it yourself you'd save about $10,000 but then you'd obviously have to deal with installing it yourself and paying for it all upfront. I'd ask for their cash price and see if that changes it substantially enough to tempt you.\n\nAlso their estimate of the production seems a little bit high. I know that we try to underquote the production so that people are more likely to be pleasantly surprised rather than feeling ripped off, so maybe with the full sun and a more optimist quote that will be right.\n\nOverall though, the size of the system matters with the buyback program. What is that like in your area? In ours it is a 1 to 1 with no monthly fee and so it makes total sense to size the house for 100% coverage. You might be able to check your usage from your grid provider if you don't want to add up all your bills from the past 12 months. One thing to consider is if you have been using more energy from  staying home more often because of COVID.\n\n[String Inverters vs. Micro-Inverters vs. Optimizers: Which Is the Best? | Unbound Solar](https://unboundsolar.com/blog/micro-inverters-vs-string-inverters#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20a%20power%20optimizer%20vs.%20a,the%20back%20of%20an%20array%20of%20solar%20panels.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I don't really know it all, I figured I would link somewhere else. If you aren't getting full buyback, then having a large system doesn't help you as much. You could consider doing a smaller system with microinverters and then adding more once battery storage is more of an economical solution. IMO from my own \"youtube research\" there will be a huge shift in battery cost in the next 5 years and that's when you'll be able to be mostly independent of the grid. That would also depend on if your utility charges a fee even if you don't use them. If you can't build up credits, then I would consider doing a smaller system with microinverters and offering to pay cash or just doing it yourself.  \n\n\nedit: nice so since it is a 1:1 buyback, then I would make sure that the estimate is near what you will use. Also consider degradation.   REC TP3M 330w panels from what I saw degrade to 86% efficiency at year 25 and the REC Alphas degrade to 92% at year 25. (That probably also explains some of the difference in cost if they aren't doing microinverters and use cheaper panels.) If you are going to need to add more panels later, then make sure you don't do a string inverter. The Power Optimizer seems fine from what I was able to get from the article, but you could ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, congrats on looking into it! I know that the first step is the biggest hurdle. It makes a lot of financial sense when there is a 1:1 buyback program and I don't know why everyone doesn't go solar in those areas.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20180348431070647,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2116599550439787,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2242485963216437,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2997404534120041,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.03915109921661042,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3721807557151395,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1648600584206482,"solar_1":-0.1867340150586782,"solar_2":-0.23364841263671626,"solar_3":-0.2131017638797251,"solar_4":-0.1327086253821489,"solar_5":-0.016692891978891566,"solar_6":-0.06800610062007605,"solar_7":-0.2124912029442688,"solar_8":-0.03665703097093876,"solar_9":-0.06855073869493822,"solar_10":-0.24491640333685055},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The problem is that these are older technology using electrolytic caps that aren't going to last a long time considering the modules aren't new to start with. Also these inverters don't generally see continuous operation (only during power failure) so I don't think there are as well engineered as modern solar inverters which run for many hours each day.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-3.659624659727948e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09052073627801746,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22926297535498938,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07618637879689534,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.0528734547689233,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18130668702234232,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15858699529781006,"solar_1":-0.013677407526605142,"solar_2":-0.010516742899199016,"solar_3":-0.17819595855075784,"solar_4":-0.005164807436813135,"solar_5":-0.0004607971544222285,"solar_6":-0.0019601663758900636,"solar_7":-0.004327430748768772,"solar_8":-0.0012058081798992741,"solar_9":-0.10035030767903663,"solar_10":-0.07381108157278504},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (APC Symmetra datacenter UPSes are a company, not a social group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

We do development as well as installations and the rich folks that finance large solar portfolios have no issue assuming a life span of up to 30 or even 35 years. You WILL have inverter issues during that time, but the panels don't really 'break' or 'wear out'. The glass can cloud over and (location dependent) you can get micro-fractures that start to degrade the panels a little faster than normal (assume .5% degradation to start).\n\nIf you think you will stay in this house (this is really the #1 question to ask), then you can do a NPV calc of the savings over 15, 20, 25, 30 years. Figure in the cost to install, ITC, some maintenance (maybe $1,200 every 5 years to swap some optis/micros/inverters), escalating utility rates, local incentives and, finally, absolute energy savings. For us (Xcel Energy- MN- LOW elec rates), its the same as getting a 5% return over 15 years, 6% over 20 or 7% over 25 years. Not incredible, but actually very safe....the biggest variable tends to be maintenance and then what you think the utility escalator will be. What's funny is that your return gets better as the utility raises rates more, which is a bet i'd take. \n\nNote that this changes DRAMATICALLY based on location (production per kw installed &amp; weather), utility (current rates and incentives), state and county concerns (renewable goals, incentives, etc).

In 10 years everyone expects advances in battery and solar panels.  Don't try to build a forever system.  Set goals, meet some  or all.\n\nMy take is to max out our solar production.

I picked up the Emporia which can tie in/talk to their energy monitoring systems.  I'm very lucky that our SDGE smart meter is compatible with the 30 USD link.

Solar installers love saying wrong stuff like this because they have a better chance at getting the sale and they can't be held liable if you get audited and dinged for it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00022536640365918478,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09189869191573052,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3233553705116113,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1447799118856589,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31751406891764955,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2684832013296172,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05535810724056015,"solar_1":-0.028983169118873775,"solar_2":-0.0008768567689306413,"solar_3":-0.0034357380791334435,"solar_4":-0.03303547285031527,"solar_5":-0.00035882303200196475,"solar_6":-0.0003063072751198585,"solar_7":-0.0003810930987431978,"solar_8":-0.00048035012393180904,"solar_9":-0.00582319640670903,"solar_10":-0.0035481510373453298},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (the commenter is not referring to a specific personal group, but rather providing general information and warning about solar installers)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

For example, let's say there is an animal that cannot feel pain (why not an oyster, since we're on the subject?) and we had incontrovertible proof that plants *could* feel pain.  Would you continue to eat plants rather than oysters just because oysters have muscles, etc?

They are kept perpetually pregnant via insemination or injected with hormones to make sure they don't run dry since they no longer have their young with them. Their young are sent to slaughter, if they are male, to become veal. The females are raised to take over after their mothers in a perpetual cycle of exploitation and psychological cruelty.\n\nEggs? The hens are kept in horrible conditions, even with free range eggs you cannot be sure how much time the hens have gotten outside to wander around. \n\nIf you're looking to get into veganism you have to get your mind out of the whole cruelty equals slaughter thing. Psychological torture is also cruelty. Being kept in cramped spaces and not allowed to form the essential social bonds. having your young removed from you sometimes as soon as a couple of hours after birth and then be hooked up to a milk machine... \n\nSure, I would probably eat an egg from a hen I kept myself, that was cared for, had a safe place to roost... then we are talking about a symbiotic relationship and not a situation of exploitation and cruelty. \n\nI look at the expansive dairy and egg sections in the supermarkets these days with horror. There are so many better alternatives. And there are a lot of pizza places out there where, if you order a veggie pizza without cheese, it is vegan since the dough and the sauce is free of animal products and by-products. \n\nA pizza is essentially just a circular piece of bread with tomato sauce and herbs, and whatever else you want. Make it yourself. Tomato and Basil are great ones. All the cheese does is dumb down the flavour of the veggies. :/","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16121706149229453,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23163698946386369,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.051713842125444574,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24200701668569954,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2171132635946057,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2868428450152848,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26092465636631823,"diet_1":-0.13519733171892767,"diet_2":-0.21993235289876892,"diet_3":-0.23018621408815468,"diet_4":-0.15544905302256193,"diet_5":-0.1649122973321937,"diet_6":-0.26843903836897454,"diet_8":-0.00933446474179315,"diet_9":-0.07622508508696531,"diet_10":-0.12181544851210901,"diet_11":-0.012717958084976999,"diet_13":-0.2839365185321915,"diet_14":-0.2506029360887621,"diet_17":-0.023777502688365832},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

I'm not hugely overweight, only slightly but I'm looking to shift some weight. I've tried different things in the past but found that I've been unable to stick to them.\n\n**WOOT!!** Good on you for making the efforts you're making! Going plant-based is a big win, IMHO, and I'm sure you'll complete the transition before too long.\n\nOf note though, it appears you may to have a misapprehension on the meaning of the word \"vegan\". It sounds like what you're describing for yourself would actually be called a \"plant based diet\" or being a \"strict vegetarian\". While \"vegetarianism\" denotes a dietary choice, \"veganism\" denotes a philosophical position (i.e. the philosophy that other animals are deserving of equal ethical consideration). Granted, adopting that position necessitates that the vegan also adopt a plant based diet, but consuming a plant based diet doesn't make someone vegan any more than keeping a kosher kitchen makes one Jewish. If I'm right that what you're doing is moving towards a plant-based diet, then that's really great! Of course, you might _also_ move towards adopting the vegan philosophy if you're so inclined, and I'm sure we'll all support that too. ^**=o)**\n\n_\n&gt; I just have some quick questions. (I'm based in the UK btw, if that helps the answers).\n&gt; \n&gt; What would be the best approach to eliminating all animal based products?\n\nI find that most people are most successful by transitioning slowly, replacing categories of items one at a time. For example, the first week, you might switch to plant-based milks. The next, you might get some tofu recipes and figure out a few that work well for you. Then maybe drop cheese and add in nooch (i.e. Nutritional Yeast Flakes). \n\nIf you're looking for formal guides to making the switch, check out:\n\n* [The 30-Day Vegan Challenge](http://www.the30dayveganchallenge.com/) (scroll down the page for the book link)\n* [Challenge 22](https://www.challenge22.com/) - \"Every day, you'll get recipes, tips, videos and lots of motivation!\"\n* [One Ingredient Chef](http://www.oneingredientchef.com/)\n* [The VeganStreet Guide for New Vegans](http://veganstreet.com/guidefornewvegans.html)\n* [The Plantpower Meal Planner](http://www.richroll.com/blog/no-more-excuses/)\n\n_\n&gt; Is it more expensive?\n\nThe short answer is: no.\n\nThe longer answer is that the relative cost is *entirely* up to you. Just like with non-plant-based foods, highly processed items (such as plant-based burgers, sausages, ice cream, etc.) are going to cost more than whole foods. If you're willing to experiment with your own cooking, then just like before you went plant-based, you're going to save money by processing the food yourself.\n\n_\n&gt; Would starting a blog, for example, give me some accountability?\n\nYou're going to be moving into a dietary practice which will have a ***much*** wider range of nutrients for you. Nevertheless, for your own peace of mind, it might be interesting to start using [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). This allows you to keep a lot ***and*** it provides immediate feedback on what nutritional micros and macros you're fulfilling or missing.\n\nOn the same note, you might also consider using [Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/2015/12/31/free-app-for-android-and-iphone-and-top-10-videos-of-2015/) as a means of getting yourself in to optimal eating habbits.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1647671060584091,"1.1.1_stance":-0.32442691177129745,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2819961620599084,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22200238285586238,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.33152415891013604,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18928696738203118,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.25880394287378294,"diet_1":-0.05800264753395368,"diet_2":-0.0470553066110142,"diet_3":-0.19075979750656794,"diet_4":-0.11907090054276373,"diet_5":-0.11129481959427692,"diet_6":-0.08050931624206747,"diet_8":-0.0015071975964625988,"diet_9":-0.0015223145189035374,"diet_10":-0.011357819370459765,"diet_11":-0.0036273599980631843,"diet_13":-0.029800237466891605,"diet_14":-0.11593957547087959,"diet_17":-0.0021150540524104144},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Just as you know it is not your responsibility to ~be vegan~ in a way that doesn't make them uncomfortable, it is not their responsibility to be non-vegan in a way that doesn't make you uncomfortable. You both enjoy your meals, and life goes on.\n\nNow, let us say you're eating at a restaurant, and you overhear the guy at the table next to you talking, and in his discussion you hear that he finds meat essential to the diet, and concerning vegans, he takes solace in the fact that many of these people will suffer an early, diet related, demise. Hold up.\n\n_____\n\nNow, clearly, there can be individuals with issues on both sides. I believe there is a subtle differentiation however that while most omnivores feel they will gain nothing from converting a vegan to an omnivore; many vegans feel they can improve the world by having less people eating meat. The intentions are good, and in trying to accomplish this, you can see how PR matters, which is likely why logan192 responded the way he did:\n\n&gt;yikes man, you might wanna lay off the vegan gains for a while. I get animal cruelty sucks, but any omni that sees this is gonna be turned off to veganism, not drawn to it - which defeats the purpose\n\nI don't believe this situation is one of vegans feeling responsible to make others comfortable. Just one of, openly wishing demise on others is a dick thing to do no matter what you eat, and it does not do any good for the image of any community you are in when you do so. I'm sure if an omnivore wished the demise of vegans in common food related subreddits, they would also be met with shame.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3101612019042174,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06651561361425137,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.25087030606678634,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2478103610256395,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12133036809916974,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22747698109810527,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21208240812120494,"diet_1":-0.10420436190548799,"diet_2":-0.171891959971011,"diet_3":-0.09505632293260646,"diet_4":-0.03982052948231285,"diet_5":-0.01903930923011406,"diet_6":-0.014520956790268732,"diet_8":-0.008028276871603643,"diet_9":-0.010080454010070147,"diet_10":-0.09047903596365359,"diet_11":-0.16324575727170063,"diet_13":-0.036444410546513005,"diet_14":-0.08297284313486368,"diet_17":-0.0308617354821763},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Change it up with different types of dashi. We even eat this for breakfast with rice. \n\n\nLazy meals for my partner and I are something like oyakodon(supposed to be chicken and egg, I really enjoy this with tofu two ways - silken for the “egg” and firm previously frozen for the chicken) okonomiyaki or yaki udon/soba. I also love making street style cabbage yaki on the griddle - charred cabbage is my favorite! Some of the traditional brown sauces used have fish in them but it’s so easy to make your own with vegan Worcestershire.\n\nIf you’re curious about homemade sauces and other dishes justonecookbook is a good resource - she breaks it down how it would be done at home and it is easy enough to make vegan substitutes since ingredients are fairly similar across the board.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.007614504429509357,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13633975637424747,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21797485649472037,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18442379617885152,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28863628457348256,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23901211617387028,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21526585997940814,"diet_1":-0.32860893560681687,"diet_2":-0.17439514327206335,"diet_3":-0.17584938315134996,"diet_4":-0.2873345775271814,"diet_5":-0.13953015781589784,"diet_6":-0.0744749944329563,"diet_8":-0.022522916341282933,"diet_9":-0.15129365732086392,"diet_10":-0.14977529746445675,"diet_11":-0.2445692567908984,"diet_13":-0.2326878160238266,"diet_14":-0.22052580318025625,"diet_17":-0.15948597496411412},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.
