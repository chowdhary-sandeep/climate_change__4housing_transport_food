A lithium cell can go from 10-80% in 25 minutes.  Your phone does it.  5Watts.  Your tablet does it.  10Watts.  A top end 300-mile Tesla Model S does it: 100kiloWatts.  20 times that is 2MEGAWATTS.  1/20 25 minutes is a minute and change.  That's faster than filling your tank with gasoline (especially considering how much energy in a gallon of gas is wasted as heat a crappy variable speed engine).\n\nIF you could find a power source fast enough to do that (most likely ANOTHER carbon battery at a charging station, filled slowly by grid power when it was cheapest, just like Tesla does now with their lithium batteries at their charging stations), and had a fat enough cable not to explode in a shower of molten shrapnel.\n\n20x means an 85kWh (300 car-mile) battery can capture ALL the breaking energy of a tractor trailer.  Hell, all the breaking energy of a train (at least till the battery fills up)!\n\nI don't think those reading fully understand what 20x lithium really means or else you'd be freaking out like me.  Presumably it works for discharging as well.  That means 20x the power.  That means a 300 mile car that can give you 20 times the power of a top end Model S.  THAT'S 8000 HORSEPOWER.  Enough power for a tractor trailer, or a train, or a ship (although for fewer and even fewer miles, respectively, of course).  (Or an ion drive spacecraft, for many, many more miles.)\n\nOn the portable device side, high power is also what enables portable beam weapons.  You want to break something, you need a quick discharge.  Right now you can't take a normal battery or even normal caps and get the burstiness needed to get a number of sub-second blasts that are powerful enough to do anything but party tricks.  But when a battery the size of desktop-replacement laptop battery can put out 10kW?  You're cooking with gas.\n\nThese are some big ol' promises, and I hope they come close to reality.

Doesn't have to be Level 2. Can just be a cheapo 110V that will add 5 miles/hour during the 8 hour day. Should be easy and cheap and if you play your cards right, you might get a good parking spot out of it.\n\nThose 60-80 mile trips to grandma's house are going to be very similar to work. Try to bring a charger with you but if you aren't going to stay a full 8 hours maybe get an L2 (start at around $400 and require a 240V/30A line installed).\n\nThe new 2016 LEAF would be my pick in this scenario but I don't have much 1st hand knowledge of the eGolf. I would also consider Ford Energi stuff but as for the most vehicles on the road Nissan is probably your best bet.\n\nBattery degradation is a very small issue (see all the 10 year old Priuses running around on poorer NiCAD technology?) Lithium degrades slower and by the time anything noticeable happens, batteries will cost much less.\n\nGas prices are indeed lower and the savings on Electric is less but unless gas goes below $1 again, Electric is still cheaper.\n\nAs for the evolving EV Market, it isn't going to slow down at all over the next 10 years. I'd save the Tesla/Bolt to replace your other ICE car in 3 years ;)\n\nBest of luck!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06436609694113334,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06386595064153273,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1511721292233982,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21587207109581805,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.09810293540328985,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16309292700801356,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13802183365138868,"ev_1":-0.09679277517516276,"ev_2":-0.029509593676872708,"ev_3":-0.09120585268829018,"ev_4":-0.15972709375153116,"ev_5":-0.009036135162508193,"ev_6":-0.15959968695742177},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

The car is the company’s statement about the future of electric mobility: It is sporty, efficient and suitable for everyday use.\n&gt; \n&gt; “Audi will present an all-electric, luxury-class sport SUV in early 2018. The Audi e-tron quattro concept provides a concrete foretaste of this,” says Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Audi Board of Management for Technical Development. “It combines driving pleasure with great range, an expressive design and excellent comfort.”\n&gt; \n&gt; Electric power\n&gt; The Audi e-tron quattro concept uses the power of three electric motors: One electric motor drives the front axle, the two others act on the rear axle. Total output is 320 kW. The driver can even mobilize 370 kW and over 800 Nm (590.0 lb-ft) of torque temporarily while boosting. The concept study thus performs like a sports car. When the driver floors the right pedal, the Audi e-tron quattro concept sprints from a standstill to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 4.6 seconds and quickly reaches the electronically governed top speed of 210 km/h (130.5 mph).\n&gt; \n&gt; The concept with three electric motors which Audi is presenting for the first time makes the technology study an e-tron quattro. An intelligent drive management system controls the interplay between them as appropriate for the situation. The focus here is on the greatest possible efficiency. The driver decides on the degree of recuperation, the driving program S or D and the mode of the Audi drive select system.\n&gt; \n&gt; During sporty driving on a winding road, the Torque Control Manager actively distributes the power between the rear wheels as necessary. This torque vectoring provides for maximum dynamics and stability.\n&gt; \n&gt; The large lithium-ion battery is integrated into the floor of the passenger compartment. It gives the Audi e-tron quattro concept a balanced axle load distribution and a low center of gravity – prerequisites for its dynamic handling. The battery’s capacity of 95 kWh enables a range of more than 500 kilometers (310.7 mi). The Combined Charging System (CCS) enables charging with DC or AC electrical current. A full charge with DC electrical current at a charging column with an output of 150 kW takes just around 50 minutes. As an alternative, the study is equipped with Audi Wireless Charging technology for contactless induction charging. The charging process is very convenient. The Audi e-tron quattro concept uses a system for piloted parking that guides it to the proper position at the charging plate. In addition, a large solar roof provides electricity for the drive system battery on sunny days.\n&gt; \n&gt; The chassis also expresses the high-tech character of the concept study. The adaptive air suspension sport, which features controlled damping, lowers the body at higher speeds to reduce drag. The dynamic-all-wheel steering combines a dynamic steering system on the front axle with a steering system for the rear wheels. Depending on speed and the driving situation, they steer either opposite or in the same direction as the front wheels. The Audi e-tron quattro concept thus reacts even more spontaneously and stably, and is also very manoeuvrable at low speeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aerodynamic: The exterior design \n&gt; The Audi e-tron quattro concept harmoniously combines the design with the aerodynamics and all-electric drive system. The five-door technology study is 4.88 meters (16.0 ft) long, 1.93 meters (6.3 ft) wide and just 1.54 meters (5.1 ft) high. Its coupe-like silhouette with the extremely flat greenhouse that tapers strongly toward the rear lends it a very dynamic appearance. The car’s drag coefficient measures just 0.25 – a new best for the SUV segment, where figures are usually considerably over 0.30.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of this contributes considerably to the long range of more than 500 kilometers (310.7 miles). At speeds from 80 km/h (49.7 mi), electrically actuated aerodynamic elements on the engine hood, the flanks and at the rear end direct the flow of air as needed to improve the flow through and around the vehicle. This is one example of the intensive development work in the wind tunnel. Wind noise is low on board the car, and there are no engine noises in an electric car in any case. The fascination of electric driving unfolds in near total silence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The vertical separating edges on the side panels and the fully enclosed floor pan with its newly designed microstructures contribute to reducing drag. Cameras replace the exterior mirrors – another contribution to the excellent aerodynamics and also a foretaste of the future of driving.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the main lighting functions at the front of the car use Matrix laser technology. The bottom section houses a new, distinctive lighting signature comprising five lighting elements. Each of these combines an LED luminary with an extremely flat OLED element (organic light-emitting diode). Audi is developing Matrix OLED technology for use in production vehicles and is showing it for the first time in the concept study at the IAA.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rear lights also comprise two sections. Each of the top zones features nine red OLED units for the tail light function, with three more below.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deep integration: The interior\n&gt; The package of the Audi e-tron quattro concept enables a spacious, comfortable interior for four persons and 615 liters (21.7 cu ft) of luggage. The interior has a light and open feel to it; its architecture melds harmoniously with the operating and display concept. All displays in the interior use OLED technology. The extremely thin films can be cut to any desired shape.\n&gt; \n&gt; The new Audi virtual cockpit curved OLED is a further development of the Audi virtual cockpit that debuted in production vehicles in 2014. To the left and right below the fully-digital instrument cluster are two touch displays with black glass and a subtle aluminum frame. The driver controls the lights and the systems for piloted driving with the left display. The large display on the right is for media and navigation management. The steering wheel serves as an alternate control level. Its spokes are equipped with contoured touch surfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Below the selector lever on the center tunnel console are two more OLED displays for the drive system status, climate control and freely programmable information functions. The curved displays in the front section of the doors serve as digital exterior mirrors.\n&gt; \n&gt; The two rear passengers sit on comfortable individual seats. They can use the OLED displays on the center console to configure the climate control and infotainment for their area or to exchange data with the driver. An LTE module connects the Audi e-tron quattro concept with the Internet. The connectivity features in the study are cutting edge.\n&gt; \n&gt; The zFAS: Nerve center for piloted driving\n&gt; The concept study is equipped with all the technologies that Audi has developed for piloted driving: radar sensors, a video camera, ultrasonic sensors and a laser scanner. The data these supply come together in the central driver assistance controller (zFAS) in the luggage compartment. It computes a complete model of the car’s surroundings in real time and makes this information available to all assistance systems and the systems for piloted driving. These technologies are also nearly ready for use in production vehicles.\n&gt; \n\nI think what surprises me the most is that Audi is using in-house batteries (thought for sure they would partner with Bosch/Seeo), so that's a serious commitment, and DC fast charging via CCS.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"yes","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.02517031319439411,"1.1.1_stance":-0.45930321514606476,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14065922490210933,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08248489303514361,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1778586044735372,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.05548815803679948,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.005768033360557941,"ev_1":-0.17468554206054943,"ev_2":-0.2103106124753443,"ev_3":-0.2588882077309143,"ev_4":-0.2704645434384369,"ev_5":-0.12442876336875368,"ev_6":-0.03296950019527145},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

It is exceedingly expensive to install a 480V AC line in order to support a DC charger to a residence, and still quite expensive even for commercial properties.  Whereas most L2 chargers up to 7.2kW can be done within existing infrastructure that exists in most homes, and businesses.  This isn't bias against BEV's this is the reality of the situation.\n\nThe batteries in PHEV's and BEV's are no different other than the capacities used.  It's not like Chevy says we'll use the heavier/crappier batteries in the PHEV over the BEV's.  In general weight is a concern for either vehicle type so they will use the most power dense batteries for either application in order to improve fuel economy and/or range.\n\nThe difference in motors has nothing to do with PHEV vs. BEV.  The Leaf and Chevy Spark EV both use permanent magnet motors.  Permanent motors have a higher torque at lower RPM, and are overall lighter/smaller than coiled counterparts.  However, they are not efficient at high RPM ranges, which companies like Tesla value more.  It's the difference between a Ferrari and a Pinto.  You use one for one case, and the other for the other case because you're not expecting the Pinto to go 120+ mph.\n\nI don't think PHEV's stall BEV's at all.  Chevrolet I feel smartly decided that the infrastructure didn't exist to a degree to support BEV's as  you're only car when they started development.  The EV1 program really taught them that.  So they went the PHEV route, and they are now going into the BEV market big with the Bolt.  And really with only 2 widely available PHEV's on the market today really proves that fact.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-9.233701772852025e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08685938820958654,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.029415948937336605,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.051184678450226784,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16931275885292207,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.286613150273914,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.026801138003065716,"ev_1":-0.013389245797346424,"ev_2":-0.07410125410630523,"ev_3":-0.024781797949496347,"ev_4":-0.014042717525929524,"ev_5":-0.003915853552219535,"ev_6":-0.01134416570009004},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers or other (the reference group is not explicitly stated as family, friends, local community, neighbors, online community, other reddit user, partner/spouse, or political tribe, and there is no possessive indicator present in the text)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

Part of the reason they sell so many units is they cost &lt;$20K. Tesla expects the ASP of the Model 3 to be north of $42K. They also add the $1200 destination fee on top of that, unlike most brands that include it in the MSRP, and they make everyone pay MSRP, where the average car buyer actually pays several thousand less than MSRP. \n\nSo in reality, the Model 3 is more than twice as costly as mass market cars, and I sincerely doubt millions of people a year will double their car payment budgets to reach for a Model 3.\n\nIt should in theory have a larger following than the Model S thanks to the lower price point, but those customers will be moving over from BMWs and Audis, not Toyotas and Hondas.

There are a handful of superchargers in California where it’s normal for queues to form, but not...quite like that. \n\nIt’s hard to say what the future of gas stations and EV charging will look like, but it might take some shape of what’s currently out there today. A lot are going to say they are not needed, but they absolutely will be. Tens of millions of people road trip in the US beyond the range of a fuel tank. \n\nIf charging will still take 20-30 minutes in the future at each stop, I’d assume they’d be parking stalls strategically placed near shopping, coffee, and restaurants. If some adopt the gas station method, I’d expect it would be a more high-end gas station like Wawa where you can get made-to-order food. Again because people will be spending 20-30 minutes there. Stations that adopt the gas station model will want to offer food and services that attract more money per customer as there will be less customers there spending more time. \n\nIf charging gets to the point where it only takes 5-10 minutes, the current mode for gas stations would still suffice. However, you *could* see stations that offer vending machines and an inside area to hang out as EV stations do not require an employee but gas stations do. Per regulation, there has to be an operator trained to shut off the fuel pumping station in the event of an emergency. This is not true for EV stations. \n\nAnd there will also be the slower level 2 chargers at hotels where you can charge your car overnight. If these are profitable enough for the hotel chains, they’ll install more as demand picks up (they’re all over California hotels, but there’s always a car charging in them). If a hotel offers 2-4 chargers it’s more of a perk, but if they offer 20-40 then they can start making some reasonable revenue off them. \n\nThose are my thoughts.

Even the maxillofacial in injuries were confined to intoxicated people even when they wore helmets. I think in the below 15 mile per hour speeds people are able to avoid face damage if they are not intoxicated, so a bike helmet might be really all that's needed along with a ban on intoxicated riding.\n\nThis is also true for motorcycles and e-bicycles. I didn't see a particular difference in the statistics between the three kinds of vehicles when they have crashes at the same speeds. Surprisingly it even seems like rental e-bikes have it worse than the scooters in terms of injuries.\n\nI will note that no one actually tracks the type of helmet in their statistics. It appears just having any kind of helmet prevents the face damage as long as you're not drunk.\n\nI think it's quite different when you get into speeds over 15 mph and there the motorcycle helmet types are tracked. In those collisions and the ones with chin guards greatly reduced facial injuries.  I assume the same for scooters but then again scooters that go over 15 mph are often blocked by local municipalities.\n\nI would love for someone to do better studies and crash testing.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004549691608796517,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14509022932547708,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18218694403282265,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3219794853309213,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3115596758257598,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25475967549251377,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1378847052595423,"ev_1":-0.1753790795535941,"ev_2":-0.010305897072006095,"ev_3":-0.0036330482544144616,"ev_4":-0.004662392935036526,"ev_5":-0.009697301720734686,"ev_6":-0.03025207143703786},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

One of the reasons I drive an extremely old vehicle is for this reason- in the long run sometimes it is better to buy a used car because you're not creating another vehicle, and for my purposes, the gasoline engine is not so bad.   Also, I am well aware that carbon dioxide emissions are not the only way to do environmental damage.  However, that doesn't make climate change less bad is my point; leaking batteries and CO2 emissions are BOTH problems\n\nNow that you bring it up though....  Electric cars yes have an issue in that the batteries become hazardous waste and the lithium has to mined.  However, for the majority of places, electric cars are still usually better for the environment than gasoline. Gasoline cars, it would seem, cannot be made to be more efficient.  My 30 year old car gets almost the same gas mileage as cars that are 20 years newer.  Not much progress has been made, and it does not seem like there is going to be a while lot more.\n\nElectric though?  We haven't even begun to really sink our teeth into that one.  We're still figuring out new ways to recycle batteries and perhaps we can find a way to not use the lithium at all, or make sure they at least don't leak in accidents.  Making the switch is still better than doing nothing at all, which is what sticking to traditional cars would be.  Electric cars, generally are better, and we can continue to work on making them even better.  Traditional combustion engines though?

You can put yourself through the wringer with off grid load worksheets or you can take a small medium or large approach.  The latter being much easier.  Most of the systems my company installs are offgrid or grid tie with battery backup.  I have found that once we narrow down our electric consumption to only the devices that should be using electricity things get a lot easier.  Here are the rules you have to follow to be off grid with a realistic budget.\n\n1.  Secondary charging source (generator).  The solar is your primary charging source and you are going to want this to be big enough to charge your battery up most of the time.  You also want to be able to afford it.  A good rule of thumb is 2000 watts of solar per person.  having a generator is a cheap secondary charging source that you can use to charge up your batteries when its cloudy.  This will shrink the size of your solar array.  Honda has some great little generators that are under $1000 and can be daisy chained together.\n\n2.  No making heat with solar electricity.  Dont try and use your solar to make any type of heat.  This will tear up the batteries quickest and if you throw a heat producing device into a load worksheet it will make all the number go crazy.  This also means you have to heat and cook with something that gets burned on the property.  Design the house passive solar with a wood stove and gas cook range.\n\n3.  Insulate the heck out of this structure, design with passive solar in mind, keep the sun from coming in the building through the windows in the months when you need cooling.  Exterior shading is great.  Google \"tension sails\" or \"shade sails\".\n\n4.  Cool with a mini split.  Mitsubishi has mini split air conditioners that play nice with solar power.  You can run them at really low power draw so that the are mainly dehumidifying.  If you build the place right a mini split will cool it down nicely.  You have to realize that air conditioning can be an \"opportunity load\".  A device that you run when you have full sun and batteries are fully charged.  When you use an opportunity load you barely cycle the battery because the power from the solar goes right through the bus bar to the inverter.  Since you are designing a system where AC is going to be your biggest consumer, you need to face the solar array in the direction where its peak power production is at the time of the day and time of the year when you need the most air conditioning.  Probably going to be south west to west facing and and flat, like 20 degrees so you get the most power in the afternoon in the summer time.  \n\nNo I have no idea what your budget is but this would be very helpful for a designer.  I can tell you that a package with a 4400 watt pure sine inverter/a 4000 watt solar array on the ground/ and a 400 am hour lead acid battery bank/ and everything included but the stuff you might need at home depot would run you about $14000.  \n\nYou are not going to get this type of straight talk from anyone who doesnt know first hand how to design and install these systems.  I can lead you to the water but I can't make you drink.  PM me if you need more help, I get folks off grid all the time.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.27157867876271663,"1.1.1_stance":-0.30630302219685746,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18966525169132906,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16793251267958517,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.012671569759504564,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23741586339694407,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06436049026281883,"solar_1":-0.2584691971562981,"solar_2":-0.2762027842929537,"solar_3":-0.018253378472460707,"solar_4":-0.20884478086372837,"solar_5":-0.060794323257141514,"solar_6":-0.12818464624615444,"solar_7":-0.08256424407591112,"solar_8":-0.06482130769776025,"solar_9":-0.02823130768418025,"solar_10":-0.14094737624903325},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I've suggested that for some of those people access to superchargers works. I've conceded that for many, a current tech BEV truck is simply not for them.\n\nI've also declared there's a group of truck buyers who don't care about 300+ mile range with 5 minute refueling, and you simply don't want to acknowledge that.\n\nI'm not sure what you're trying to protect by not admitting that there's people out there whose needs are not what you're familiar with in your own world.\n\n&gt; People pay $50k for a truck that can haul things on the highway, your average daily driver truck is around $30k.\n\nWhere did you get the data that the $50k truck drivers only ever go long distances on the highway, and average commuters only pay $30k for their trucks?\n\nI see late model Denalis mixed in with the luxury cars at work. Those people are commuting in them daily.\n\n&gt; Torque doesn't really mean anything, it just affects the feel of the vehicle, power is what moves you down the road. \n\nPower is important, totally agreed. The P85D puts 691hp to the wheels. The 6.2 V8 available in a Denali, 420.\n\nYup, the power curve over RPM is super important, etc etc. But to claim a BEV necessarily has a power deficiency is ignorant.\n\nBut to then claim torque - especially low end torque - *doesn't matter* for a hauler? If you truly believe that, I'm not sure why I continue to engage with you.\n\n&gt;&gt; Do you think (the Volt truck) would be a hit?\n\n&gt; No. Is the Volt a major hit?\n\nTook awhile to get its footing, but:  \n\"As of September 2014, the Volt is the top selling plug-in electric car in the United States, and the Volt together with its rebadged variants are the best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle in the world.\" [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt)\n\n&gt; Maybe someday, when battery tech has matured enough to make BEV trucks useful, but until then you're dreaming.\n\nFor pretty much the last time, because I think I'm done with this thread: There's a big difference between a BEV truck being everything *you* would want it to be, versus it what *somebody else* would want it to be.\n\nI've stated that a current-Tesla tech BEV truck would be good enough to be my daily driver and utility vehicle. It would:\n\n* Be fast\n* Be easy to drive\n* Have more range than I would use in a day 99% of the time\n* Be (almost) free to keep going, combining my rooftop solar with free EV charging at work\n* Effortlessly do all of the towing and hauling that I current wish I could do but can't do\n\nI started this thread with the dream-like statement \"For a moment I was giddy with excitement, thinking Tesla had announced more concrete plans for their light pick-up.\"\n\nYes, I am dreaming. And I'm guessing it'll be brought to reality - with at least a concrete product announcement - by the close of the decade.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.25188467500151906,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3279295966627658,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22741216671862616,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.053858368657529354,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15888877046058952,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19584603411300136,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.298242542737474,"solar_1":-0.20282557316393116,"solar_2":-0.22144237526331204,"solar_3":-0.14114995694399113,"solar_4":-0.039523988806953035,"solar_5":-0.002750595015337846,"solar_6":-0.0038158959820672558,"solar_7":-0.004204518811699624,"solar_8":-0.014699431492772419,"solar_9":-0.04947137440176874,"solar_10":-0.09300847738632001},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Terrible excuse.  Either wind is cheaper than coal or it isn't.  Coal is a fungible commodity and can be exported.  The idea that they are doing it to ease the blow to their coal industry is ridiculous.\n\n&gt;Second, too much of one thing too quickly isn't always the optimal solution which is why they decided to replace some of the switched off nuclear capacity with coal in the interim.\n\nThey could restart closed nuclear plants far cheaper than building new coal plants.  If wind is as cheap as you claim, then there should be no issue with simply building windmills.  Unless, of course, intermittency is a much, much bigger issue than you are willing to admit.\n\n&gt;Finally, because they don't have access to cheap gas like they do in the US.\n\nThere we go.  The first tacit admission that intermittency really is a problem.\n\n&gt;It's always been more expensive there, it's mostly tax.\n\nThen why did the residential price increase so much over the very same period of massive renewables build-out?  You can try the ploy of \"mostly tax\" if you like, but I know their price history.\n\n&gt;Moreover, because Germany started rolling out renewables at a time when they were still far more expensive, \n\nFinally a point on which can agree.  Germany were dopes to adopt as many renewables as they did as early as they did.  \n\n&gt;...shouldering the burden for the rest of us.\n\nLet's not idolize the act of trying to boost their own industry.  They very much wanted to become an exporter of windmills and solar panels.  Their energy decisions were a handout to their own industry.  What they didn't anticipate is China undercutting them and eating their lunch.\n\n&gt;They also subsidize their coal industry heavily. \n\nHow much per kWh?\n\n&gt;They don't subsidize them at \"high levels\" either, it's just 5-6 Cent/kWh and that's for any kind of renewable power, not just wind. \n\nThat's pretty high.  That's more than the wholesale cost of power in many parts of the US.\n\n&gt;The numbers clearly show that wind power would be cheaper even without any of those subsidies.\n\nNo, only flawed LCOE numbers suggest that.  The article I linked to debunked the idea that LCOE is the appropriate metric, but you either didn't read it or found you couldn't take issue with it, so you continue to pretend that LCOE means anything.  Since you want to play that game, here is the cost of integrating wind at 10% and 30% penetration:\n\nPrice at 10% penetration:\n\n$/MWh|Low|High|Mid\n:-------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\nNuclear|1.7|3.1|2.4\nCoal|0.5|1.3|0.9\nGas|0.3|0.6|0.5\nOnshore Wind|16.3|20.5|18.4\nOffshore Wind|20.5|36.0|28.3\nSolar PV|14.8|57.9|36.4\n\nHere are the prices at 30% penetration:\n\n$/MWh|Low|High|Mid\n:-------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\nNuclear|1.4|2.8|2.1\nCoal|0.5|1.3|0.9\nGas|0.3|0.6|0.5\nOnshore Wind|19.8|43.9|31.8\nOffshore Wind|28.3|45.4|36.8\nSolar PV|28.3|83.0|55.6\n\nSo from now on, you can only try to pretend LCOE represents the actual price of wind.  Now you know better.\n\n&gt;I agree with them in most points except for the most important one: since nuclear is so much more expensive and takes so much longer to build, it simply won't happen.\n\nExcept it's not more expensive and it *is* being built.  It's being built in countries that don't have a carbon tax and won't have one.\n\n&gt;It's hilarious how happy self-declared conservatives, \"libertarians\", small government, anti-subsidy people and whatever else you skeptics call your economic views...\n\nDon't know why you bring that up since I am neither a conservative nor a libertarian.  I guess you don't like actually discussing wind costs so you want to deflect.\n\nNow, you haven't commented on Hansen's articles that I provided.  Please read them.  Also, please have a look at another estimate of nuclear/wind/solar cost:\n\nhttp://energyrealityproject.com/lets-run-the-numbers-nuclear-energy-vs-wind-and-solar/","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004762932502975066,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28923954977989885,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1565878447964916,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.29316322005615714,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2618254902888108,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16089332728819533,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.372225026289622,"solar_1":-0.3745422214269638,"solar_2":-0.08434098868714474,"solar_3":-0.11096594979365666,"solar_4":-0.035258470103144646,"solar_5":-0.21084254110852876,"solar_6":-0.04419134184718132,"solar_7":-0.05936556588858366,"solar_8":-0.012330974141756693,"solar_9":-0.07367320607105891,"solar_10":-0.10600161800781886},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (the author expresses a preference for nuclear over wind and solar, but acknowledges the importance of renewable energy)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Lot's of embedded CO2 emissions in those because they are made by factories powered by coal generated power. If that panel goes to a generally cloudy region, it will never save as much CO2 as it took to create the panel. What's more, it won't generate power for much more than six hours per day on average. So it would fail both criteria above, depending on where it is placed.\n\n&gt;We can't. There are industries that need other types of fuel. Jets need fuel.

Some companies simply quote general numbers, such as panel count and power component manufacturers' specs. Others are more detailed in their description of the layout. And many include satellite images of the home with panels superimposed. If you can assert a clear legal position, then perhaps you can press harder rather than letting them out quickly.\n\nThere are a lot of dependencies. Your state's laws, whether the company can suffer an very unhappy customer which nationals are more than happy to do and locals less likely, are just a few. Options sort of fall out of those. \n\nMaybe you submit a calculation to them using your estimated production loss as a counter offer to $300, letting them know this will prevent you from taking legal action. In one of the more expensive states, a rough calculation might be $60 a year in net metering credits over 20 or 25 years. Of course, if they agree, you will still need to find a contractor willing to bat clean up or to simply live with it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00024039268222016594,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07049825284402686,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2123911130761881,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3058516336096558,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3473104439203777,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27265567536492746,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.28298048096864176,"solar_1":-0.12210419494744273,"solar_2":-0.1495870615617605,"solar_3":-0.03673553197101379,"solar_4":-0.026136315675103106,"solar_5":-0.0014753623787934582,"solar_6":-0.014499679062282667,"solar_7":-0.0016897846629338649,"solar_8":-0.157690730469767,"solar_9":-0.04599906163834788,"solar_10":-0.1549409997690632},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I hate that the recent train built in California wasn't built in the right location on the coast, and part of that is due to antiquated and tunnel vision environmental protections.\n\n>isn't that ironic? Environmental protections messed up the building of this railroad and forced it to move inland, which massively reduced it's popularity and success. Yes, building a train line has some effect on the environment, but wouldn't having a bullet train that goes on the coastline from San Diego to San Francisco have way more pros than any cons it would cause to the environment? Shouldn't the priority be to get people to want to use it? Instead of worrying so much about the beaches that already have railroads near them and highways, just build another bullet train railroad on that beach. It will slightly affect the environment, but do far more help than harm in the big picture.

In fact, if you want to make your otherwise untenable argument more persuasive, you should read Just War Theory and the doctrine of Double Effect. Of course, the intentional/unintentional distinction is rather foolish. Your argument is the argument which says that the hundreds of thousands of dead and displaced in Iraq are not morally important. Because, we didn't intend it right! This is a completely bullshit way of analyzing things (or do your really think hundreds of thousands of dead civilians, children and the millions more displaced, some forced into prostitution are not morally important and that the U.S. has not done anything unethical?).\n\nNice straw man. That is in no way my position.\n\n&gt; The best way to conceptualize the argument, in my opinion, is this. There only a small set of possible food choices. Vegan diet, various strands of vegetarian diet, and omnivorous diet. My intention (intention is an important word here) is to make food to eat. Unintentionall, IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE, animals die. No matter which one I choose, animals die. There are no alternatives in which animals unintentionally do not die for the food. So you pick the best collection of animal-bloodied food sources which can easily include meat.\n\nIf I get you right, you are saying that since we can't avoid unintentionally killing animals, it is morally justified to intentionally kill animals? We see such a standard is ridiculous if we apply it to humans.\n\n&gt; Also Matheny is making a welfarist argument.\n\nOne of Matheny's conclusions is that \"vegetarianism kills fewer animals\". Whether the rest of his argument is welfarist or not seems moot.\n\n&gt; Lamey just argues against the numbers, not the ethical reasoning. This means, if the numbers are correct Lamey has no rebuttal.\n\nDavis' argument was that we kill less animals if we eat grass fed beef instead of a vegan diet. Arguing against the validity of his numbers is an appropriate answer. Arguing against the numbers does not mean they are the only ethically relevant factor.

I'd order a pizza from somewhere and - I swear - say \"everything but the vegetables\" when asked about toppings.\n\nHonestly after cutting the meat entirely the texture of the fakes gets easier and easier to deal with. Also, I have to agree with anchal3 that reading up on why you're making the switch will help immensely. I'm not a fan of PETA but the \"Meet Your Meat\" video killed any desire I had for relapsing (specifically the portion at the pig farm).\n\nIt's not easy but in the end it's worth it. You'll feel better about yourself every time you sit down to eat. Just try not to end up becoming one of those self-righteous vegan assholes.

Eating like a vegan is great, but vegans want to talk about more than food, sometimes, especially since the vegan lifestyle is not easy.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16627622903353653,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1940499926313603,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20874614383279277,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3198195674170383,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16501890539443917,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21115172124300405,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04232548379028837,"diet_1":-0.06591465360058162,"diet_2":-0.1403814741934184,"diet_3":-0.08027261482190322,"diet_4":-0.1522965030223228,"diet_5":-0.011276687057640325,"diet_6":-0.14844944043822275,"diet_8":-0.0018300743116318092,"diet_9":-0.008303176027159983,"diet_10":-0.0960649933743601,"diet_11":-0.05172546150303484,"diet_13":-0.014033827338910973,"diet_14":-0.23665377468010818,"diet_17":-0.029718443387537263},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

You can't fight for animal rights and get all the cows to go along with you That is a fundamental problem. You also run into the problem of causing harm for your side. Most of situations you described are where people have risen up against an oppressor, there is no real oppressor here though. You can say that animals are oppressed, but they are not, at least not in the sense that humans were in your examples. There is also no genocide, Holocaust, war, or what ever word you wish to describe the killing of animals as.\n\nAgain, I am not saying to go with inaction, I gave you several ways to help, you don't like them because they are not as extreme as you seem to be, but they were rational and superior methods to violence. The extreme position you take is why so many people ridicule veganism. You don't help anything, you only hut. Of course all of those is purely hypothetical, it is easy to raise your voice and be a, for lack of a better word, asshole on the internet, but it is very different. \n\nSaying morality is subjective, to me, means that it is not something to hate or kill over. I have the same view of religion. You can say that I have a \"I'm right\" attitude, but the difference is that my way of thinking allows others to think differently than myself. I might think you are an internet tough guy and an idiot with too much hatred and free time for his own good, but you are, at the end of the day, entitled to your beliefs, so long as you are not harming anyone else. \n\nIf you choose to harm others, that I feel you will get the violence you are so inclined to use, for a few minutes before you are either killed or arrested. All of your violence, all of your words, all of your hatred, all of your hurt feelings and frustration....I ask you, what has that done for the animals you claim to be wanting to save? Even as a vegan you don't save or help them, not really. \n\nThis is the point where you should decide to do something to help if that is what you are actually about. Trying to incite violence because of what someone eats is, quite honestly, retarded. People hate each other enough for skin color, religion, and other dumb things, what people eat shouldn't be an issue.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001030375521319608,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06636780197432017,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.070119542380174,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22742798117299876,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2694308375940737,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26172407547890547,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04263644194482671,"diet_1":-0.003598727950399431,"diet_2":-0.0019030367645124595,"diet_3":-0.002485357857949566,"diet_4":-0.0019697762284825635,"diet_5":-0.0013260867326607695,"diet_6":-0.001455690175741135,"diet_8":-0.0008805216039036168,"diet_9":-0.0004597793716432837,"diet_10":-0.0010499394702492282,"diet_11":-0.0013185208845243324,"diet_13":-0.0021988623157085385,"diet_14":-0.00681456823682917,"diet_17":-0.0007438675432543581},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (the reference group is not explicitly stated as a personal group in this text)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

The diet itself. Science, flawed or otherwise, supports eggs, meat, and fish. Some even supports dairy, which is total garbage due to pasteurization in my view but still. So you have a small section of someone's friends, maybe... 1/10, that's eating differently than the 'norm' so that's where bullying, mistrust, skepticism, doubt, fear comes in. Same thing happens to the one white kid in a black neighborhood or Muslim in a Catholic neighborhood. What people don't understand, they tend to fear, hate, or at least draw back from. Human reality. But they don't hate you or distrust you, they have an understanding of their beliefs and morals and ethics, from society, which you cannot change. \n\n2. Veganism is known to be very, very aggressive and preachy to an extent. The anti meat sentiment runs deep, similar to race and religion. To confirm that, just scroll through the past three days on this thread and see the amount of memes about killing meat eaters or waiting for them to die. So imagine speaking to those 9 friends above that eat meat, do you think they want to be preached at or changed. Same as religion, you believe in your own and have to be learn your own path. Such as watch earthlings and make your choices. Having someone constantly nag you isn't their path. \n\nI'm not saying that's the answer to your question, but those are my experiences so I shared it. I was a heavy meat eater for 15 years and I made my choices based on my own morals and ethics as I watched various documentaries. I would never have changed because I heard that I'm going to hell for eating meat. Never. I get constantly downvoted for still giving the 'opposition' a voice but, again, my experiences so they aren't wrong. Hopefully that gives context to the meat eater confusion. They don't understand what they don't know.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001572711703677972,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05960284444627177,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20151863595488423,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21224863154020568,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28733096255510304,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20200597350029517,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1458662056053678,"diet_1":-0.04350752039802804,"diet_2":-0.27228007138675475,"diet_3":-0.20202928725757374,"diet_4":-0.07752251622180968,"diet_5":-0.005920747242877648,"diet_6":-0.03795236090021111,"diet_8":-0.00784466784716642,"diet_9":-0.008184751829200346,"diet_10":-0.040371648480989585,"diet_11":-0.013972431221191073,"diet_13":-0.11101887551679586,"diet_14":-0.17920712025830435,"diet_17":-0.23895781087384468},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
