Yes?\n\n**Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.**\n\n&gt;I don't claim to be vegan, I am a vegetarian who tries to minimize animal suffering.\n\nI don't care if you are not a vegan, you're claiming high ground for consumption of animal products directly consumed from the line of cruelty vs cars. I sincerely hope you do not drive, otherwise you are clearly failing too.\n\n&gt; Metal is strip mined for cars. Plastic is created for many car parts, which as we know is very bad for the environment.\n\nI don't drive. I don't have a drivers license. Satisfied? But while we are on the subject, it is not possible or practicable to avoid all plastics and metals in today's day and age. Does it suck? Yes. Do most vegans try to avoid plastics? Yes. How much new things do you buy? I use my electronics, for example, up completely before replacing them with new things. If they still work, I don't get new things.\n\n&gt;Not to mention the human animal exploration used in the manufacturing of the cars.\n\nNot quite sure what you are talking about here. \n\n&gt; Then you have the actual pollution from the car which sickens and kills animals. If none of those are direct enough for you, what about the fact you kill thousands of insects a year driving. Every 10 miles you drive you kill about 9 insects. Drive ten thousand miles, that's over 9000! \n\nIf I do ever get a car, or my husband ever gets another car we are going for solar powered electric vehicles.\n\nAnd while my husband owns a car because he needs to drive in order to get places professionally (and sometimes for food, no reliable buses out here) he rarely drives more than 10 miles per fortnight, if that. Not to mention that the bugs problem will occur even if one uses public transport and sometimes we need to travel further than we can walk. It is a necessity in this day and age. I know... I walk most places, but walking a 5 mile round trip with a couple of kilos of perishable groceries in 40C (104 Farenheit) is not exactly sane, is it? Most of the food is going to be spoiled by the time you get home.\n\n&gt;So tell me again how driving a car is better for animals than eating honey? \n\nI never said it was better. I said it was EASIER TO AVOID. Hella lot easier. Here's how you do it; You don't eat the sustenance storage other animals have worked all year to collect, instead you use some goddamned sugar if ya want something sweet. There's an alternative.\n\nWhen we use a car it is usually because; public transport is not always available in a practicable way, it is not possible to walk the distance, the trip needs to be made. As in, the only option is to utilize a car. \n\n&gt; Del Monte, one of the biggest sellers of canned fruit, has most of it imported from china. Just the environmental cost of shipping it here, not to mention lax pesticide laws and working conditions in china, make it bad for animals. \n\nI don't eat a lot of canned fruit, and if I do, it is not Del Monte. I prefer fresh, locally produced fruit.\n\n&gt;Also while we are on the subject many fruit farms in America exploit bees for pollination. I am talking about loading colonies of bees onto trucks and driving them to different farms to pollinate fruit plants and trees. \n\nDifference between honey and pollinated fruit and veg? I know where honey comes from. I don't need it. I can cut it out. The exploitative pollination? I cannot be sure which fruit or veg has been subjected to it, there are no markings... I cannot simply cut vegetables and fruits out of my diet. It would look like this; mushrooms, yeast, some grains, walnuts(since they are usually wind pollinated). Yeah... sure... that's a sane diet, let me get right on that. But I am sure that I am supposed to sacrifice any capability of health until I grow my own legumes and fruits in my tiny, rented backyard, amirite?\n\nNow we get to the comparison you have made. You are presenting a brilliant hypothetical that you cannot prove exist as a wonderful person who is more vegan than vegan because they are completely isolated from the rest of the world (presumably) as opposed to a modern day vegan trying to be vegan and still live in society simply because this person uses no plastics, no transport, no metal, etc... eats plants only grown from their own garden but eats eggs... \n\nI don't understand what your damage is. I really don't. \n\nI don't drive a car, I don't consume a lot of unnecessary products. My \"new\" jacket for this winter is a decades old jacket that used to me my grandmother-in-law's jacket. Our rental house is furnished with hand-me-downs and second hand items. \nOur books, our clothes... most of it is second hand because we prefer to use things up completely. Our main computer is second hand. Our fridge is second hand. My husband barely ever drives unless necessary. We mainly eat locally produced food according to season. (fresh, usually) The mower we have is a manual push mower, it runs on vegan power. We are hoping to start our own garden, and some day hope to build our own self-sustaining, zero impact house.\n\nSo tell me again, how is your imaginary vegan a better vegan than me? And how many of those do you also do? No new, imported PS4s I hope?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.12542808000463992,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3135776329176479,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21298434433765565,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.052582256961613894,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2711477218680586,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2742103883431389,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20665179313012536,"ev_1":-0.1609246163171928,"ev_2":-0.20068041049914123,"ev_3":-0.07950241786117355,"ev_4":-0.13601581905580437,"ev_5":-0.05171516299014911,"ev_6":-0.13996310599516923},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

So Tesla's DC chargers installed cost $50k each. Tesla has done a process shrink on their AC rectifiers which will allow them to lower their cost per charging stall and has committed to doubling the size of their charging network.\n\nThis $50M in capital is enough to install 1,000 single stall 50kW DC charging stations at most.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004971232022702073,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17625700517137374,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20240957328762202,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.10748642683029175,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23822391221155018,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1768297194648653,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03126848977020321,"ev_1":-0.12125676594829571,"ev_2":-0.16100761124706153,"ev_3":-0.04147016070783138,"ev_4":-0.04094005515787558,"ev_5":-0.0009208098393476879,"ev_6":-0.03221780631179172},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

(And of course the Tesla Model S/X had the Chademo adaptor but they have superchargers)\n\nNew Zealand has gone down the same path as Australia (except they locked it about a year before us, which may have influenced our decision)\n\nSorry for the lengthy reply to a question you didn't ask :P","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00019910882231973423,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27139186049074226,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.155352434677089,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0303981751203537,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12689774655526284,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16965039029309992,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10352651738503482,"ev_1":-0.015198455216401877,"ev_2":-0.0012381891647237353,"ev_3":-0.0003952030359262911,"ev_4":-0.010868548371689712,"ev_5":-0.0006279430696546721,"ev_6":-0.010780925455037504},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I am a solar service technician out here in Hawaii. I have to jump start or rma the resu units at least once a week. We have installed hundreds of these units. Most of the time the cells don’t hold a charge after a couple hundred of cycles, even with the backup reserves set to 15% on the solaredge inverters. Proper firmware, proper install, proper inverter settings. Lately, we’ve been experiencing the batteries we have to expand so much that it pushes the top brackets holding the battery up and pops the lid. Expanding batteries are an instant rma and a huge hazard to the homeowner house and family. I guess the reason why I get downvoted is because I didn’t explain myself. IMO if you keep that battery in a cool basement like that you should be fine. Most of the installs just leave them in direct sunlight on the sides of the house.

A lot of noise about things they might to while others have been doing it, like Toyota's lithium refining at Naraha, BYD's mining operations in Chile, and Volkswagen's stakes in Gotion and 24M.

If we only had 800V+ EVs, you could half the size of the conductor which would probably reduce the size of the cable by 20% or so.  Length is also a HUGE factor with DC.  AC can move electricity across a LOT longer distance than DC can without the voltage dropping and heating up the wire.\n\nThere are complex calculators for really high amps and low voltage sags like you would need in a charger.

Called a deglacial episode because of its association with the melting of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, this interval illustrates the extreme sensitivity to change of the Earth’s climate system. The findings appear in the journal Paleoceanography.\n\n“One of the most astonishing things about our results is the abruptness of the warming in sea surface temperatures,” explained co-author Kennett, a professor emeritus in UCSB’s Department of Earth Science. “Of the 13 degree Fahrenheit total change, a shift of 7 to 9 degrees occurred almost immediately right at the beginning.\"\n\n.......\n\n\nhttp://www.news.ucsb.edu/2015/016158/dissecting-paleoclimate-change\n\n\n.........\n\nGiven that we have already measured methane plumes, from melting clathrates, in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf and off the oregon coast among other places, then the only question that remains is when did our 50 year period start? 5 years ago or 49?

Once you understand this, then the phony agreements and hopey well paid Bill Nye's and NGO spokespeople are seen for what they really are - desperate, delusional and in denial. I bet it's a much happier place to be then where I'm at in reality.

What this means is that out of 100 photons that hit a solar panel, only about 10 to 15 of them are converted to electrons. There is a *tremendous* room for improvement. Materials researchers and physicists have already gotten this process to over 40%. \n\nUsing the *existing* solar efficiency numbers, solar power is projected to be about 25% of the world's total energy by 2050. \n\n&gt;If you want to compare apples to apples, you need to look at the cost per kWh produced.\n\nOne of the benefits of renewables is that they don't deplete. Right now, nuclear power is not the world's largest energy source. By keeping everything the same, and not increasing the population or number of nuclear reactors, we have enough uranium to fuel the existing reactors by 200 years. That's it. \n\nNow factor in replacing the rest of the world's fossil fuel emissions by nuclear reactors, this 200 years drops pretty significantly. As the supply drops, just like with fossil fuels, the cost increases substantially.\n\n&gt;The external costs of nuclear are actually quite low, since it is the power producers who end up paying for clean-up. Again, you must factor in power actually produced to compare costs.\n\nThe problem is nuclear waste. We have a very small amount of nuclear waste right now because we've only recently started using nuclear as a significant energy source. Factor in 150 years of nuclear power replacing fossil fuels and you have a big problem. \n\nThis is why I say that for now, nuclear power will be great to carry over until renewables can sustain us indefinitely.

Have to check on the fuse part. I found that mentioned in an old manual on a distributor site... its not in the current manual on the SMA site. Guess I should call tech support!\n\nRan a few calcs with the inline fuses, but in the end, they didn't workout because they also could only go up to #10AWG. That actually simplified things. Since the maximum wire size the SMA can take is #6AWG, the choice reduced to going back with each circuit on #10, or going into a combiner, and evaluating a single / double / quadruple run with #6AWG. \n\n#6AWG x 1 run = $100 savings / -$8 yr production\n#6AWG x 2 runs = $23 added cost / $3 yr added production\n#6AWG x 4 runs = $266 added cost / $9 yr added production\n\nActually, the middle option is the best option. The solar array is at a 10 year payback, the middle option is at an 8 year payback -&gt; this makes the array more profitable.  But since there's 50% more terminal connections, and I didn't get into those voltage losses,  I'm actually not so sure the effort is worth the reward. I think I'm just going to stick with taking all 4 strings back in #10AWG and dispense with the combiner all together. \n\nAt minimum, this exercise shows how a 2-1 inline fuse that allows an upsize from #10 to #6 would be a pretty slick product...","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001978372662658027,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16927108047766523,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14158026878213156,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27273789420723915,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23502377485056034,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1974818117147856,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05755096433373789,"solar_1":-0.28539790069510645,"solar_2":-0.01274879230428875,"solar_3":-0.08036956122668926,"solar_4":-0.18616828645994038,"solar_5":-0.0020815117980722184,"solar_6":-0.012012328691829074,"solar_7":-0.03156964231554108,"solar_8":-0.019125898495985894,"solar_9":-0.10164745821526111,"solar_10":-0.38527915150542336},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The grid is not a one way system.  It is two way.  The entire grid.   rate classes etc are just for billing.

The other fees are supposed to be passed along from the generating company, transmission company etc.   So if utility credits solar house for 1kw/h and sells it to non solar home for the same as the credit.   They also get the SREC for the 1kw/h which goes to their requirement for emissions offsets.   Thus, the utility is whole, because of the fixed fees.  Both Solar home an non-solar home have paid their fees to use the grid.    In many areas the PUC allows the utility to even sell the 1kw/h at a higher rate as it is green power based on the SREC they received with it.

It will be an upsell.  \nBut, you want a purchaser to be able to buy a roof, powerwall and solar at the same time. All from one spot.  \nThere are definitely concerns, and it won't be as efficient as a current system, for sure.  That's not the point.  The number 1 reason people turn down solar is that it doesn't look good on their house.  If you eliminate that, and get it at the same price range (as a nice roof currently) When you get your  electric bill into consideration, your sales go up like crazy.  Solar install and Cogs have gone down for years, but cost of sales have gone up in most companies. If you can use the Tesla press machine to eliminate Cost of sales, that's the dream. \nEdit:  Oh and setbacks, yes, you can't run open wiring through setbacks, but you will be able to run these tiles up to the roof line. It's the same as a tile roof on a house now, or a metal roof. You don't see metal going up to the 3 ft line and then getting swapped out for comp.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0020287988202956817,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2707306536841291,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3028395161098229,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30834215801053055,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1243416594820701,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22282993322872538,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.31100675927397486,"solar_1":-0.1578001840989752,"solar_2":-0.1427892954268238,"solar_3":-0.0678846729133511,"solar_4":-0.04466891256743111,"solar_5":-0.04220733031858496,"solar_6":-0.05928407010166362,"solar_7":-0.008011203004571144,"solar_8":-0.11044296763429884,"solar_9":-0.2325127309425928,"solar_10":-0.24216514934475222},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Yes, you want to oversize the array rather substantially... but you are going to be doing that anyway since you're typically designing towards winter production. Compared to a USA-style net-metered array, the solar array should be at least 20% larger if not more. \n\nThen you consider battery maintenance. If it's an FLA battery bank, you really want it to recharge after day 1, if you are expecting overcast weather on day 2. Like a weak rubber band, FLA batteries work better when lightly stressed at the very beginning of their range. So this presents a Catch-22. You want a large enough battery bank so it only operates at the top of its range, but you also want to run a generator before the battery gets down to the bottom of its range.\n\nSo then you start looking at advanced batteries which cost 2.5-4x more but you can use 80%-95% of their range. Comparing all costs, FLA is running around $0.16/kwh whereas some of these newer batteries can get as low as $0.08/kwh. That might seem like great value, but then again, you have to pay for 3x more cycles upfront. That makes buying batteries similar to solar, in that you might be able to reduce your LCOE by 50% but very few people can afford to pay that substantial chunk of change upfront. \n\nAnd even at $0.08/kwh cost, you start to understand that batteries are very expensive to run your house on, and a grid-connection that only compensates you at $0.04/kwh might be the better option if it's available.\n\nThen you examine \"generator starts\". Even if you don't want a generator, and your FLA bank is sized to work 100% year round off the solar array, you still want to run a generator 12-24x per year to \"condition\" your batteries with an equalization charge. I've found this metric pretty useful as a good way to size a non-lead acid battery bank. \n\nSo now we have an FLA battery bank which is sized to run the home for ~3-5 days without auxiliary power, but you only use 20% of the battery and you run the generator every two weeks (even though you don't technically need the generator to have a stable power supply). You could compare that to a more advanced deep cycle battery which might be sized for 1.5 days off-grid, which doesn't need a conditioning charge, and results in a similar generator utilization rate.\n\nAt which point, it really boils down to client preference. Pay for 30 years of use upfront today to have a lower LCOS and rely on that generator as a criticial system component. Or pay for 10 years of FLA use with a higher LCOS and not rely on a generator for power (although you will still use it 12-24x/year REGARDLESS of the cost of fuel).\n\nYou probably want to go with FLA if you don't have a strong idea of what your energy needs look like. After a few years of off-grid operation, you have a much more precise look at your battery and can upgrade when it becomes time to do so. My prediction is at that time, you'll still keep your FLA battery bank to provide a small amount of daily baseload operation and have a lithium ion bank providing demand response for the majority of your power use. SMA/Schneider/Outback technical support will tell you their systems cannot handle multiple battery bank technologies, but will also say that people are hacking around with this. \n\nIf you want to go advanced for the lower LCOS (which off-grid customers commonly do when it comes time to replace FLA), it helps to have your winter use be relatively even to your summer use. This is because you're trying to use 80% of your battery each day but not crank the generator.\n\nIf your system is grid connected, I would opt for a smaller, more advanced battery. You need a LCOS of =&lt;$0.08/kwh for time-of-use differentials of $0.16/kwh+ before energy arbitrage begins to make sense. These batteries become more economic if you have a kW demand rate structure. \n\nOn a grid-connected battery, the goal is not to provide back-up power (a back-up gas generator being the recommended). Nor is the fuel cost a big issue since you only use the back-up for a very small amount of time. The goal is to use the battery every single day, for load leveling or energy arbitrage, without the need to run your entire home off the battery. This is why a smaller, advanced battery bank makes more sense for grid-connection and you see companies like Enphase/SolarEdge/Sonnen/Tesla recommending their batteries for these purposes (and not recommending them for 100% off-grid).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001901204736592869,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18435894823917007,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2689806157494097,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04913988336920738,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34803468967562734,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2558261947960207,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17973789824701344,"solar_1":-0.1699912922415964,"solar_2":-0.14440593480852995,"solar_3":-0.2255945599612956,"solar_4":-0.06987963677853352,"solar_5":-0.19665523538368168,"solar_6":-0.03129105499950432,"solar_7":-0.07784849969855319,"solar_8":-0.035115303886594146,"solar_9":-0.035592512016542344,"solar_10":-0.2701169719326362},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

If the generator is connected on the 220single phase and the main breaker to the grid is turned off, then as long as the generator is running at 60 Hz, the grid tied inverter will work with it. \n\nThe generator will track the load pretty well, and the grid tied solar inverter will output and reduce the amount of fuel the generator uses.  The problem comes in when the the grid tied inverter plus generator produce more power than the load is drawing.  I think a Tesla powerwall can run off grid because it can accept power while still generating the grid signal voltage.  When the battery gets full, it varies the frequency outside the acceptable range for the grid tied inverter to function causing the grid tied inverter to shut off for five minutes.  I’m not totally sure, but I think you need to have more powerwall inverter capacity than solar inverter capacity to deal with the excess voltage that turns on.  \n\nEnphase energy is coming out with iq8 microinverters later this year that will track the load and adjust output so they won’t over produce. In that case, as long as you have sun you can have AC power. They also are going to sell batteries called ENcharge which can supply power when the sun is not charging.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005780264036729932,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2422372155591506,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1747925090827435,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33474756045336385,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21795382506923033,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2502054926842016,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16296681761737375,"solar_1":-0.09193868356651513,"solar_2":-0.2386317793173968,"solar_3":-0.149203063526302,"solar_4":-0.046785678322183846,"solar_5":-0.05032038936165929,"solar_6":-0.016651421135369066,"solar_7":-0.2238879418776681,"solar_8":-0.08480108721778379,"solar_9":-0.21399493431316807,"solar_10":-0.17635530773968028},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (mentions benefits of solar and grid-tied inverters, but also mentions limitations and solutions)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

When I was researching the different battery options, I wished that discussions like this existed, so I'm more then happy to be starting one here. \n\nHere's how I'd put it. My goal with the solar battery storage is not to optimize for energy arbitrage, reduce peak demand charges, nor TOU load shifting. My P0 need (to borrow a term from tech / project management) is to have usable power during power outages. If your P0 need is different from mine, you may make a different decision.\n\nSo you can imagine that this drives most of the decision making. Reliability (avoiding any issues in the first place) and repairability (speed and ease of resolving any issues) are crucial. You may have heard stories of Powerwalls sitting broken for weeks or months because either replacement parts take a long time to procure, or it just takes a long time to get schedule someone from Tesla to be onsite. This is purely from anecdotes around the web, and not something I've been able to quantify.\n\nBut in any case, this is the worst-case scenario that I absolutely want to avoid. Having an inoperable battery during a power outage would make this all pointless for me. And that's where Enphase seems to have an advantage. Yes, capacity and power are important, but for me they only need to exceed some baseline I've calculated using my historic energy usage, and anything above that are simply nice-to-haves. Cost/value is another huge factor which heavily favors Powerwalls, further complicating this analysis.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.02326345629990101,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16523858889277834,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1556741611308695,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30338200690613326,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18840314189782825,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.28139391341148684,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10254623409127817,"solar_1":-0.27340473527874565,"solar_2":-0.10762078615153461,"solar_3":-0.17884274311654735,"solar_4":-0.07261329286606401,"solar_5":-0.009412275280434793,"solar_6":-0.09808813505032069,"solar_7":-0.08712090948877933,"solar_8":-0.16473875413066708,"solar_9":-0.020134732345923112,"solar_10":-0.08489632908972018},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Carmakers hope they will get a jolt of excitement from electric ones too.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning last month, it became the latest US carmaker to unveil a product to compete in a segment that comprised about 20 per cent of the US auto market’s 14.4m sales in 2020. The field is becoming crowded with Rivian scheduled to deliver the first R1Ts in July, General Motor’s GMC Hummer coming this autumn and Tesla’s space age-looking Cybertruck likely to go on sale next year.\n&gt; \n&gt; Electric vehicles comprised about 3.2 per cent of the US auto market in April, according to research firm JD Power and Associates. That share could grow if Americans embrace the new electrified entrants: a January survey from Cox Automotive found that two out of five consumers shopping for a pick-up in the next two years was considering an electric model.\n&gt; \n&gt; But success will hinge on whether electric pick-ups can draw in new buyers, including urban cowboys and commercial fleet operators. Traditional retail pick-up buyers may prove harder to entice because towing a heavy load — an important feature for many buyers — shrinks the distance an electric truck can drive before it needs to recharge. EVs also carry a perceived association with affluence and liberal politics, while pick-up trucks typically sell better in the more conservative US south and central regions.\n&gt; \n&gt; “We definitely see in surveying that there is interest,” said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. “The question is, how many of these people are there, who are they, and who will they buy from?”\n&gt; \n&gt; “There are a lot of players headed to that market,” she added. “Is the pie big enough for everyone to have a piece that is profitable?”\n&gt; \n&gt; The US market is dominated by light vehicle sales, a category that includes vans, pick-ups and sport utility vehicles. In 2020, cars only made up a quarter of US vehicle sales. Yet the most visible EV models in the US have all been cars, including the Toyota Prius, Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the past two years, electric vehicles’ share of the US car market has nearly doubled from 1.7 per cent. Tesla’s Model Y and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E helped drive that growth, said Tyson Jominy, JD Power’s vice-president of data and analytics. It was “really the first the time we’re giving Americans what they want — SUVs — as opposed to giving them hatchbacks. The only thing Americans were most distrustful of than EVs were hatchbacks.”\n&gt; \n&gt; Because pick-ups are such a large market, a carmaker only needs to capture a small percentage to sell significant volume, Jominy said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The federal government and automakers alike are pouring money into electric vehicles. President Joe Biden’s fiscal 2022 budget includes incentives for EV purchases, infrastructure and federal EV purchases totalling $4bn, with funding peaking at nearly $34bn in fiscal 2026, before tailing off. By 2025, GM plans to spend $27bn and Ford $30bn on EVs.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Lightning is critical for Ford because the F-150 is the Dearborn, Michigan’s flagship franchise. The company says it has 70,000 purchase reservations for the pick-up. Rival GM plans to follow the GMC Hummer, which revives the name of the archetypal early 2000s gas-guzzler, with an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado.\n&gt; \n&gt; The field of EV-only companies includes Tesla and Rivian, as well as smaller players such as Bollinger Motors and Lordstown Motors. Ohio-based Lordstown, which has attracted the scrutiny of federal regulators over claims, which it denies, that it overstated its pre-orders, said it would need to slash its annual production plans and raise additional capital.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tesla, with the Cybertruck’s distinctive stainless steel exterior, and Rivian, with a $75,000 starting price on the R1T, are targeting lifestyle buyers who may not have owned a pick-up before but are intrigued by the prospect of an electric one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ford is heavily marketing the F-150 Lightning to commercial customers, who often are more focused on a vehicle’s maintenance and fuelling costs rather than the sticker price alone. The truck is priced at $40,000 to start and can be used at a worksite as a generator.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jay Darling, president at Darling’s dealership in Bangor, Maine, said he had 80 reservations to buy the Lightning, compared with roughly 65 for the Bronco, Ford’s competitor to the Jeep. Many of the customers operate fleets. Several of the reservations come from solar power companies.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; “The newer [F-150 hybrid] PowerBoost and the Lightning seem to be hitting a mark that consumers want and, in particular, businesses,” he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; But electric pick-ups, at least at first, will not be as profitable for carmakers as pick-ups, vans or SUVs with internal combustion engines. Automakers command higher prices selling “cars by the pound”, yielding greater profits compared to smaller vehicles. The higher costs to manufacture an electric vehicle eat into that margin.\n&gt; \n&gt; GM chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said on Thursday that the company’s new battery technology, Ultium, cost 40 per cent less than the batteries used in existing Chevy Bolts, and GM aims for a total reduction of 60 per cent by 2025.\n&gt; \n&gt; “We’ve targeted about a 10 per cent margin,” he said. “That’s been in place for a long time, and I think we’re making great strides to there . . . We’ve got a good trajectory to manage through that transition [from petrol to electric] and keep those margins intact.”\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides watching profit margins, manufacturers also will need to convince would-be buyers that an electric pick-up has the same capacity as a traditional pick-up. Hauling a boat or camper eats into how many miles an electric pick-up can drive without needing to recharge, and “unless the lake is 150 miles or less from your home . . . it does start to limit what you can do”, Jominy said. Even though pick-up owners may only need to tow a couple of times a year, they are unlikely to want to compromise on power, again suggesting that for manufacturers “to be successful they’re going to have to attract new customers to pick-ups”.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are also questions about customer acceptance in parts of the US where pick-ups are popular, but political conservatism feeds scepticism of electric vehicles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pam Cotton Conn owns a dealership in Carol Stream, Illinois. She said she was “ridiculously excited” about the F-150 Lightning, with a front trunk where the engine used to be and business owners’ potential to save on gas and maintenance. She advertised the truck’s unveiling to the dealership’s customer base and received an email from a man annoyed by the new product’s perceived political ramifications.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that was a single person on a 19,000-strong mailing list, she noted, and for those who prefer trucks with traditional engines, they are still for sale.\n&gt;","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.033024746303757034,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20713291957112262,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17203531739369282,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12061527697369456,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31063012058135236,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.35332710553511265,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15206741636696583,"solar_1":-0.013315342269680267,"solar_2":-0.2181308540419624,"solar_3":-0.07776446492304483,"solar_4":-0.0022169717497793804,"solar_5":-0.005626794426156323,"solar_6":-0.003038994414964691,"solar_7":-0.0025437442600377835,"solar_8":-0.007846864629148817,"solar_9":-0.0063459187804255635,"solar_10":-0.18305834805748114},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (the author expresses interest in the new electric pick-up trucks but acknowledges challenges in attracting traditional pick-up buyers due to limitations in towing capacity and perceived association with affluence and liberal politics)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers (mentioned in passing, but not a significant focus of the text)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.

Generally speaking, DC coupling is a problem and needs to be removed from an electrical system or it will cause failures.\n\nNow using PV to power DC devices directly, there's nothing wrong with that, but it requires some thought as it's very easy to make it less efficient than AC and and inverter.  Generally when people talk about DC, they mean low voltage DC (under 100 volts) and this low voltage is significantly less efficient (whether it's AC or DC).  So if you stick with low voltage, you need to spend more money on thicker wires, more money on DC-compatible switches, and you will usually lose more power in wiring resistance.\n\nHowever if you go higher voltage DC - around the same voltage level as grid AC, so 120 or 240 volts DC, then you are back up at the same efficiency level as 120/240V AC, you can use the same thinner wires, etc.  You still need to pay a more for DC-capable circuit breakers and switches, but you won't have anywhere near the losses of low voltage AC or DC.\n\nThe question then becomes, if you already need an inverter to produce mains voltage AC, is it worth having another set up to produce mains voltage DC, or can you use low voltage DC without incurring a loss greater than the AC inverter loss?\n\nPersonally I think it only makes sense if you don't have an inverter, and all your cable runs are short (less than a few metres/feet).  Any runs longer than that and it will lose more power than an AC inverter, unless you spend more on massive cables.  At which point you may as well spend that money on a larger AC inverter or more solar panels and just use AC.\n\nEVs that can fast-charge on DC are a good option though, because they will accept voltages around 400 VDC and above in some cases.  This means you can take the higher voltage from a string of panels (typically up to 1000 VDC) and feed it straight into the car (more or less) and because the voltage is so high, you will have minimal losses (it will be more efficient than dropping the voltage back to 240 VAC and using AC charging).  However you still need to adjust the voltage in response to commands the car sends you, which means you'll need something that can twiddle the voltage up and down, so you'll likely end up with effectively some kind of inverter in there anyway.\n\nAll in all, I do tend to think that the extra complexity by maintaining a DC system is going to make it less attractive for a long time yet.  If you look at computer data centres, huge buildings full of computers, they have been trying to run them all off 400 VDC for over a decade now to save power and reduce electricity costs.  But despite the potential of saving quite a bit of money in electricity costs, it still hasn't taken off, which can only be because maintaining a whole DC power distribution system is still not worth the added complexity over a simple, robust AC system.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.014587408489508865,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08100091146459362,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18002088358497637,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22731473357893048,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19941775050787985,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23543062732244044,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2620478826521364,"solar_1":-0.13732337910672263,"solar_2":-0.10572676817901083,"solar_3":-0.128216627467753,"solar_4":-0.19290349875336688,"solar_5":-0.011207473352745486,"solar_6":-0.13717275821545627,"solar_7":-0.013129153304665428,"solar_8":-0.012335500317324962,"solar_9":-0.030970674256352027,"solar_10":-0.1355590760443583},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It is the DC rating that dictates how much energy your system will generate, assuming a standard range of DC:AC ratio.  If you were to install the same 4kw of solar panels on a 10kw inverter, you would not generate any noticeable increase in energy.  The utility company is concerned about the AC power of your system, as that is what affects their power lines and transformers.  They could care less how many DC watts of solar panels you install.  This is why your paperwork with the utility company has the system listed in AC watts.\n\nYou seem to have a misunderstanding of a common practice in the industry.  Nearly all installers will design and quote systems based on the DC rating, as that is what is directly attributed to energy (kWh).  If you don't believe me, search for PV Watts, which is one of the most simplest and oldest production calculators.  You have to list the system data in DC watts (the sum of the panels wattages).  It does not ask for any details on the AC power of the inverters, because that does not impact energy (assuming a standard DC:AC ratio).\n\nAC power will not correlate to energy.  I can install a 5kw solar array on a 10kw inverter and energy output will not be proportional to the AC rating, it will be proportional to the DC rating.\n\nTo sum up - you got what you paid for and the numbers you measured are fine.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000697864668230371,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1583292919177893,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2119216371359754,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1444012012022237,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27109265342387734,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20823040724627617,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.015035488851329623,"solar_1":-0.19889918921520197,"solar_2":-0.015469266664998335,"solar_3":-0.0005372432791167133,"solar_4":-0.004401879070125385,"solar_5":-0.0012856719198074036,"solar_6":-0.0008888409702194622,"solar_7":-0.001718560658749387,"solar_8":-0.001536060878909969,"solar_9":-0.045889912020101065,"solar_10":-0.0040611060030641966},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

The reason is because it's double the labor: the work to take the panels down, and the work to reinstall the panels back up!\n\nYou still own the panels, which is good, as you don't need to pay for them again. However, while they are taken down, they need to be stored carefully, as this is where they are at their most vulnerable! It's easy to accidentally scratch or break a panel while they are all being stored next to each other (sharp edges), and the panels are super easy to steal when they're all conveniently sitting on the ground. So, you need to clear some space inside your garage to securely store them.\n\nThe good news is that I could shop around for my choice of contractor to do the solar panel removal and reinstallation, and by a lucky contact found through a previous contractor, I found a solar company who did a great job for a better price. This was in California, not Florida, though.

I did a diy install but only did the procurement and hired people for electric work and installing panels.  15kw for $28k, but that was bc I overpaid for panels during last minute crunch time at the net metering deadline.  I believe NJ has great repurchase rates for solar, so I'd overbuild and sell back the power.  20kw system should cost in equipment no more than $16-18k, all in.  I'm being generous here.  I can literally do it for about $10k in equipment on the west coast.  Hire a licensed crew and get installed for maybe $10k, assuming you don't need to do work on electric panel.  If you do, try to do a line side tap as that doesn't increase the cost as much as changing out the electric panel.   So maybe $30k all in for a 20kw system, before any rebates.

If you say \"I respect you\" and with a heavy heart kill the pig, or if you laugh as you do it, it really makes no difference. Compared to factory farmed meat or whatever, it is an improvement from the animal's point of view if he treats the animals better and kills them more humanly - which is likely. I don't think anyone's said the effect of what he does is worse than a factory farm.\n\n* For some random guy, there isn't the expectation that they necessarily have a good idea of where their meat comes from or what's involved, or that they even think about the animal. Perhaps they don't even know that it is possible for humans to abstain from animal products and live a healthy life. For someone that was previously vegan, I'd have the expectation that they have full awareness of the ramifications of their actions, the alternatives that are available, an so on. For that reason I would be inclined to gives them less leeway.\n\n* You're probably never going to get a vegan to say something nice about something that is diametrically opposed to the fundamental tenets of veganism, even if it is an improvement over other possibilities. As an example, if someone is extremely opposed to rape, and there existed a sect of rapists that just raped their victim rather than raping them and beating them too, would you expect that person to say something favorable about the latter group? They would think *all* rape is bad, even though rape in addition to beating is objectively worse.\n\n* There is a perhaps irrational feeling of betrayal when someone that was part of a group that adhered to some moral code leaves the group and commits acts that are diametrically opposed to that code.\n\nI speak primarily for myself with those reasons, but I would not be surprised to find that they apply for others.

Sincerely curious. Cereals are the grains of grasses. When I said grass fed cows are fed oats and alfalfa I mean the oat grass before the grain has a chance to mature. \n\n&gt;It just doesn't follow logically.\n\nUhm, it does for vegans. As people ethically opposed the cruelty to and EXPLOITATION of animals we do not see the raising of animals to satisfy our tastebuds as something that would logically follow our ethics.\n\n&gt;Read \"Meat: a benign extravagance\" this issue is very easy to oversimplify.\n\nI am not going to buy a book for $25 that I cannot afford just so that we can have this discussion. I am reading interviews with the author, on the other hand, and he seems to be lacking in providing an answer for \n1. How this helps with the ETHICS of killing another animal for food when we do not have to\n2. How cattle actually DESTROY the pasture they are on and the LARGER amount of land needed to maintain herds since you need to rest each part of pasture.\n\n\nThis man is quoted as to saying this;\n\n&gt;But animals also eat food we can't eat, such as grass. So the real conversion figure is 1.4 to 1.\n\nSurely he should say \"grass that is not oats, rye, wheat, barley, maize/corn, rice, sorghum, millet, buckwheat, triticale, fonio and similar\" if he talks about us not eating grasses? Because we do. Grains are the seeds of grasses. \n\nHe then goes on to argue for a very low meat consumption but seems to think that dairy consumption could remain on the same level as it is today... forgetting all the problems that goes in to the dairy industry to begin with.\n\nHe started eating meat again after being a vegetarian because he started raising goats and he \"had to do something with the males\" because males do not give birth and milk? You want me to read the book of a man who has no ethical center and labors under the illusion that we can maintain our dairy consumption as-is on small family farms while treating them ethically and letting any and all cows graze on grasses not suitable for human consumption? Does that sound reasonable to you? Why would I waste $25 (half of my food budget for the coming week) on a book like that?\n\n&gt;Also check out this subreddit, someone posted an article arguing that a vegan diet would kill up to 25 times more sentient animals.\n\nFeel free to find it and share the link with me. If it is about pasture raised cattle and not grain fed I would also enter the proviso that we compare it to ethical agriculture and home grown food, not commercial farming... since there is no way the grain fed beef, with the grain fed dairy and chicken sourced eggs kills 25 times more sentient animals than eating the cereals and soy that goes to those animals directly.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.039404755303015314,"1.1.1_stance":-0.38281476423374244,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16916932419077707,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3496403969108908,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21598145216045161,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.4556541303239487,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22861391848273713,"diet_1":-0.07654640624980402,"diet_2":-0.21012738499415345,"diet_3":-0.21790954968023524,"diet_4":-0.04487849427383139,"diet_5":-0.15418121182059016,"diet_6":-0.26537771977382363,"diet_8":-0.07767616204425092,"diet_9":-0.2837856501767722,"diet_10":-0.11364344115269205,"diet_11":-0.16240208867681644,"diet_13":-0.17957087776934108,"diet_14":-0.0869391657154463,"diet_17":-0.0817234704818647},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

This is not a cult and giving bad health advice is not the best way to grow veganism. I care about humans too. \n\nVeganism is not limited in that I am also going to use my voice to share the effects of processed foods and sugar etc\n\nIf we want people to remain vegan and spread veganism we should at least have the best information for those that ARE interested in taking the best care of themselves and living the longest. \n\nYou seem to not realize that maybe the person addicted to sugar doesnt know any better. Veganism suffers from retention problems and I see too many people coming here with digestive issues etc because they are eating processed foods that are being targeted to vegans and too many people here do not know how to differentiate between a whole foods diet etc  I will continue to educate myself and celebrate whole foods veganism and try and help those suffering to maintain their veganism. \n\nAgain, Veganism does not exclude humanity and it is this cult like mentality that is so frustrating. Each person is on their own path and of course being healthy is a huge part of veganism for those that it is. Just as celebrating the fact that oreos are vegan is important to some people that identify as vegan. but the fact is I am human and I might tell the person the health effects of sugar. \n\nJust as I am might start talking about the working conditions of a factory clothes are made or iphones.

My justification is that my personal interests, actions, and desires do not necessarily outweigh the rights of others. For veganism specifically, people have to truly make minor concessions (which eventually convert to feeling like living your normal life) in order to stop supporting the violation of many individual's negative rights (and not to mention other secodnary issues such as  environmental impacts). I'm trying to get us to that understanding.\n\nThe driver's interest in not being inconvenienced while driving does not justify violating your loved one's negative rights. Vegan or not, I recognize that, and thus do what I can to minimize the unnecessary violations of others rights, especially where it is obvious (e.g. veganism as one example) and requires minimal impact on my life as a whole.\n\nThe driving example is my attempt to get you to make a concession against the convenience of one individual (their driving route) for the negative rights of your loved one (in the crosswalk), laying out the interests involved. Your loved one has an interest in their own negative rights. The driver had an interest in not being delayed while driving. Does the interest of the driver match or outweight the negative rights of your loved one? That's my simple question to you in order to get us to how that answer applies to animals.\n\n >On the second line you quoted it's true I'd much rather have a code where I can do whatever I want and you can't but noone would accept this so it forces a compromise where both of us are bound. It's different from the example you constructed.\n\nDo you disagree that people shouldn't just do *whatever they want?* We **already do** make compromises on so many things, because of the underlying ethics, ultimately. Even if people only limit their actions out of fear of punishment, there is still an ethical stance underlying the action which pushed people to create the punishment for it in the first place (as you said).
