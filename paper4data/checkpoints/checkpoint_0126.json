It's my understanding that the front of most cars will crumple more readily than the back and it appears as though the impact was between the threshold where the front of the at fault drivers car crumples but before the back of the Tesla needed to crumple to protect the passengers. It does weigh a good 500kg more than most other cars it's size on the road so can probably absorb much higher impacts without deformation.",

It was lamentably short-lived, 2012-2014.\n\nToyota tends to come out on the better end of their joint-ventures.   The NUMMI plant taught Toyota a lot more about American autoworkers than it taught GM about Toyota assembly line processes.\n\nAnd of course the old NUMMI factory in Fremont, California is now under new ownership and builds a certain popular electric sedan.\n\nYou're completely correct about the RAV4 EV, in both incarnations, being entirely a CARB compliance vehicle that helps confirm that Toyota's focus on low-emission vehicles is going to stay on hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains.",

So just consider a PHEV, when shopping around -  they might be a viable alternative for what you're looking for.\n\n\nOtherwise I think most of the full electric cars are going to get you similar range in  a full charge ( about 100) compared to a plugin (25-40) and it  boils down a lot as to which car you like the extras on and cost; although I've read the leaf doesn't do as well in the warmer climates.",

"comment": "While I agree with your sentiment that society can be weaned off of fossil fuels, it's not a realistic possibility in the near future (especially in the time frame Jerry Brown has considered of 'by 2030'). Batteries in every home and solar panels on roofs and electric cars in garages are all well and good, but the simple fact remains that solar alone cannot come close to meeting the energy needs that the grid currently supplies. Implementing solar on the residential scale is obviously a great step towards decreasing reliance on the grid, but it is supplementary at best. \n\nThis is all healthy discussion though and demonstrates that the zeitgeist of this generation is shifting toward a focus on renewables and sustainability. That being said, I still wouldn't trust legislators to lead the shift to renewable energy and fossil fuel divestment (especially in CA, where, despite the stated goal of decreasing GHG emissions, has decommissioned nuclear power plants in favor of coal plants); let consumer demand and private investment follow the market.",

It also helps with motor wiring to not need to electrically reverse, just use the reverse gear.\n\nYou'll want a pack somewhere around 150v or more. Thats around 50 large format lithium batteries in series. You might want to look into used nissan LEAF batteries, they are physically robust and easy to mount.\n\nFor a controller I'd recommend the Soliton1. It's rugged and incredibly simple to use. It has a wide voltage range so you can add more battery later without rewiring or changing parts out.\n\nFor a motor the standard is pretty much a Warp 9. Reliable and pretty common. You might want to look into AC motors but you've got less choice there and costs are usually higher.",

It has the same battery size as the VW e-Golf which gets 124 miles, but it's boxy shape really hampers its efficiency.  I like it though -- I don't have one, but I test drove one and also rented the ICE version for a week recently.  Have a look at the Alex On Autos review of it on YouTube.\n\nOtherwise, you're looking at the Tesla Model X ($100K) or waiting for the Hyundai Kona (likely limited availability) and the VW Crozz which is several years away.  Even those seem to live in this world between hatchback and CUV size-wise.\n\nETA: I think Mercedes also has a crossover coming out soon, but like the Model X I don't pay much attention because it's out of my price range.",

It should be noted I DIDN’T get anything about Harry Potter from the early news coverage.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t disturb my original point. If a Tesla customer WERE to put in a custom DVD player, it would be the customers fault for altering the vehicle and not paying attention.\n\nI did originally try to compare it to an ICE engine with a broken thermostat for the sheer simplicity and ease of understanding. That is a better example and much easier to confirm the accuracy of the effect it causes as there ARE SO MANY confirmed cases of issues caused by thermostat failures. I, personally, have seen a few and they make the most spectacular chemical waste fountains.\n\nEdit: Clarity in the first section",

"comment": "Today, cost for making hydrogen and compressing it is a major issue. It is hard to convert people off their existing habits anyways, and something with higher cost is always harder. With a FCEV, both the cost of the vehicle and the cost of energy are very high. With a BEV, the cost of the vehicle is high, but not nearly the cost of a FCEV and the cost of energy is very low. Today, the specific energy of batteries have gotten to the point that they are viable as general purpose energy stores for most light duty passenger vehicles. That wasn't the case before recently.\n\nFuel cell technology may be worthy of continued R&amp;D, but they are not ready for a scale up in production.\n\nLithium element availability is not really an issue. The more immediate concern is cobalt, but again, not really a major issue.\n\nFCEVs may find a perch somewhere eventually, but the transition to BEVs is the here and now and for the foreseeable future.",

There are MANY more electrical connections with the smaller tiles, more things to go wrong.

"comment": "&gt;GM claims the Bolt can handle 170-190 miles at 70mph highway speeds. I don’t own a bolt, but I felt that’s a good test of an EV.\n\nA test for what? I rarely drive at that speed, because it's so hard on the range, but a full 100% to 0% at 70mph under optimal conditions (about 80F along with a willingness and physical stamina to drive w/windows up and without the AC on ;) ) you'd probably top that number slightly, maybe 195mi. Entirely unclear to me though how you get from there to the Bolt's EPA range as underrating the Bolt???\n\n&gt;And I will say this: The i3 has seen software updates that allowed it to squeak out more range on its batteries. Dialing down throttle response, upping the regen a little bit, etc.\n\nUh, that can fly with the i3 but would very much undercut what Jag is trying to do with the iPace.\n\n&gt;Remember when EVs only got 80 miles unless they were a Tesla? And this forum basically stated that’s enough for 80% of the population? I remember.\n\nI'm new around here but I suspect you're colouring your recollection. Then there's the matter of the other sizable chunk of the population, and about how much tighter it feels as you approach 200 mi. It's really a difference of \"can use it\" and \"it beats ICE to use it\" for long distance traveling. The later is where the bar is at now.\n\nP.S. Also, given state of charger network currently being quite different for the iPace.....or maybe that means the iPace is just going to be staying close to home in NA for now, anyway? ¯\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

"comment": "It's never a simple decision to make is it? Haha. As far as cost I wasn't so much referring to the up-front or monthly cost seeing as in your case they seem to be very similar, but more the overall cost. As we're pretty good at pointing out in the EV community, the total cost of ownership of a car can be very important. BMW is a premium brand and there's no getting around the fact that it's going to be more expensive. Even if nothing goes wrong with the i3, which is very likely, regular maintenance and replacement parts, like those i3-exclusive tires, aren't going to be cheap. But at the end of the day EV maintenance is so minimal that the cost difference might not even be that much.\n\nI completely appreciate the size issue, I live in Spain and my first car was a little Toyota Yaris for a reason haha. You'll probably want to check dimensions or actually try out the i3 with car seats but I agree, I think they'd be fine. The boot is, like you said, more than enough for shorter trips and daily use. \n\nIt looks like you've definitely done your homework and without a doubt you'll be saving money going for either of the 2 cars. The much lower insurance cost is surprising considering that EVs are generally more expensive but I wonder if it's some sort of additional incentive (?). Let us know on the thread which option you go for!",

"comment": "They could if they want I guess. But VW spending $2 billion on public EV infrastructure/charging was part of the Dieselgate settlement and upped popped Electrify America/Ionity, so I guess they actually aren't allowed to limit it to anyone.\n\nTesla also doesn't really make anything from charging sessions at their current prices which is okay because it helps them sell cars, this is what I meant by they're subsidised. Ionity charges almost 3x as much and is the most expensive that I know of, so they do try and make a bunch of money from them being used. Banning Teslas that buy a large amount of electricity in a short amount of time and then freeing up the space would probably be losing their best customers. The opposite is true when Tesla bans others, non Teslas would be the worst customers by charging much slower and taking up spaces for longer while paying the same total amount.\n\nIt'll all level out eventually once non Tesla charging infrastructure becomes just as good and when most non Teslas also have fast charging. Until then Tesla would just be shooting themselves in the foot. Give it 4 years or so, Tesla will open them up eventually.",

M3 is the best value and MS is and AWESOME car that never dissapoints. Polestar has an AMAZING lease deal now or you can get the 7500 tax credit if you buy before 12/31, 2 years free supercharging, and three years premium. If you like and use google, thats another big perk (google maps much better than Tesla maps imo)  \n\n\nIMO all three are fantastic options and you'll be happy and have a ton of fun with any of them",

"comment": "I am completing a house like this currently. It's on-grid, but I aimed to make efficient enough to go off-grid if I wanted. Here's my thoughts.\n\n1) Super insulated and super sealed, think passiv-haus standards. My house is close to passiv-haus and might pass if I tested it when done, or might not due to being small and having a stove vent. Blower door tests, double-wall construction, R50 root, all that stuff... Alternatively, just heat with wood, that's what my friend's off-grid in a yurt do.\n\n2) Super efficient appliances. Mini-split heating (if electric), heat-pump hot water heater (or a system that heats from the wood stove), oversized high-efficiency ERV/HRV unit (if you explicitly ventelate), induction stove top, LED lights. Ideally design for a sunfrost fridge - I screwed this up in my kitchen design so ended up with a smaller fridge that's half the size but a bit more than have the power use... second most efficient fridge on the market. I'm still mad at myself for that.\n\n3) If the system is small enough buy battery appliances when you can. Battery power tools, battery vacuum, etc. This will be more efficient and help keep your peak draw down.\n\nI'm in a rural area and intend to put my solar on the ground. If off-grid you want to be able to clean it regularly, especially if you have snow. Ideal seasonal angles also help. IMHO \"ensuring you have a south-facing roof\" is not the way to go here if you have the space.\n\nMy plan from the start was a hybrid inverter with battery and grid tie (specifically sol-ark-15k is my current plan, I'll add load management if I find I need it) - but to try and build so we could expand for off-grid if we want. We get long outages anyway, so I want to make those easy. I tried, but couldn't figure out how I should wire my main panel so it was easy to add an inverter. I haven't done it yet, but based on my research my main advice is to make sure you save some space near your main panel for the inverter etc. If you've got that any rewiring you need to do shouldn't be that hard. As others said I have a generator (driven by my tractor). \n\nEchoing what others said I'll probably never actually go off-grid. I'm in Vermont so off-grid is even more expensive. We go long periods in the winter without sun sometimes, and the days get short, and I need to run a heat-pump and own an electric car. I'd probably need at least 4X panels, and something like a week of battery (and I think I'd still need the generator occasionally).\n\nBut regardless of whether I do go off grid the effort still pays off as long as I stay in this house a while. It'll help me during power outages, and reduce the solar size I need to offset my bill. With my well-built house even without power backup I went 3 days with no heat in the dead of winter due to an outage, and our house was still in the 50s F.",

"comment": "Two motors on a single axle can give you more fine grain control of torque to each wheel, without the need of a differential. However, a single higher-powered motor, when combined with a locking differential (or some kind of torque vectoring differential) can apply more torque to a single wheel. In off-road or high-performance applications (track racing) this can be very beneficial.\n\nThe Ford Lightening SuperTruck (used in the most recent Pikes Peak Hill Climb) actually uses two rear motors mechanically linked and power a single limited slip differential. A Ford engineer explains this concept really well here:\n\n[https://youtu.be/EwidlmAShZE?t=3011](https://youtu.be/EwidlmAShZE?t=3011)\n\nOff-road you have a similar situation when you lift a tire (or 2) off the ground. With quad motor, one powering each wheel, you are limiting the amount of torque you can apply to the wheel that still has grip. People like to say \"but electric motors can produce lots of torque so it doesn't matter!\". I would STRONGLY disagree with this, and people really underestimate how much torque may be needed in an off-road situation (especially for such a heavy vehicle). See pretty often the quad motor Rivians really struggle with this off-road and their \"simulated\" lockers leave a lot to be desired.\n\nJust to give people some perspective on torque numbers, I have a '97 Wrangler with full lockers. It's also geared pretty low and when in 4wd low range and 1st gear it has a total \"crawl ratio\" of 70. With the 4.0L engine at 1000 RPM it's producing about 75 ft/lbs of torque, which results in 1300 ft-lbs of torque at each wheel but can peak at 2625 ft-lbs at 2 wheels (with 2 wheels off the ground). From what I can find a quad motor Rivian is 495 ft-lbs of torque for one of the rear motors with a final drive ratio of 12.9:1, which results in peak torque of 6385 ft-lbs at a wheel.\n\nSo, with my Jeep at nearly idle, the Rivian can still produce about 2.5x more torque at a single wheel in a situation with 2 wheels off the ground. However, at just 2000 RPM the 4.0L in my Jeep produces about 200 ft-lbs of torque, which results in 3500 ft-lbs of torque at each wheel. In a 2 wheels off the ground situation the peak is 7000 ft-lbs at a wheel, which now exceeds what the Rivian can do. Worth noting the Rivian weighs over twice as much.\n\nAnother issue is that electric motor makes all that torque at a very low speed, which means a TON of heat being generated. It probably doesn't take long for the motors to be thermally limited in torque output.\n\nI used to be in the \"quad motor best off-road\" camp, but after seeing some Rivians off-road and really thinking about it, I think dual motor EVs with lockers might be the best combo. Possibly even a traditional 4wd ICE drivetrain but the ICE swapped with a single large electric motor.",

"comment": "The CHAdeMO was already there. \n\nA few years ago, EVGo started adding Tesla plugs to some of their chargers, via a CHAdeMO to Tesla adapter mounted on the charger. When the CHAdeMO wasn't being used, it was \"parked\" in the Tesla adapter, allowing the Tesla plug to be available. \n\nThe problem, of course, is those Tesla plugs only work on a Tesla because they're not CCS based, which will confuse the f--k out of anyone who buys a new non-Tesla with a NACS port in the coming months, plugs into an EVGo Tesla charger and is unable to charge.\n\n\"NACS\"/J3400 is really just CCS using a Tesla plug. The original legacy Tesla protocol is essentially CHAdeMO, and Tesla didn't add CCS support to their cars until 2017 or so. Newer Teslas can communicate with both CHAdeMO and CCS-based chargers. Very old Teslas only \"speak\" CHAdeMO and can't use CCS chargers even with an adapter.",

Now then, I still am missing advice on sizing, I don't want to oversize the PV system since netmerering overproduction yields whoselsale rates. I wish someone made a tool to use green button usage data (down to hourly use details) to suggest the best PV sizing and to go TOU/ TOU2 or not. Are you guys aware of any such tool? Maybe it's worth reiterating that on TOU some say the overproduction multiplier is as much a 3x of nightly usage (due to TOU peak vs non peak rate difference). With that a Costco sunrun agent advised taking 60% of net of household plus EV use.. I should research some more, please chime in on helping me brainstorm. Thanks all !!\n*note: aware of SDGE 120% cap, will be filing for an exception showing addition to family, EV etc..",

"comment": "Well a few things.\n\nFor one, solar has indeed dropped a lot, so much so that you can now save money on your bill without any money down and essentially risk-free at a hedged, locked in utility bill. That's pretty cool and that's pretty new, too, a decade ago you still had to pay a premium. And while you could save money a few years ago already, you still often had to put $15k down, that changed, too.\n\nWhether you call that dirt-cheap or extremely affordable sort of lies in semantics territory. Getting Nikes for $30 is dirt-cheap and extremely affordable, for Nikes, but it's not any cheaper than similar non-brand shoes, and you could argue they're still hella expensive. My point is that articles can say different things and be correct due to loose semantics.\n\nBeyond those semantics though, there's also a few issues.\n\n1) people are simply wrong. I've read so many bs articles over the years. This isn't unique to solar, in every industry you have companies putting out PR pieces to try and get consumer demand going and to start a discussion, and sometimes they're hyperbolic and wrong, and sometimes these get the most attention. VR for example has been 'about to arrive' 6 times since the 80s-90s now. A bit similar to say google glass disappearing quite quickly. VR is finally looking realistic with the Oculus Rift and everything that came after (Hololens etc), but who knows. \n\n2) misleading. This stuff isn't wrong, but misleading. For example, the price of solar modules in 1975 was $75, today it's $75 cents. That actually did happen and it's completely correct, but module costs are just part of the story. Yet millions of articles are written about this, often because people have no clue that a solar module is not a solar panel, and a solar panel isn't an installed solar panel, between each of those are big cost-incurring steps, which is why the actual price can be 5-10x more expensive than just the module price. Another is that sometimes you have people compare installed watt costs to other things, like wind, when wind usually has a higher capacity factor (i.e. there's a difference between generating capacity, and actual generation), which can make solar look cheaper than it actually is. (as there is a lot of misinformation that makes solar look more expensive than it is). So there's a ton of apples/oranges comparisons.\n\n3) changing context. When feed in tariffs and subsidies were announced, obviously on that basis, solar got cheap, and would stay cheap. If only the tariffs stayed. Look at Germany for example, tariffs were sharply reduced. Solar still stayed affordable because the price of solar dropped a lot, but its offset by fewer subsidies, and so a positive effect was accelerated, and another positive effect was delayed. This is what causes the hype cycles of every few years solar, somewhere, breaking through, and then getting tampered, yet the articles won't stop being written. And it's not just subsidies, about a decade ago silicon prices rose extremely sharply due to shortages. All of those markets had to mature for such bumps in the road not to occur. And not to mention competitors. Fossil fuels have dropped extremely sharply very recently for example, that affects things, too.\n\nThe combination of all those things can explain most articles which, combined with loose wording, are pretty understandable.",

For a backup solution where there are very few cycles, there are no advantages for lithium.   All battery life is based on a combination of time and cycles.   Lead acid life would be shortened to 5 to 7 years with aggressive daily cycling (currently still cheaper than lithium).\nlead acid batteries are: larger, heavier, capable of less cycling, safer, cheaper.\n\nAlso note that with net metering you are not \"selling power\".   This would have tax and bill implications.  You are instead banking the power or trading kWh",

"comment": "Here's [an example](http://www.codaenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EnergyDemand_Chart.png) of what our load profile looks like. One way to \"level\" those peaks is to use batteries (as shown in orange).\n\nOne problem with commercial solar is illustrated in this graphic. Once the array size exceeds the difference between the mid-day peak and evening peak, it no longer offers demand savings to the customer. Furthermore, if a cloud passes over the array at mid-day, even that smaller array might not offer any demand savings to the customer.Also, our morning and evening peaks are much closer to our mid-day peak than what that graphic shows.\n\nOf course, the problem with the battery solution is that batteries are expensive.\n\nWhen you add up all of our load profiles together, the curve smooths out, with higher demand occuring from mid-day into the evening. The dilemma of commercial solar is that while peak power is being provided to the grid, that peak power generation does not translate into cost savings to the customer. In fact, the opposite happens. Even with net-metering, large commercial solar arrays only generate at ~50% of retail price because they offer relatively little demand savings.\n\nThe solution is to add energy storage to the mix - but that increases costs and pushes payback out the window. Perhaps a lower cost solution could be developed which focused more on automated power controls, ramping up building energy usage on items such as HVAC as a function of array power levels.\n\nWhile that sounds good in theory, I'm still undecided on whether such a control circuit could have value without a storage component.  But perhaps the storage component could be much smaller if assited by the control circuit.",

They should know first hand, they had weeks of time to study the record ice once their ship got caught in it, way before they even got to where they were claiming it to be.  They got stuck in ice even they claimed was not there..  [Funny](http://www.climatedepot.com/2014/01/01/clitantic-ship-scientists-trapped-in-ice-claim-expanding-sea-ice-caused-by-global-warming-but-data-and-studies-refute-claims/).  They even blamed global warming for the expanding of the sea ice.  (Can't even try to make this crap up)  \n\n\nOr the polar bears \"that are gaining population\", they have tracking devises on them.  The problem with  the tracking is, they are tracking them doing one of two things... SWIMMING FOR 6 MONTHS AT A TIME or WALKING ON ICE THAT ALARMIST DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE... [here is the latest overlay](http://alaska.usgs.gov/science/biology/polar_bears/images/bear-movements-September-2015.jpg) and as you see, mrs polar bear is taking a very long swim, or there is ice there.  Now, please note, that polar bears have been recorded to take 6 week swims, but it is very uncommon.  But 6 month swims have never been recorded. \n\n\n\nBut again, to answer your question, we still have ice at the north pole.  I know they said it would be gone by now, but you can't take a boat to the north pole yet.  In fact, it's a hell of walk to get there over miles and miles of ice.  \n\n\nAlarmist claims for the north pole:\n\n[here](http://www.takepart.com/article/2012/09/20/ice-free-north-pole-just-few-years-leading-scientist-says)\n\n[Here](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/North-Pole-ever-closer-to-having-no-ice-1285401.php)\n\n[Here](http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=3f16c255-7c20-4024-a02d-6a93d8aca59c)\n\n\n\nYet [THIS](http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2015/05/icepack-levels-growing-rapidly-to-record-levels-at-the-south-pole-north-pole-still-frozen-solid-3151842.html) is what we get.  Where the models wrong?  Or did the 97% get it wrong?  Is the media jumping ahead of the scientist and claiming stuff they do not understand yet?  Or, is it something more simple, like money?  How many wind turbines or solar panels could we sell if there was no global warming??  How much of the keystone pipeline would be built today if there was no global warming concern??   How cheap would gas prices and electric prices be today if there was no global warming concern??  How much money DID they make of global warming last year?? \n\nThose questions never get asked....  and they should!!!",

If I have a 1kw system and energy costs $.10 a kwh I save about $18 a month in energy costs, but with a $10 increase in my service charge I now save $8 a month.  That was a big hit!\n\nIf I have a 10kw system I save about $180 a month in energy costs, but that $10 increase in service charges I wind up saving $170.  That is not as big a hit.\n\nThis is what NVEnergy proposed in NV and I believe that though they \"saved the net metering rates\" the elephant in the room is increasing these fixed charges.  They were going to go up about $25 a month I believe.",

"comment": "Asking about how the install is preformed can be a deal breaker. I work for a company out of SOuth Carolina. We see SunRun installs all over the place. They are famous for running conduit directly off the roof to the power equipment(disconnects and meters). One thing our comapny prides itself on is clean looking systems. We penetrate into the attic where the wires are run into the main service panel. Then go out to the other service equipment. This type of installation allows the homeowner to use the solar before sending any excess back to the grid. Alot of comapines(sunrun included) run right off the roof because it is easier and alot of the time you are grid tied, which means you are giving all the solar to the grid before you use it and your are just selling it 1:1(if you have net metering). As far as pricing is concerned you are looking at between 3 and 4 $/watt.",

Our program this week is a good 2017 update to the solar industry, and our target audience is business professionals (engineers, architects, managers, developers).\n\nI do need some [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUsPdSpH905lJSO_hnWoItw) subscribers so I can change my stupid channel URL.\n\nBut I think your biggest asset is knowing people with deep pockets in the financial community. The USA solar market is so messed up thanks to the private sector IMO. There are plenty of other countries which are presenting great investment opportunities in solar, where community solar offers cost-savings to both the participant and investor alike. A lack of funding is the real problem. \n\nIn particular... if you know anyone with stranded overseas money, community solar is one of the best ways to put that money to work.",

"comment": "Although your theoretical magic panels don't exist and probably won't ever, the military would love to have them. They're highly interested in mobile energy applications such as solar trailers and rapid deploying solar systems. Being able increase the power per panel carried into the field would be extremely valuable.\n\nSimilar uses would be in anything portable or temporary, such as solar for disaster relief, large scale emergency power systems when infrastructure fails (more common in Africa and Asia) and field research. This would also apply to automobile and bus rooftop solar concepts, where space is at a super premium.\n\nFinally, space based solar cells would basically switch over this immediately unless these magic (and totally non-existent) panels weighed more than 4 time more than conventional panels. Lift costs are still high, so higher power output usually means better economics.",

"comment": "Here you go:\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With her foot down to show off the acceleration of the zippy electric car, Joanna Edghill spins around the car park before plugging the vehicle into a charging point beneath rows of solar panels converting Caribbean rays into power for the grid.\n\nIn the five years since she and her husband started their company Megapower, it has sold 300 electric vehicles and set up 50 charging stations plus a handful of solar car-ports on the 21 mile-long (34 km) island of Barbados.\n\nThey are now expanding elsewhere in the Caribbean.\n\n“The main factor with islands is we don’t have range anxiety. I can develop and roll out a charging network in Barbados where customers are never more than a few kilometers from a charging point,” said Edghill, who previously worked in international development.\n\n“We have at least 220 days of pure sunlight every year, so why not take advantage of the resources that we do have here?”\n\nBurdened by a costly dependence on imported fuel for energy, Barbados and many other Caribbean islands are considering boosting the number of electric vehicles on their roads.\n\nBut they face barriers, including high initial costs, stiff import duties on electric vehicles and a lack of regulatory support, say people working in the sector.\n\nGlobally, the number of electric vehicles topped 3 million in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which predicts there will be 125 million in use by 2030.\n\nThat figure could go as high as 220 million if action to meet global climate targets and other sustainability goals becomes more ambitious, says the IEA.\n\nMore research, policies and incentives are needed to drive further uptake, it notes.\n\nIn Barbados, the island’s electricity utility, government departments and private firms are among the customers buying the lefthand-drive electric cars and delivery vans Megapower imports from Britain, said Edghill.\n\nIt has also built solar car-ports, which power charging points, for the Barbados arm of courier giant DHL and the government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nMegapower’s other solar panels feed into the grid, offsetting the equivalent of the non-renewable power used by 400 electric cars.\n\n“The Caribbean is ripe for the electrification of transportation,” said Curtis Boodoo, assistant professor at the University of Trinidad and Tobago who also works on electric vehicles with the CARICOM regional group of 15 countries.\n\n“If you invest in electric vehicles, you are able to use your existing electrical infrastructure, and save the costs of the transportation fuel that you have to import.”\n\nGREEN BUSES\n\nPumping fuel into electricity generation is two to three times more efficient than putting it directly into car engines, he said, meaning more electric vehicles on the roads could help shave the region’s hefty bills.\n\nFor many Caribbean countries, over half the amount of fuel they import is used for transport. Barbados spent $300 million last year on fuel imports, government data shows.\n\nCrippled with public debt and dogged by rising oil prices, the island’s new government wants to make its bus network electric, and eventually switch all government transport too.\n\nBoodoo said increased state investment in electric buses would help upgrade transport systems, while cutting climate-changing emissions and paving the way for consumers to follow.\n\nPlug-in vehicles could also “piggy-back” on a push to inject more power into the grid from renewables like solar, wind and hydro, said Devon Gardner, CARICOM’s energy program manager.\n\nCosts are high, however, and on some islands, import duties for electric vehicles are higher than on combustion-engine cars.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago has scrapped taxes and import duties for most electric cars, but taxes elsewhere can add up to 100 percent depending on the model.\n\nHigh purchase prices mean vehicles remain unaffordable for most Caribbean drivers.\n\nA Nissan Leaf electric car, for example, costs about $50,000 in Barbados, compared with $30,000 in Britain.\n\nHeavily indebted Caribbean countries are torn between collecting much-needed revenue from car imports and supporting the roll-out of private electric vehicles, said Gardner.\n\n“The Caribbean doesn’t have the luxury of using some of the levers of incentives that were used by the richer, more developed countries,” he said.\n\nNonetheless, power utilities in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and St. Lucia are starting to install charging networks, which could help the sector expand, said Megapower’s Edghill.\n\n“Privately owned utilities want people buying electricity, so every person that is plugging in is a person not buying gas or diesel, but buying their product,” she said.\n\nBATTERY BACK-UP\n\nJohn Felder, who founded Cayman Automotive, plans to open an office soon in Havana and anticipates a healthy market in Cuba for electric bikes and scooters which start at $800.\n\nLow import duties on electric vehicles in Cuba make them cheaper to buy, said Felder. He has sold about 60 electric cars in the Cayman Islands - which has cut import duties - and installed 15 charging stations he wants to convert to solar.\n\n“The eco-system is very fragile - there are no freeways where you can go 70, 80 miles per hour for hundreds of miles,” he said. “Electric vehicles are perfect for the Caribbean.”\n\nWhile fast-improving battery technology is making electric cars more attractive globally, on hurricane-prone Caribbean islands, emerging vehicle-to-grid technology could use power stored in batteries to keep the lights on if disaster strikes.\n\nPower stored in one electric bus could provide energy for up to 50 homes for a day, or power shelters and community centers if overhead electricity cables are knocked out, said Boodoo.\n\nDriving down prices might be key to kick-starting an electric car revolution. But some bet islands will gradually wake up to the benefits plug-in vehicles can bring by improving public transport and taming expensive diesel habits.\n\n“I’d like to say that within five years, 10 percent of the (Barbados) population will be driving electric vehicles - I think that’s realistic,” said Edghill.\n\nReporting by Sophie Hares.

"comment": "I don't need much wind, just a small 400W vertical axis one would be fine and those are quiet and can be mounted on a roof as long as you have consistent wind like we do (we're up on a hill.) To get enough PV with enough storage to go off-grid all year around takes a lot of doing, but making the house as energy saving as possible and best using the energy generated, plus storing the PV for use after the sun goes down makes sense if there's also a consistent source of medium wattage power to supplement it. I would need 3x as many panels as I have (and my roof is utterly full already) plus 3x the battery storage to have a hope of going off grid, but a small 400W turbine or maybe two would turn that around entirely.",

"comment": "Running heat pumps (COP of 3 to 7) with fluid through the solar panels to make hot water for radiant floor heating gets rid of the furnace, and heats water up to 700% more efficient than electric water heater.  Hot water storage lets you use average winter sun days to store heat to cover for the cloudy winter days.\n\nAn EV makes the system cheaper.  It needs (leaf) a reverse charging feature, though.  Instead of designing for the worst possible winter day, you can design for having to go recharge the car at a supercharger station on a bad day, though generally often in winter, while having something very practical and useful to use overcapacity in other 3 seasons.",

"comment": "Have you researched the PG&amp;E rate plans in detail to see if you'll actually save money?\n\nI'm asking because with only a 5 mile commute to work, your EV charge costs are going to be pretty low. I'm not a PG&amp;E customer, no am I on an EV rate plan with my utility, but my understanding is that by switching to an EV rate plan you are also placed in a higher tier during the day which could increase your overall bill, couldn't it? I've highlighted an applicable section from their website.\n\n **Home Charging EV2-A**  \n(Non-tiered, Time-of-Use) \n\n\"This rate plan works for customers who have an electric vehicle (EV) and/or battery storage and can charge during off-peak hours of 12 a.m. to 3 p.m., ***in addition to shifting other household energy usage to off-peak hours.\"***",

EVERY day I hear at least one person say “oh no, I couldn’t possibly go solar the HOA/neighborhood CC&amp;R’s won’t allow it”. This is completely false. In Oregon no HOA can prevent you from installing solar panels. They can ask you to position the panels in a certain way but not if 1. The reposition will raise the cost of a solar system by $1,000 or 2. The reposition will affect the systems performance by more than 10%. Which for nearly all systems, it will.\n\nAdditionally, any solar company worth it’s salt should talk to the HOA for you, so you won’t have to deal with any of their bullshit. \n\nThe point is, if your HOA says you can’t have solar and you want solar, google the laws in your state. You just might be very happily surprised.",

"comment": "I had Tesla solar + Powerwall installed (in Utah) about 6 months ago. Pre-sales support was not great - it took a lot of back &amp; forth to get them to agree to run conduit in the attic rather than over the roof. They also only sold in even 4 kW increments. I wanted to max out my roof space which would be about 10 kW but they would only sell me a 8 kW system and I'm on my own for adding the rest of that capacity (and potentially putting my warranty at risk if I do it.)\n\nThe install crew was fantastic - knowledgable, professional, and friendly. They were local Tesla crew, not contractors. I told them exactly where I wanted everything (Powerwalls, panels, etc.) and where I was hoping to have less/no equipment for aesthetics and they went out of their way to make me happy with the install.\n\nAround here at least they are using 315W Q-Cell black panels which look nice and seem to have a good reputation. They also use SolarEdge inverters with power optimizers.\n\nThe monitoring they provide is rudimentary. They used to be able to give you access to the SolarEdge monitoring website/app with panel-level monitoring but now substitute the SolarEdge gateway with a proprietary gateway and the data is no longer going to SolarEdge. You can work around that by running an ethernet cable to the inverter and disabling Tesla's gateway but again that may have warranty implications. I just did that on mine recently and I'm waiting to see if Tesla calls to ask me why they aren't getting data any more.\n\nI'm happy with the system and the job Tesla did installing it but be aware of the caveats. Also see if there's a local Tesla car club - ours just did a group solar buy that got everyone 10% off the already pretty low Tesla price. There may be something like that going on in your area. Also if you use a Tesla auto/energy customer's referral code both you and them will get $250.",

"comment": "They primarily use SolarEdge inverters on existing installs. To hook up to a Tesla PowerWall, you need to install an additional piece to add battery functionality to the inverter. If an install doesn’t have a PowerWall, Tesla needs to install their Neo Gateway hub. Not to mention they’re purchasing a product with its own margins where they could “easily” make their own and enjoy those additional profits. \n\n\nMain point is, they need to make several accommodations to gain their full desired compatibility with SolarEdge while this Tesla inverter has all of this included.",

"comment": "For sure, they seem to be pushing limits of silicon with solar but your right in that time frame I'm sure at least one or two breakthroughs will happen. Funny thing is even with solar roof option it wouldn't be much more than my electric bill. For me personally, the 30% tax credit is pretty awesome, I will use every penny of it lol. So the bigger projects are that much more tempting.\n\nSolar hasn't changed terribly much in 10-15 years, roofing certainly hasn't. Solar roof is really far ahead of current standards. But the rate at which technology is starting to change most professions will probably be dinosaurs in 10-15 years so may as well live while we can eh?!",

"comment": "I remember in the late 70s after the Arab Oil Embargo there were studies done on space-based solar power. The idea was to collect solar power in orbit and to beam it down using microwave. The  conversion would use klystrons and rectennas, which are efficient. The main problem was the cost of putting the system in orbit. It might become more feasible if the SpaceX starship works.",

If grid is up, it will then export to the grid. \n\nOnly if the grid is down (or you take the system off grid in the settings) will it flip the pannels off, run off battery, then flip back on to 100% and rinse/repeat. \n\nWith net metering the batteries usefulness is just backup. However, there is no guarantee that net metering won’t go away (my electric is discussing doing away with it and making solar homes go to a weird TOU plan that will screw homes with no battery).",

"comment": "This falls under electrical code in general, not a solar-specific code. When the inspector is reviewing the solar, they will often check that this standard is met because it didnt use to be code but now it is, and many houses were built without it. To some of them its important enough that they will fail the solar inspection over it and expect the solar installer to bring it up to code. In my opinion its something the salesperson, project manager, and installer should have checked for and known about from the beginning so they could handle it before the inspection, as its definitely not anything new. \n\nHaving said all that, it shouldnt be a deal breaker for the installer to run a bare copper wire from the water meter up to the attic then over to your service panel, or run it around the base of the house, or wherever works best in your situation. In my experience its also acceptable to bond your grounding clamp to any metal water spigot on the house, so if there is one closer to your service panel i would go for that. However if your inspector or local jurisdiction specifies the bonding needs to be specifically on the water meter itself then you just gotta follow what they say, each city/county/jurisdiction has different standards",

That makes paying down low interest fixed-rate amortizing debt a generally bad investment decision. inexpensive leverage is a generally good thing to have access to. if you were advising a business and not your own household, would you tell them to deplete their cash reserves for capital improvements, or stay liquid with a long term fixed rate note, particularly for an investment showing real time savings in excessive of fixed payments?  \n\nmost people financing solar panels are paying combined monthly payments smaller than their electricity bills before. that means the break even point from a cash flow perspective is day one! You can think of the electricity bill savings as earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (and there are no taxes, as far as I know the government hasn't thought to tax our electricity production as income yet!). if they're higher than that depreciation and amortizing  loan payments, you're winning every day of the loan term.\n\nit may not pay for itself as dramatically as upfront purchase past the break even point, but deferring a return on your investment until the break even point means the higher the inflation, the worse you're doing relative to the guy who financed.",

"comment": "Lol definitely rains a lot. Without 1 to 1 net metering it wouldn't work great but may to October is a great time for solar in Oregon. And outside activities :) the largest utility  in the state has requested a 16.5% average increase in rates for 2024, previously we used 6% every 2 years for our calculations as a very conservative payback metric. Still see wild competing quotes from the blue ravens and ions of the world at 5-6 a watt. I assume those payback periods are terrible. At 3ish or less with a good roof for solar here it's a great choice.",

"comment": "I'm an electrical apprentice (3rd year) and solar installer. It kinda just comes down to 1) does your state consider 100% of solar installation to be electrical work and 2) do you think you would actually enjoy the rooftop side of PV installation. If it's a \"no\" to (1), I'd say skip the PV installer part because it'll slow down your apprenticeship and you really wanna get that ticket as soon as you can. If it's a yes, and you think you'd have fun slinging some glass, then fuckin' go for it, my brother!\n\nI actually love installing! I love being on the roof, out in the weather, feeling like kind of a badass in my harness with my heels sticking out over the drip edge. I love seeing an array come together, I love when other people on my crew look at my wire management and say \"Damn, that's sexy!\" and I love standing back and taking the final photos of the completed array, knowing that I built that thing with my own hands. I don't want to do full-time roof work forever (it's dangerous!) but for now, it's great. The pay is good (not electrician good, but good enough that I have a house, some toys, etc.) and the camaraderie is excellent. I find building arrays very satisfying. Not everyone feels that way, and that's totally OK. This job is not for everyone. It's dangerous, it's tiring, it's no fun when the weather sucks. If you're afraid of heights, don't even bother (unless you can sign up with a company that only does ground mounts, I guess).\n\nEducation-wise, I think it's honestly fine to go either way as long as the electricians you work under are good at their jobs and good teachers. The electricians I work with who have come from non-solar backgrounds often come up with approaches to problems that the rest of us don't think of, and the electricians who have always specialized in solar have their shit *dialed* and often have a better understanding of some of the little quirks inherent to this part of the industry. Both perspectives are valuable, as long as you are good at your job and you give a shit. The \"solar electricians\" also tend to be more helpful to me on the roof, when I need another pair of hands for whatever reason. There are pros and cons. Don't believe the people who tell you that all solar electricians are hacks. You can find hacks anywhere, regardless of specialty. I work with some solar electricians who are damn good at their jobs.\n\nWhen it all shakes out, you'll have excellent job security. There's a huge electrician shortage in general, lots of electricians are uninterested in solar for a variety of reasons, and the industry is growing massively with the supply of licensed electricians being one of the primary constraints. Even once we're done saving the planet (well… what's left of it) there is going to be a ton of solar infrastructure out there that will need to be maintained, decommissioned, replaced, etc. You really have to suck to not be able to find a job in solar as a licensed electrician. Please don't suck though, electrical work is important to get right.\n\nAnyway, if you wanna be an electrician in solar then I think that's an excellent career path, and I think you can do just fine whether you or not you do your apprenticeship as a solar installer.",

It is just one place I've considered if I purchased new before the tax incentive changes. If anyone has good or bad to say about them I'd really appreciate a comment.\n\nIt is unclear to me if solar panels made in Indiana have more or less raw materials originating in China than those built elsewhere.\n\nSeeing how delivery can double or triple the cost of solar, they are at least worth considering if money is at all a concern to someone.\n\nWhat panels do you work with? Do you source them back to their raw materials?",

"comment": "Hi OP!\n\nTime to pick up the spec sheet.  Looking at the EG4 3KW off grid inverter it can take solar input of 5000w max and 500v max.  The inverter requires 120vdc minimum to operate.  Now you've not specified what the wattage or amps are per panel just the voltage so it's difficult to give you an answer here.\n\nYou can answer this yourself.  Panels in string you add the voltage, panels in parallel you add the amps.  The total wattage of the system is equal to the total volts times total amps so...\n\nw=v \\* a\n\nSo I'm going to use the 24v 200w solar panels that seem common for an example.  First off these panels can generate up to 37vdc max in perfect sun.  It's always best to design systems around the max dc output just so you don't blow your inverter.  That 200w panel is calculated assuming max dc output and nominal amperage (37.6v \\* 5.32a = 200w)\n\nSo the max input on the inverter means you can run as few as 4 panels in string or as many as 13 in string, You can run two strings in parallel to max out the inverter.  I wouldn't go beyond 2 strings of 12 panels however as you'll push past the 5000w max input.\n\nNow I'm guessing as you didn't provide the wattage.  Most solar panels come in this range.  I have 385w panels on my roof so I'd need roughly half the number of panels as what I'd need with 200w panels.\n\nFor future questions best practice is to specify everything.  The specs on your panels etc.\n\nHope this helps!",

We do a 30 day true up with any overproduction credited to the next month's bill at the wholesale rate. That wholesale rate is typically 30% to 40% of the retail rate.\nI think the effect that we'll see in the Midwest is that equipment prices will go down as California isn't siphoning off major stockpiles.

And all the solutions that mitigate that are just not here. If you think 10 years to build another nuclear plant is long, wait till you hear \"we need 10 to 15 years to check if the solution we developing is even viable\". Or, more likely \"the solution will create itself, just you wait\". Germany started using more wind power because of the hardships of getting fossil fuels, but if you look at your link more thoroughly, you will see that the amount of fossil fuels being burn stays roughly the same. Because you can't wish yourself some electricity when there is not a lot of wind in the night, which is most of the nights.      \nBut again, I don't think you are engaging in good faith, so unless you start addressing the points, I don't see how this conversation can continue.",

"comment": "Because heat pumps wont reduce emissions in any time frame that would actually have an effect on climate change before weather severity brings about the end of modern civilization.  Residential use of natural gas doesnt actually generate that much emissions in the first place, home heating furnaces in the U.S. are far more efficient than natural gas fired plants used to produce energy.  And reducing the use of natural gas in a residential setting doesnt remove the infrastructure for natural gas as industry is growing exponentially specially for exports.  Only a small percentage of natural gas produced in the U.S. is used in the U.S.\n\nPeople also over state the efficiencies of heat pumps which are dependent on proper installation and climate.  efficiency reduces in colder temperatures, and uses power the majority of the time generated by fossil fuels.\n\nSo when you are talking about spending +20 billion for heat pumps to replace gas furnaces in 66 million households that are responsible for less than 4% of national emissions...Its an absolute waste of resources.  There will be no emissions reduction unless you consider 1-2% reduction after spending 10s of billions of dollars over decades.  Most of the Greenhouse reduction fund isnt even going directly to the adoption of heat pumps but to NGOs who will promote their use.  So in a best case scenario you are not even going to see that.\n\nSolar panels are the same issue except you have power utilities to deal with who are scaling back net metering as adoption rates increase, and will end net metering entirely as their profits drop.  The U.S. would have to nationalize all power utility companies and make them public, that is not ever happening.  You also look at power generation and most renewable power plants are wind, Solar requires large masses of land.  Solar and Wind both require infrastructure to be replaced, upgraded and expanded...Which isnt exactly practical.\n\nThe alternative is to focus on the largest sources of emissions coming from the smallest sectors.  Focus on industry and business, instead of the individual.  We live in a consumer economy, constantly increasing cost of living and overburdening the individual is causing our recession.  The money we are already spending just needs to be put to good use instead of wasted.  There are only 217 coal plants they make up close to 60% of all power generation emissions.  Shutting down coal plants or converting them to hydrogen would eliminate a massive amount of emissions.  Water desalinization plants can reduce harmful byproduct to marine life by pretreating water and in doing so aid hydrogen production.  Building nuclear power plants that can reuse nuclear waste would take care of the bulk of power needs without having to upgrade the entire nations power infrastructure, converting simply cycle natural gas plants to modern combined cycle plants that can function as peaker plants doubles efficiency and supports renewable energy.  Building carbon capture at the source of emissions on power plants and industry promotes jobs and eliminates a major source of emissions.  \n\nInstead of targeting personal vehicles with EVs focus on medium to heavy duty vehicles used by industry and commerce that represent a much smaller group that contributes a larger percentage of emissions.  Logistically it is far more practical as vehicles are stored and kept in warehouses and private lots.\n\nThen after the government targets the largest sources of emissions they can focus on smaller sources modify the algorithm used by the CAFE standard to promote vehicle manufactures to build smaller vehicles.",

It's just the leftover Pu239.\n\nThe thing you are talking about is a fast breeder reactor running in a mode to transmute long lived products until they decay to something stable. Doing this is mutually exclusive with running a fast breeder reactor to generate more fuel from U238 or Th232 (something that there are/have been half-prototypes of) as it requires the same neutrons.\n\nThe sea water uranium thing is unequivocally a worse idea than anything else that you could think of for electricity including lining up hamsters to run on little wheels. It's not a new idea. It has been examined in depth for decades. Getting 500 Joules out of a litre of water over a period of months (enough to heat it 0.1 degrees) is completely and utterly useless. You'd do better trying to harness the thermal fluctuations of the same water with one of those little coffee cup stirling engines.\n\nNo amount of developing or scaling is going to make it useful. You need thousands of km^2 of net or sponge sitting in an ocean current to power a reactor. You can't move the water because it would use up all the energy and you can't make your net too dense or the water won't get through.\n\nThe way to make mining less necessary is to stop building light water reactors. We have solar panels and wind turbines. They work. They use less material than the reactor (which is the low mining part of the nuke plant). Build those.\n\nIt's not physically impossible to build a breeder reactor (it just requires a ridiculously expensive rube gold machine to refuel it every few months and reprocess the fuel), but you need to build at least ten for every light water reactor to sustain them on Pu sourced from depleted uranium. So if the nuclear industry were actually serious and not just bullshitting they wouldn't propose any new non-fast-breeder designs.",

No batteries or inverters needed.  They can switch between line power and solar power automatically, but will run only on solar if enough light is available.\n\nThey are by far the best option if you want to cut your AC bill and have some backup AC if the power fails.",

Thus, I would happily skip a meal if there was nothing vegan available. I would skip multiple meals without question. \n\nLike other people pointed out, being vegan means that we need to think ahead and plan our own food. If we are going to be at places where there is not food available for us, don't go, or bring your own. Even when vegan food is available I will usually not go unless the entire meal is vegan for everyone (which my carnist family has gotten used to and now does if they want me to show up).",

"comment": "&gt;if I went over to a friends house and \"humanely\" stole his stereo, that would still make me an asshole\n\nThanks for the thought/prespective. I hadn't really thought of it quite like that before. I don't completely agree with your analogy, though. Here's my counterexample with eggs: Let's say I raise chickens (both hens and roosters) and eat the hens' eggs. Every once in a while, I let the roosters in with the hens so they mate and the eggs are fertile. I let the hens raise their chicks. What I am taking from the chickens (their unfertilized eggs) is scientifically equivalent to a human menstrual period. Would it be wrong if I went over to a woman's house and took her period before she flushed it down the toilet (I know this is weird but just for the sake of the argument). \n\nI think you can apply the same argument to milk- impregnating the cow and letting her raise her calf, etc. I realize the analogy with either doesn't quite fit, but I think it's close. I agree that it is not exactly what a \"natural\" chicken or cow life would be but I am not causing the chicken any suffering or anything.\n\nI guess where I have trouble and can't really make concrete decisions is where human morality comes up against biological/evolutionary principles. I've always found this very interesting. For example, I don't find it immoral when a bear eats a fish. Yes, there is pain involved, but in order for (most, higher up) living things to survive, other living things must suffer. I would be okay with being this fish who died to sustain the bear just as I would be okay with being a chicken who died to sustain humans.\n\nI realize humans are different. A chicken doesn't have to die to sustain humans, as is evidenced by vegans like me or you. We can make choices to avoid animal products and be fine. But I guess I still consider all of these choices natural and equally valid, just as evolution does. Or I'm not sure if I do. I guess what I'm saying is I don't necessarily think it's wrong to eat animal products, only the ones that are produced in ways that are obviously harmful to the environment, cause huge amounts of suffering for the animals, etc. This is why I raise chickens and eat their eggs. So yes, I lied above. I am not quite vegan. I don't eat/buy any animal products except for my chickens' eggs. But I love my chickens and they are happy and healthy running around right now eating grass and bugs. Even though I do take from them as you say.\n\nBut I don't really know, it's all so complex and gray to me. Any thoughts/help me with my moral dilemma?\n\nEDIT: Also, did you read my blog post?",

Vegans are by no means immune to this, and we must always be vigilant about not making overly grandiose or false claims.  \n\nVegans are challenging the ethics of animal agriculture and animal product consumption.  It's not for no reason that we're suddenly seeing an explosion of \"cage free eggs\" and \"grass fed\" meats / dairy.  (Such a strange term, because it's not the meat that was fed grass.  The animal is simultaneously acknowledged while also being being rendered invisible, but I digress...)  People are only to eager for the industry to reassure them that they need not worry, and they can both keep their current lifestyle and be kind to animals.

You would think the other 99% has more of an effect, no?\n\nTo add, I was vegetarian for about 8 years in a 10 year period, and quit twice, after I thought it was the right thing to do, due to social pressure as well. But the social pressure for me came from my parents and my roommates essentially implying I’m not a part of their group unless I eat animals, and I didn’t have the courage then to hold up against peer pressure.\n\nI’m curious as to why you think it’s really vegans, rather than non-vegans, who are pressuring you to not be vegan. I’ve had frustrating conversations with vegans (hell, the leader of my activist group blocked me on fb because she was saying some racist shit and I called her out this last week), but I haven’t had the experience of vegans pressuring me to not be vegan. It’s essentially been the opposite, not knowing any vegans in real life made it more difficult for me, rather than it being due to the behavior of any vegans. \n\nBut that’s been my experience, what’s yours been like, if you don’t mind me asking?",

My point isn't economical. My point is that the arguement is completely moot to them. If you want people to adopt a kindef and cleaner vegan lifestyle why not propagate the ideas of changing laws so that everyone would have to kill and slaughter their own meat if they chose to eat it.",

Now I’ve gone fully plant based in my diet, if asked it’s usually simpler to say vegan, but they may point out that I’m wearing a leather belt, or wearing wool (I won’t buy any more of these, but hate waste, and they’re all too old to sell or even give away, so I’ll carry on wearing them until they’ve worn out). By the standards of an educated vegan, I’m not meeting the proper definition, but I’m trying.

Unless you're experiencing a caloric deficiency, which has the simplest solution. this is way way too soon for you to have a vitamin deficiency. Though it is possible you already had one and it was exasperated or just came to a head. Blood work will give you a lot more information, because as I already said, this is too soon for you to develop a new deficiency. Be prepared this might not even nutrition related and will require more testing. \nYou should probably consult with a registered dietitian as well. If it's just a caloric deficiency they will be able to treat it and provide you with helpful information.\n\nAnd now for rant. This is not just my personal opinion, this is the consensus held opinion among most professionals.\n\nI won't tell you to switch a doctor because he said veganism isn't healthy. It's easy to see how someone without experience with vegan recipes can think it could lead to malnutrition. However saying Keto is healthy is absolutely unacceptable. Luckily most people on Keto  cheat or are unaware vegetables have carbs (yes, seriously), nevertheless true Keto for a long enough period of time, without supplaments will lead to many many vitamin deficiencies such the  untill recently forgotten scurvy. But even with supplaments that diet will litteraly cause the poor sufferer to stink. Keto diet is named after the ketosis it causes, ketosis is the production of ketone bodies and oh boy do these things smell. they smell like alcohol mixed with acetone and it's awful. If you ever meet a person who is or was suffering from apilepsy the is not managed with medication yet (the only group of people medically advised to be on keto) they will tell you all about the smell and the ketogenic flu. It's better than seazures (which can cause irreversible brain damage) but it's an awful way to live. \n\nNow I know we talk a lot about which diet is healthy and not healthy and the abundant misinformation floating around and frankly if it was a comparison of normal diets I wouldn't be feeling it's right for me to even advise you. However keto is not a normal fad diet, there is wide spread consensus and plenty of knowledge and you can talk with people who had to truly do it (and as you can probably guess by the fact that this diet comes with a built in smell test. Most people who truly were on it are people who needed it due to uncontrolled seazures) it's awful. There is a huge difference between saying you're afraid new diet will possibly be harmful than recommending a diet that awful with such wide spread medical consensus. You need a better doctor",

I was also anemic in my teens and had low iron into my 20s. Just take an iron supplement. Some if them are more easy in the stomach than others, so it's worth asking at the pharmacy which ones are gentle on the stomach. Also not all iron supplements are vegan. So just keep an eye out for that as well.\n\nAs others have mentioned: take your iron with a meal, try and avoid taking it with caffeine, but have it with some source of vitamin C. A small glass of orange juice or some berries will do the trick!",
