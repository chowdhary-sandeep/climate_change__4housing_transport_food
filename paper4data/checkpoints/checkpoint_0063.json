"comment": "&gt;What sort of strange math is this?\nI guess you are not familiar with the :\"leaky pipe\" of taxation, of course the government takes a cut for themselves, spends some on other stuff and loses a bit along the way.\n\nI have never seen this as a \"tax credit or rebate\" because depending on your locale (our tax on cars in 13%) well then the car would have to be over $55k to get a \"rebate\" of $7500, but as noted a leaf @ $28K would only have a total tax of $3640, yet the claim is a $7500 credit.. now that is bad math,\n\nAs far as you calling you an idiot.. well sorry, I was pre menstrual and your reasoning was faulty (IMHO)",

The end game number should have been specified up front. Now we're going to waste a lot of time and money as all the competing standards fight it out.\n\nTo me only Tesla has a real clue about how to do EVs, and that's coming from a LEAF owner!",

"comment": "If the American consumer is truly rational, the average consumer would have an instilled, trained distrust of oil prices due to the violent fluctuations of the past 10 years. The average consumer would understand that oil prices would just shoot back up eventually, and bite them in the wallet if they continued to buy gas vehicles. They would be aware that they could preclude such a situation by buying an electric car that would bring forth stability. This distrust would convert into steady, increasing purchases of electric cars.",

The part about margin being so low is illuminating -- the part that they're not talking about is all of the dealer culture that's got to change (at least for me, I hope it does).  I'm sick and tired of going in to buy a car and being treated like a mark instead of a buyer.   American car dealers have a lot of karma to overcome before they're going to get my sympathy, in other words.  The bigger issue -- This video talks a lot about the competition between different dealers but doesn't show the relationship of service profits to sales profits, which I think is an even bigger issue.   But I voted up here for you -- glad to see something instead of the usual silent passage of legislation story.",

You can probably get one for pretty close to the lease price point you mentioned, or if you keep looking you'll probably find a good value in a used one. I got 50-60 miles range in mine even up to the point where it was down 35% capacity and had its pack replaced. Of course we don't really have winters here in SoCal - not sure what your weather is like there.\n\nAs far as your lack of options, I hate to \"mess with Texas\", but unfortunately you do live in a place that's not so hospitable to people who like EVs, to put it mildly. If you don't like it, vote with your feet. I'm sure California would be happy to welcome another EV enthusiast. :)\n\nOtherwise, even though you have concerns about out of state service issues for \"compliance cars\", I'd wholeheartedly recommend a used Rav4-EV if you can find one. It might be a bit of a pain, but you'd be getting by far the most bang for your buck with one of these. Check out myrav4ev.com/forum and you'll find that there are other Texas owners who've made it work.",

They did the same with the BGE acquisition. Constellation is substantially undercutting the market in those counties and cities in which they have to fulfill this requirement. Once the requirement is met, their project pricing goes back up to normal for that city/county. I'm sure Constellation simply outbid Tesla by a wide margin for this project. Home Depot does energy procurement in chunks, but it is managed by a central energy management division.",

The buyer would have recourse and the IRS would not support either party.  \n\nIf the buyer would \"have the seller not claim the tax credit,\" and the seller did claim the tax credit, the buyer would have a cause of action for breach of contract.  What would happen is that both parties would fill out IRS form 5695 and under line 7b, both parties would input the same address and the same cost under line 1.  This would probably automatically trigger an alert on the IRS software and the IRS would investigate it. Both parties would get audited and the IRS would probably eventually figure out some sort of agreement (contract) was made for the buyers to claim the tax credit, albeit illegally. Now whether an illegal portion of a contract is enforceable is another issue, but the buyers would have enough of a claim to file a complaint.  And the IRS would not be the adjudicator of who is legally right under that lawsuit.",

I say this as an electrician, I don’t even own an electric car.  Small generators like the one you are talking about are notorious for poor quality and variable voltage output, especially near the peak of their range.  The rating on the generator is also usually a peak usage rating, and not a constant running load rating.  So you stand the possibility of frying your charger electronics with under voltage and if used consistently enough, wrecking an undersized generator.\n\nIf you can plan well enough to have the generator on hand, you should plan better so you don’t rely on one.",

Turns out the Hyundai ioniq is the same (I wouldn't have bought the car had I know this beforehand, only know because 12v is prone to dying due to being undersized). No idea if the Kia does this, I don't believe the Bolt does (all GM vehicles I've seen have manual overrides on passenger doors). Just something to consider.",

DC Fast Charging (or DCFC—sometimes erroneously referred to as “Level 3”)public charging—usually delivering 50 kW and above—is becoming more common at locations near interstate highways, but public Level 2 stations still far outnumber the DCFC units. Tesla Superchargers are DCFC, btw, but only Teslas can use them.\n\nTo get an idea of what the proportions are like, download the PlugShare app and use the filtering feature to view J1772 stations vs CCS combo or Tesla Superchargers.",

His goal is to see how fast you can go 1000km, which for the best charging cars (Teslas included) is around 10h, so around 100km/h.\nIf he were to do sprints, you would see a higher average, since he starts with 100% battery which mean that for the first 300-400km the average is closer to 130km/h, rather then the 100km/h.\n\nA similar test was done by car&amp;driver https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36877585/ev-1000-11-electric-cars-long-distance-race/ in which you can see that even for the fastest car (Model S Long Range Plus), it took more then 14.5 hours of driving (charging not included) to do 1000Miles, which is almost 69Mph (or 111Km/h) average speed and with charging you get 16.25 hours, resulting in 61.5Mph (or 99Km/h) average speed.",

Do Tesla Solar contracts include a performance guarantee? You could ask to have that waived if so and they might be more comfortable proceeding. If you don’t want to spend the money on the analysis upfront, there is no risk with doing the install and seeing if it fits your needs. If it doesn’t, then you could go back for an analysis and see if tree trimming is an acceptable solution. When I was getting quotes for my install, none of the estimates included potential shading losses.",

"comment": "Quick note for the $4000 tax credit: it is 30% up to $4000, so a $8000 used car doesn't immediately become $4000. Also, it is only for dealer-sold EVs or PHEVs that had a single owner. There is a filter on websites like cars.com afaik. Also, I believe the dealer would need to sign a document for the IRS to confirm the credit.\n\nFor cars, a used Chevy Volt can be great for <$10k if you want to do road trips still with your car. A Chevy Volt is great for the reasons other commenters mention, but can be very rough to road trip with due to the slow fast charge speed. A 2016 or newer Vott can have up to 50 miles of EV range, but some people in the Volt subreddit mention problems with the BECM.\n\nOther EVs that could work would be the Lead or BMW I3, but due to their shorter ranges (and at least in the case of the Leaf, air cooled battery), degradation of the battery could make it close for your usage when using heavy AC or heat.",

They could actually be very good for trucks (I would love to see a manufacturer have a modular range extender that could go in the frunk or in the bed of a trunk) because they could enable extended towing while still allowing someone to drive as an EV for the rest of their driving, or even for part of the trip. \n\nWhen I first got my i3, I thought I would use the range extender with some regularity. I did not. I went out of my way to not use it. It was loud and annoying. Having a range extender is a good way to address edge cases and also to calm range anxiety. Its a good gateway to full EVs.",

While the Model Y launched cheaper at $43k, it was also a rear wheel drive version with a reduced \"standard\" range battery that was only really sold in limited numbers and \"discontinued\" far before pandemic pricing. I say \"discontinued\" because they could bring it back on a whim, should they choose to do that. \n\nI'm sure there's a slew of reasons behind just profitability that the decision to stop making that spec was made. Could've been as simple as a general lack of interest. That said, there may be a huge uptick in interest now with all of these credits. Between state and federal, if I could order a rear wheel drive model y at $43k, my net would end up being $32k, which is now well equipped Corolla money.",

"comment": "I work in this industry. There are many business models. But primarily you see two. \n\n1. Charging as a service (Caas)\n2. Capital purchase or capital lease. \n\nThe CaaS people thought that if they built it, it would come. Meaning if they built and owned the equipment they could make money off the charging to eventually pay for the equipment and start turning a profit. \n\nHowever, a lot of CaaS are start ups and/or capital ventures. Some were all about putting assets in the ground so they can resell. Some are trying to make money off of volume. \n\nI think two or three have gone under this year. I've heard that a couple of the bigger guys are trying to sell their CaaS or get additional funding. \n\nIt's a gamble business model woth a lot of risk. \n\nFor Tesla and now Ionna, they care more about chargers being in the field than making money off of it. Plus charging isn't a stand alone model for them. \n\nThe others in the field are more conservative companies. The one I work for either gets paid up front or we offer 5 years financing. We do well but it's hard to compete with free. But we also do soup to nuts and take care of the equipment and guarantee up time. We have our own stuff but we also install other companies. It's more the construction event and the service afterwards that we are interested in.  \n\nYes it can be a profitable business. I think it will continue to be but I don't think the CaaS groups are going to thrive for much longer. Only the ones who are federally funded or are doing it as a loss leader for their car sales.",

"comment": "* We always involve a structural engineer.\n\n* We always involve the regional roofing contractor for the specific roofing system, as typically required by the roofing material manufacturer to not void the warranty.\n\nThis is common sense stuff which roofing trades are more than comfortable performing. Solar is not the only thing that penetrates a commercial flat roof. \n\nAdding unnecessary weight to the roof to avoid roof penetrations and eliminating the ability to visual inspect the roof deck for leaks seems much more problematic than using competent persons to perform a roof penetration. However, many solar installers lack that roofing expertise, and  seem adverse to involving other contractors on the job for some reason. \n\nBut sure, go ahead and cover the roof with concrete if the building can support the weight and you feel uncomfortable with roofing penetrations. Just be prepared when the fire department won't step a foot inside your building.",

"comment": "Search the internet for infographics on solar, there are some really cool ones that put solar into perspective, but be really careful finding things that are more than a year old.  Sadly (not really) the industry changes very quickly so pricing, average system size, rebates etc vary a lot.  dsire like /u/MildlyAgitatedBovine said will be great for your local incentives, and be sure to search for solar using photovoltaics, and renewable etc synonyms to find all of the programs that might not mention \"solar\" but still benefit solar.\n\nSolarPowerWorld, cleantechnica, all have great articles but are more industry focused.\n\nIf you're going for community benefit, solar helps provide peak electricity which is usually most expensive, and is made with natural gas (typically).  It also helps reduce the load on your grid helping it last longer. Less pollution in the area from peaking plants not running, etc.  There's an average savings graphic from a few years ago that is probably dated.  They had average savings for each state, California was $34,000 and Hawaii was like $50k and other states varied a lot.  Could help :) http://costofsolar.com/how-much-are-solar-panels-savings/",

I live in the foothills and am completely energy independent, drawing on a bank of 36 solar panels.  My central fireplace is large and wood-burning and with 30 acres I won't run out of fuel for it. I don't have a garden yet but will soon.  My well is superb and not aquifer dependent, though with several thousand acres of BLM surrounding me that's not really an issue anyway.\n\nMy house is **entirely** \"modern\" in every way....I built my *supply* large.  That's the obvious way to do it if you're able.\n\nConcur that no amount of building wind or ground-based solar is going to work for a modern society--energy depends are just too great.  We need nuclear and fossil fuels now, fusion and perhaps geothermal and/or space-based solar later.",

So I think it's best at this point that I reach out to my electric company or some solar installers in my area to see what they have to say at this point. It sounds like the real bennefit comes from when I can over-produce on electricity.\n\nSo my question is, comparing to the diagram in the instructable, how different is the process? I imagine it's running a number of panels in a series to a charge controller, that then connects to a grid tie in box? haha all of this is a bit beyond me for sure.",

If you need your roof fixed in a couple years we take care of taking the solar panels off and putting them back on. \n\nAnd since we're one company, you don't have to wait for your solar company to find the time to take your panels off, we handle it all at once. Coordinating a job like that becomes a huge headache for the customer. Try reaching out to a solar company that does roofing as well. [PetersenDean](http://petersendean.com/solar/) is one company that I know of, but I've never personally delt with them.\n\nHowever, it's always going to be easier and more cost effective if you take care of the roof before you put the panels on. Even if you only reroof the area where the panels are going under.",

I have, however, read a really interesting [article](http://blog.energysage.com/measuring-the-cost-of-solar-power-dollars-per-watt-w-and-levelized-cost-of-energy-lcoe/) that evaluated the cost and value of solar power through $/W and the ‘levelized cost of energy’ (LCOE) - which provides insight on efficiency. There's some charts that look at LA and NYC as comparisons. You might want to collect data and try to put it together yourself.

"comment": "Edit 2: You may be referring to another comment where he explains a new hydrogen production method. I don't know anything about that, sorry. Leaving the rest of the comment as is.  \n  \nWhat he says doesn't make any sense to me. He compares hydrogen and 'regular electric' and say regular electricity is more expensive and less clean.  \n  \nA hydrogen fueled car is always less efficient then a regular electric car. Since hydrogen is made by using electricity, then transporting it, and later converting the hydrogen back to electricity there's a lot more loss in the whole cycle then just storing the electricity at step one.  \n  \nComparing hydrogen produced with solar power and saying it's 'cleaner' than regular electricity not using solar power is also not making it an apples to apples comparison.  \n\nEdit: Here's a copy of an edit I made this morning in another comment thread:\n\n[Here](http://insideevs.com/jaguar-i-pace-ev-designer-hydrogen-fuel-cells-are-complete-nonsense/)'s a recent article from the designer of the Jaguar I-Pace on why hydrogen is not a good solution.  \n  \n&gt; “You end up with a well to wheel efficiency of roughly 30% for hydrogen, as opposed to more or less well to wheel 70% efficiency for a battery electric vehicle.   So the efficiency of putting the electric energy directly into a battery is about twice as high as the efficiency of producing and using hydrogen.\n&gt; “Also, you have to consider the fact that the battery itself has a high efficiency of around 90% or so.”",

It always boils down to cost/kWh... and high efficiency n-type mono back contact modules i.e. sunpower/LG are a niche product at best, because they are 25% or more more expensive than standard multi or multi perc. This is why SPWR is pivoting to making a multi product. There are also strong LID degradation concerns w/ p type mono, which is starting to break out in the industry.",

The net energy produced or consumed is purchased from or sold to the power provider, respectively.\n\nNet metering does NOT have to be on a single meter.   It is just an accounting method of doing billing on a net basis of the kWh consumed - kWh provide by the facility.   It can and still is done with two meters in some locations though with the prevalence of smart meters this is going away.   The number of meters is not part of the definition though.\n\nFurther the power produced is not sold during the period of the net billing, it is traded.  Thus there is no tax liability.   It is more complicated in time of use net metering where it is traded at the equivalent value, so it sounds like a sale.",

"comment": "I firmly believe that when things like demand charges and time of use charges are lessened for rate payers the utility will find a way to keep making money.  They will raise monthly service charges etc. and decrease the cost per kWh.\n\nIt will be like water companies when people conserve water.  They simply charge more as their fixed costs remained the same even though people conserved.\n\nIt is like every new energy saving technology.  It will save money until enough people have it and then utilities will adapt.\n\nSoon people will be saying \"you don't pay your fair share of the grid because you have battery storage\"",

"comment": "If you are okay with the pump only running during the day, the system for the pump will not require a battery. Just hook up [larger some panels](http://solar-panels.nz/products/17-watt-solar-panel). Connecting multiple panels together in [parallel](http://solar-panels.nz/products/voltaic-m3511-splitter) will provide you with additional current if required for your motor. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nFor the lights you will require some sort of battery to store the energy for use in the evening as I am guessing you will want them to be on during the evening. This setup could potentially be a different circuit. If your LED's are low power say something like the [LUMINOODLE](http://solar-panels.nz/products/power-practical-luminoodle) 5V ≈500mA then you will not need a large battery or many panels. However, if you are running higher current / voltage lights then the panels and the battery will need to be be increased to match your load (lights) requirements. If you are not looking to run the lights all night then the size of panels and battery could be reduced.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nIn terms of turning on and off the lights this is going to depend upon the voltage and current of that load. For example the switching for something running at [5V and ≈0.5A](http://solar-panels.nz/products/twilight-switch-low-current) and something running at [24V and ≈2A](http://solar-panels.nz/products/twilight-switch-low-current) is going to be different. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nIf you are using a SLA battery, then some off the shelf [charge controllers will feature](http://solar-panels.nz/products/powertech-solar-power-controller-with-lcd-12v-or-24v-30a) settings which will make switching the load on and off based on either time / solar input very simple.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nIf you have your heart set on the pump to run 24/7, then depending on how much water you are moving you are going to need significantly more solar power and significantly more power. Many pumps will easily draw 1A @ 12V and that means your panels will not only need to keep up with that during the day but also be producing sufficient power to store in the battery for the pump to also work at night. The complexity of the system amount of space required for the solar is going to be greatly reduced if you can simply run the pump during the day directly from the sun without a battery added into the mix. An added side effect would also be a reduction in the cost of the setup.",

"comment": "I have no clue about the pitch, but in NY, solar is heavily subsidized and you can expect a really good payback on solar. Solar leasing companies transfer this wealth to corporations who finance the array and receive the subsidized cost savings benefits (instead of you, the consumer). If you have a good house for solar and pay a not insignificant amount of federal and state taxes, you should tell the guy to get lost, and then look into solar ownership options.\n\nSolar leasing, like any kind of leasing, means you pay alot more money for use of certain equipment. There are reasons to lease equipment, for example, if you have a critical short-term need where long-term ownership makes little sense. But there is no reason to use solar for only a short period of time.\n\nAnother reason to lease is because you need to finance and lack access to conventional financing. Unconventional financing markets always emerge before conventional financing. But in NY, you should be able to receive conventional financing for your solar array (home improvement loan, mortgage refinance etc.) which will be much more beneficial financially than the lease offer.",

The expanded use of electric vehicles will also change the supply/demand curves.\n\nI also see the distance at which it makes sense to transmit cheap solar power increasing every year.

"comment": "A few assumptions:\n\n* Daily use is 30 kWh. I calculated this as follows: the total use is 1800 kWh.  In my town, the holiday lights go up in early November and come down in early January. That’s about 60 days. 1800 kWh / 60 days = 30 kWh per day\n* The number of sun hours during the relevant time is 2.0. In New York, the winter range for sun hours is 1.58 to 3.03 http://www.solardirect.com/pv/systems/gts/gts-sizing-sun-hours.html.  For sake of simplicity, I’m going to say 2.0 sun hours per day.\n* Annual electricity cost is $600. I calculated this as 2000 kWh x $0.30 per kWh. Yes, I used 1800 kWh above, but $600 is easier to use than $540.\n\nLet’s figure out what size system we need.  The area gets 2.0 sun hours per day and needs to produce 30 kWh per day. 30 kWh / 2.0 sun hours = each sun hour needs to produce 15 kWh. Remove the hours and that’s the size of the system: 15 kW or 15,000 watts. \n\n[A 5kW system in New York costs about $15,500 before tax credits](https://solarpowerrocks.com/new-york/). Triple that and a 15 kW system cost $46,500.  Let’s assume that the price doesn’t scale up like that, so we’ll say it costs about $35,000 (I’m being VERY generous here).\n\nNotice I said before tax credits. However, no tax credits would apply here because the city doesn’t pay taxes.  So no 30% federal tax credit and no 25% New York tax credit.  Ouch.\n\nNext let’s size the batteries.  Since we need 30 kWh here. And batteries cost [$400 per kWh (on the low end)](https://www.energysage.com/solar/solar-energy-storage/what-do-solar-batteries-cost/), we have 30 kWh x $400 per kWh = $12,000.\n\n$12,000 + $35,000 = $47,000.\n\nThe payback period would be $47,000 / $600 per year = 78 years. Factor in rising electricity prices and that number may go down by a few decades at most.  Note that this doesn’t account for transmission loss and a bunch of other factors.  Basically, all these other factors will almost certainly make the cost of the system go up. $47,000 is a low estimate.\n\nOK, what can we do? \n\nNew York has net metering, so let’s assume the city can get into that.  So, we don’t need to pay for the batteries. Yeah!\n\nNext, we can refigure the size of the system.  Since New York gets about 4.0 sun hours per day annually, we can use that number. 365 days per year x 4.0 sun hours per day = 1460 sun hours per year.  Since we need 1800 kWh and we get 1460 sun hours, we need a 1.23 kW system (= 1800 kWh / 1460 sun hours). Put simply, the system spends all year gaining credits to pay for the usage during the holidays.\n\nA 1.25 kW system costs about $4,000. Assuming that about $200 of the $600 is the connection fee (which needs to be paid because we’re using net metering), and that’s a payback period of about 10 years, which is feasible. \n\nEdit: used kWh when I meant kW",

You would need to generate about 55 kilowatts for 5 hours  a day to cover your daily energy usage - not including extra load, weather, clouds, etc.  That would be a very large system, I'm guessing roughly 230 solar panels. Your system would probably be much larger than this and I'm guessing around 100k.  Do you have enough space for such a system? \n\nI suppose you have a couple options. You could build a much smaller system and use it to offload some of your energy usage. \n\nYou could also consider reducing your energy consumption - look at where that energy is being utilized, remove unnecessary equipment and replace with higher efficiency systems. This could help reduce that 275kwh per day to something where solar could better offset your usage\n\nP.S. - that seems like a very low price for energy.",

My friends got quotes and they were a little higher, because of solar tariffs, but you should be close to $3 per Watt for LG panels or $3.40 for Sunpower.  If you have no shading issues got a SolarEdge system with LG or Panasonic panels.  You could also go cheaper and get a 300 Watt panel like Mission Solar if you have lots of space.",

"comment": "Just got off the phone with ConEd. They said that they see I’m getting back power, and I’m sending it to the grid during the times we’re away. It’s just not enough to cover what we’re using. Through the day, if we weren’t home, our house is using about 10 kWh with everything plugged in. \n\nI’m guessing it’s my electric oven, they said there’s a surge of usage between 6-7 (when my wife is home) and during the summer, we tend to cook on our grill instead of the oven. I’m in NY, where the sun doesn’t last long during the winter, and we’ve had a lot of rain. \n\nSunRun says that I’ve been producing a lot more power than what they promised in our original set up, so it has to be something we’re using on our end. \n\nThey recommended waiting until the spring, and seeing if there is any updates and if we end up sending back power to the grid a lot more. \n\nIt makes sense, but it’s just frustrating that I assumed I would have a much smaller electricity bill, and its average is just a little less than I used to pay. \n\nI’ll see how the spring and summer treats us for now, then go from there.",

"comment": "&gt; In most areas the 50% production will be LESS effected not more. \n\nThat is correct.  And 5-6 years ago, that was even correct for California.  It is not correct for California today, and even more wrong going into the new rate plans that existing solar owners will be forced into in a couple years.\n\nIf we assume nothing will every change, you are correct.  If we assume utility companies will make significant changes to their net metering, TOU, tiers, and rate structures as more solar gets installed on their grid, your are wrong. \n\n&gt;  You will be automatically converted latter but could choose to convert to new rates now.\n\nWhy would I want to change from a plan that pays me more during the day and charges me less in the evening, to a plan that pays me less during the day and charges more in the evening?  The new plans are terrible for solar owners compared to the old plans.  I will be forced onto the new plan, that is not how grandfathering works.  There are some aspects of net metering that I am grandfathered in for 20 years.  Rates and TOU periods are not included in the grandfathering.  \n\n&gt; HI has not altered rates in a way that effect existing more than others. What they have done is limit and then restrict new installs to grid zero (no feed in) installs. \n\nThey removed net metering altogether.  Of course that affects how much solar owners pay for electricity they buy from the grid.",

Very classic Rankine cycle thermal power plant.   \n\nNuclear doesn't have a chance based on economics, they are too expensive to compete. I'm a huge technical fan of nuclear, but economically it's too expensive in the US.\n\nSolar PV is cheaper than advanced nuclear in every LCOE table in that report.

"comment": "You are still confusing NEM with rate plans.  These are not the same.  The full quote from your web page is below.\n\n**\"These customer-generators are allowed to remain on the former tariff for 20 years from the date they interconnected, or they are permitted to switch to the current NEM tariff.  The former NEM tariff is sometimes referred to as \"NEM 1.0\", and the current NEM tariff as \"NEM 2.0\".**\n\nWe are all grandfathered under NEM 1.0 for 20 years.  Nowhere does it say we are grandfathered on our rate plan for 20 years.\n\n&gt;It's a very bad option. I think you are the only one who would choose that plan. SDGE pays wholesale for energy regeneration regardless of Tier or TOU. It doesn't make sense to go TOU with solar.\n\nYou do not understand at all how net metering works.  The utilities only pay the wholesale rate if you over-generate over the entire 12 month true up period.  But on a day to day and month to month basis, they pay the full retail rate.  Here is proof.  Take a look at my bill below.  The bill period ending 5/30/2016 shows a net usage of -175 kwh and a credit of $93.41, which comes out to about $0.50/kwh they paid me, not the 3 cent/kwh wholesale rate.  They paid me at the full peak TOU rate.  If I was on tiered plan I would have only been paid a lot less than $93 that month.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ogzruon.png\n\n&gt;Current buyback in SDGE is 1.8 cents/kwh. PGE is 3 cents/kwh. You pay less than 3 cents at night?\n\nAgain, you do not understand at all how net metering works.  Below is current TOU rate plan from PG&amp;E.  When I sell a kwh to the grid during the day I get a credit of $0.38/kwh because peak rate hours are during mid afternoon for me.  Then at night when I'm buying electricity from the grid, I only pay $0.19/kwh because night time is off peak.  So for every kwh I sell to the grid, I get about 2 kwh at night.  When I first installed solar, it was a 1:3 ratio.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5voYBN8.png\n\n&gt; How are you deciding that most people are on that versus the much better E-1 Tiered plan? \n\nAgain...most people understand how TOU works, so they would have gone on TOU plan.\n\n&gt; Tiered plans get 20. \n\nNo they don't. Again, you get NEM 1.0 for 20 years, but they seem to only doing 5 years for the actual rate plans.  From what I can see, we will all lose our current plans and be transitioned to TOU plan with peak rate hours at night.  That includes regular residential customers without solar.",

"comment": "No. Electric cars and renewables are not going to work, that is the huge lie of green denialism. There is no technological magic bullet, or series of bullets, that can serve as a work-around to simple physics and the presumption of infinite growth with finite resources. Sure, fusion, space elevators, and robust AI are things we should aspire to, but we certainly aren't there yet. We have overshot the carrying capacity of our present environment, perhaps fatally and without hope of recovery. Building more Teslas and solar panels, with the huge supply chains and demands on resources that feed that, is not a solution. Staying at a 'green' and 'sustainable' hotel chain on vacation is not a solution. We can't consume our way out of this.\n https://www.ted.com/talks/david_mackay_a_reality_check_on_renewables/up-next",

Tesla has already had Virtual Power Plant pilots in Australia and New Hampshire, and will eventually use the same patented Autobidder software that drives their utility scale installs.  I absolutely agree we need more companies than just Tesla involved, but we also need cross-country transmission lines, carbon pricing, etc etc.\n\nRight now Powerwalls are just like the Model S in 2015:  more demand than supply, plenty of government rebates, and no incentive to lower prices.  They have already moved beyond \"wealthy cabin owners\" to upper-middle-class homeowners in CA fire districts.  We have yet to see the \"Model 3\" of grid batteries, but it will come.\n\nI'm closely watching research into Lithium Sulfur batteries, which could be a lot cheaper even than the Lithium Iron Phosphate that Tesla has started using in China.",

Our utility here in the states (PSEG of NJ) has a website where you can check real-time capacity of the transformers in your neighbor hood and the website tells you how much additional local generation can be supported before a transformer upgrade is required. This was done to help folks like you who believe it's a giant conspiracy to hold back solar installs. There are some uilities that hate solar, yes, but they don't stop you fr installing they just don't want net metering :) they would love the free capacity at peak times.",

"comment": "Theoretically yes, injecting power at your house with a grid-tied solar inverter will raise the voltage in your house by some amount proportional to how much power it is producing.  Just like raising one end of a pipe causes water to flow down hill, for the solar power to flow back to the street the voltage in your house must be higher than at the street.  If the solar produces exactly what your air conditioner draws, then they cancel out and the voltage in your house will be the same as if the air conditioner and solar were both off.\n\nThere are larger effects that might cause problems.  It sounds like you have an overloaded transformer at the street, undersized wires from the transformer to your house, or both.  If the transformer is the problem, it is unlikely that you will be able to install enough solar power to get the voltage in your house all the way to 240V.  (This would require supplying enough power to your neighbors that the transformer is no longer overloaded, and is likely to overload your house wires.)  It will still be able to raise the voltage a bit and compensate for loads in your house.\n\nIf the wire to your house is the problem, adding solar power will raise the voltage in your house a lot.  In this case, the voltage drop you see now is the grid power \"working hard\" to get through the little wire into your house.  The solar will have to work just as hard (raising the voltage rather than lowering it) to get power back out to the street.\n\nIn both of these cases, you may have problems with the inverter shutting down because the grid voltage it senses is too low or too high to operate safely.  Enphase IQ7 microinverters, for example, only operate between 211 and 264 V.  I found a Chinese unit that says it will operate down to 190V.  Both will turn off if your voltage drops to 170V.\n\nIf there are any loose or oxidized connections in your electrical system, tightening or cleaning them might have more of an impact than adding solar, and will improve your safety overall.  Make sure it is someone experienced doing the work of course.",

The definition of electric vehicles depends on the engine/motor that powers the wheels or propeller.\n\nWikipedia definition of electric vehicle:\n&gt;An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.\n\nHybrid cars are called hybrid because the drive train contains both, an electric motor and an internal combustion engine.",

"comment": "At a micro level load shifting is very important to me and my goal of minimizing my energy bills for my house.\n\nI [hyperinsulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/n66aa5/100f_outside_76f_inside_at_5_pm_yesterday_wo/) my house so I can chill it in early mornings with outside air, and not have to run the AC till later in the day.  At least on the shoulder seasons.\n\nI'm working on solar thermal on a cabin in Colorado.  Plenty of heat in the mid-day sun, would cook you out if you let it, the trick is how do you effectively store hot water to keep the place warm at 3 a.m.\n\nThermal storage (hot or cold water) is distinctly cheaper than battery storage of electricity,  but when batteries are 5x the density and 1/2 the price they are today, there will be one (or more) in every house in America --- driven by cheap, daytime-produced solar power.\n\nAnd it's sure a lot easier to control electricity than water!\n\nSo you're dead on -- storage is where it's at!",

"comment": "I have reduced my family's energy consumption by 2/3 since 1990 and I quit eating meat except for about 3 times a month.  I am building an electric car and getting quotes for solar panels for my home. I support carbon taxes and all manner of public policy changes to retire the use of fossil fuels entirely. I pay for carbon offsets when I fly, which I haven't done in 3 years anyway, opting instead for driving my high-efficiency car or taking the train.\n\nAnd just so we're clear, the Global South is complicit in the problem as well. See, e.g., Bolsonaro in Brasil. Venezuela and Nigeria are huge oil producers. The list goes on; There's no shortage of blame to go around.",

"comment": "I basically was in search of this solution as well.  I have 2 Powerwalls with solar.  The other day I had a brief outage (I think). As far as I could tell, the battery cutover was instant.  The only reason I knew this had happened was because my UPS doesn’t fully work so when the power cut off, my pc shut down instantly.  But my other’s pc didn’t blink and the router and modem stayed online.  Unfortunately the hvacs weren’t running so we couldn’t tell if the walls would have supported the load.\n\nI’m told that you need to adjust the battery frequency a bit when you have a pw, otherwise the battery and the ups will conflict with each other.  I think this is what happened with my pc’s power off shutdown.",

"comment": "If you have 1:1 net metering, figure out how much your system produced last year, convert that to a dollar amount based on the utility's kWh price, divide that number by 12, increase your monthly rent by that much, and then make the tenant pay the electricity bill. Call if a solar fee.  If you want, you can reduce the utility's kWh price by 5% so your tenants get an actual benefit. \n\nSo let's say that your system produced 12,000 kWh last year and your utility charges $0.25 per kWh. Then your annual dollar production would be 12,000 kWh x $0.25 per kWh = $3,000.  And your monthly rent increase would be $250. If you want to give a 5% discount, then reduce that solar fee down to $237.50\n\nIf you have more than a year of solar production history, then base your annual production on that increased data.  \n\nBe super transparent about the calculation. \n\nAlso, adjust the solar fee every year to be fair (or get more money when electricity rates increase).",

But generally, in order for the vehicle to move, it needs to get energy from outside of itself. Those self-charging watches work because a wristwatch uses hardly any electric power, little enough to rely on your body movements; just think of how small a watch battery is and how long it lasts, running 24/7/365.",

"comment": "A few pieces: do you know your net metering situation from your utility where you are?  I see a battery listed so not sure if that is to metal the fridge running in case of power outage or for shifting time of excess.\nNext, I see about $37k pre incentives for the just under 10kw of solar. That is about $7k too much for that piece in most parts of US on an average shingle roof with no extensive adders.  Next I see that he is quoting qcell qpeak panels (possibly made in their plant in Georgia, USA) that are OK. But I missed what inverter this is paid with.\nLastly I see it is guesstimated to make about 12000kwh/yr, how much does your power bill say you use yearly and what do other quotes you have gotten say you will make from about this array size?  Output is an estimate thst can be altered.",

"comment": "> Sunlight is weak and diffuse on earth.\n\n\"relatively\".  It's strong enough to power everything we do for 1000+ years.\n\n> Your claim would require covering the entire area of the earth in solar panels\n\nNo.  My claim is that is we cover a couple percent of the earth in solar panels, we'll have enough power until deep into space-colonation.  Based on current energy needs (about 4million GWH), we need 11.2M acres of solar panels (at 2.8 acres per GW).  That's well under 20,000 square miles, or a basically a 100x200mile rectangle (I'm lazy with my math today).  For all the energy needs of the entire world with CURRENT solar panel technology.  \n\n> The equipment is not free and its production is not environmentally friendly\n\nThe equipment for solar panels is cheaper per lifetime GWH than the equipment for nuclear power, and is more environmentally friendly than the equipment for nuclear power.  Unless your plan is for humanity to stop using electricity altogether, you're winning the battle for solar with every argument you make.\n\n> You ought to know that solar power is also not infinite. The sun has a limited lifespan.\n\nAbsolutely.  And in a billion years or so when the sun dies, we can build microfusion plants on our other colonial worlds and ship them to Earth... or something to that effect.  It's so far into the future that we really should be backseating it against *literally everything*.",

"comment": "I think you raise an excellent question.  Here are my thoughts on it:\r\n\r\nPersonally, I've been vegan long enough that I would find it absolutely disgusting.  I derive no pleasure whatsoever from meat.  It smells bad enough, and the thought of putting it in my mouth is repulsive.  Occasionally a sloppy cook at a restaurant will drop a fleck of meat into my dish.  It might as well be a fingernail or a fly.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first went vegan, for maybe the first 5 years, I would sometimes think it cooking meat smelled good, and wish there were some perfect alternative to fill that void.  \r\n\r\nNow, the thought of eating meat is akin to the thought of drinking a bowl full of spit, or eating another human.  I could probably force my self to eat it if it was a matter of life or death, though. \r\n\r\nOddly, I do like some of the meat alternatives though.  I think it's perhaps because I slowly learned to like them, and because they really are not that authentic.  Nobody has yet been able to realistically reproduce a vegan lard flavor, for example.  Also the \"thought of it\" is not so repulsive.   Perhaps what I like most about them is the things they share in common with meat - mostly the spices used.  For example, I really like the \"soysage\" made by \"Gimme Lean\".\r\n\r\nRegarding if it died of natural causes: It seems that being a vulture would be completely ethical.  Besides, pretty much anything that can be eaten, will be eaten eventually, whether by a human, or maggots.",

I'm talking about healthy people who decide they want to make a major dietary change. My brother appears very healthy (6-pack abs and everything), but he eats A LOT of sugar, white flour, and fast food. I don't think he needs to consult a doctor before making major changes to his diet.",

"comment": "When I was in my early 20's I really believed the holocaust comparison was not only justified, but inadequate to describe the scale of the horror of factory farming. I set up shop outside of my college dining hall and shouted at people going in, saying that they were killing beings that were equally worthy of life as humans. This approach effectively pushed me away from all of my friends, and worked against my goals. Of course at the time I was too blinded by my dedication to the cause to see the damage I was doing, but now i'm in my late 20's I have been out of college for a long time, and I can see that this approach does not work at all. I wish someone would have taken me aside when I was younger and explained this to me, but even if they did I probably would not have listened. Thanks for the contribution!",

Bodybuilding as a vegan is extremely difficult, and you will NOT be able to get as large as you could if you only added whey protein.\n\nYeah, tell that to these people: \nhttp://www.veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios\n\n&gt;Vegan sources of protein tend to be a lot higher in calories vs amount of protein contained than whey or meat.\n\nJust the opposite in fact. Use nutritiondata.com to make comparisons if you want, but vegan protein sources are *almost always* lower in calories for the same amount of protein.",

"comment": "Generally anything higher in calories is lower in fibre and vice versa. Apart from the more obvious things like oil/fat, nuts, seeds, avocados, sugar, try swapping some wholegrains for the white versions if you can't physically eat more (this is the same diet advice for children because they have the same problem of a small appetite and high energy expenditure - you will still get enough other nutrients, don't worry).\n\nSome of your problems could be from changing diet, but you said you ate basically like this before going vegan. Maybe you're just still adjusting to a higher fibre diet (when did you change to eating like that?) or maybe you need to reduce the amount. If that tracker can take soluble and insoluble fibre into account that would be great, you might feel better eating more of one than the other for example. It could also be an intolerance exacerbating the problem, a tracker would be useful for that as well. Good luck!",

After 100+ responses, we have some clear trends we can point to in this self-selected group. I'll leave the statistical significance questions to the real pollsters, but here goes.\n\n1. There are religious people on /r/Vegan, of all stripes, but the *vast majority* refer to themselves as atheist or agnostic.\n\n2. The large majority of respondents don't closely tie their dietary choice to the faith they follow (or lack thereof.)\n\n3. The community here is by majority against wearing leather or wool, and strongly against eating animals (no surprises there), but there's a large group who are clearly on the fence about animal experimentation.\n\n4. People around here are so gosh darned stingy with their up-votes. Create a survey, get 100+ responses in a day, and there's 7 measly up votes? I know, *clicking is so hard,* cue violin.",

It's really where the differences become apparent, and they're still just not *quite* good enough replicas in many cases to work for people with cravings.  \n\nIt might be a bit unconventional, but when I transitioned to veganism, I found that when I was craving cheese what I was (partly) craving was really something with a creamy, fatty texture, and there was a vegan product that was cheap and widely available (where I live), and nearly identical to its non-vegan counterpart which provided that: mayonnaise.  \n\nAlso, I used it in a place where I used to eat cheese, and where it wasn't the only ingredient, so I wasn't going to focus completely on it and the differences between it and cheese, and end up thinking only of how it didn't stack up to cheese: sandwiches.  \n\nI started making sandwiches with vegan mayo in them *all the time* (try brands like Just Mayo or Vegenaise).  Like, every day or every other day for a while.  \n\n* A ton of mayo as a condiment in vegan [chicken patty](https://www.google.com/search?espv=2&amp;biw=1298&amp;bih=707&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=vegan+chicken+patty&amp;oq=vegan+chicken+patty&amp;gs_l=img) sandwiches, \n* mayo in chickpea [\"tuna\" salad](http://sweetpotatosoul.com/2015/06/vegan-chickpea-tuna-salad-video.html), \n* mayo in [potato salad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atpiRtKPY0Q) sandwiches, \n* [flavored mayo](http://www.thekitchn.com/10-ideas-for-flavoring-store-bought-mayonnaise-173374) in sandwiches like mayo with capers in vegan [lox](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=vegan%20lox&amp;oq=vegan%20lox) sandwiches or \n* paprika mayo in vegan turkey cold cut sandwiches.  Like I went *craaazy* with the mayo.  \n\nHealthiest thing ever?  Absolutely not.  But it was vegan, and it helped me stop craving cheese so much.  And after a while, when the cravings became a little less, I started cutting down on doing it as well, until I didn't feel the need to use it all the time either.",

This is the second time you've intentionally neglected a relevant part of my claim to continue to insist on something is totally irrelevant to a discussion of morality anyway.  \n\nI know this totally went over your head, but that whole thing where I was pointing out how talents have absolutely nothing to do with moral status, and you said, \"the rest of your comment about moral value is irrelevant to this post as the OP is about the talents and abilities of animals vs humans.\"  Well, that is the crux of the problem here, you've entirely misunderstood what the robot is saying and what it means.  Go back and try again, I think you might get it this time.  (hint, is the robot saying that Will Smith doesn't have moral status because he can't write a symphony or paint a beautiful masterpiece?)\n\n&gt;The goal never changed.\n\nAnd I quote, \"If you can find a an animal that is regularly eaten that has a talent that no human can do\".  Evidence for which was supplied.  The goal then changed to, \"that no human can do assuming the best possible circumstances and broadest definition of \"human\" (not a single individual, but all humans working together with a full civilization of technology) and the worst possible interpretation for animals (it doesn't matter that they can do things humans can't at various life stages, or innately, or in ways that humans can't even with technology).\"  \n\nEvidence for which was **still** supplied.  The goal then changed to, \"that no human can do assuming the best possible circumstances and broadest definition of \"human\" (full civilization of technology) and the worst possible interpretation for animals (it doesn't matter that they can do things humans can't at various life stages, or innately, or in ways that humans can't even with technology) and *we will ignore all the examples of things animals can still do that humans can't even with technology*.\"\n\nBut, you know, same goal.\n\n&gt;And for the record, my dislike of vegans has nothing to do with the fact that you don't eat meat. It is based purely on your belief that all life is precious.\n\nAmazing, you have a personal \"dislike\" of a group of people that is based on a notion that doesn't even categorically apply to them.  What kills me is, why do you think anyone here cares in the least about your personal likes and dislikes, much less the ones obviously based on shitty rationales?\n\n&gt;Even vegans would be allowed to live, usually. A large portion of the population would not but most vegans would.\n\nI do appreciate this comment.  It lets me know that you are either insane, stupid, or just fucking around with people.  Regardless, not worth my time.",

No one is saying that eating a banana will make you a vegan either. \n\nWe post all kinds of food at r/vegan, (except for animal products) this just happens to be one that made it to /all. \nCan't a vegan get excited about fruit and make a post about it?! haha",

You could just be \"cutting back on meat and dairy for health reason\" or \"giving the plant-based diet a try\"\n\n3. Accept that vegan burgers won't taste like meat ones, and that the ones that come close just make you crave the real deal (as someone who used to eat a few burgers a week, that's been my experience). Once you've accepted that, experiment with [alternative](http://thevegan8.com/2015/06/06/smoky-barbecue-sweet-potato-chickpea-burgers/) [ones](https://youtu.be/iGTNL5VDDUg)\n\n4. Just experiment with a few new meals a week. You'll find some you like, some you don't, but eventually you'll get to a point where you have a whole vegan repertoire of things you find tasty.

I’m not the op but I just wanted to recommend my favorite seasoning that I use for tofu, called “rations tofu scramble seasoning.” It has black salt as one of the ingredients and it makes tofu taste just like eggs. It also has salt and pepper and other spices already so I don’t have to add any other seasoning. I also would recommend the following veggies in a tofu scramble: spinach, green onion, tomato, mushrooms, bell pepper. I hope that helped!!",

What can you handle so far?\nPersonally, I enjoy vegetables more when I prepare them myself because I can control how soft it is and everything. And I still enjoy recipes where vegetables are pureed into sauces! Some people still dislike the texture, but it could be worth a try for you. \n\nThis is a palak tofu recipe (instead of palak paneer with cheese!) where the sauce is a creamy sauce with lots of cooked spinach. https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-palak-paneer-with-tofu/ You could just have the sauce with rice/whatever even if you don't want to try the tofu yet. \n\nAnd this is a Japanese-style curry recipe that is super amazing with rice! https://www.shinagawa-japanese-cooking.com/post/japanese-veggie-curry I personally like it with baby Bella mushrooms, a carrot, a red bell pepper, and sweet onion (I just exclude the celery leaf) but you could really use whatever vegetables you want! \n\nAnd of course, try experimenting with cooking if you haven't yet! For example, get like two crowns of broccoli and chop it up. Roast some, boil some just a little (blanching), steam some a lot, etc. That way maybe you can get an idea of it's just specific textures you can't handle or what.",
