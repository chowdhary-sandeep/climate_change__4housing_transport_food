I, as many others in this thread, work sales at a solar company so take what I say with a grain of salt. \n\nThere should be 1 primary question you ask yourself in regards to getting a solar system, that will help you decide between a purchase or a lease/ppa option. Do you have a tax liability? All residential solar systems in the US provide a 30% investment tax credit for the purchaser. In the case of Vivint they would receive 30% of the cost back, if you purchase YOU would get 30% of the cost back in the form of a tax credit. Most people, with the exception of retirees can take advantage of it (if we're primarily talking about those who qualify to benefit from solar). If you can take advantage of the ITC then you should own your own system.\n\nIn New Jersey and Mass, ownership is far and away the best option. Both states have a strong SREC market, basically your system produces clean power and based on how much it produces you receive Solar Renewable Energy Credits which you can sell on an open market to companies that need to purchase them to offset their carbon footprint. Every single PPA or lease provider will tell you that they factor these SRECs into their pricing model so that you benefit from it, but what they dont tell you is that they are pricing them much more conservatively than is responsible, because they get those credits and get to sell them. \n\nMy company does a turn key installation, we offer PPA's and leases through finance providers that we do NOT own for those customers who prefer a lease or PPA (or are retired) and we also have finance partners who offer low interest loans for system ownership. I'm sure we're not the only company who offers both, but be wary of companies that sell one thing, they tend to disregard what is actually best for you so that they can sell you what they carry.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20764564211382322,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15005539717926694,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16069952643911362,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21331060198406007,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08173928429607713,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26379640952950717,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2658579824841084,"ev_1":-0.15458205081113097,"ev_2":-0.09919960520820226,"ev_3":-0.1650927031393318,"ev_4":-0.09609510360072211,"ev_5":-0.013841214332690773,"ev_6":-0.1318689273466589},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I don't know why people can't get behind that and cheer on any company giving it a shot.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00814707754761912,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12299262346223258,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24074922467343343,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08019887531797092,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22703197028338146,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3222694821563588,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11177253383599843,"ev_1":-0.13858533677800247,"ev_2":-0.014687238215022566,"ev_3":-0.0022677163360640407,"ev_4":-0.002885119271619866,"ev_5":-0.0017542454103628795,"ev_6":-0.14887453053961508},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I personally would love a Tesla, but chose the Bolt because it was too big of a difference to ignore. It may not be everyone's experience, and is limited to the next 6ish months in which tax credits differ, but here's my real-world experience from the Model 3 and the Bolt I have put a deposit on (can't buy in 2018 due to other tax credits, so I have to take delivery on 1/1 or after)\n\n.\n\nTesla Model 3: MSRP = 46,000\n\nsold price = 46,000\n\n+sales tax = 3,220\n\n-tax credit = 3,750\n\ntotal = 45,470\n\n.\n\n.\n\nChevy Bolt: MSRP = 44,385\n\ndealer price = 39,396\n\n+sales tax = 2,757\n\n-tax credit = 7,500\n\n-minimum trade value of old van (literally towed in, subtracting towing cost) = 1,940\n\n-GM Supplier Discount (discount to GM vehicles I get through my job) = 1,500\n\ntotal = 31,213\n\n.\n\ntotal difference = 14,257\n\n.\n\nGranted this is a very personal situation. Not everyone will have a junker of a car and a minimum trade value at a dealership. Not everyone gets a discount through work. However, even without those discounts, the straight dealer price from their website with absolutely no negotiating ([39,396](https://i.imgur.com/FH3C6JZ.png)) for a window sticker price of 44,385 Bolt after tax credits alone is ~10k savings versus the Tesla. It'll be less of a difference in 6 months, and less again as the tax credits are completely eliminated and/or Tesla gets out the Standard Range Model 3. But for me, in a midwestern non-CARB state I couldn't justify spending that much more for a Tesla. Even though I wanted one.\n\nedit: and yes, that screenshot of the price is for the Bolt, and yes it is silly that they have an 'additional offer' of 2 year, 24000 miles oil changes. I'm guessing that's a blanket offer across all cars and they just don't have it built into the website to eliminate it from the Bolt listings.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.007187512159968416,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27289673340856097,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2049434942935609,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25963538578889594,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34208986845371797,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22056440606263447,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08943846559850499,"ev_1":-0.18984797605304063,"ev_2":-0.15472544127709575,"ev_3":-0.19751059940366153,"ev_4":-0.040507187324692495,"ev_5":-0.1624878640238118,"ev_6":-0.20712033885380757,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.071279531478649},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neutral/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Glass roofs can add something like 200 pounds to the absolute highest point of the vehicle. BEVs have their battery packs as low as you could possibly put them, so the roof's impact on handling, stability, and body roll are largely negated. It'll take a lot more engineering to counter that weight in an ICE car, and manufacturers aren't really going to bother with that in lower-margin vehicles.\n\nThere's still a lot of dislike of touchscreen-centric interfaces, and rightfully so. Having a large screen is cool, and I absolutely love it in my Model 3... But even after coming up on owning it for two months, I still need to take my eyes off the road to use most of it. I'm pretty sparing with adjusting anything unless I'm stopped or on autopilot. Consolidating your entire system into a giant screen doesn't make a lot of sense until there are a ton of features to consolidate (even if a big screen is pretty nice). A low or mid-range car eating its air conditioning controls with a larger screen will probably irritate more potential buyers than it pleases. High-end vehicles from manufacturers like Porsche in particular have so many buttons across the dash and into the center console that it could be incredibly worthwhile for them to invest a bit of time in UI development and replacing those buttons with a large screen or two. While I'm at it, capacitive buttons are worst of both worlds, as trying to find them by touch automatically activates them (and often buttons nearby), so you have to look for them, and they take up physical real estate. Additionally, piano black is the worst and it completely baffles me that it's associated with luxury vehicles so closely.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010963282159840067,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2319599038650081,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.178387585788429,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23851556641360125,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.436999084106478,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3509933412952587,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.38834532343510847,"ev_1":-0.008381045999461397,"ev_2":-0.001232382111387172,"ev_3":-0.0013893947228401278,"ev_4":-0.0011764053706428967,"ev_5":-0.0018519294656774339,"ev_6":-0.005262788725910165},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

However, as solar adoption rates increase, the utilities have no choice but to shift peak rate hours to the evening hours to avoid overproduction and duck curve.  This has the added benefit of making sure solar owners are paying their \"fair share\".  \n\nA simple change like moving peak rate hours from afternoon to evening and forcing solar owners on to TOU rate plans can significantly increase the cost of owning solar.  In worse-case scenario, existing solar owner might be better off disconnecting their panels and going back to 100% utility electricity.\n\nHowever, utility companies aren't stupid.  They will make sure net metering is still at least 20% cheaper than off-grid because they want to keep us as customers.  Right now, going completely off grid is not really an option for the vast majority of us. The utilities know this and will of course take full advantage of it.\n\nIf you have solar and live in an area where solar is growing fast, you should probably assume this will happen to your rates sometime in the next 5-10 years. This isn't something solar salespeople warn their customers about so going to be a lot of very unhappy solar owners as this change rolls out across the US.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"frustrated but still pro"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.35779996711335116,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3607808786704944,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19632500835435143,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18449601590471515,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11228906768154243,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.01072557740068684,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006600804006059964,"solar_1":-0.15937937421444986,"solar_2":-0.200094248846772,"solar_3":-0.020253328650113644,"solar_4":-0.21898482521848556,"solar_5":-0.22424892536109445,"solar_6":-0.21016843898541993,"solar_7":-0.24881559426527625,"solar_8":-0.034199991543618045,"solar_9":-0.028421169963223747,"solar_10":-0.20037048129654508,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.0890260511599384},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author expresses opposition to the utilities' actions that increase the cost of solar for solar owners.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Most concerned people are flipping out because they know the fragility of government induced change. A large part of the climate response is through government.\n Trump can potentially destroy years of slow progress trying to stop climate change through regulation.\n\nBut Musk is in a different position. His answer to climate change is based on exploiting the laws of physics and applying them to economics, not the law or governance. Between Solar Roof, power packs and Model3 Musk has created a real sustainable ecosystem that is competitive in the market. Donald Trump can't stop that. \n\nThat said, Donald Trump will not be convinced by words or evidence. As the president elect he will get a briefing on climate change using data that is inaccessible to most of us (Submarines/satellites/military intelligence). If that does not convince him, nothing will.\n\nI fear that his most likely reaction will be to attempt to classify it all, which will be foolish, but that's what you would expect from an expert media manipulator.\n\nHe might also go on a firing spree until he finds the scientists that tell him what he wants to hear. That's what you would expect from a 70 year old millionaire who made his fortune through fraud, bankruptcies, manipulation of the laws and casinos. He thinks the world works in that way.\n\nThe other option is that he knows , but assumes that the best response is to rely on the white supremacists that surround him to lock down power  while the world burns. Setting up a federal infrastructure to deport 4 million immigrants and the patriot act would help him greatly to squash dissent.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI want to add another possibility.

You may need to  brush up on your cost/W breakdown of a resi install in 2016, because although modules are dropping in price like crazy, labor is also incredibly cheap. Modules still account for about 50 percent of total system cost, labor is about 15 percent. \n\nI agree there are cases, such as a very limited roof availability, where high eff. modules are the only option. If you're using microinverters, then you don't need to worry about shading, so generally you will have much more roof space to work with i.e. no need for high efficiency. I just get upset when Sunpower sales guys trick people into thinking higher efficiency = more energy production. \n\nP.S.

A typical cell is about .5V and 8A = 4W. Plenty of amps to drive a fan. If you have 10W, then your cell is going to be around 2V and 8A... and maybe if its not 6\" wide, more V and less A.\n\nNow, the fan is \"undersized\" for the panels so that the panels can produce enough power and turn the fan. You just need enough V and since this is DC, even a tiny amount of A will turn the fan. \n\nThe bubble wrap is doing a few things. It's blocking the sun, so the panel is getting less energy. However, its also diffusing the sun, so the cells are getting more even sunlight. You might even be redirecting some light that would fall on the edges of the solar panel. So even though the panel is getting less energy, your diffuser/concentrator is raising the cell voltage enough to more consistently operate the fan, albeit at a lower power level when it is spinning.\n\nSolar panels gain voltage pretty quickly in the morning and evening. Voltage climbs, and amperage follows. So at the very least, diffusing the light is helping the voltage climb to the minimum amount required to turn the fan. If you remove the bubble wrap under full sun, you should notice the fan turning *faster*.\n\nNice observation, you aren't crazy.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00016332716768374667,"1.1.1_stance":-0.167242893532557,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19085595260063806,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06272014571974675,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2156753269417157,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2630889125505921,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17498129041390106,"solar_1":-0.006694959229207598,"solar_2":-0.08081783833161656,"solar_3":-0.00301101056720654,"solar_4":-0.0012266029558910911,"solar_5":-0.0024001154091214025,"solar_6":-0.0003345393288327614,"solar_7":-0.0003826130256735875,"solar_8":-0.00035819650656776503,"solar_9":-0.11292009821459459,"solar_10":-0.029995649291474063},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (the author is addressing a generic \"you\" and not referring to a specific personal relationship group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

My more precise guess would be around $6,000.\n\nExplanation: I noticed that since you posted in New Mexico, I'm going to assume you live in Albuquerque.  \n\n[Albuquerque gets an average of 6.77 sun hours per day.](http://www.solardirect.com/pv/systems/gts/gts-sizing-sun-hours.html)  That amounts to about 2471 sun hours per year (6.77 sun hours per day x 365 days per year).  \n\nYou require 400 kWh per month, which is 4800 kWh per year.  By simple division, in each sun hour, you would need to produce about 1.94 kWh (4800 kWh / 2471 sun hours per year).\n\nSince solar panels only normally produce about 80% of their rated amount (e.g. a 100 watt panel will only produce about 80 watts hours in an hour under full sunlight), we would then take your 1.94 and divide it by 80%, which is 2.458 kW, or ~~2428~~ **2458** watts, let's round this to 2500 watts.\n\nSince solar panel systems cost *about* $2 to $3 per watt (after incentives), your 2500 watt system would cost about $5000 to $7500.  This also assumes you would sign up for net metering (aka connection to the grid).\n\nAgain, this is very much back of the napkin calculations.  The numbers will vary on location drastically, but I write this to show the general calculation. \n\nSee also: https://solarpowerrocks.com/\n\nEdit: 2.458 kW is not equal to 2428 watts; I just pressed the wrong number.

But I was only seeing around $100/Mo generated electricity. I agree with you that considering the savings offsets the payment.\n\nI bought a ford fusion PHEV and I used this math to figured me real monthly cost, the problem there is that it will never pay for itself.  It just help stomach the extra $150/Mo payment for the vehicle‘ is my budget.  \n\nIf I look at it your way I’m paying an extra $150/Mo to have solar power.

Panasonic, Solaria and several others now have micro inverters built it on the back of the panels. That’s why sometimes you see a panel for $300ish ea and others carry the same panel for 500-600. They are sometimes referred to AC panels.\n\nAny reason your looking at SunPower? I’d check out the REC Alpha series. Better Temp Coef, same output warranty at Yr 25 @ 92%, plus the split panel allows for better output during partially shaded times, and lastly cheaper and easier to get your hands on. REC tops at 380w 60cell currently and 450w 72 cell which started production this year. \n\nI own the X22-360s and after some real world results I plan on comparing them to the REC370AA’s. I could find 360s and will adjust results by correct percentage to represent the 10w difference. Other thing that is different is the RECs are on IQ7+ vs the X22s are on IQ7x.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002505704954576989,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21254273500234808,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21124694511659678,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14825159311294556,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22637817382520273,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26228693848482737,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2737583407433277,"solar_1":-0.1723525933921337,"solar_2":-0.09206530061914757,"solar_3":-0.06784255810877464,"solar_4":-0.030893511731846957,"solar_5":-0.010862150142202154,"solar_6":-0.015478191560153695,"solar_7":-0.003920980469653538,"solar_8":-0.0015807266196740481,"solar_9":-0.19071111294518536,"solar_10":-0.03116588822255532},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I have been a sales rep in solar in California for 3 years. Every company has a baseline (lowest price install can be done) then the rep assigned to your bid will decide we’re he wants to price above that line. So the higher the price the higher the commission. Most reps will not want to sign at baseline because there is no money in the deal. And every company has a different baseline. \n\nWarranty support matters... as said in the comments if a local company says they will give you a 25 year umbrella warranty but they are small and leave the industry in 5-10 years kiss that warranty goodbye. In my opinion the only company’s without a doubt that will be running long term are SunRun, Tesla, Freedom Forever. Side note... a lot of so called company’s are just dealers (sales offices) for SunRun etc... \n\nSo to wrap this up, every quote you received can probably be lowered. But different companies do have different baselines. Make sure just because a company has a good warranty they will be around long term as well, publicly traded is a good indicator. And lastly the type of panels... all the panels available are really solid now a days no major difference in efficiency.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20675681814019647,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19069436405567722,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2416092794743454,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3873871573205823,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.03281479888210015,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23647585984872,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.25132368691242846,"solar_1":-0.27740403911975764,"solar_2":-0.04712632257481649,"solar_3":-0.022462993785059854,"solar_4":-0.10887300960409145,"solar_5":-0.0038700645260784463,"solar_6":-0.07010050824222465,"solar_7":-0.005146280896345464,"solar_8":-0.1203546905477803,"solar_9":-0.264440675333996,"solar_10":-0.1404855953099084},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Does NOT include electrical panel upgrades from 150 amp to 200 amp ($2700), adding a 100a subpanel for $1700. REC panels would cost me 46 cents more per watt. The panel upgrades are to support adding an EV charger to the main panel and geothermal to the subpanel, so idk if you would need that. Just make sure this includes all your costs before you sign. \n\nI did find a solar installer who would install Jinko cells for $13,548 for 5.12 kw ($2.64 per watt), but I wanted more panels on my north roof which they were adamant against doing. Which I would 100% understand, but buying more panels on the north roof even at 35-40% reduced production seems to work out better math wise than not covering what will likely be more than half my energy use from geothermal.\n\nIf you are getting a backup interface for batteries to run a few circuits, it may be better to replace your electrical panel with a Span electrical panel as it is supposed to have that functionality built in. I'm looking into that option as well considering the installer also does geothermal work.\n\nAlso, if you are near southeast Michigan, let me know if you find anyone cheaper. I'm probably going to post later this week with more info from my quotes, but it has been exhausting trying to find the best installer for solar.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002814010974058571,"1.1.1_stance":-0.30154149873905567,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18798371275552778,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2921935762050719,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.05750748157675545,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15244580073689593,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.041296025117238365,"solar_1":-0.10770811221413269,"solar_2":-0.1902609701954096,"solar_3":-0.023646798285578068,"solar_4":-0.1808036876061799,"solar_5":-0.030181142113481958,"solar_6":-0.3018472690031263,"solar_7":-0.039172157732537016,"solar_8":-0.12648052746071375,"solar_9":-0.25314865962464983,"solar_10":-0.16660605991880098},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Here’s an outline of a viable approach:\n\n1. Policy and Regulatory Support\n----\nMarket Incentives: Create mechanisms like feed-in tariffs, carbon pricing, or tax credits for renewable energy to incentivize investment in low-cost technologies.\nTransition Compensation: Establish government-backed funds to help companies recover part of the value of stranded assets, mitigating financial losses.\nPhase-Out Timelines: Define clear, gradual timelines for decommissioning high-cost or carbon-intensive generation assets to allow companies to adjust their operations strategically.\n\n2. Asset Repurposing\n----\nRetrofitting Existing Infrastructure: Explore converting older generation facilities to new technologies, such as retrofitting coal plants to biomass or integrating hydrogen production into gas plants.\nRedeploying Facilities: Utilize existing sites for new generation technologies, taking advantage of existing transmission and grid connections.\nEnergy Storage: Convert retired facilities into energy storage hubs (e.g., battery storage or pumped hydro) to support grid reliability.\n\n3. Investment in Renewable Energy\n----\nJoint Ventures: Encourage partnerships between traditional utilities and renewable energy developers to share risks and accelerate deployment of low-cost technologies.\nPortfolio Diversification: Shift investment gradually to build a diversified portfolio that includes renewable generation, storage, and grid services, reducing reliance on legacy assets.\nCorporate PPAs: Promote long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with businesses seeking renewable energy, providing steady revenue streams for new projects.\n\n4. Stranded Asset Mitigation\n----\nDepreciation Acceleration: Accelerate the depreciation of fossil fuel assets on the books to align with transition timelines and reduce the economic shock.\nSecondary Markets: Develop markets for selling or repurposing equipment and expertise associated with high-cost technologies.\nStakeholder Engagement: Involve financial institutions and investors in managing stranded asset risk through transparent planning and disclosure.\n\n5. Grid Modernization and Flexibility\n----\nSmart Grids: Invest in grid modernization to integrate variable renewable energy sources efficiently.\nDemand Response Programs: Enhance demand-side management to balance supply from renewables and reduce reliance on traditional peaking plants.\nInterconnection Projects: Build interregional transmission lines to distribute renewable energy more effectively, leveraging diverse generation patterns.\n\n6. Workforce Transition Programs\n----\nReskilling Initiatives: Provide training and education programs for workers transitioning from fossil fuel-based roles to jobs in renewable energy and grid services.\nCommunity Investment: Focus on economic development in regions dependent on legacy energy industries, ensuring a just transition for impacted communities.\n\n7. Long-Term Strategic Planning\n----\nIntegrated Resource Plans (IRPs): Require utilities to prepare IRPs that prioritize cost-effective, sustainable energy generation.\nScenario Analysis: Conduct regular assessments of market trends, technological advancements, and policy developments to adapt transition strategies dynamically.\nStakeholder Collaboration: Engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, and communities to ensure aligned goals and shared responsibility.\nBy combining policy, innovation, and financial mechanisms, this strategy allows electricity generation companies to transition responsibly, reducing the burden of stranded assets while aligning with the shift to low-cost, sustainable energy.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"yes","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005159956999705173,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15160830262465197,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2592492022862037,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27377172163040897,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24918863196903243,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21169853706540037,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15473365980687365,"solar_1":-0.21706826727578035,"solar_2":-0.1793367175123287,"solar_3":-0.15675727309687462,"solar_4":-0.05957662111224488,"solar_5":-0.1363187789732668,"solar_6":-0.011922627692304863,"solar_7":-0.027570639431360178,"solar_8":null,"solar_9":-0.1715412713092519,"solar_10":-0.25005396184133133},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

If you are getting a net meter credit for 12¢ but energy at that time is 20¢, you only have to pay 8¢.   A battery, over 15 years is about 20¢ per kWh, so you saved 8¢ from the grid but had to pay 20¢ to own the battery.  That math only works if you are looking at the battery as a form of backup as well, or if your region eventually comes out with a VPP type program, I know Duke is starting one in Florida; my batteries, if the program lasts for 10 years, will become free after all my VPP payments in my state of MA.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0015057950319411855,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2211758277531683,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18403906157691285,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2433911043180722,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11894473483431446,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.217214320260873,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2275803251347194,"solar_1":-0.20350557008602432,"solar_2":-0.18962507937829565,"solar_3":-0.23342203688277527,"solar_4":-0.21448839040812828,"solar_5":-0.008435451930078367,"solar_6":-0.005675522237046001,"solar_7":-0.02670385827271578,"solar_8":-0.05061802720803854,"solar_9":-0.08427622248630229,"solar_10":-0.11829254603556667},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

It is piped down as CNG, The exported gas is LNG same stuff just different technique for liquifying. The exported stuff the company charges $40/GJ and domestic gas is $8/GJ. It is a lot cheaper to compress and send down a pipe 1500Kms than Liquify with refrigeration and transport by boat to China. A 400M/W gas turbine takes up as much space as a large seatainer and is instantly adjustable for loading. I have seen them and there is usually a pair. Very inexpensive power. A comparable wind farm would take hundreds of monstrous towers that do not always work and are maintenance heavy. cost an absolute fortune to build assuming you can find someone dumb enough to do it. The wind turbines latest trick is when the wind gust the rotors go so fast they shear off. Try not to get that in the face you might get cut a little bit. To get anywhere even close with DC solar panels we would have to solar panel the entire Pilbara which has recently been tried and everyone went broke before it even started. Its very dusty up North and panels would need constant cleaning for what amounts to piddle power. I am sure charts exist that show renewables are more cost effective but there not. As a plumbing Apprentice I did an exercise on the costing of solar hot water verses Natural gas and the purchase price of the latest solar hart was around $2500. This was in the late 70s. A 90 litre gas hot water unit was around $300. both cost a similar amount to instal. The solar had an electric booster that was needed for 3 months in winter. The gas unit even using gas constantly never cost more than the solar unit and both last about 20 years.A 130 litre gas unit would catch up on a solar in a shorter time frame but it was still years. I am aware the church of green claims there is a renewable utopia somewhere out there we just have not found it yet. I think coal is primitive and nasty but if you have a pile of it build a coal fired power station next to it.

I guess that's easy to look past because they don't know better, but you would *expect* humans to know better.\n\nJust remember that you're trying to be be the best you can and that many others are too. There are so many very inspiring people. \n\nIf you get frustrated about other's view on animal rights in particular, keep in perspective that you are a *new* vegan. For many years you were subject to the same psychological barriers that prevents everyone else from going vegan. Half baked rationalisations, willfull ignorance, denial... these are powerful things, it's not as simple as just giving people the facts...\n\nPersonally, I could still imagine an alternative universe where I  never became vegan because I was never exposed to the right information at times that I was receptive to it. But in this universe, once I did embrace it, it became second nature very fast and it has been one of the most important things in the world to me for years.\n\n\nSo there's the glass-half-empty take on this: As a species, humans have an inherent psychology that makes us behave irrationally, sometimes like assholes to each other. We resist change despite horrific consequences. Obviously we are contemptible creatures.\n\nOn the bright side, we have the capacity to overcome this. And every individual does not start at square one, but we progress as a society. I recommend reading 'The Better Angels of Our Nature' by Stephen Pinker, it's got some surprising insights on this progress. It's written more as an academic thesis than a feel-good novel, but I find the premise very uplifting.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012991038359662828,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25544508563404716,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21644238051772724,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06971265779187281,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2382642282319514,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13897646422692686,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2635389342884764,"diet_1":-0.0025223754346370697,"diet_2":-0.006563739083503606,"diet_3":-0.0018571715457558942,"diet_4":-0.0018062339653018473,"diet_5":-0.002106516397664867,"diet_6":-0.004694532831611771,"diet_8":-0.0009459106792443587,"diet_9":-0.0004896657264907844,"diet_10":-0.0023235570054869945,"diet_11":-0.0006520270314164615,"diet_13":-0.012553284260017486,"diet_14":-0.04926244890278516,"diet_17":-0.0020372534563648514},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I couldn't stand to look at raw meat, and when I saw people in the supermarket looking at dead fish, birds and mammals as if they were just food and weren't ever anything else...it made me feel so sick. But I just couldn't manage to give it up. I don't know what was stopping me, and I don't know what finally pushed me over the edge, but I'm so glad that I'm now vegan. There seems to be such a disconnect between meat=food and meat=animals. People *know,* they're fully aware, but they don't think about it. I'm naturally an overthinker and a worrier so that may have played a part in me thinking about all the dead animals even as a young child. (not a toddler, but maybe as someone aged 8 or 9) \n\nThis is kind of going off subject a tiny bit but I *hate* how people feed their kids meat and don't give them a thorough explanation of exactly what it is. The vast majority of children would get so upset and shocked that they were eating the cute gentle cows and the beautiful sparkling fish. I recently was talking to my nephew about the food he eats, and when I told him he ate chickens he was in pure disbelief. \nWhen it's breaded and shaped into convenient shapes made to appeal to children, like dinosaurs and aeroplanes, I see that as cruel. Not quite child abuse but getting dangerously close. This is where the problem begins, IMO. If you're going to give your kids meat to eat, please at least explain where it comes from. Nothing graphic obviously at that age, just let them know that animals do get turned into food, and it hurts them.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.30556758932187145,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22657001430268067,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23524616757007719,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.29511839402949747,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1663359944201943,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24111683340870035,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.060638845898211,"diet_1":-0.13490881313191494,"diet_2":-0.0929634304338407,"diet_3":-0.2370289260482726,"diet_4":-0.11973395152910911,"diet_5":-0.1908119333794614,"diet_6":-0.10110882614389963,"diet_8":-0.02567968253788422,"diet_9":-0.2350807620678097,"diet_10":-0.1449012354714796,"diet_11":-0.004921555603990176,"diet_13":-0.21207808492019972,"diet_14":-0.21290683190281975,"diet_17":-0.26777608019686305},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Anything else fermented like cheap kombucha, certain types of pickles, vegan kimchi, sauerkraut, or foods involving fermented soybeans like natto and miso would do the trick just nicely as long as you check to make sure they haven't been heat treated to the point of boiling out the probiotic bacteria.

I would suggest Treeline Cheese, Nuts for Cheese, The Uncreamery (their Truffle Brie is absolutely incredible!), and Miyoko's cheese wheels if you can find them.

When you approach veganism as an ethical principle, it becomes impossible to look at an animal product again without thinking of the victim who was abused and killed to make it. This awareness fills you with motivation, which carries you further than people who view veganism merely as a health or environmental solution. They are great bolstering arguments, but veganism is an animal rights movement and it's the ethics which make certain that you'll be a vegan for life. ✌️","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19178839191054256,"1.1.1_stance":-0.016022420682323475,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.25616278130765235,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3433283717197865,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32108995712670074,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29496026987422097,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.011491561715956777,"diet_1":-0.003257291318732314,"diet_2":-0.0008703263642360071,"diet_3":-0.015315139358184146,"diet_4":-0.0771901654152316,"diet_5":-0.18400380312999323,"diet_6":-0.1945387120201,"diet_8":-0.000835189310843513,"diet_9":-0.0008506650289443011,"diet_10":-0.012784473190549761,"diet_11":-0.0005462289021428054,"diet_13":-0.007684357282414567,"diet_14":-0.029253187521438424,"diet_17":-0.0019983687783072432},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
