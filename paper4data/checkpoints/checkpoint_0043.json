{"transport":[{"comment_index":15200,"comment":"I'm interested to understand how our regulatory and utility structures will have to change in the type of world where installed solar (without subsidy) becomes cheaper than the utility.  When that happens (and it's already happening in certain high power cost markets), the whole utility paradigm is going to change, as the people that install solar will still need the utility to given them power when the solar isn't producing enough energy to meet the site's needs (i.e., net metering), so the utility will be forced to invest more heavily in relatively quick ramp rate generation to be either spinning or able to be quickly spun up (which is typically nat gas simple cycle or even recip units)--but these quick ramp rate forms of generation are inherently more expensive to operate (because of higher heat rates)--so who pays?  Well in the current world, the non-solar (i.e., non-net metering) customers would pay, because they would be the only ones actually paying a utility bill, as the solar (i.e., net metering customers), would likely be netting their utility costs against their generation.  So in theory, the utility costs would go up for the non-solar customers, which in theory may further increase the rate at which non-solar customers move to solar, as the solar paybacks would continue to improve as more and more non-solar customers stop paying their bills (i.e., because they are now net metering), which leaves fewer customers to pay fixed utility costs, which leads to more defection, etc.  THIS is what I am interested in for the US--because the above scenarios will be a disaster for the whole utility industry, which means that new regulations will need to be put in place to re-contextualize how utilities will function.  \n\nIt's all super interesting--but it's also super interesting that the re-contextualized utility system is likely going to be incredibly reliant upon nat gas, which puts the North American nat gas supply and costs as a foundational underpinning to the new electrical energy world view.\n\n...but then you might say, \"No, we'll just use Telsa batteries from the GigaFactory instead of nat gas!\" If this would ever happen, then the world would look entirely different.  \n\nOkay, I'm going to go and pitch some pea gravel into a fire pit so that I can drink a PBR in my back yard tonight whilst staring into a fire.  \n\nIt's cool to see everyone's responses, here.  By no means feel like you need to stop, but I need to pause for a while.\n\nAll best,\n\nAventeren","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-7.27529768482782e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05550536838659355,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23440287266028098,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23619633689355607,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.37739876549039764,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24200131188370205,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15720927617184444,"ev_1":-0.0816911594447447,"ev_2":-0.004052880511153489,"ev_3":-0.055274626172225304,"ev_4":-0.010596978584847724,"ev_5":-0.0007435652732965536,"ev_6":-0.0008805212443500446},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Would you rather have a car which is superior 99% of the time or superior 1% of the time?\n\n&gt;In practice? Sure. In literal terms? Not even close.\n\nRight, so in practice EVs are better.  And it's \"not even close\" how much better they are.\n\n&gt;How many miles of charge do you get from 10 minutes of being plugged in?\n\nWell, it takes 5 seconds to plug in, and 240 miles per charge, so thats 200 times I can plug in in 10 minutes, so 48000 miles in 10 minutes of activity.\n\n&gt;If, and only if, you use them for more than about 4, 6, or 11 years for an ICE, Hybrid, and PHEV, respecitvely\n\nlol, no.  First of all, your source seems to be your own comment sourcing a table on a blog.\n\nThe *vast* majority of any car's emissions come from use, not production.  So you're talking about a slightly higher production cost and a drastically lower use cost.  When a big number is much smaller and a small number is slightly bigger, that means the overall number is a lot smaller.\n\nThis is a rather conservative look at things, which doesn't even take into account things like transmission and refining costs of gasoline (which costs another third or so as much): http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/life-cycle-ev-emissions\n\nFurther, cars are in use for more than 4 years, so your \"*only if*\", as if 4 years of use for a car is some massive hurdle which most cars won't get to, is ridiculous.\n\n&gt;I would have to drive the EV for 12 years worth of miles to break even compared to a comparable ICE car\n\nWhich \"comparable ICE car\"?  The Model S is a far better value for money than anything else anywhere near its price range, without even taking savings into account.  [You can lease a Fiat 500e for $1,600 for 36 months](http://ev-vin.blogspot.com)...total.  Find me a new Fiat 500 which can be leased for that little.  And people generally like the 500e more than the 500 as well.  *And* it's cheaper to drive.\n\n&gt;And how do you quantify that?\n\nHow do you quantify quieter?  There's these things called microphones...  I forget which magazine it was, but one of them tested the Model S as the quietest car they'd ever tested, quieter than the Lexus LS.\n\nMore pleasant can be quantified by the lack of vibration, not having to hit a clutch or brake pedal in traffic, and customer satisfaction numbers.\n\n&gt;I mean, seriously, I'm a huge fan of EVs\n\nSure doesn't seem like it, given the propaganda you're pushing.  You mention doing a conversion, perhaps when you're done with it you'll see how great EVs are.  Being unable to think of a selling point of an EV reflects the limits of your imagination, or your willingness to use it, more than the limits of the vehicles themselves.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006170095681833724,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2909383987347788,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23220647635557645,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13601667806506157,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1811788544795642,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.31246734578008933,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03690201613062527,"ev_1":-0.10439599742053929,"ev_2":-0.004870703041281861,"ev_3":-0.016188588284421712,"ev_4":-0.003006711895674622,"ev_5":-0.045918411623764165,"ev_6":-0.11707762366859242},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

So with a bigger battery in theory you should be able to charge it at the same speed with just more juice going in, but even with the same juice you're able to sustain a much higher charge rate, making it only slightly slower.\n\nLike 250 kWh is almost 5x bigger than SR Model 3, but changing at constant 250 kW that would be fully charged in one hour. The Model 3 still takes like at least 30-45 minutes to fully charge.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00024804014537949115,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14132283920746289,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22558646074735886,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.269377593901663,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.37838096464777965,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22668911399049832,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2650986696438243,"ev_1":-0.24622117140361013,"ev_2":-0.24040349871974545,"ev_3":-0.203487379861051,"ev_4":-0.05772240885562496,"ev_5":-0.014702422068997597,"ev_6":-0.12661261271823349},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I’m pretty pleased with how it turned out. Why do you think government knows better than actual consumers what’s best?\n\nWell it's stupid in the sense that places like the EU don't have to deal with multiple charge port standards. Everyone uses the same one. Is it necessarily better than NACS? Arguably no. But, in my opinion, standardization is more important than having the bestest connector. Now we have a fragmented system, people are literally buying CCS2 vehicles right now, and spending a lot of money on them. DC and AC chargers are still being installed to this day that use CCS2. The mess we have in the US is now forcing all of them to use adapters in the future. Simultaneously, NACS vehicles (mostly teslas) are unable to charge on CCS2 stations without an adapter. It's undeniably a messy situation and is a major component consumer confusion. Your average person has no idea about types of ports, they're used to 100 years of using the same universal gasoline nozzle design. The reason why tesla came up with their own standard was because the government failed to set a standard. The government doesn't have to know best, they have mechanisms to seek public and industry input.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005301360458057995,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14177684131125118,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2766374552807701,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26937767308158017,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29933688392643304,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17974211163014528,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1930272907629842,"ev_1":-0.14628215874462905,"ev_2":-0.012561500821902882,"ev_3":-0.01969379528478991,"ev_4":-0.1269637429641343,"ev_5":-0.3317955438348387,"ev_6":-0.1018890657681426},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

For the whole system, the payoff is under 8 years once you include the $1,000 state rebate. \n\nSo it's going to take him an extra year to pay off a system that's  85% bigger than using just the south.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00033907019557470147,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28638932450478477,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19921023026108742,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.028152766947944958,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2002185793885206,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16887789380246546,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.031070172248291783,"solar_1":-0.13659131991530318,"solar_2":-0.17317130095761968,"solar_3":-0.05110768357068688,"solar_4":-0.17252391372650777,"solar_5":-0.2074005353442072,"solar_6":-0.0016651723611479004,"solar_7":-0.0035474448110714243,"solar_8":-0.01936692182061961,"solar_9":-0.19721407471016345,"solar_10":-0.026960564330996323},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers (assuming the author is discussing the system analysis with them)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

This is a lot of fun. Now..\n\nA.) It's hard to say. I'm assuming you're going to be using more electricity once you move in than you are now when you go all-electric. It might be a good idea to install everything except for the solar first, and then wait a couple of months to see how much electricity you're using in terms of kWh's. Forecasting how much energy you're going to consume in a new home is always really tricky. Do you plan on leasing these panels or just straight purchasing them?\n\nB.) To be honest with you, I'm not very sure. I've never had to deal with any rebate-paperwork or any of that. I know with solar the rebates are actually trying to hit a goal of a certain amount of mega-watts being produced in california by 2016 I think is the year. Hopefully they start up the rebates again right after.\n\nC.) That's interesting, I didn't know solar city didn't do them. It shouldn't be a problem though. It just needs a different attaching/flashing method that's been engineered for foam roofs. Prosolar makes a foam-roof attachment stanchion.\n\nD.) I'm not sure that these utilities are giving checks out to homeowners for energy produced into their grid. I'm not sure how PGE is, but I don't think I've ever heard of these utilities actually paying out homeowners. I think if anything that'll just flip over to the next year. \n\nThis proposal solar city gave you, is it a PPA? I don't really like those. We're getting solar on our house by the company I'm working for, and it's a 9.81 kW sunpower lease for 20 years, roughly about $150, 0% annual escalation. \n\nI think you should shop around and look at some local smaller companies too. You're doing a great job on all this research though, not a lot of homeowners are as pro-active as you.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.018546782977258165,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0875765909292113,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24686469679567552,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27747708371257657,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.03581660201427894,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.09427865344786805,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24279242222352573,"solar_1":-0.0808794970313708,"solar_2":-0.1898952747384707,"solar_3":-0.001718524833753084,"solar_4":-0.021153815711537998,"solar_5":-0.0021851954758555316,"solar_6":-0.03212527558207512,"solar_7":-0.0178745174780488,"solar_8":-0.003693398413209555,"solar_9":-0.09271956883558938,"solar_10":-0.12701773479428452},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Yes you still pay for what is generated, but if you don't use that energy it will be credited to your utility and they will pay you back (net metering agreement) at whatever the going rate is. So here in cali, if I take a vacation I actually make money. Utilities do escalate prices, and they will continue to do so at an alarming rate as more people switch to solar. The 100+ year old grid takes a ton of money to maintain and whether there are 1000 or 10 customers the cost will still be there, it will just be divided differently. \n2. It's in SolarCity's best interest to keep the panels working and producing at max, so they will replace old parts to keep up with panel production decline. And the 2.9 escalator isn't the only way (even though at the end of 20 years that will fall between $20-50 [smaller-larger] more to your bill and accounts for inflation, and cost of living increase for the employees) there are flat rates you can get for 20 years, or even de-escalating rates ( down to -4.5% over 20 years). The 2.9% is basically front loading most of the savings, and for people who would be moving in a few years that's great. \n3. Think about Amazon, they had the same business model. Tons of customers, and make just a little money off of each. They really take care of employees and put in a ton of capital that they will charge for over the course of 20-30 years. They only have 37% of the total solar market (which accounts for only 3% of the residential  electricity market.) In a few years they will most likely be the largest provider of electricity in the US.

I wonder how much that contributes to the current air quality? Do the particulates from unfiltered coal burning stick around for years?\n\nI'll give you an anecdote from today to explain: as I walked to the subway this morning I noted that the sky was grey with smog; getting out of the subway, I noted that the sky was blue and the horizon was grey with smog; by the time noon came about, the sky and horizon were mostly clear of smog.\n\nThe wind that had started up in the morning had blown most of the smog away.\n\nParticulates from burning coal stick around only so long as there is no wind. The pollution from previous years have absolutely no impact on the current pollution.\n\n&gt;In terms of reliability and cost, it makes no sense to subsidize solar. Keep coal plants around and install proper filters for them\n\nTwo issues here:\n\n1. With the level of corruption here, actually enforcing the use of scrubbers would be extremely problematic. From what I've read years ago, most of the power plants **do** have scrubbing systems in place, but just never turn them on because it is more expensive and cuts into profit margins (or makes them run at a loss).\n\n2. China saw the potential to become a market leader in solar technology.\n\nWhile solar power lags behind conventional power production in terms of efficiency, it has great potential for the future and for applications not suitable for other conventional sources of power (mounted on small toys, vehicles of any size, satellites/spacecraft, space stations, lunar/planetary bases). Some of these applications are still far off, but becoming a market leader is a long term goal.\n\nI'd have to do a little more research to see whether China's investment looks to be paying off or not.\n\n&gt;And that's a problem, just not to the extent as in China and India. The EPA is a middle ground option, it's better than nothing in the medium term, but in the long-term it grows into the monstrosity it has become today, where it essentially now claims ownership of all bodies of water, and any property owner are essentially their slaves at this point. The EPA is, without governance by the people, effectively the ruling entity in the USA when it comes to property.\n\nThe bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.\n\nI'm with you on that one. The EPA employs close to 16,000 people. And while I do credit the EPA for a lot of good (such as clearing up skies over many American cities), it has indeed expanded beyond its original mandate and should be pared back.\n\nI would be interested in a neutral audit of the EPA.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00024286417950255176,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12965723454367292,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20970808312140196,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.10102591725687186,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3335862045814585,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.177479902475185,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10522238180662195,"solar_1":-0.060923998110714216,"solar_2":-0.1158542862073141,"solar_3":-0.062085846962266565,"solar_4":-0.03535046167113857,"solar_5":-0.026861743271486677,"solar_6":-0.005821426456047145,"solar_7":-0.00873171116351538,"solar_8":-0.006530303459536905,"solar_9":-0.10951638158682424,"solar_10":-0.17585688714461867},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

They also might not be able to get permission for a construction project from whomever owns the property: most office and retail locations are leased rather than owned by the businesses there.\n\nSo this is exciting in that it solves those problems by being something you can just purchase or lease and drop on a parking space to turn it into a charging space.\n\nWhat's disappointing is it doesn't actually work to enable people that would need to charge at work reliably to do so. Since it's solar powered, it won't be available on days with clouds or inclement weather, and it needs to be available every day. No amount of battery storage will make up for a couple straight days of rain, not when this thing isn't grid-tied at all, and not being grid-tied is the only reason it'd be purchased in the first place.\n\nSo while this is really cool, it's going to serve a more limited role due to its unreliable nature.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00016308578536457693,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21999662634379658,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1852674839332593,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16791779415315675,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.048581356978957047,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2675507544605062,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06857246205133076,"solar_1":-0.01238855942938244,"solar_2":-0.007363139212732979,"solar_3":-0.2937956554226859,"solar_4":-0.05731619390705115,"solar_5":-0.08431893371675869,"solar_6":-0.002221832463571142,"solar_7":-0.0017130066310831655,"solar_8":-0.002075114398394362,"solar_9":-0.14930414021849478,"solar_10":-0.2663694802613463},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

You use 399kwh/month for March. That is fall in your location so I am assuming it is not very hot or cold.  Average 13.3kwh/day.  You use about 1/2 the power of the average home in my area.  Your home is very efficient.  You are certainly not running an air conditioner.\n\nNext, when considering battery size the night time use is our main concern.  It says you use 57% of your power from the powerwall.  We will assume that is all power stored during the day and released at night.   That take us to 7.5kwh on an average night. Your PW2 has a capacity of 13.5kwh.  Your reserve capacity is 6kwh.\n\nSo you can go a single 24hour period on your power wall with no sunlight to recharge the battery. This is a very limited design. With no sunlight, by the time you get up in the morning and cook breakfast you would be running on empty.\n\nNow March is one of the months with the lowest power consumption.  Most homes aren't running the furnace or air conditioner much.  In one of the winter or summer months, you do not have a full 24hours worth of battery unless the sun is shining.  This is most important in the winter when the panels could be covered by snow, and the furnace will be running.  If a storm rolled through during the night and snowed on your panels, your powerwall would be discharged by mid morning with no ability to charge it up.\n\n13kwh is not much power.  I will give a quick breakdown of how I size battery systems. \n\nMost homes have a base load of 400watts that never shut off.  So unless we control that base load, we are starting with a minimum battery budget of 9.6kwh/day just for the base load.\n\nI focus on mainly the items that use power at night that you can't turn off.\n1.5kwh/day for the refrigerator \n2kwh/day for a furnace\n9.6kwh/day base load.\n1kwh/day lighting\n5kwh/day everything else\n(2kwh/day per chest freezer)\n\nTotal 19kwh/day.  Half of that for night time load, is 9.5kwh.  \nTake that 9.5kwh and multiply by 1.2 to account for conversion losses. = 11.4kwh\nNow multiply by safety factor or days of autonomy desired.\nThen multiply by depth of discharge desired on the battery.  (lead acid battery should never be discharged by more than 50%)\n\nYou can see why battery systems need to be large and expensive if you do not have a power grid to draw from.\n\nOne other major concern that I have not even brought up yet.  That powerwall puts out 40amps.  Thats it. Here in the US I am not even allowed by code to attempt to power a house with just the powerwall.  The minimum size service I can install on a home is 60amps by code.  You have to parallel two of the PW2.  Double the cost.  Once you do a service calculation on most homes, it takes us to 100amp minimum. Now you need 3 of the battery packs.\n\nOn your system you are drawing from the grid no matter what your monitoring app tells you.  Any time you turn on more than one major appliance you are exceeding the capabilities of your system and you are using the grid to provide the amperage you need.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001867786981165409,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13588689859305986,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21100396482075598,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2251191842790915,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2750882240873158,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2098549359446904,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24848449447502693,"solar_1":-0.2981185181074479,"solar_2":-0.24976181870922762,"solar_3":-0.12322190196892423,"solar_4":-0.07961262598933123,"solar_5":-0.07664392337924364,"solar_6":-0.29304528030237026,"solar_7":-0.2025868676476724,"solar_8":-0.029864926736341047,"solar_9":-0.04744407078276325,"solar_10":-0.10702809335848475},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The average is about 1.8 cars per household.  But anyway EVs can all be programmed when to start and stop charging, so you plug the car in when you get home but it won't start drawing electricity until you tell it to, so you can schedule the cars to charge at different times from each other and at times when you're not typically using your heaters etc.  E.g. program the cars to charge on alternating days from 1am to 5am or something.\n\nCharging at home overnight is really convenient for homeowners but it's actually not the best solution if you think about it.  Most people with a commute that are worrying about nightly charging drive to work and then park in a parking lot and leave their car there for 8 hours.  Charging at work during the daytime when abundant solar power means the grid is at its cleanest is the ideal situation, and most workplaces already have the infrastructure for high-amp charging, they just need to install the charge stations and price them reasonably.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0097421662261065,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3155114669889172,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21127134688727014,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17016342253899097,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2726846478241513,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2355265750846868,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19967748395477733,"solar_1":-0.1272916414210176,"solar_2":-0.1311075383678665,"solar_3":-0.23593636221024403,"solar_4":-0.04684164903755651,"solar_5":-0.10103102449405317,"solar_6":-0.05147830107792591,"solar_7":-0.18969257635520384,"solar_8":-0.12330879760156677,"solar_9":-0.013367362888054402,"solar_10":-0.15400064009230618},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

They are doing 6' spans from rafter to rafter in MN which by engineering tables are not allowed in this area.  The standard is 4'.  I wonder why they have that skirt around the array?   Is it because Inspectors cant see the spans and can't see if wires are touching your roof?  They use solar edge inverters which quality control has gotten absolutely terrible the last 2 years.

It's the home consumption tracking your solar production that's the problem.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"yes","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.31485734095677853,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3112758551086177,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1721303454531231,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2662576511502266,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2146350543836413,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24400881370835115,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08906264215086897,"solar_1":-0.13610746936079335,"solar_2":-0.03462513520692786,"solar_3":-0.029230603948235512,"solar_4":-0.048222232648792364,"solar_5":-0.03225351278282081,"solar_6":-0.19196966818223396,"solar_7":-0.16629387610560897,"solar_8":-0.09594525893529256,"solar_9":-0.0017413979934417512,"solar_10":-0.006478858696254974},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (injunctive, as this implies a shared expectation among SunPower customers that their solar monitoring should function correctly)","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed (the author is discussing a problem with the monitoring system, not taking an overall stance for or against solar)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear (The text mentions a problem with the monitoring of solar production and home consumption, but it's not clear if it's describing a common issue or just the speaker's experience.)","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers (assuming the author and the person they are responding to both work for SunPower)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

Flax, flax flax....\n\nJust try to keep a snack on you at all times, have a  piece of fruit even if youre not hungry[I have a banana every morning--- I HATE bananas, but I owe it to my body/stomach/brain to keep it going]\n\nIts hard for someone who tries to eat healthy but fights with food intake to just sit down and have BIGGER meals with MORE food at those times in the day. The best way to keep your body fueled, processing calories[your metabolism will stay high], and still getting nutrients is to always, always have food on you. If you smoke, switch in a snack for a cigarette. Start by grocery shopping with a friend and getting your FAVORITE foods, or making homemade vegan granola bars. Tempt yourself to get out of bed and have breakfast in the morning [dark chocolate oatmeal with dried fruits and nuts-I would never make it through the day without this!]\n\nAs far as meals and vegetables go- start doubling the portions. Choose vegetables that cook down if it looks like a lot. Calories are not your enemy, they are direct fuel for keeping your muscles strong and limber, your tendons and ligaments lubricated, your stomach's ph balanced, your liver's purifying action working, your blood pressure normal and THEY KEEP YOUR BRAIN ALIVE.\n\nAt the weight youa re at, be aware that you are now burning muscle tissue and fat cells in the brain that keep you alive and functioning. At this point you are physically restricting yourself so much that you are permanently altering your PHYSICAL AND MENTAL identity! Your brain is rotting.\n\nThis isn't about toxins, bad calories, fats, sugars, this is about self respect for the shell that carries you through the day and allows you to see brilliant colors, feel the breeze and love those around you. Respect your vessel, you owe it more than what you're doing for it.\n\n\nYou eat healthy enough that you will never have to worry about weight. that is your metabolism speed, not the caloric intake. Look into good Raw cookbooks-even when im not hungry, I can always munch down some raw veggies/fruit and theyre gone before I know it. Carry around PB and carrots, a raw pepper or even a bag of greens[kale, collards, mustard greens] and when you find yourself standing[whether youre hungry of not], just munch away, make them disapear. Bring pickled lupini beans or a can of chickpeas with you- whip it out at work, in class, on the bus, and just keep nibbling IN ADDITION to 2-3 meals a day. When you go out, add some of your own beans to the salad. bring your own flax-heavy salad dressing if you dont want to use their processed stuff. You don't have to enjoy it, the act of eating food is your obligation to your physical form. If you ruin your physical self, you will cease to exist. you can do permanent damage that can leave you physically or mentally crippled for life. If you don't have your health, you don't have anything.\n\nVeganism and Vegetarianism is NOT about restrictions! It is about substitutions to aid you in becoming a healthlier, better functioning human. What you are practicing is not vegetarianism, its just elimination. Suggest these things to your family so others can help you make snacks. Make your own fruit leather! When others have meat, have two servings of veggies and grains instead. You don't always have to finish, but keep trying. Take breaks in meals to walk around and have a glass of water.  LEARN ABOUT ARUVEYDIC HERBAL DIETS. \n[I can get started on the importance of grains+vegetables+legumes acting together if you want---basically, your body doesnt absorb enough of the nutrients in any one of these things UNLESS you eat with with another. Tomatos? need grains. Beans? need grains. Vegetables? Need beans or grains.] Keep making snack packs and nibbling away. Stop putting a cap on your daily calories.. going over IS oging to bother you and make you feel uncomfortable-just recognize that and keep nibbling. There is NO way you will get fat if you make healthy choices about quality of food. Some days of the week, dont count anything at all! Start on the weekends, dont keep a log, mental or otherwise. Or set a much HIGHER cap, like 1500-3000 cal. Consider it body building, because, well...you need more mass.\n\nDont give a fuck what others think, you are doing this out of respect to yourself. If you dont have enough respect to keep your physical form working correctly[think of all it does for you], well then maybe your respect for life in general is very low. If you don't respect this life, if you aren't grateful for what you have, then get off my planet.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.057275466923632244,"1.1.1_stance":-0.36450146507040604,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3634039150966904,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12200487061636522,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2523859056333701,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.4272615151974602,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.008829602816452583,"diet_1":-0.30585125478119046,"diet_2":-0.02981717295673055,"diet_3":-0.10136638847567762,"diet_4":-0.03434883636267235,"diet_5":-0.03199776477413252,"diet_6":-0.01139277588420858,"diet_8":-0.004248045809314742,"diet_9":-0.12137238104341819,"diet_10":-0.3263592679300838,"diet_11":-0.07966061730015402,"diet_13":-0.1295305471923235,"diet_14":-0.11263606128185799,"diet_17":-0.01275314080218474},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

They were inflicting a bevy of animals with horrendous conditions (organ failure inducing stuff) and then feeding them their various types of tea in the hope that one of the teas would reduce the condition in the animal so they could launch an advertising campaign about the nutritional benefits of their teas.\n\nalso worth considering that cigarette smoking was seen as ok health wise for far too long because rats don't get cancer from tobacco exposure - many potential cures may also have been thrown out because they have adverse effects on animals who actually differ in biology to us. \n\nanyway, good luck trying to figure out where you fall on all these issues, when it first hit me I was depressed by the weight of it all and turned away , unable to address it, 4 years later I saw a car accident fatality in progress and was struck by what we share with other animal species in our desire to live , desire to be with our kind and wish to avoid suffering + experience pleasure , so then I decided to begin becoming a vegan.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.011219078364471594,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2913978781039927,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16138794433954232,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19778274474146246,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17016784869989898,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.39367157066195907,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22272641083625433,"diet_1":-0.1781835296624321,"diet_2":-0.22598498741419457,"diet_3":-0.1290682374895198,"diet_4":-0.045060212312212876,"diet_5":-0.09339732882290264,"diet_6":-0.0680604572868712,"diet_8":-0.009327580371367125,"diet_9":-0.014842844121934226,"diet_10":-0.05518566874040213,"diet_11":-0.01349281949175444,"diet_13":-0.09690109040820971,"diet_14":-0.1108884435177073,"diet_17":-0.063895479067772},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

I lived in Rogers Park and there is an awesome store called Devon Market, it's on Devon, closest to the Loyola Redline stop. They sell super super cheap produce. Like, REALLY cheap. There is also an Aldi right near there (closer to the Granville stop) which is also really super cheap. Just bring your own bag cause they don't have bags there.\n\nAlso if you wanna eat out for cheap go to Sultan's Market, there's one in Wicker Park and another on Clark. I know others but that's the best deal in my opinion.\n\nI found it a lot easier to find produce in Chicago than it sounds like youre having, I'm actually really surprised you even found a fruit or vegetable at Walgreens. Whole foods is a little expensive but there are some all over the city.\n\nI keep a blog about eating a whole foods vegan diet for cheap, its called Cheap Vegan. You can read it at www.cheapvegan.net\n\nLet me know what neighborhood or what color El you're near in Chicago and I'll let you know if I know any good places to find cheap groceries and take out.

But I can't bring myself to introduce an element to their diet that I currently believe to be harmful to them (again I'm talking about these two specifically because I only have data for them). If I start feeding them *some* vegan food and it does not trigger a pH rise, I don't have a way of knowing if it's doing them harm or not. With the 100% vegan food and the negative pH tests it was quite clear. I feel like if I give them some percentage of vegan food I'll need to at least get multiple bloodwork tests done, at least for the first six months or year.\n\nIdeally it would be fine. But if not, how do I know I'm not causing some long-term adverse effects, which will then be managed with extensive veterinary care, etc.?\n\nI think it's good for any vegan cat owner to try and find out for their specific cats. I did and I wasn't comfortable with the results. I know there's a sanctuary in, I think, North Carolina that feeds all the cats and dogs vegan food.

Fully backed by my vet who I have been consulting to come up with recipes. I am also intent on putting together a google doc or something like it with links to scientific texts about vegan diets for dogs. I have read plenty of convincing material, but I didn't make a point of saving it to share with others yet. Will try to remember to post a link to it back on this sub once I get started. My go to basis recipe at the moment is:\n\n--- 50% carrots/potato/sweet potato/pumpkin/beets cut in 1-inch pieces --- 20% kale/spinach/cabbage/celery/green peas --- 30% lentils/chickpeas/beans. ---\n\nI make a large pot every 5 days for my 22lb very hungry, very active jack russell mix. I start by boiling a pot half full with water. Add lentils first, something like a cup (I'm not too strict with the amounts, I have just learned how much goes in), they cook about 20 minutes in total, set a timer. After a few minutes add carrots and/or pumpkin/beets if you have, they cook the longest of all veggies. With about 10 minutes left, add potato and/or sweet potato. Add leafy greens and cabbage at the end with a minute or two left. Add a can of chickpeas or beans. If you get dry ones, those have to soak over night and be cooked on the side. Then i turn it off and throw in a tablespoon each of a few things:\n---\nSunflower seeds --- Nutritional yeast --- Ground flax seeds --- Chia Seeds\n---\nIf I have any blueberries around I throw a handful, maybe a bit of apple or banana. In the beginning my pup was a bit picky with the food sometimes, so I would add a spoon of peanut butter before blending and she would gulp it right down. Now she loves it and jumps for joy before every meal :) Then blend everything. Get an immersion blender if you don't already have one! Store in the fridge for a few days or freeze some for a lazy day. I get creative and change things up gradually here and there to give her a varied diet, and it took some finessing before getting the amounts right. Too many beans and she would have to poo like twice the normal amount. Things like that take some adjusting. But overall we have been keeping an eye on her health with our vet and she is perfectly healthy and thriving. She is 2 years old and has been vegan for about 5 months. Have fun!\n\n--- Upvote if this was useful please, new redditor here trying to gather enough karma to post in a sub I follow daily.

Do you mean that these cats vegans have been feeding commercial plant-based foods will die at a young age or get serious health issues even though the cat-caretaker has informed themselves on this topic?\n\nI am wondering where you get your information from because I read most scientific articles about this topic (although it is very lacking, research has been very limited indeed) and I came to a very different conclusion from reading all of that.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001298640815851589,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11808256364747649,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2405090813438992,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3387080165505836,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28409651442658895,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2498644415020692,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22458557603385998,"diet_1":-0.1146998029053701,"diet_2":-0.06549086980036616,"diet_3":-0.11773994788884086,"diet_4":-0.14768814739848798,"diet_5":-0.0181408940552501,"diet_6":-0.0740661927605591,"diet_8":-0.008119576908939052,"diet_9":-0.008099979818022499,"diet_10":-0.007815268686196456,"diet_11":-0.02882010104561535,"diet_13":-0.001542876474559307,"diet_14":-0.11072144088878606,"diet_17":-0.0035974251998898885},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

That's why being a Vegan is so hard, because beforehand everything contradicts what you thought you knew. Truth doesn't care if it hurts, because truth is truth no matter what. Veganism is almost esoteric.\n\nWhen people's belief systems get challenged, they either self reflect and change or try to find some way to justify it and keep going with what they are doing; not even realizing they are frugivores. The government also subsidizes the meat, dairy and egg industries because of the vast amount of money they recieve. It's all a trade system.\n\nThen the pharmaceutical industries make a shit ton of money from the diseases that the meat, dairy and egg industries cause. If everyone went on a plant based diet and started making altruistic changes, 0$ would be made. So they put on a front, or a mask, to everybody saying, \"This medicine will treat, this, this and this!\" When it is all just a facade. \n\n\"1/4th of what we eat keeps us alive. 3/4ths of what we eat keeps the doctor alive\" -Egyptian Proverb\n\nSo not only when we make the change (regardless of reasoning: health and/or animals) are we healing ourselves, we are healing the planet as a byproduct and vice versa. People are just very comfortable with where they are at. We cant force change as much as we can force a river to go where it doesn't want to. We just have to lead by example. \n\nIt's like being in a party for your entire life and everyone is drunk. You sober up and you start to see everyone else is drunk, but they don't know they are drunk nor know what being sober is. If you point out they're re drunk, they will be in complete denial and may even call you crazy. This is how it is when we tell people the facts of what meat, dairy and eggs do to us. They will be in complete denial. But that's okay. The truth is always there. Nor does it need defended. \n\nJust keep making those changes and keep choosing compassion for yourself and the planet. If you're being called crazy, you're on the right track. Take it as a compliment. I'd rather be called crazy by people who are crazy than be called normal by people who are crazy. \n\nHonestly the hardest part is in realizing that it is no ones fault. They are conditioned just like everyone else and shrouded in a vast, thick smaug of misinformation. The reason why I say it is hard is because I am faced with this predicament quite a bit: Someone will complain they are tired all the time and substitute their sleepiness with, lets say a red bull. You point out what the redbull and all the processed shit is doing and tell them there is a much healthier and holistic alternative that will give you a boost in energy and WAY better sleep. They reply: \"Ew plants.\", or \"I dont like the taste of plants. Never ever.\", or even \"Dont ruin my food!\" Then be on their merry way. If people say ignorance is bliss, this is literally it. But to me ignorance is the complete opposite of bliss. It's dancing with the devil persay. \n\nIn conclusion: Lead by presence and help the people that are open. You can show people that they are killing more animals than there are stars, but they won't give a shit because to them it is a part of their \"natural ways\" and it'll break a leg or two off of their high horse. Just have faith and keep doing what you're doing. Collectively, it is the small changes that will add up and up and eventually it will spread like wildfire. It's already happening today &lt;3 \n\nAll love my friend &lt;3 Godspeed.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06640252890065312,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1382740712724626,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20371581668383498,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23706049803462015,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27563431716912307,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17883992782306657,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.020799281638270866,"diet_1":-0.2230122707068539,"diet_2":-0.3040775955764927,"diet_3":-0.19884569250978837,"diet_4":-0.21074720038207792,"diet_5":-0.15437243575191437,"diet_6":-0.04779199699543877,"diet_8":-0.010121259148945683,"diet_9":-0.017453669434568535,"diet_10":-0.09541782039256456,"diet_11":-0.04127711011581899,"diet_13":-0.2331839352836564,"diet_14":-0.170373456903524,"diet_17":-0.1449278538754394},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I mean, technically instead of being dishonest they could just lack the cognitive ability to understand the reasoning, but I'm pretty sure you don't need to be an academic to understand that 'animal cruelty is wrong' + 'consuming animal products is unnecessary' = 'go vegan'. I find it far more respectable when they say, \"I agree that veganism is the correct position, but I'm just too lazy to change.\" Unfortunately, most people I have civil conversations with deploy fallacious reasoning, misrepresent the vegan position, ignore the actual argument, deflect with red herrings, use character attacks and appeals to hypocrisy, tu quoque fallacies, appeals to nature and tradition, and so on. It's quite infuriating.\n\nI don't really get it either, but this is what it seems like to me. As soon as veganism was explained in detail to me, (eating animals is unnecessary, they are sentient animals &amp; deserve to live, you wouldn't want that treatment if you were them), and I saw some of the footage - I was like.. \"yeah!
