You can also marinate them for 20 mins or more(longer the better), then drizzle the bag juice over them.  But always bake them first to get the right texture, then you can sear them on a grill or what'evs.",

"comment": "Firstly, good post.  I particularly appreciate your manner and your willingness to both consider evidence contrary to your assumptions and do follow-up research.  Some comments.\n\n&gt;They say B1 and A1F1 are more likely, given your supply-side constraints...\n\nI think you misread.  They say, \"...by limiting projections to the B1 scenario, both the median change and the spread of model results are reduced relative to equivalent projections under an **unrealistic high emissions scenario (A1FI)**.\n\nIn other words, they accept that B1 might be likely, but reject A1Fl.\n\n&gt;Go back to Marcott. Here's the relevant bit:\n\n&gt;&gt;Climate models project that temperatures are likely to exceed the full distribution of Holocene warmth by 2100 for all versions of the temperature stack \n\nTwo thoughts here.  First, and without double-checking Marcott, I recall he is using GCMs.  As you noted previously, GCMs have a higher ECS in general than do observationally constrained estimates of ECS.\n\nSecond, we are actually conflating two things here.  Given that it most likely takes centuries to reach equilibrium, ECS isn't really useful for estimating temperatures by 2100.  For that, we want TCR (transient climate response).  AR5, if memory will serve me twice, estimates TCR at 1.8°C per doubling of atmospheric CO2.  More recent papers have either confirmed that estimate (a paper I saw yesterday said 1.8°C/doubling) or suggest lower TCR (Nic Lewis estimates 1.35°C).\n\nWith this in mind, we then have to ask:\n\n- How much warmer was HCO than today?\n\n- What is the best estimate of TCR?\n\n- How much of the ~0.75°C warming of the 20th century was due to GHG increases?\n\nOnce we've answered that, we can subtract the answer from the last question from the answer to the second question and compare it to the answer from the first question.\n\n&gt;1) Wouldn't a response to climate change be similar to a response to peak oil? \n\nThat's a very good question.  I would have to say yes and no.  The response to peak oil, if one doesn't feel CO2 emissions are a big deal, would be to reduce consumption of oil as quickly as possible.  That would include supporting EVs, which would be a policy espoused by those who want to reduce CO2 emissions, but would also include support of natural gas vehicles and even the processing of coal into dimethyl ether, which would obviously conflict with CO2 emissions initiatives.  (Coal to liquid fuels is actually fairly old technology.  The Nazis pioneered it when the Allies cut off their oil supplies.)\n\nOf course using other fossil fuels to replace oil only moves up their respective peaks, so it couldn't be considered a long term solution.\n\n&gt;2) Why is the same crowd that's so worried about the devastating nature of climate change policy not trumpeting concerns over peak oil?\n\nAnother great question.  I've asked myself that frequently.  In fact, I would argue that we have better science on fossil fuel production and consumption (including economics of supply and demand price elasticity) than we do about the very complex climate system with all of its attendant feedbacks.  (I'm sure others would disagree, but that's fine.)\n\nI think a big part of the disconnect is that peak oil is greatly misunderstood.  I see news reports every week that get it totally wrong.  Peak oil is simply the moment in time when oil production reaches its maximum flow rate.  Some news reports think unconventionals will stave off peak oil for decades, but I really doubt it.  On the other side, you have people claiming that peak oil will cause society to essentially crumble overnight.  Because it is not well understood, or worse, often misrepresented, I think people are averse to looking into it further.  (Sounds a bit like the climate debate, now that I think of it.)",

It also seems like this would also significantly increase the cost and weight of an EV to implement this technology.

Added to that the cost of shutting down roads to implement this or the cost of build entirely new highways, both are ridiculously expensive. This all in all seems like a less effective solution.",

I did like the part at the end:\n\n&gt; In other words, GM is making a $37,500 car that would sell for $20,000 if it wasn’t electric, while Tesla is trying to make a $35,000 car that would sell for $35,000 if it wasn’t electric.\n\nThis is incredibly spot on and, in my opinion, the reason for poor adoption and consumer apathy outside of the Tesla universe. This is also the main reason I haven't purchased an EV yet. I came damn close to getting a Focus Electric a few months back, but I couldn't rectify paying $30K-$40K for what is essentially a $15K-$20K car if only it weren't electric.\n\nI even did the math that if I bought the previous model year pre-owned Ford Focus like my girlfriend did for about $13K I could drive it for almost a decade before the total cost of ownership would equal that of the sticker price of the EV. On the other hand Tesla just screams quality and you know you're getting a car that would sell for that price no matter the drive train. It's just worth it.",

"comment": "I have it from my power company ($49 a month) on my 14kW system. Sucks - but I knew it going in and I am OK with it. It pays for the meter - the meter man (yes he comes to read the new digital meter on solar installs). It also pays for the transformer and the trenching and cabling (I live 1/2 a mile off the main road). I ran the numbers and the Tesla batteries really don't provide any benefit to me even with the $48 bill. Without the solar install my bills would be 350-550 a month (all electric geothermal). So I look at it as a lease payment on a really nice generator. I think I should get props for spending the money and setting the example - but I know I can't beat the system. $600 a year is much better than near $600 a month and the return on my investment was better than the stock market where the money was sitting..",

I can see a great deal of households switching their smaller/commuter cars to Electric in the near future, but the family hauler will likely stay ICE or PHEV until the tech and fast charging infrastructure comes along. This is exactly how EV adoption will be playing out in my own household in the coming years as we live in Texas, we cover great distances along highways with zero charging infrastructure, and I'm not willing to go out of my own way on a 500+mile trip to try and find charging stations that hopefully work or aren't already occupied.\n\nChrysler's coming out with the Pacifica PHEV that has a 30 mile plug in range, and gets in the mid to upper 20mpg on it's gas engine. This is the right formula for our mileage and size needs in a family car, and I'm hoping when our current mule wears out that there are more options similar to this for the family vehicle.\n\nMy corolla on the other hand, will hopefully be replaced by a model 3.",

"comment": "A ton of EV start-ups are Chinese. This makes sense since the government and their private sector understood that it was simply too late to compete with 100 years of refinement re: the champions of the ICE industry. \n\nI've never thought the greatest threat to Tesla would be from the old car companies. They are bogged down with too many legacy issues. A lot of the major future EV companies will be Chinese, and I expect quite a few Western dinosaurs to die out.\n\nAs Marc Tarpenning(co-founder of Tesla) pointed out in a talk a few years ago, for most car companies their primary differentiator is their ICE. All other stuff is usually outsourced, so if you lose your primary competitive differentiator, there is little else that you can really compete on head-on(like interior comfort or whatnot).\n\nEither way, this is great news. While we shower Tesla with much-earned praise, the real showstopper may be the Chinese behemoth steamrolling into EVs.",

"comment": "A Leaf doesn't typically get driven for many hours a day on long journeys. You aren't likely arriving at a location 400 miles away at 11pm at near empty and need to charge overnight in 8 hours to continue your journey even when it is below zero outside. This is common with ICE vehicles and the Model S. You get home from a trip on near empty and you need to head out in 5-6 hours the next morning and go 200 miles. The electric vehicle charging infrastructure that we are spending billions of dollars on should be planned for the vehicles we will have in the next decade, not the vehicles we had in the past decade.\n\nIt is far more wasteful in aggregate to keep putting in 24-30 amp L2 EVSE's and then realize hey, that was too small and replace it. Similarly, L2 DC charging (less than 200 amps) is really expensive for what we get and it will look like a complete waste of money in just 2-3 years. All that money misspent.\n\nTime of use rates typically are 4-6 hours long at super off peak. You can't get even a half charge in 4 hours on a Bolt. 10 kW is the minimum for L2 AC charging for long range BEVs. At 7.2 kW, the Bolt is going to cause even more people to waste money with 32 amp instead of 40 or 48 amp L2 EVSE's. We need hotels and the like to install 10 kW or higher in large quantities. Slow speed L2 AC isn't going to cut it and trying to work around with low speed DC is a very expensive and inconvenient/frustrating way to address the issue.",

"comment": "&gt;.What EVs are there that are actually comparable to ICE counterparts? Between features, interior quality, and performance, most EVs are lacking at least two compared to a similarly-priced ICE.\n\nI meant they don't review equally low end ICE vehicles but they seem to focus mostly on that segment on the market for EVs. The Rimac being the only million dollar hypercar electric car. They featured no other.\n\n&gt;They rarely test concept cars or prototypes, especially after the Furai disaster\n\nBut they DO test prototypes, just not electric because reasons.\n\n&gt;I'm going to go out on a limb and say it was more of Tesla refusing to loan them one.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands on the road since launch. They would have tens of thousands of offers from fans to drive test theirs. Don't tell me that all the cars they ever tested were from the manufacturers directly.\n\n&gt;Again, niche models that are only significant for being EVs.\n\nOh please, one holds the Ring lap record for anything that's not an actual FIA approved race car.\n\n&gt;There's only so many cars they can show.\n\nBut never electric unless it's a Leaf or i3. \n\n&gt;And they do bring in niche EVs like, say, a Tesla Roadster.\n\nThe Roadster is almost 10 years old now. That's how behind the tech they are. Did they even feature the battery upgraded variant? They complained so much about the range and yet they didn't revisit the updated model.\n\n&gt;What's the point of testing it and crashing it? \n\nIdk, what was the point about lying and laughing about EVs for a decade now?\n\n&gt; If they really hated EVs, why not just ignore them altogether? \n\nMy guess would be that their audience doesn't allow them anymore given how fast the technology is improving.\n\n&gt;And why in the world would they deliberately crash a car like that and literally risk dying? It makes no sense.\n\nIt makes perfect sense, the guy didn't die, he basically made the car lose grip. Maybe he didn't think he'd get a knee injury. Eurobeat [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGbg_wbFl5c) was almost audible while he was making the maneuvers.\n\n&gt;And you still haven't addressed my main point. If they hate EVs so much, why would any of them personally go out and buy one with their own money to daily drive?\n\nDid they buy a Rimac Concept_One?",

So purchasing those higher amperage 120V EVSEs may be pointless.\n\nConverting a 120V outlet to 240V, by simply changing out the breaker and outlet is not exactly recommened. As long as you stick with a NEMA 6-15/6-20, you can do it though, just make sure you label the wires properly. You won't be able to install a NEMA 14-50 as it requires 4 higher guage wires.  \n[https://www.doityourself.com/forum/electrical-ac-dc/46593-120v-240v.html](https://www.doityourself.com/forum/electrical-ac-dc/46593-120v-240v.html) (Post #4)",

The instrumentation (or lack thereof) is a fatal flaw for myself on the tesla model 3, I would never buy one due to that...but then I would maybe never buy a model 3 due to the horrible tesla reputation on build quality and the service issues they constantly seem to have anyway.

"comment": "I have no issue with delays as long as they deliver. However, I too would want some access to the press to test and confirm their progress with regards to at least the semi truck. There have been ride alongs for the UTV but not enough to confirm their specs are genuine, I think it was supposed to have a 125 kWh pack or something. \n\nMy criticism is that taking too long to offer the fuel cell products to the market will only give battery electric ones more time to close the range advantage of hydrogen. If it’s feasible now to make up to 1MWh class 8 trucks, in another five years with solid state cells or other advanced battery it should be easy to make a 1.5 MWh or more truck for the same weight as the first generation and given fuel cost difference it will end their case. Even the recently announced pickup, 600 miles is too close to BEV trucks, should have fought to make it on par or longer range than ICE pickup trucks to justify a higher cost of operation.",

Not a \"technical\" issue but one that revolves around money. \n\n If you are possibly thinking about using the \"federal investment tax credit (ITC)\" on a battery system to reduce the overall cost of it, there could be issues with that plan. (This assumes you qualify for ITC in the first place like if you were getting straight solar).\n\n\\*If you weren't planning on using ITC, then ignore everything else below. (Why im saying possible con).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I just want to point out, **im not a tax expert** so I could have something wrong with what im saying. Although this is based off of my personal experience.)\n\nAs far as I understand, to qualify for ITC, any energy storage system (battery) must be charged with \"onsite renewable energy\" (like solar). A standalone battery system would not qualify as its primary recharge method would be from the grid (or a generator).\n\nTo qualify, it would have to be solar+battery installed at the same time or solar first, then battery. \n\n(Option 2 (solar, then battery) is what I did. Installed solar in 2020, installed battery system in 2021, got ITC for both. Although you may or may not get the same experience I got. A tax expert is recommend to sort this out as there could be some caveats for you with option 2 I would not be aware of.)\n\nNow, I have no idea if you can apply ITC to a pre-existing storage system once solar is installed but I'm going to assume not. (Haven't heard of anyone achieving it before so I'd be surprised if you could do it.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo financially speaking, if you're trying to get the most credits out of your system (as I understand it), then you don't want to install battery first.\n\nInstall solar, then battery or install both at the same time.",

Most people seem to buy cars based on emotions.\n\nEVs are generally more expensive to purchase, although that difference is narrowing.\n\nPlease don't forget that an EV requires virtually no maintenance - no oil changes, tune-ups, fuel and air filters, exhaust systems, etc. That is not only savings in money, but also time and hassle. As a mechanic, you know about that!\n\nAlso, the more miles you drive, the more you will save in fuel. I did the math and my fuel costs are equivalent to gasoline at $0.87 / gallon. At the USA national average electricity price, that goes up to about $1.30 / gallon - still pretty attractive.\n\nFinally, the experience of driving an EV is pretty dope. They are smooth, quiet, and powerful as hell. That is worth something also.",

"comment": "which makes zero sense long term. alot of this is going to have some bad backlash in 10 years.  unlike evs which actually save money unsubsidized or battery storage.  people need cars either way, battery storage is printing money like mad for tesla,  but putting this stuff on consumner asphalt roofs is just not smart.  always got a laugh out of the subsidies which capped at 100kw or similar depending on state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni did 36kw on my warehouse metal roof and 14kw at my house on the ground and i swear the inspectors were all just braindead.  trying to do the 120% 2x in a row for continuous load turning a 42A inverter into a 70 amp breaker somehow , having no idea what rapid shut down was on and on.  knew less than a 20 something after reading a few pages of manuals.  getting told a 200 amp continuous meter can good for 240 peak as explained by the damn manufacturer was only good for 200 for example.  when 320/400 meter cans are a thing.  (everything has a continuous &lt;3hr peak rating).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe 20% rule in itself is made for absolute idiots.\n\nyou can do 120% worth of solar, inputs would simply cancel across the bus bars not add if supplied from opposite ends.  but the rule is in case some stupid customer takes the breaker off that position and puts it in DEAD TOP.  No provision for security fastener etc to permanently fix the breaker at bottom etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nall the work has really been done by the engineers by the time anyone opens the box.  either you have the wires wrong and it trips, or you dont torque them enough and it arcs (they all have arc faultnowadays)  or it works fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy city requires installers to have a master electrician on PAYROLL to wire a pathetic 30 amp inverter to disconnect to a meter &gt;&gt; like having a dentist sitting around to do a cleaning or a surgeon giving out vaccines.",

They don't license it and never wanted to license it. It's such a weird conversation, the reason it's not a standard isn't because the world fought a proprietary protocol.  It's not a standard because they didn't let anybody use it.  \n\nThe Lightning analogy is also a bad one because of the timing, the other standards are contemporary to Tesla's own.  CCS is older than Tesla standardizing their own connectors.  It would be like if Apple chose Lightning over USB-C in 2015.",

The average of kWh is $0.36 so while this is not cheap, it is doable. And we live in an expensive area (northern California)\nWith a non-Tesla the story looks quite different. Fast charging for non-Tesla are not so common and very unreliable.\nSo in summary - with Tesla YES, with non-Tesla NO (except if it is a PhEV - again different story)",

It's like entering a cheat code on an old Nintendo where you first have to turn on the ability to turn on cruise, then you turn on cruise and then you adjust the speed.  It's the first step I have to search for every time because they purposefully put it in an out of the way spot you won't easily hit.\n\nTake my [QX60 for example](https://cars.usnews.com/static/images/Auto/izmo/i159614463/2020_infiniti_qx60_steeringwheel.jpg).  Which buttons do you use to turn on cruise and set it to 75mph? Use the image I supplied so you can't read the labels.  Good luck.  This is one of the best button layouts of any of the cars I've ever owned as they are all different shapes and locations but still random.\n\nFor a Tesla you just pull down the right stalk once and set the speed with the right scroll wheel on the steering wheel.  No need to turn on the option to turn on the option to turn on cruise.",

They lost money on every sale and while they were profitable on sales last year they have that little problem in that they still need to pay to run the company. Their SG&A is another 200m that they need to earn from sales and other activities which most companies rely on profit from their vehicles to do. Companies can and do make it up from their lending arms but that is not something I see Polestar having.  \n  \nSo yeah, they aren't quite burning money like Rivian which is playing with a bonfire but they are closing in on a billion a year to run the company that is not being supported by their sales.\n  \nLike Rivian they have some very compelling products but I am really curious if long term they can stand on their own. \n   \n[Simplest numbers to understand](https://i.imgur.com/sAGh9sA.png)",

I know the person who brought me into the industry never gave a second thought as to how a lag screw might impact the structural integrity of the rafter. Not just the pull force (dynamic load) but how that rafter might torque laterally, particularly if that lag screw was not dead center.\n\nI am wondering if it might be safer to do many distributed penetrations into the decking vs less distributed penetrations into the rafter.\n\nMight going into the rafter a symptom of solar installers being afraid of roof leaks, thereby trying to reduce the number of penetrations?",

Now your topped-off battery needs to provide 4 hours of additional power.\n\n35 watts * 4 hrs = 140 watt-hrs\n\nSo you would need a battery that can safely provide 140 watt-hrs of power. But then your inverter will sap a few percentages in efficiency, and you should toss in some additional safety factor. Maybe aim for a minimum of 200-250 watt-hrs. Which is still not much.\n\nMost solar charge controllers are intended for 12volt battery systems, so you'll need a 12volt DC -&gt; 110volt AC power inverter. You also need to appropriately size your solar charge controller. You have a 100 watt panel feeding a 12v battery.\n\nWatts = volts * amps\n\n100w = 12v * amps\n\n100w / 12v = 8.3 amps\n\nSo get a solar inverter of at least 10 amps (safety factor!). I like the Morningstar Sunsaver series, but there are probably smaller ones out there. Get one with MPPT (google it) for the most optimized charging.\n\nAnd get fuses. Lots of fuses.\n\n(edit to add some stuff)",

If you pay this much, chances are there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that saves more money and requires fewer investments, like say insulation or ditching old inefficient washing machines or ditching an electric heater if you have any of that.\n\n2) no you'll need way more. 5 kWh/m2/day are very likely to be solar insolation average figures for your location. But solar panels only capture about 18% or so of the energy of the sun.",

"comment": "Let's assume the Tesla Power Wall costs $3,500 installed for 7kwh and 3.5kW of power.\n\nLet's we assume a generous feed-in vs. TOU rate differential of $0.20/kwh, for five months a year, on weekdays. Let's assume a $.10/kwh differential during all other times. We're assuming the solar array is perfectly sized to take full advantage of the powerwall and the growing duck curve doesn't devalue daytime demand electricity so much, so it's safe to assume this is the maximum effective rate of the powerwall per kwh.\n\n$0.20/kwh x 5/7 x 5/12 + $0.10/kwh x 2/7 x 5/12 + $0.10/kwh x 7/12 = $0.13/kwh max. eff.\n\n7 kwh x $0.13/kwh/day = $0.60/day.\n\n$3,500 / 365 / $0.60 = 16 year unsubsidized payback.\n\n\n\nNOW, let's assume you are a commercial customer being charged $15/kW each month as a demand charge. Let's assume the Tesla powerwall can load level 3kW of demand each month off of your bill.\n\n$15/month x 3kW = $45/month.\n\n$3,500 / 12/ 45 = 6.5 year unsubsidized payback.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Residential grid-connected battery storage will not be cost-effective market until most businesses have installed battery banks on their buildings for commercial load-leveling.\n\n\n\nNow, residential rate-structures could shift to demand-based structures, which would balance the adoption rate of batteries between residential and commercial users. But revenue loss from batteries will likely cause utilities to move AWAY from demand charges and towards FIXED FLAT RATES for residential electric usage, similar to your cell phone bill. This will keep the focus on batteries towards the commercial market (whose demand curves amongst different commercial users vary more greatly than residential demand curves).\n\nBatteries will remain a luxury market for residential energy users for some time, probably a decade.",

"comment": "I believe this is the primary purpose of the powerwall: enable solar in areas without net metering.\n\nIn the US, the areas with good net metering programs are reaching 5% market penetration.  The grid cannot absorb any more electricity during the day.  It seems that 5% is a somewhat natural limit for a grid with good net metering.  So those programs are ending.  To continue the growth of rooftop solar, it is necessary for homes to have their own local storage.  This is the purpose of the powerwall.  Good luck getting one!",

But even individual progress is difficult when I can turn around and there's a moron driving a jacked up 4x4 truck, that's never done of day of work in it's life, that's also been modified to \"roll coal\".

There's residential batteries available and their lifespan will be exceptional if only cycled during emergencies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind the wattage of the appliances you want backed up and multiply that by the number of hours you want backup for. That's the amount of energy you need in Watt-hours (Wh) from your energy storage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can charge these batteries with either utility grid power or with a small solar system. Depending on the setup you're looking for, you will/may need a backup loads panel (in addition to your existing main service panel), a manual or automatic transfer switch, and some mixture of DC charge controller, battery inverter, solar inverter, or hybrid solar + battery inverter (this is a somewhat in-depth discussion about AC or DC coupling).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's continue to discuss!

But if you are in the hook for long term maintenance then find better financing terms.  You will still be eligible for the ITC.  \n\nFor sure, cancel that contract before you cannot, and get some more quotes.

In Australia you would pay admit $6k for a system that size.  The trick would be to get enough batteries to store the power and use later... I guess that would add about $30k for 30kwh of storage to the price.  Not yet viable but it's getting there.",

A \"PowerUser\" option should be available)  \n\n(Oh, when I was designing my system with the install, I had originally wanted the Powerwall 2, but they were backordered everywhere and LG had batteries in stock, so I went with that system.  I think the Powerwall 2s are more available now, but I've heard that Tesla is requiring people to purchase a minimum of 2 Powerwalls these days, so that would have priced me out, not to mention, I'd rarely generate enough electricity to charge both of them in a day!)",

However here are some more serious:\n\n3) Our kids are lied to and frightened with scary stupid stories about climate apocalypse\n\n4) The scientific community lost credibility and are acting as puppets in the hands of corrupt politicians\n\n5) The politicians are using climate change to divert from real problems and to reach their selfish goals.\n\n6) It's not sure at all that the world will be healthier and better. For example more CO2 is already proven to be better for the Earth: https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2436/co2-is-making-earth-greenerfor-now/\n\n7) Renewable energy for large scale is not realistic and actually hinders efforts to develop good energy sources. Nuclear plant investments almost stopped because require political support and politicians don't want to be seen as anti-green. For an example of how much solar power we need and what numbers we are talking about for the large scale, a recent post in this forum provided this link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2019/09/30/net-zero-carbon-dioxide-emissions-by-2050-requires-a-new-nuclear-power-plant-every-day/#b26823035f7e",

"comment": "On both counts, your HOA may have grounds. [Davis-Stirling](https://www.davis-stirling.com/HOME/Solar-Energy-Systems) allows HOAs to impose *reasonable* restrictions, an example of which would be aesthetic reasons provided it doesn’t decrease efficiency more than 10% or cost more than $1,000.\n\nAs for signing a covenant, yes this is also reasonable. Your HOA may have similar restrictions for modifications to roofs, such as skylights and sun tunnels. This makes it clear to you, the current owner, and subsequent owners that any expenses arising from maintenance to the roof caused by the solar panels is at the owner’s expense.\n\nIANAL, but you could be on the losing end for simply bypassing your HOA’s architectural change process.\n\nIn any case, I wouldn’t be too worried about this. Talk to your installer and let them know the situation — maybe they can split the cost of adjustment with you? I’m surprised they didn’t get in writing that you *didn’t* need HOA approval. Sometimes the city permit alone requires this.\n\nAs for the covenant, depending on how your HOA wants it, you may have to pay a fee to record this document with the county registrar. From that point on, this “runs with the land” and future owners will need to be informed about this (unless you opt to remove the solar panels before sale). Or it could be as simple as a promissory note saying:\n\n&gt;\tI promise to pay, at my own expense, for removal and reinstallation of solar panels if the roof needs to be worked on; if the roof is damaged because of the panels, I shall pay for it; if I need the panels serviced, the HOA is not expected to pay for it”",

"comment": "Yes you can do this.  Currently I am building and wiring my own house and already have installed the solar as my main power with batteries for night time.  A Hybrid Off Grid Invertor feeds the power into my breaker box everything is wired exactly the same as if I were just using an on grid system.\n\nWhen my house is completed I will get a grid supply with it's own separate breaker box, this will then be connected my inverter's A/C Input (NOT THE MAIN HOUSE BREAKER BOX) and I can set to the inverter to use this power if the batteries get low at night or assist the solar power on a cloudy day.\n\nI will only have one other fused socket outlet connected only to the grid breaker box and paint it red, this would be for emergency use in the event the inverter fails so I can keep the fridge running and some led work lights running.\n\nDepending on my off-grid solar experience I may keep everything as it is, expand out the system or install and interlock between the grid power, inverter and main breaker box then I can switch between solar and grid power for the whole house if the anything goes wrong with the solar.\n\nI hope that wasn't too confusing but essentially you wire your house for lights and power sockets normally.  When you are ready for solar you have a few options of how it can be connected up but you don't need to worry about that yet.",

"comment": "It would depend on the type of panel and the chemicals. Ammonia is a big consideration because farms are a big market.\n\nThere has probably been research done on other chemicals but I haven't read any. I think that it would be wiser to look at how your chemicals react with the outer components of the panels you intend to use. \n\nSo, solar panels usually have these outer materials that are exposed:\n\n* Frame - Usually aluminium \n* Glass - Shouldn't react much\n* Backsheet - Usually a combination of polymers \n* Junction box - Usually polyphenylene oxide\n* Cables - Usually polyvinyl chloride\n\nDepending on the chemicals (I'm not a chemist) I'd say that the biggest risk (that you can do anything about) would be the backsheet. You can eliminate this by going with glass-glass modules, which have glass on the back instead of polymers.",

"comment": "I am not sure where you got the idea that Ontario pays anybody X amount of dollars regardless of whether they produce or not. In consulting with my Solar guy he stated he heard about some generous payments about 15 years ago but definitely not today.\n\nI am out West but at this point Edmonton is the only place in Canada that is offering a subsidy which works out to 20% on their bill.  There has been some federal $$$ for businesses that could do anything from insulating to changing their windows to renewable energy. This was $$$$ taken from the Carbon tax. In terms of putting a dent in your cash outlay smaller purchases made more sense.\n\nLet's take Manitoba. There newest project from the North cost the taxpayer $24 kwh after cost over runs and permits and money to go through native lands. Not to mention the cost and poor reliability of running long transmission lines. Of course this made more sense than the cost of $1 kwh in subsidy for anyone interested in Solar according to the Govt.\n\nHis best year in Manitoba he paid $75k in  PST , 188k in upgrading Manitoba old systems for Solar, then $200 k in permits. Also the fact that having customers in rural areas actually adds to the strength of the community power along with employing tax paying individuals. \n\nBC is the only one offering net metering so if you want to talk about a scam how about provinces giving a credit to Solar owners based on power rates in the middle of the night or the absolute lowest rate plus the fact that you still pay a power Company even if you produce far more than you use in a year.\n\nYou dont seem to be very aware that the 2nd largest factory in the US is run completely by Solar and batteries. Many of us around here after spending premium dollars on getting reverse osmosis spring water have no problem digging into our pockets for a combo of Solar Wind and batteries. Interesting looking at the Solar project in Minnesota with a Sulphur batteries and other places with zinc batteries offering thousands of kw hours storage. \n\nHe stated the biggest jump in technology and innovation has been in battery storage just in the last 3 years. Storage keeps going up and battery prices keep dropping. Another benefit is the use of renewables as a backup for unreliable power right now. Ironic as I write this as I got a call from a buddy a few miles from me who left his place due to another power failure. That is 2 power failures in less than a week here. \n\nMy Solar buddy hasn't been wrong about where this Industry is going and he feels battery storage will be extremely affordable in 3 years. Right now without any help from subsidies the break even point is 12 years out on a Solar system in Sask. His system on his new house in unfriendly Manitoba is 7 years based on his costs. His biggest mkt is soon to be retirees or the retirement crowd who only see the price of power going up.\n\nAfter many years in the Industry Roots Rock Solar closed its doors in Sk on Thursday and thanked the Sk govt for being closed off to any solutions and taking the Solar Industry back 10 years. Meanwhile take note of the Countries that are leading in Solar. Then again SK likes to lag behind on many fronts.",

"comment": "Congrats on your new home!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;So how does it all work?\n\nThat'll depend on what you mean by \"how it works\". \n\nHow a solar panel converts sunlight into electricity or How it's connected to your (new) house electrical? What's the different parts of the system and what do they each do? \n\nMaybe it's all the above! \n\nSo many things could be talked about with this part of the question alone.  🤣\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Maintenance?\n\nThere is very little maintenance with a solar system. It is for the most part, a set and forget system.\n\n  The **most** you \"might\" have to do for your solar panels is to clean them once or twice a year to remove dust, pollen, or ash depending on where you live and how often you get some good rain. \n\nIf you get a good amount of rain from a single storm every month or 2, you probably wont have to clean at all. If you enter a dry spell for a couple of months and notice your overall solar production going down (this would be gradual and my not be noticeable right away), check your panels and see if they're dirty and need to be clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bigger thing instead of maintenance is monitoring.  This is just to make sure things are operating as they should. At least this a quick 1min to 10min check with the monitoring app or a web page to see how things are going.\n\nOther people here like u/displaced_lemon already mention about how you should be able to get solar monitoring so I wont repeat that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Longevity?\n\nGenerally, for most solar panels and inverters, they \"should\" last 15 to 30 years. Some of the crappy stuff might last 10 years but the good stuff should last 25+ years.\n\nAka, if the solar system was installed fairly recently (last 5 years or so), then you shouldn't have to worry about replacing anything, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Does it all depend on where I live (Illinois)?\n\nWhen it comes to Maintenance &amp; Longevity, for the most part no.",

"comment": "If you don't have black outs very often and have net metering through your utility company, battery backup is a fatty waste of money.  Just think of it like this, is having a battery just sitting there for 1 blackout a year for 2 hours really worth doubling the price of your system?\n\nHowever, there are some benefits like if you really want to run off battery backup at night instead of pull from the grid because it could be cheaper.  Or if you're a super environmentalist and want to be able to say that all the energy you're using is straight from the sun, then running off your stored energy allows you to say this.  Instead of pulling energy from the grid and using your credits.",

I’m not intimately knowledgeable about the complexities of the Australian grid, but I am about the Californian grid, the CPUC, and energy policy. And I have read the entire NEM 3 policy several times, all 204 pages. \n\nYou are correct. Change is needed to NEM in order to keep pricing low enough for power to encourage electrification of homes, businesses, and transportation. But the current NEM 3 policy has zero value towards meeting those goals and is entirely a utility profit grab from top to bottom with the solar tax, punitive measures against those who don’t have their own lobbyists (homeowners), royally screws renters, and does nothing to incentivize battery storage. CA rate plans are filled with cost shifts, including for solar but it is by no means the largest cost shift. If better equality and avoiding cost shifts was the goal, we need a top to bottom restructuring of our rates.",

"comment": "Cost has little to do with a company cutting vehicle prices.  Price is primarily set by supply and demand.  Price cuts come when supply is exceeding demand and the company is stuck holding onto unsold inventory.\n\nGlobal vehicle supply from all OEMs has increased in the past 6 months, as has Tesla's own production output.  Without cutting prices, Tesla would have built up a huge inventory of unsold vehicles.  Unlike other OEMs who offload inventory to their partner dealerships, removing the costs from their books, Tesla doesn't utilize dealerships, so unsold inventory stays on their books.  They seem to err on overreaction in price cuts to ensure they maximize sales.  Even then, they don't seem to have any backlog built up on any of their models anymore.  Every single model / trim in the US has an estimated delivery of April... and we're already two weeks into the month.\n\n(there do seem to be some \"dealerships\" in European and Asian countries that are buying Teslas to keep on their lots, but those dealerships would likely be buying the cars at MSRP)\n\nOver the last 4 quarters, Tesla has added around 70k-75k vehicles to inventory globally, with most of that coming in the last 3 quarters.  Had they not drastically cut prices, that inventory could have easily risen to over 125k.  50k additional cars in inventory at $45k ASP is $2.25 billion of unsold inventory.It's not chump change.\n\nAnother sign of lacking vehicle demand is that they've recently shifted a lot of cells from their high margin vehicle production to their lower margin battery storage production to avoid building cell inventory from their enormous cell orders.  Holding vehicle inventory AND cell inventory would show they're also throttling vehicle production but still building up valuable inventory, which would be very bad for their books.",

They lack the necessary inverter for that purpose.\n\nTesla has a rationale for not supporting V2H in that a stationary battery and inverter system makes much more sense for that use case, and this is the roll of their PowerWall units. I agree, though V2H might have edge cases where it may be useful (it’s certainly cheaper if you already own the car).\n\nThey don’t really have a good rationale for not supporting V2L, especially in the Cybertruck where it would be expected as standard like it is in other EV light trucks. It really should be an option for the Model Y as it is increasingly common as an option in SUVs and crossovers. There are many use cases for V2L.",

Remember that an off grid setup will require a power room with ample space for batteries, inverters, disconnects. It would be advantageous to have this room on the south side of the building to save wire and conduit out to the array. Bury a conduit from this power room out to the center of the array. Make it a 1.5\" conduit and you will never have to redo it no matter what voltage/amperage the array ends up being. Find out what the utility is gonna charge to hook up power... in many cases this is more than the cost of an Off-grid system with generator backup....\n\nIf you are on-grid you can save a lot of trouble by putting the whole house feeders on a 200A ASCO transfer switch.

I didn’t see a higher insurance cost home or auto and other than $1500 electrician cost have Level 2 charger in my garage.  EA pricing right now is $0.48/KWh. I have 30 minute free charge a day from EA from my EV manufacturer. I’ve heard people’s EV batteries lasting >10 years.

As we have spoken about this matter before, I want to personally acknowledge your frustrations and sincerely apologize for the continued difficulties you’ve experienced with your solar system and Tesla Powerwall. We take this situation seriously and deeply regret the impact it has had on you and your family.\n\nI understand that the issues with your system, especially following the storm in August 2023, have caused significant stress. The failure of the system during a prolonged outage and the resulting damage to your refrigerator are certainly not acceptable, and I completely understand your frustration with the delays in getting the system repaired. While we have been working diligently with Tesla, the manufacturer of the Powerwall, to resolve these issues, I recognize that the process has taken far longer than either of us would like.\n\nWe have spoken in the past about the need to work through Tesla due to the nature of the Powerwall product, and while this limits some of our direct control over repairs, I assure you that we have been pushing for a resolution at every step. Spencer from our team has confirmed an upcoming joint evaluation with Tesla, and we are committed to following through on this and ensuring your system is fully operational as soon as possible.\n\nI deeply regret that this situation has persisted for so long and appreciate your patience and communication throughout this process. We remain committed to resolving this matter and will continue to keep you updated as we move forward.\n\nThank you for allowing us the opportunity to make this right.",

It does require water\n\nIt doesn't matter how much water it uses, what matters is that it loses productivity in a drought\n\n>but not nearly as much as something like hydroelectric, tidal, or geothermal.\n\nTidal doesn't matter because it's on the ocean but Geothermal definitely doesn't have to worry about water.\n\nGeothermal systems take subterranean water and draw it up to the surface, so they won't run out of water until Earth is geologically dead.\n\n>Solar and wind do not produce consistent power 24 hrs a day regardless of how their configured, and we do not have the tech to efficiently store and distribute power from sunny/windy areas to non ideal areas.\n\nYou can put wind turbines and solar panels anywhere in the world for electricity generation and it would be more economical than a nuclear reactor.\n\n>The life of the system does matter because you will have to replace solar and wind many times over the life of a nuclear plant. Solar and wind are only good for about 20 years before you start seeing big drops in power generation.\n\nAfter 20 years you would see a drop to 80% efficiency with solar panels. We can do some basic math to figure this out.\n\nYou can generate 7 times as much electricity with solar for the same cost as nuclear.\n\nSo you generate 140 years worth of a nuclear reactor in 20 years for the same cost.\n\n>Nuclear plants can run for up to 100 years with no drop off in power.\n\nYou're right. I forgot about all of those 100 year old nuclear reactors in Simcity.\n\nIn the real world Nuclear Reactors last for about 20 years between overhauls because that is how long until nuclear embrittlement takes to make it unsafe to operate. The second biggest problem with France's nuclear fleet is that they were planning to retire the reactors en masse and so then they had to shut down 2/3rds of their fleet to refurbish them to extend their lifespan past 40 years.\n\n>What's your cost/kwh look like amortized over 100 years when you have had to fully replace your solar/wind grid 5 times over.\n\nRunning a nuclear reactor on its own costs more than the lifecycle cost of wind and solar.\n\n>Nuclear is a large up front expense that drives the high cost/KWH, but the maintenance cost after that investment is substantially lower than a comparable wind/solar system.\n\nWind and Solar have no maintenance cost. \n\n>You will also need something to provide power at night or on less windy days, so even with wind and solar, you will need some kind of auxiliary power system.\n\nEnergy storage.",

However, I know some vegans who like the smell and miss meat.  I know even more vegetarians who still crave meat quite a bit.\n\n&gt;Do you get enough protein?\n\nThat depends on what you define as enough.  I exercise regularly and have not had any problems.  I give blood every 6 weeks without issue (even though that's more of an iron issue than protein).  I have had regular checkups and my doctor says my health is tip-top.  \n\nI have been eating a lot of quinoa lately, which has a lot of protein.  Otherwise, I eat plenty of nuts, seeds, beans, tofu and tempeh.\n\n&gt;Do you wear deodorant?\n\nYup.",

"comment": "&gt;Even if organic farming would be good, a vegan society shouldn't support it, because it is not conceptually related to veganism.  \n  \nYour logic seems to fail.  For one thing, your definition of Veganism is too narrow.  I see what you are doing, you are defending a very strict, narrow definition for Veganism, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out into the future.  I envision Veganism encompassing and embracing Organic foods, as it already appears to be doing so more and more all the time.  Logically, your argument doesn't hold up.  Even if you think that organic farming is not \"conceptually related\" to Veganism (which I disagree with), that doesn't mean that a \"Vegan society shouldn't support it\".  Whereas you see a conflict, I see two mutually beneficial/married concepts, which go hand in hand.  Whereas I see you are trying to separate these two into being distinct and separate ideas, I'm working towards the opposite.  I'd like to see more organic foodies become Vegans and I'd like to see organic foods become more Vegan friendly, essentially, the merger of the best of both of these worlds.  We can take all of the benefits of both and combine them together.  Doesn't that seem worthwhile to you?  \n  \n&gt;it drives away some vegans  \n  \nI disagree.  I don't see how supporting organic farming would drive away any Vegans.  Because of the fertilizer?  Get real!  \n  \n&gt;but doesn't really attract new vegans to the society.  \n  \nYou are very much mistaken, because before I was a Vegan, I ate primarily organic foods, as much as possible.  Now that I'm a Vegan, I still go for the organic stuff.  And I know a lot of people who are interested in organic foods who would easily be swayed to Veganism.  The idea being that getting people to think very carefully about their food will ultimately lead them to becoming Vegans.  At least that's what happened with me.  So that's my story and I'm sticking to it!",

I get it. \n\nBut if I were an omnivore, and I was picking up groceries in the couple hours I have before I have to go pick up my kid from soccer practice, and I come over and see these vegan fanatics hosting a eulogy for some ham, I'd probably just get annoyed. I dont care in this  moment, I'm just trying to live my life. These ass holes are telling me to live mine, and that's so not cool. So fuck all vegans. There're all self absorbed high and mighty hippies who's only purpose is to bitch about an industries that are probably not all that bad to begin with. Then I'd leave with a sour taste in my mouth for anyone preaching veganism. I'd then pick up my 6 year old daughter from soccer, and vent to her, and she would also be like \"fuck vegans\". Then the cycle would continue, one generation to the next.\n\nI just don't think this would be the right way to get someone's attention. There are, in my opinion, better, less aggressive ways to make someone vegan. I'd rather make no impact than a negative one that would turn of the average shopper.\n\nAlso, I've never met a vegan who's become vegan by strangers preaching to them in a grocery store. Just saying.",

I eat the eggs when they lay them.\" and people jump down your throat because well suddenly, CLEARLY, you are ABUSING THOSE POOR ANIMALS BY NOT LETTING THEM EAT THEIR OWN EGG. *IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THIS CHICKEN EAT ITS OWN EGG.* ...really?\n\nThey forget--or just don't see/understand that chickens (or any animal, really) kept as pets are not living the lifestyle of wild chickens. Their diet is nutritionally complete. Animals in the wild will also eat their newborn babies to reabsorb all the nutrition they spent making them too, are you being cruel in stopping that?",

"comment": "Alright, alright.\n\n**Braised potatoes**\nThis recipe is NOT healthy but it is super easy to make and is incredibly delicious. It’s a good side with some greens or carrots and/or burgers. \n\n* 2-3 big potatoes per person\n* ½ onion per person\n* Oil for frying (use an oil that can be heated well and does not have a strong taste, canola or sunflower are fine)\n* Salt, pepper to taste\n* Paprika spice to taste (optional)\n\nPeel potatoes, then wash them and cut into very thin slices.\n \nPeel onions, then cut into half rings, about 3mm thick.\n\nHeat a good amount of oil in a large pan (that you also have a lid for). When the oil is hot (you can test this by splashing a few drops of water in the oil, if it sizzles, the oil is ready!), add the potatoes and fry until they turn light golden brown. Add the onions and fry until everything has a good colour. \n\nTurn the heat down to low and put a lid on the pan. Cook, until potatoes are soft. \n\nSeason with salt and pepper. You can also add some paprika if you like, it tastes good and will add some colour.\n\n**Easy “Honey”-mustard vinaigrette**\n\n* 1.5 tsp vegan mustard (there’s vinegar in mustard that might not be vegan)\n* 1 tsp vegetable stock powder\n* 1.5 tsp agave syrup\n* 1 tsp vegan white balsamic vinegar\n* 2 tsp olive oil\n* Water as needed\n* Salt, pepper to taste\n\nWhisk together everything apart from water, salt and pepper. It should form a paste. Add water, until the vinaigrette has a consistency you like. Then add salt and pepper to taste. This usually works for an amount of salad that serves as a side for 4 people.\n\n\n\n[**“Snickers” cake**](http://imgur.com/cEEfBuf)\nA good way to make this cake is to prepare the cake and the icing separately the night before you need it, then just combine them the next day. The icing should be kept in the fridge, however, to be able to spread it on the cake more easily, you might want to use it at room temperature. Just take it out of the fridge an hour before using it.\n\nBatter:\n\n* 2 tbsp vegan margarine (sometimes they add “vitamin D”, which they take from wool)\n* 250g sugar\n* Pinch of salt\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 1 tbsp caramel syrup (optional)\n* 300g plain flour\n* 100g corn or wheat starch (makes the dough lighter and fluffier but can be substituted with plain flour)\n* 1.5 packets/ 2 tbsp baking powder \n* About 500ml plant based milk or water (you can even use 100ml soda and around 400ml plain water to make the cake even “spongier”)\n* 50g cocoa powder\n\nPreheat oven to 200°C (180°C if using fan).\n\nCombine margarine, salt, sugar, vanilla extract and caramel syrup and whisk until the sugar has dissolved (i.e. the mixture isn’t grainy anymore).\n \nAdd flour and starch and baking powder, then roughly combine. \n\nAdd the liquid of your choice around 50ml at a time while slowly whisking – this will prevent lumps of flour in the batter. Keep the last 50ml of liquid. \n\nTake roughly half the batter and fill into a greased cake pan (26-32cm diameter).\n\nAdd cocoa powder to the remaining half and mix, then slowly add the last 50ml of liquid. Carefully pour the chocolate batter into the pan, to prevent it “pushing away” the plain batter. Use a fork to swirl the dough. Don’t overdo it, though, otherwise the batters will mix and turn out to be light brown instead of marbled.\n\nBake for around 45min. To see if your cake is done, take a toothpick or thin knife and stick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is cooked.\nLet cool completely, otherwise the icing will just melt when you put it on.\n\nIcing:\n\n* 3 big tbsp smooth peanut butter\n* 2 big tbsp vegan butter or margarine (Vegan butter is not as soft as margarine, which makes the icing be more solid), room temperature!\n* 100g sifted icing sugar \n* \nCombine everything and whisk until smooth and creamy. Spread onto the cooled down cake.\nYou can decorate the cake with caramelized peanuts or caramel or chocolate sauce (or everything together).\n\n**Sheesecake**\nThis recipe can be combined with all sorts of fruit as well! Just take the fruit of your choice and place them on top of the sheese filling. You can use canned or frozen fruit as well, just make sure to thaw and strain them well to avoid watering down your cake.\n\nPastry:\n\n* 175g sugar\n* 175g vegan margarine or butter, cold!\n* 250g plain flour\n* Pinch of salt\n* Dash of water\n\nPreheat oven to 200°C (180°C if using fan).\n\nCombine all ingredients but water in a bowl and knead with your hands until the pastry starts sticking together. If needed, add water. \n\nMake a “ball”, cover with seran wrap and leave in the fridge for at least 30min. This allows the sugar to dissolve and the pastry will be nice and smooth. It also makes it easier to work with.\n\nEither roll out pastry to 0.5cm between layers of seran wrap, then transfer to a greased cake pan (26cm-32cm diameter). If you can’t be bothered, just use your hands to flatten out the dough inside the pan. Be sure to cover the sides as well and not leave any holes! Otherwise, your sheese filling will escape.\n\nIf you want the pastry to be super crisp, blind bake it first: Use a fork to make a few holes in the bottom of the pastry, then cover with a baking sheet and fill with dried beans or lentils. Bake for 10 min, remove the beans, bake for another 10min. You cannot use the beans for cooking anymore, after you’ve baked them, as they will taste burned. But you can reuse them for blind baking as often as you like!\nDon’t worry, if you don’t want to blind bake. The pastry will still cook just fine if you bake it with the filling straight away.\n\nFilling:\n\n* 1500g soy yoghurt, put in a strainer lined with cheesecloth or two layers of paper towels overnight (This will leave you with a super creamy texture that’s amazing to work with!)\n* ALTERNATIVELY: 1000g soy yoghurt, non-strained and 4 tbsp semolina (the fine kind, not the one you use for pasta dough)\n* 2-3 tbsp lemon juice\n* 1tsp vanilla extract \n* 5 tbsp corn or wheat starch\n* Sugar to taste (roughly 100g, I think)\n\nCombine all ingredients in a bowl and whisk together. You can adjust sweetness and the lemon according to your taste.\n\nTransfer into the pastry-lined cake pan. \n\nBake for around 45min, until the cake is golden-brown on top and only very slightly wobbles in the middle when you shake it. Let it cool down before taking it out of the pan and serving it.",

"comment": "&gt;This sub largely supports capitalism I personally rarely see any mention of communism or socialism\n\nLet's just say that we have *wildly* different experiences of this sub then.  Because shitting on capitalism (\"no ethical consumption under capitalism\") might as well be the subtitle of the sub given what I see on here on the regular.  Pro-socialist, pro-anarchist, pro-communist stuff is everywhere in the comment sections.  While being anti-military might not be a political position on it's own necessarily, it's usually a very left wing position, and is basically always that on this sub. \n\n&gt;Can you show me what you mean by using this place as a platform for politics?\n\nYeah, people get on their soapboxes in the comment section.  The comments are almost never restricted to veganism, or the question being asked. [How about the dickheads being upvoted here for shitting on someone in the military asking a question about getting vegan food on deployment](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/qmknax/comment/hjbh0br/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  One example of the usual behaviours I see here. \n\nWe must just read different posts, or logon at different times and see comment sections in different states or whatever,  because our experiences seem to be essentially the opposite of each other.  Guess we'll probably end up agreeing to disagree eventually, we've both had the experiences we've had here, and the other person isn't going to change that!",

"comment": "Veganism is a set of practices. It's just not consuming animal products within your capability. Some people do it for the animals, some people do it for the environment, some people do it for their own health. *Why* you do it is less important than *what* you do.\n\nI think the important distinction, though, is that it's based in evidence. We can all observe, with our own eyes, that animals have the capacity to suffer, and that they don't want to die. We can calculate the effect, in physical measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and sewage waste, that animal agriculture has on the environment. We can find studies that will show the health benefits that a vegan diet can provide. It's not a question of whether you believe these things are true, because they're observably true. It's a question of whether you believe these things are more important than some amount of personal pleasure.\n\nReligious beliefs generally aren't evidence-based or observable. They tend to involve a holy text, beliefs regarding the origin of humans and/or the world, beliefs regarding the afterlife, and often proscribe a set of rituals or ceremonies.\n\nYou can't demonstrate to me that animals were put here for humans to consume, just like I can't demonstrate that they weren't. You can't demonstrate to me that there's such thing as a god, just like I can't demonstrate that there isn't. I *can* demonstrate that animals experience suffering when treated cruelly.\n\nEdit: Willing to switch to messages if you prefer.",

"comment": "There's a lot to unpack in your comment, so I'm going to respond to some statements that stood out. Thanks for sharing your perspective! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If I were to give animals the exact same consideration as humans, I'd have to advocate against the concept of even owning them as pets.\n\nI don't think most vegans believe that animals are the exact same as humans. There are obvious differences, and I don't think most people are advocating that animals can vote, own property, and other things that we associate with human rights. But, the point is that animals deserve to live their lives free from violence and suffering because there is absolutely no need to consume them for food anymore. \n\nAlso, there are some vegans who do not have pets for the reasons you outlined, but that is not the case for everyone. We have a major overpopulation problem, especially for cats, so giving a home to an animal in need is not unethical. The problem is that most people view pets as inanimate objects, accessories, or pieces of furniture rather than living, breathing beings with complex needs, wants, and experiences. If one shifts from the view of owner to that of guardian, there isn't anything wrong with providing safety, shelter, food, and love to an animal you are a legal guardian over. To make a change like this happen though, we would need to change our laws because, as it stands, animals are property in the eyes of the law. It doesn't mean they are though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I do go out of my way to eat animal liver however because I have very low iron and plant-based solutions to that issue is exceedingly difficult to pull off.\n\nSorry to hear you struggle with low iron. What plant-based solutions have you pursued though? A lot of people (both omni and vegan) take supplements if they need to boost their iron levels. Also, many plant foods--think oats, dark leafy greens, and fortified foods--are high in iron and, when paired with foods high in vitamin C, become even more biologically available. There are also dangers with iron toxicity when getting your iron from animal-based sources. Our bodies can over-absorb iron from animals and have too much of it; however, with plant-based iron, a natural mechanism kicks in that stops the absorption of iron after our body has received its appropriate amount. \n\nThere are also plant-based dietitians who could provide more specific support on ways for you to get adequate iron into your diet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I don't necessarily think any animal is lesser, but I don't think there is a practical way to give them consideration on an equal level to humans. I consider animals and their products for nutrition and ease of use purposes first and foremost\n\nHow can you give them moral consideration while also subjecting them to heinous torture and killing them? I don't think the point is that animals are lesser or the same as humans. Yes, they may have similar experiences to us, but there are always going to be differences and that's fine. The argument vegans make is that it doesn't matter if animals are different or the same; the point is that they are *capable of suffering,* so we shouldn't be causing them harm when it is not necessary. \n\nWhile animal flesh and secretions provide some calories and micronutrients, you could obtain all of that from plant sources without causing harm. All the animals you eat got their nutrients directly from plants, so you can too. Also, to your point about nutrition, animal products cause a plethora of chronic illnesses and diseases. Dairy, for instance, has been linked to breast cancer, prostate cancer, bone fractures, osteoporosis, and acne. It may also have a connection with Type 1 Diabetes. The saturated fat and cholesterol found in animal products contribute to heart disease, cancer, diabetes (primarily Type 2), hypertension, stroke, and ultimately early death. Plant foods do not have these ingredients and have been shown to have protective benefits. In the Nurses Health II study, researchers compared Seventh Day Adventists who were vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores. They found that the vegans had the best health scores in every area except for colorectal cancer (because vegans consume fewer probiotics, but this is something that can be easily remedied with food choices and supplementation). \n\nI don't know what you mean by \"ease of use.\" It is extremely inefficient to raise animals for food. We have to grow crops to feed the animals, which requires a lot of land, water, and energy. We have to forcibly inseminate animals, which is time- and money-intensive. We have to have buildings to house these animals, we have to give out antibiotics when they get sick after living in filthy conditions, we have to transport them to slaughter houses, and we have to kill them (a process that is dangerous and can cause serious harm to the slaughterhouse workers). \n\nThe resources that we expend in feeding and housing farm animals could be allocated to humans instead. We would save a tremendous amount of land, water, time, and money doing this. Also, the Rainforest and other indigenous lands are being cleared so that cattle can graze. If we stop producing animals, we don't have to grow all the crops to feed them. Fewer animals also mean fewer CO2 emissions. So, respectfully, I disagree that farming and eating animals are easy. Maybe it's easy for the consumer to purchase animal flesh, but the environmental and health impacts absolutely cost more.",

"comment": ">You think that one analogy is going to make someone understand veganism? Lol.\n\nMuch more effectively than yours, yes. It forces the interlocutor to compare animal agriculture with dog fighting, which almost all carnists are already strongly opposed to, and opens the door for further conversation about why such a comparison is legitimate. \n\n>My analogy is fit for purpose as it meets them where they're at to get the immediate point across.\n\n\nIt's not fit for purpose at all, because it doesn't convey an iota of the vegan message. It sends the wrong message, i.e that meat is bad due to its addictive qualities, rather than sending a strong ethical message as my analogy does. \n\n>Yours is definitely more consistent but won't work on a lot of people (neither will mine which is why you switch in whatever thing the other person cares about)\n\nOf course there are a lot of people on whom it won't work. You could say that about any analogy. But the point is that your analogy can *never* work, whether you want to convey why you don't want to buy meat, or why buying meat is immoral. It just doesn't work. \n\nDude, this doesn't need to be an ego thing at all. I am sometimes corrected, or have arguments/analogies improved by others, and there's no shame in it at all. There really isn't.",

Once they realized it was here to stay we started having more arguments over it but I have a good relationship with my parents so the arguing usually got resolved even if there was a lot of “we don’t want to change but we also won’t try to change you, why can’t you do the same?” involved. Then my dad decided to go plant-based to bond with me and to help his cardiovascular health since he’s getting older and then he went vegan. Much easier to go vegan if you’re already living 80% of the lifestyle and therefore rejecting animal cruelty mentally “costs” you less. My mom didn’t want to make two meals so she stopped eating animal products at home.\n\nThe only thing I will say is I was in college so I was visiting more frequently than you probably are and exposing them to vegan food more often. It might be a slower process if they don’t see you as much.",

If I’m a surgeon and save 5 lives a day am I allowed kill someone because our net gain would be +4 lives?\n\n*I highly doubt MOST people are capable of changing their diets to veganism. Maybe most people in an economic status similar to your own but not most people on a global scale.\n\n*I think the fallacy you were looking for is false equivalency. I was in no way comparing the weight of environmental damage as I was pointing out the hypocrisy of attacking someone who is intentionally doing something wrong out of lack of better options.  I’m not saying don’t strive for improvement either obviously environmental cars and cultured meat will help the environment out and I hope we get there soon. I’m not saying someone driving a car shouldn’t go vegan but don’t be so quick to assume everyone has the same means as you. For one person it might be tenable for them to walk to work over driving but maybe that same person can’t afford a vegan lifestyle.",
