Period.\n\n*  Power transmission - it's about 99% from the plant to your house - AC is very efficient even through long distances.  You waste 10x that much just idling at stoplights\n\n* Extra weight - the fuel savings from running a more efficient battery more than make up for this.  By a lot\n\n* Reliability, life expectancy, etc etc - both have their issues.  Classic internal combustion probably has an advantage in this category\n\n&gt; There is a reason why most people stick with combustion engines and only a very small, wealthy minority can afford the luxury\n\nYou have a point here... \"can afford\" is a bit melodramatic - it's just not a great deal for consumers as far as raw cost/benefit, so most prefer to get something else.  My personal pet peeve is that all enviro-vehicles are either (a) slow, over-compact, boring econo-boxes, eg, Prius; or (b) exorbitantly overpriced, eh, Escalade Hybrid, Tesla.\n\nBut the heart of the argument here is:\n\n* Adam Corolla is an idiot and he doesn't know what he's talking about",

The next problem that will need to be tackled will be charge times and bigger availability of charging stations. \n\nCharge time is up to the engineers and developers of batteries and charging systems, not much to do here but wait for improvements and innovations which will come in time.\n\nAs for charging stations, it's acceptable to charge overnight at home if you use the car only in your area but if go on a long trip you shouldn't be worried about finding a charging station. Any community from small towns or bigger should get at least one charging station.",

As it stands, the median household can only benefit from $5,271 of the current Tax Credit (Married filing jointly, $53,891 median income, $12,600 deduction).  Increasing the tax credit to $10k would only benefit the richer members of society (dual income households making more than $68,750, the to 38%), with the maximum benefit only coming to households who make more than $85k/year (top 28%, making about 60% more than the median household).\n\nOn the other hand, as a Rebate, anybody could benefit from it.  Only make $34k/year (the bottom third of households)?  Then the additional $10k would be more than 4 times the savings on a new Leaf.  That would drop is effective cost to such a family from around $33k down to about $25k.  That's a *huge* difference for the people who could most benefit from it.  Especially since that would be of even greater benefit to the poor, who both spend a greater proportion of their income on transportation costs *and* tend to live further away from their jobs (where they can afford to live).\n\nWell done, Mr Obama.",

"comment": "thats my point, people are ignorant about EVs cause its a new way of thinking. you dont have miles per gallon, you need to plan your long trips to see where you can fast charge. people generally dont know how EVs work, witch is probably also why so many are skeptical of them. and when they advertise ranges you can only reach on a summer day on flat roads with wind in your back doing 50kph (30mph) your not going to win over people.\n\na woman i work with was disappointed with her Leaf cause the range had dropped so much since she bought it. well the Guessometer is giving you expected range based on your driving and not the batteries diminishing state as she thought. she actually thought the batteries of her car had lost 30% in two years.\n\nwe need real world testing of cars range not some lab test on a dyno bench where there are optimal conditions for the car to perform.\n\nthere is an article in a major norwegian news paper from a few years ago ([link in Norwegian](http://www.vg.no/forbruker/bil-baat-og-motor/bil-og-trafikk/bmw-gjerrigere-enn-miljoebil/a/10065688/)) where a BMW 320 diesel comes out a winner based on mpg. it beat the Chevy Volt (opel ampera in Europe) basically because the real world testing on hills, colder climate (probably around 15c given time of year) and so on. the EU testing witch stated that the chevy should use 0.12 liter per mile was actually 0.57. Thats a huge difference and i would call that false advertisement. the BMW with its 160hp used 0,54. \n\nTLDR: buying a Volt is worst for the environment then a BMW 320 :)",

Second off, the real threat to this car is the Chevy Bolt which does go for sale this fall/winter with 200+ mile range also in CUV form.\n\nLastly, the i3 and i8 are both technology platforms. As in, BMW is pushing very hard for alternative materials to make cars out of because weight is the enemy to cars for both handling and range. Hence the composite body and other work has already been applied to other cars in their catalog. \n\nAluminum is an old tech for the most part, considering it reached the level of F150s its pretty much indicates its not the going forward direction as its benefits are played out. So we will have carbon fiber and plastic composites.\n\nEVs face three major problems, weight of battery packs, density of those packs, and charge time. The conflict of course is as density goes up the difficulty of getting it charged faster increases. Even the super charger network would have to get serious upgrades for cars if they ever surpass 300+ mile range. Porsche has their idea, simply ramp up the amount the car can absorb.\n\nWhile pure battery EVs are cool, 400kg of batteries is not a solution when all manufacturers have been working to make cars weigh less, not more",

"comment": "The i3 is not as cheap as the Leaf, but the OP is considering a Volvo S90, so the i3 is clearly in their price range. Used ones are especially reasonable, now.\n\nYou say that \"the trick with buying an EV Is buying for the vast majority of your usage pattern and using someone else's car for the outliers,\" but the OP already said they don't want 2 cars. They want one car that can do both. \n\nContrary to your claim, the i3 absolutely can be used just putting gas in, especially for a European i3 that can turn on the gas engine at higher state of charge, leaving you plenty of battery buffer to drive however you want. The i3 is very good at maximizing electric miles, as a result, too, because it has fast charging (unlike most PHEVs) and can run on only gas if you don't want to charge or can't.\n\nI'm not saying it's ideal for every trip, but it works fine for many trips because it can legitimately use gas or electric on longer trips, whereas BEVs can't use gas, and most PHEVs have short range and comparatively slow charging. For instance, the Volt (Ampera) can charge at 3.3kw-6.6kw, max (Europe may be slightly faster). The i3 can charge at 50 kW. As charging infrastructure improves, the i3 will become more and more viable for longer distances while maximizing electric miles. The Volt (Ampera) and other PHEVs still won't because they will still be limited to slow charging.",

I honestly don't understand why there aren't more utility-sponsored and branded charging stations. \n\nNot only would the utilities be suddenly getting money that traditionally went to the petroleum sector, that money would offset the slowing profits caused by the increasing energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors, especially if more consumers install solar. \n\nNot to mention, they would be improving their brand. Install a charging station branded with \"whatever-edison\", and suddenly people might view you as a cool, high-tech company, instead of the dinosaur that most people consider their utility to be. Utilities are usually a monopoly, so it might seem they wouldn't gain much from such PR, but they do already engage in public projects that promote their name, so it's clear they value it somewhat. This one would at least bring them money.\n\nI know it already happens in European countries, so I hope it's a matter of time in the US.",

Couldn't justify the extra 8-10k for a new electric vehicle after incentives when there were used ones out there that were perfectly suited to do the same thing and still relatively new!\n\nA few of my passengers have said they found the e-Golf to be very conformable and I remember reading that the e-Golf has a more powerful motor than the leaf. I want to say it was a little zippier and handled a bit better but that could also have been some confirmation bias. I actually found Edmund's reviews to be very helpful here as you can look up their take on each model year, get specific info on the different trim levels and the various specs for each car. I think the cars are very similar in most aspects and you pretty much can't go wrong with either. I remember being very impressed with the acceleration on the leaf compared to my 07 Impala boat car! Until I test drove the older leaf, I hadn't even considered it. I was nearly to the point of putting in an offer until I drove the e-Golf.\n\nYou might be able to find a Nissan dealer near you with a used leaf to test drive.

Of course those news make top in a non-Tesla-specific EV sub. And there is not a lot substantial happening at Tesla, compared to that. If there is, it will also make top.",

"comment": "One other thing happened when the pandemic hit.  All major manufacturers saw a major drop in sales and cut contracts and volumes from their suppliers. Chip suppliers started selling their out put to others (surge in PC's for work at home computers). Tesla was just ramping up and did not see the same drop in sales, and kept their contracts.  This really helped them at first, but they grew faster than expected and had to try to get more supplies.  This is when Tesla had to contend with the chip shortage.",

"comment": "Aggressive is relative. Relative to what you ask? There’s literally no mechanism to stop fossil fuels tomorrow that wouldn’t impact billions of people, mostly middle to lower class and impoverished people. But even people people who can afford to buy an electric car or buy solar panels to maintain their lifestyle will take a financial hit, but where would their food come from? How would it get to their table? Would their job exist? \n\nPeople can downvote me all they want, but there’s no lie here. Ending fossil fuels tomorrow would result in economic collapse on a scale not seen since the end of the Roman Empire. Hundreds of millions would die due to starvation, decades or more of educational enrichment and institutional knowledge would be erased.\n\nAnything less than _literally tomorrow_ is acquiescing to some kind of transition and then the question becomes at what speed and at what cost. It’s an outrageously privileged (even delusional in my opinion) perspective that we can 100% end the use of fossil fuels in 10, 20, or even 30 years without incurring massive loss of life and culture globally.\n\nIf there’s an equitable way to completely wind down 100% fossil fuels literally _tomorrow_ without mass starvation and economic disruption to the point of depression or collapse, I’d love to hear it.",

But, the EV part of that is pretty dang dead simple. Plus, the 'transmission' if you can call it that is not really the CVT we all love to loathe. There's basically a power split device, which is just a couple of electric motors, and a set of planetary gears. There are no real wear parts in there, like CVT belts, cones, clutches, or anything that complicated. It's all done through computer control of the electric motors, to speed up, slow down or run backwards as the conditions require. It's not mechanically switching anything for gear ratios.",

For example.\n\n\"With module and other hardware prices expected to level off in the coming years (and in the near term, actually increase)\"\n\n\"Global solar-panel prices fell from $1.34 per watt in 2011 to 67 cents last year, and prices are expected to fall to 64 cents this year. Prices are expected to end 2016 at 59 cents per watt. \"\n\n\"Recently imposed anti-subsidies and anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels could make solar-panel prices higher in the U.S. \"\n\n64 cents to 59 cents is only about a 7% decrease over 2 years and that's just the panels, which would only be a minimal decrease to the overall installed cost.  Not sure why installation cost would decrease.  No where does it say soft costs in the US or even Germany will be decreasing.  Just because it's cheaper in Germany doesn't mean it can be cheaper in the US.\n\nThe reality is that the cost of installing solar has pretty bottomed out.  Take away utility incentives and tax rebates and the net cost will increase significantly.  If I was in the solar installation business in the US, I'd be getting ready to find a new job in a couple years.",

NABCEP is not necessary, and while it serves as a solid basic knowledge set it does not teach the truely \"in demand\" skills that you could be focusing on. The top students in NABCEP programs are electricians - so if you aren't an electrician, you aren't going to be at the top of those classes.\n\nThe most valuable \"plain solar guys\" are the ones who have taught themselves solar design (just pay a guy to teach you, like a tutor) and then just dove in headfirst by putting projects together. \n\nSo I'd give a NABCEP program a B- as an entry point into the industry, mainly because there isn't much else out there. But if the program costs $2000+, I think its better to spend the money installing a 0.5kW Enphase solar array from start to finish, and taking a basic course on engineering economics.\n\nI say this as a NABCEP PV Installer, solar instructor, master electrician, mechanical engineer, project lead, etc.\n\nBy the way, you do know about [this subreddit](/r/voltmate) don't you?",

"comment": "&gt;Well to be fair, just because \"most states\" are eligible for federal subsidies doesn't necessarily mean that they will actually use them. \n\nPlease don't twist what I said.  I said that most states offer subsidies *in addition* to federal subsidies.  There are myriad energy related energy programs from the federal government that have nothing to do with the states themselves.  The states don't act as gatekeepers to the federal programs I am referring to.\n\n&gt;...states like Texas and Missouri aren't exactly scrambling to add solar power.\n\nSeveral years ago Texas invited environmental groups to the table to hear their recommendations on power.  They said go with wind.  Texas went with wind.  I haven't followed Missouri's energy situation.\n\n&gt;Along those lines, the U.S. installed 4.75 gigawatts of solar in 2013, while China added significantly more.\n\nOf course.  China is expanding all forms of power at a much faster rate.  The U.S. has been closing coal plants over the last several years at a rate faster than they are being replaced.  Can you say the same about China?\n\n&gt;So while China's government is wonky in many ways, one of the good things about it is that once it makes up its mind, it can go full steam ahead with minimal red tape. \n\nYeah, if there's an upside to totalitarianism, that would be it.\n\n&gt;So actually yeah, China really is by far surpassing the U.S. in renewable/clean energy investment.\n\nI wonder if you judge companies by only the revenue portion of their income statement.  Yes, China is throwing gobs of money at renewables, but those are much smaller than the mega-gobs they are spending on coal plants.\n\n&gt;By claiming climate change isn't real...\n\nBut they haven't stopped the programs.  They are already in place.  No one is repealing them.\n\n&gt;...it creates furor when the government does try to invest in clean energy.\n\nThe government's investments are either ongoing or have been stymied only by the black eye they've received from pushing their ill-advised renewables-only agenda.  (You already mentioned Solyndra.)\n\nSeriously, name a program that has been cut because of fossil fuel company lobbying.\n\n&gt;So yeah, it's this type of sentiment that prevents or obstructs further investment in renewable energy\n\nName a program that was proposed then blocked related to stories like that.  Come on, now.  The Democrats control the Senate.  Surely you can show me a bill they passed for clean energy that died in the House.\n\n&gt;...there actually is a strong conservative argument to fund renewable energy.\n\nHow is more jobs at the cost of more expensive energy a conservative argument?  That's a straight out liberal argument.  A conservative argument would be cheaper power via advanced nuclear to create more affordable power for household and business alike, which would increase our competitive and technological advantages.\n\n&gt;The problem is the fossil fuel industry a lot of money, and a lot of pull.\n\nLike G.E.?\n\n&gt;But regardless of which industry you pick: coal, gas, oil... fact remains that these are all finite resources. \n\nYes.\n\n&gt;Solar, wind and hydro are all virtually limitless. \n\nNo.  There is a very distinct limit on how much power we can get from those sources.  What's more, one of those has been built out in developed countries and the other two are diffuse and intermittent.\n\n&gt;Whatever your feelings on climate change, it would behoove a government (who has different motivations from a private corporation) to do the best things for its citizens, both short term and long term.\n\nYes.  Such goals include:\n\n- Electrified transport that doesn't rely on asphalt roads.  [SkyTran](/r/skytran) does this nicely.\n\n- Stable baseload power generation.  Hydro is built out, so that leaves nuclear.  If we had spent on advanced nuclear what we've blown on diffuse, intermittent renewables, we wouldn't have fallen behind Russia, which is building their **second** breeder reactor, or China, which will have it's first molten salt test reactor online in six years.\n\n- Affordable power that doesn't hurt our competitive advantage.  This will include some solar in certain locations to help with peak load.  Most power generated should come from nuclear for the long term, though.\n\n&gt;This isn't entirely true though. The Kochs...\n\nThe Kochs aren't oil companies.  They produce coal.  By the way, the ability to sell solar power back to the grid is one of the biggest subsidy programs there is for solar power.  Utilities have to produce 3-4 Joules of energy to sell you one Joule of energy, but people with solar panels get to sell every spare Joule they produce at a rate of 1:1.",

"comment": "Not sure why the downvotes. \n\nIf you mention \"We had to build a solar array with batteries for under $1000\" your experience will be devalued - just the battery componenents of residential systems are upwards of $10k.\n\nLikewise, the autocad you do in PV design is very simply. Click. Drag. Zoom. OP shouldn't shoot himself in the foot by stating \"he doesn't have too much AutoCAD experience\". Any AutoCAD experience is sufficient for his job.\n\nMaybe some people think that engineering interviews are about belittling yourself in front of your future employer through honest self-assessments. That's simply not true. You should put your best foot forward in the interview. Your perosnal skills are being tested. Hit as many buzzwords as you can. Talk about wanting to be part of a team, particularly an industry-leading team. Emphazise your photovoltaic course selection as acting on your desire to work in renewable tech - of which you think solar is the winning technology.\n\nMost entry-level engineering jobs are very easy for graduating engineers to execute. You don't need to be afraid of overstating your capabilities.",

"comment": "OK, there are several reasons your batteries are not lasting very long. First, the batteries Costco has been selling for the last 2-3 years are not as high quality as they were previously.  I too had to go through a couple batches of batteries before I swapped mine out for a different brand.  If only some of your batteries are \"failing\" check all your connections, and replace as necessary. Even a bit of corrosion on one terminal or in one wire can cause significant drop further down the line.  I suggest getting some welding wire and making your own cables, or preferably, get some solid bar connectors.  \nBut, most importantly, your batteries are failing because you do not have enough solar coming in to charge them. Ideally, you want your charge current to be between 10-3% of your \"c20\" capacity rate. For the Costco batteries, the C20 rate is 200 amp hours, which means 20 amps for 10 hours, or 200amps for 1 hour.  So to charge them, you need to maintain a current of 20 amps@  59 volts.  Failure to do so will cause rapid battery lifecycle death.  You're currently charging at 17amps@59v, under absolute best condition. Your panels are not putting out the full wattage on the nameplate, usually it comes out to about 70% of that rate, which means you're probably getting closer to 12amps -- add some clouds, wire loss, temperature corrections on the batteries (requiring higher voltage to change) and a diminished amount of time to charge..and you end up with dying battery cells.  I'd suggest investing in some additional solar panels to get your charge numbers higher, as well as a hydrometer. If you find a good hydrometer, please let me know, because mine keep failing on me!",

"comment": "Except that utility rates are about to get much cheaper for most people that are looking at solar.\n\nTo charge batteries from grid electricity doesn't make sense unless off-peak rates are at least twice that of peak rates.  You have to make up for capital cost of battery and also losses in charging cycle.  If off-peak is only 20% lower than peak, then it doesn't make sense.\n\nTo charge batteries from solar doesn't make sense when utilities are paying full peak rates for excess electricity generated during peak hours.  If PG&amp;E will pay me $0.33/kwh, why would I put that electricity into a battery instead of selling it to PG&amp;E?  It might make sense if utilities start paying wholesale rates for excess solar power, but I don't think that will happen anytime soon.",

"comment": "It is difficult to get into specifics without more detail about your house (orientation, roof, etc.). But given your power demand you are a potentially great candidate.\n\nI would suggest getting a few installers involved to start. They answer questions specific to your circumstances, and they can also give you options to compare. All very quickly. There are a [number of sites like this one](http://www.solarreviews.com/) where you can not only find some companies that service your area, but you can also find reviews.\n\nGood installers should also give you a precise and accurate view of every incentive, federal and California. Net metering caps can be tricky, for example. Once you have background and quotes, perhaps getting input may help in making a decision.",

"comment": "&gt;There are a whole host of things that people will variously consider outrageous in terms of the perceived harm they cause... the guy who bought 6 strawberries by mail and they came with a cubic yard of packaging material... people who throw away a half dozen k-cups each year... people who eat mangoes in January... I think it’s outrageous that people who live on quarter acre lots in subdivisions don’t have gardens in their yards.\n\nI agree that all of these things are outrageous. That doesn't make killing animals any less outrageous. It's possible to avoid doing all of these things AND avoid killing animals.\n\n&gt;I think it’s not much better to eat black beans that rode to my house on a diesel truck. \n\nI actually did the math on this. Lets say your family eats 40lbs of dried black beans (~100 pounds cooked) every 6 months, and these beans need to be transported 300 miles to get to your house. If a semi-truck can carry an 80,000 pound load and gets 6.5 mpg, that would mean it would need to burn about ONE gallon of fuel to transport those beans to your house. ONE gallon. Is this really worth an intelligent, sentient animal's life? Why not buy the sack of beans and set up a few solar panels instead (a single household solar system can offset up to 2 tons of co2 per year)? And ultimately it is still your choice to live in an area that is unsuitable for farming.\n\n&gt;People have said I’m a psychopath, evil, a monster... Is a soccer mom who gets chicken nuggets at the drive through for her kids a psychopathic monster? 200 years ago, nearly every person outside of a major city lived the way I do. Were they monsters? I guess I just don’t understand the rhetoric and what it’s supposed to achieve. \n\nIf we were to go back in time 200 years, there would be many accepted behaviors (slavery, subjugation of woman, child labor, etc etc) that today are widely considered immoral and evil. Does that mean that the majority of people 200 years were evil monsters? No, because ultimately everyone is a product of the time period they are from. But what they did was still wrong.",

As is good economic sense, most all will choose what saves them money. You can see this in the adoption of solar panels as they become more efficient and cheaper to produce, as well as with electric vehicles. American industries that sell to an international market are therefore incentivized to make more efficient products, to create better goods regardless of any over-arching mandate. The main problem is the industry in America with a captive market; the power/utilities companies that often have a monopoly that have no incentive to change the current method of  doing business.",

So you'd need to set up accounts with distributors, who generally work on some sort of \"credit for now but you owe us the sum inside 30 days\" exchange.  that means you've got to tie it all in with the sale of the job, and make sure the contract has you getting paid enough to start your cash expenses, with the final sum coming in after you guys  walk off the roof.  you can't \"get solar panels delivered\" then go sell that, because it'll leave you with equipment you can't use, inevitably.\n\nB)  Sales, sales, sales.   \n\nC) education.  there has to be some education options for you - a lot of governments will tie those kind of incentive programs to education programs - or at least offer them simultaneously.  Start looking at your country's energy department and see what kind of trainings might apply.\n\nreally - at this point - you might also just be good with getting in with ANY electrician and start learning the ropes about *how* to run wires, install boxes, etc. etc.  get yourselves used to the manual labor of it.  There's a lot of nuance to being a good installer that you can pick up as an electrician.  In fact, here in the US, installers *are* card-carrying electricians - it's part and parcel with the job.   \n\nWhich brings up certifications, licensing, and code.  I imagine Bulgaria has some level of code enforcement/inspection.  you've got to know that stuff.   and it seems simple, but as always, the devil is in the details.  color coding for wire, how much of what size wire can you fit in a box of a given size, how much room around equipment you have to keep clear.\n\nanyhow. \n\nfind your distributors, know what they have available to sell.  Then sell it, then order it, then install it.  and all through, before, and after that, is educate, educate, educate.\n\nand start with electrical distributors.   these are the most likely candidates that will be supplying this stuff.  or call teh companies and then ask them where they have local distributors.  \n\ngood luck.",

Elon made a huge mistake by pulling all of the reps out of SolarCity which halted all the ways that a solar company needs to evolve. While all the other companies have been improving in the years he's been working on other projects, his panels are catching fire on people's roofs. Don't get me wrong, I'm quite proud to sell the Tesla powerwall with a Sunrun or SunPower deal, it's just funny that he's not out in the field understanding that homeowners aren't cookie-cutter. They have very individual needs and he wants to provide solar on a very generic, mass scale, similar to his Tesla. Unfortunately, until we can completely be free of the utility companies, this doesn't seem like a probable solution or one that we are remotely concerned about.",

This means a given dollar figure of investment will give 3x as much decarbonization if invested into wind and solar instead of nuclear.\n\nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/450436/rehcd3.jpg\n\nNuclear has never even been economically viable, it is never been done, anywhere without massive government support:\n\n\"Most revealing is the fact that nowhere in the world, where there is a competitive market for electricity, has even one single nuclear power plant been initiated. Only where the government or the consumer takes the risks of cost overruns and delays is nuclear power even being considered.\"\n\nhttps://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20170912wnisr2017-en-lr.pdf#Report%202017%20V5.indd%3A.30224%3A7746\n\nrenewbles are subsidized less:\n\nhttps://htpr.cnet.com/p/?u=http://i.bnet.com/blogs/subsidies-2.bmp&amp;h=Y8-1SgM_eMRp5d2VOBmNBw\n\nAnd after all the subsidies nuclear has received, it is still not viable without subsidies, meanwhile wind and solar have many examples of subsidy-free projects\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/subsidy-free-wind-power-possible-in-2-7-billion-dutch-auction\n\nhttps://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/10/31/more-subsidy-free-solar-storage-for-the-uk/\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/subsidy-free-solar-comes-to-the-uk\n\nWith the overall lower subsidies to the renewables industry, they have transitioned to being viable without in a very short period of time, compared to nukes which literally remain subsidy junkies 50 years after their first suckle at the government teat.\n\nRenewables even make better use of subsidy dollars; the same amount of subsidy invested in renewables vs nuclear will give many times more energy as a result.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dcPVyt7\n\n\"Global reported investment for the construction of the four commercial nuclear reactor projects (excluding the demonstration CFR-600 in China) started in 2017 is nearly US$16 billion for about 4 GW. This compares to US$280 billion renewable energy investment, including over US$100 billion in wind power and US$160 billion in solar photovoltaics (PV). China alone invested US$126 billion, over 40 times as much as in 2004. Mexico and Sweden enter the Top-Ten investors for the first time. A significant boost to renewables investment was also given in Australia (x 1.6) and Mexico (x 9). Global investment decisions on new commercial nuclear power plants of about US$16 billion remain a factor of 8 below the investments in renewables in China alone. \"\n\np22 of https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20180902wnisr2018-lr.pdf\n\nThe results of this is that in 2017 there was over 150 GW of wind and solar coming online, but nuclear:\n\n\"New nuclear capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW) in 2017 was outweighed by lost capacity of 4.6 GW.\"\n\nhttps://energypost.eu/nuclear-power-in-crisis-welcome-to-the-era-of-nuclear-decommissioning/\n\nRenewable energy is doing more for decarbonization than nuclear.",

"comment": "That's interesting. Thanks for the info. However, from what I've heard, in tech items, separating each element before melting everything (and therefore obtaining a mix that is hardly separable because of neighbouring melting temperatures of the components) requires workers doing it by hand and that businesses are not willing to pay (at the moment at least).\n\nBut in anyway, reducing our energy use will have to part of the equation (I was not defending traditional ways of producing energy) as there is a growing population, limited resources, that recycling itself uses energy, producing solar panels, wind and water turbines uses energy that will have to come from somewhere (I think I remember a study that looked at how much CO2 we would have to pump into the atmospher to switch to renewables with the same consumption of energy, can't remember the details),  that renewables participate in environmental degradation (albeit less than fossil fuels, but still they use land, dams detroy ecosystems, etc.), etc... So every KWH not produced and not consumed is a win.",

A Tesla powerwall is AC coupled as well.\n\nThe catch is, those inefficiencies only matter in a grid failure situation, or something like TOU shifting when the battery is actually being used. For example the grid fails, and you have 6kW AC Load on a sunny day, the battery isn't really \"discharging\" per say beyond providing a grid signal for your solaredge. The battery will just sit fully charged and you solar edge will just continue working as it always has the rest of the time.\n\nThe only way to DC couple that, would be gut the whole thing or use the LG Chem battery..\n\nEdit to clarify..",

"comment": "The purpose of that box would be to limit the voltage to the trolling motor to prevent it from burning up. If your solar panels are going to be putting out less power than your motor would be drawing with 12V applied, you won't need it because the voltage will be less than 12V anyway. Just don't buy too big of a panel and you will be fine. You will want a solar panel designed for a 12V system though. \n\nYou could use the big, higher voltage house panels (30V or so) but you would want to use a MPPT charge controller and a battery. The MPPT controller will automatically convert the power to 12V at maximum efficiency.",

I recommend 30% as people have a natural tendency to be less mindful and use more energy once they have solar, and for most we continue to increase electrical use over time.\n\nOversizing by more than that doesn't \"pay\" Net metering runs 12 months then a true up. If the utility company owes us for excess production at the end of that time they only give us wholesale value which is pennies.\n\nIn SCE area a properly size system should reduce your energy costs.  PPA is a bad deal for most. Buy the system either cash or loan (HELOC, your local credit union or bank; NOT the low interest solar loan options vis the installers, those increase your system cost due to hidden dealer fees).  \n\n\nSunruns reviews speak for themselves. There should be plenty of good local companies that can give you a quote. How old is your roof? I'm a bit south of you. Companies that do both solar and roofing in our area typically will do a free roofing assessment as part of their discovery process with you.",

Don't trust articles about engineering written by English majors.\n\nAs more EVs are built, people pay the electric companies to fuel the EVs. That revenue stream is used to build more generation and transmission equipment. And if we assume good growth in EV sales, that means the utilities can borrow against that future revenue stream to build big. And what's the cheapest electricity on the grid? Onshore wind and solar PV!\n\nEV drivers will be happy to pay for clean energy growth because driving on electricity is DIRT CHEAP compared to gasoline! Especially if it's your own solar PV on your roof.\n\nSo we anticipate MUCH cleaner, quieter, and cheap-to-fuel electric cars will grow (jobs!) thus also causing growth in good local electricity generation and transmission (more jobs!) of clean energy....and this is a BAD THING SOMEHOW?\n\nNO! It's economic growth (jobs), much cleaner air, reduced climate change, AND CHEAP ENERGY.\n\nIt's a win, win, win, win!",

"comment": "Or, perhaps more to the point: experts are generally agreed that the major obstacles are political, not technical. Perhaps you're imagining a great leap of innovation fueled by ample cheap energy? That would be great, but that isn't what's really needed. (Or at least, we can't gamble on a huge game-changing innovation appearing out of nowhere.)\n\nThe trouble is that we're not implementing the green technology we have. The first-order effect of this is that we're putting out carbon right now (and the longer carbon is in the atmosphere, the more it can heat us). The second-order effect is that there isn't enough market demand to drive innovation in that sector! If everyone were desperate for cheap efficient solar panels, there'd be more incentive to develop cheaper and more efficient solar panels. And yeah, that'd be great! But instead we have the opposite.",

"comment": "Close, at the end of the year your \"credit\" goes away.  At that point, if you have excess kWh, those are converted to the wholesale rate based on a value that changes monthly.  For instance, the monthly excess generation table for SDG&amp;E is here:  [https://www.sdge.com/residential/savings-center/solar-power-renewable-energy/net-energy-metering/billing-information/excess-generation](https://www.sdge.com/residential/savings-center/solar-power-renewable-energy/net-energy-metering/billing-information/excess-generation).\n\nIf you use an EV rate and load shift, it's possible to have a credit but not have excess generation because of the differential.\n\nAs for the Powerwall, payback is around 7 years on SDG&amp;E if you net consume, and the warranty is 10 years.  There is also SGIP, which lowers the payback, but for Equity or Equity Resiliency completely pays for it (after tax credit and assuming you got the Powerwall for $10.5k).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;run other appliances like washer dryer and dishwasher. \n\nOne thing a battery gives you is the ability to not have to do those at night, since you can load shift them with the battery, especially with the new IRA rules where you can have the battery recharge at midnight at that super off-peak rate.",

We had signed before that but there were some convenient delays on their side that led to us missing out. Coming in with no usage history also meant some more negotiating to get our intended system size. They typically give you kW DC= 2xsqft of home+ garage if you don't have a 12mo usage history.",

"comment": "Remember to consider the opportunity cost of sinking $50k cash into solar panels. \n\nEarlier this year I was pitched solar installations by two companies.  Both had a break even point of 15 years - which in itself is miserable - and furthermore neither of their calculations consider opportunity cost.. \n\nLet's explore if you instead invested $50k in the S&P 500 on Monday morning and left it there for the next 14 years. Assuming the investment appreciates by 7% each year (on average), you'd be sitting on a $128k portfolio at the end of 14 years. You could then choose to leave that $128k invested and continue to grow your wealth for decades to come. In that time you can move house, or even liquidate your stocks if you need the money... You have total freedom. \n\nAlternatively, you could put $50k into solar and (for all you know) move house in 5 years time and be left with no benefit .  Or, if you don't move, in 14 years you will find yourself with a solar installation that is 1/2-2/3 of the way into its expected service life and hopefully still functioning as intended. Either way you just spent $50k to bolt something to your roof that may be considered a dinosaur in 10 years. And, despite what the solar industry tells you, plenty of people don't like the idea of buying a house with solar panels (Holes in the roof) installed by a contractor they have no relationship with. \n\nThere isn't a chance in hell that I'm going to spend $128k on electricity bills over the next 14 years, which is why I still haven't installed solar. It's just not a good investment. Instead, I added insulation to my home and have kept my money invested in index funds and CDs of 5%.",

I'm sorry, that wasn't the intention.\n\nOkay, fair, if we're going to keep debating this, lets both try to keep it civil.\n\n>retrofitting ***the overwhelming majority of housing stocks in the western world and a huge chunk across asia and Africa*** to what amounts to passivhaus specifications is actually more energy intensive than using heatpumps but I doubt you'd listen\n\nOkay, but surely we're on the same page that these need to change? A free standing McMansion in the Arizona desert with huge windows and no shared walls is just incredibly wasteful. Even if you're all in on battery storage and solar, having houses sap this much energy makes no sense.\n\nAlso, a significant number of homes will probably be destroyed by climate disasters in the coming decades. Wildfires, hurricanes, sea level rise, etc. You already know this. The sunbelt people flocked to for decades will grow increasingly inhospitable. New construction will need to happen regardless.\n\n>Great, I'll tell that to French peasants or poor people in Bangladesh that as they die of heat stroke\n\nPassive methods of cooling worked for nearly all of the world until the mid 20th century. I really cant understand how someone invested in the climate prefers using brute force with climate control as opposed to passive designs that don't require energy.",

I can't find a good document where they cover backfeeding power.  That's a horse of another color.\n\n\\-> I see there are a lot of prior discussions so for now you get PGE's answers and ask if you can go for zero export.  Also, for NEM 3.0 you'll get batteries so you can maintain zero export for hours and use your solar power when the sun sets.",

"comment": "Interesting points.  I get that eating something that tastes or looks similar to meat would not be immoral in and of itself for a vegan.   I also get that describing something as an analogue is easier than presenting say a tempeh pattie as just tempeh.   It is the lack of emotional connection that is confusing.   But if we look at food taboos, I've never heard of things like mock beef dishes for Hindus, mock whale dishes for those opposing whaling, mock cat, etc.    If it looks like dead duck, tastes like dead duck, is called vegetarian duck, and you don't like the idea of dead ducks, how does this work?",

It's on Wikipedia on the veganism entry. It's also used in many studies on vegetarian diet (also \"pure vegetarian\" diet is sometimes used). \n\nAgain, not all vegetarians eat dairy -- just lacto-vegetarians. That's why they're called lacto-vegetarians. You have heard of that term, right? As in, lacto-ovo vegetarians, too. \n\nAnd again, there's no reason to give in to ignorance. For Pete's sake, people go crazy enough on here correcting it's for its. I think we can correct people when they think that a philosophy against animal exploitation is nothing more than a fad diet.",

"comment": "&gt; I'm not for eating meat all the time. Humans have forgotten moderation. We want pomegranates year round. We're out of touch with the earth. Eating fake meat and super vegetables make you more out of touch.\n\nI believe in nothing should be taken in excess, but I don't believe the reverse of everything in moderation is true.  There are plenty of things humans should *never* do.  As far as becoming more one with the earth, I simply don't see the appeal.\n\n&gt; I don't live in Texas, so that's not my issue.\n\nEven if you don't live in Texas, there's still the issue of where hay comes from and the amount of resources it takes to get that hay to the cow.  Even if they hay is just one town over, you are still having a giant 14 wheeler be put in action between two towns weekly in order to feed the animals.\n\n&gt;Are you against hunting? I used to be up until a couple months ago when I realized there are some people who simply cannot afford food from supermarkets. The earth is providing all these things for us to use for food.\n\nI'm not against hunting if people absolutely *need* to do it. I'm just against it for the majority of people that don't need it. As long as you are buying from a supermarket or farmers market vegetables are generally cheaper pound for pound and nutrient per nutrient than meat is, so unless you are in a position where you need food for free, or you live in a country without the infrastructure we have, vegetables are the better choice for the hungry.\n\n&gt;Also I think the whole vegan/vegetarian movement was hijacked in the 90s by groups like PETA and whole foods type shops so they could turn a profit on compassion.\n\nI don't know about whole foods as they more capitalized on the organic craze than the vegan craze, but I completely agree about PETA. Thing is that doesn't all of a sudden make veganism a bad life choice. I bad mouth PETA every chance I get, but I'm still vegan.",

There's also not much natural about the way 99% of the meat people buy and eat is produced; the animals are fed unnatural diets, kept in unnatural conditions, pumped full of unnatural hormones, etc. \n\nThis isn't meant as an attack on you or anything; i have an iPhone which I'm sure was made at foxconn, and you aren't an animal murderer any more than I'm a slave driver. The idea behind being vegan is that it's not all that hard to avoid animal products, so since I have the means to do so, I do in the hopes of alleviating some suffering.",

One of them was a vegetarian, the other ate meat.\n\nThey just had this arrangement that they, when they cook together, cook meatless meals and if the non-vegetarian craved meat, he would have to cook it on his own to add it to his plate of meals they cooked together.\n\nNeedless to say, lazyness won and he ate meatless meals most of the time. He got steaks or something at restaurants, though.\n\nI always thought that was a healthy way to go at it :)",

"comment": "It was a while ago, but I don't recall any sort of dairy cravings (but I had been vegan for a few years already and pretty much had lost those prior to becoming pregnant, anyway). My big cravings were Taco Bell bean burritos and strawberries :/. I didn't really do anything special with my diet that I wasn't already doing except up my nutritional yeast consumption and increase my veggies a bit. I in no way had a perfect diet back then....these were the days before such things as quinoa and chia seeds became popular,  lol....and I was young and lazy. My point is that I didn't spend a ton of time planning my meals to make sure they were the very best possible...I just ate normal, healthy vegan foods (and occasionally vegan junk food), just making sure I got plenty of vegetables. I did take prenatal vitamins and extra iron, however.",

[This user](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2qyy3p/japanese_vegetarians_campaign_for_tokyos_50000/cnb3c6i) was saying that that even if you say \"no meat\" they still got food with meat slipped into it, and multiple users reported that they had to be hyper-aware of fish stock being in everything. We all know how hard it is to stay vegan, so don't think this is a criticism on your brother's part of that he did something wrong/negligent, just a heads-up to you (or anyone else reading your post) who goes to Japan with similar expectations.\n\nThat Buddhist monastery meal sounds really awesome.

I am against all of it (which is why I'm vegan to begin with) but I can believe that killing one for pure \"sport\" AND of a species which is endangered comes across as more evil than killing one for food - even though yes it's still strictly out of pleasure not out of necessity, but society still deems it as \"necessary\" to eat animals. These people are hypocrites, no question, and they would probably realise this too if they stopped to think about it, but that doesn't change the notion that some killing is worse than others. And that has nothing to do with speciesism - i.e. how \"charismatic\" or \"cute\" the species is, but to do with how fucked it already is, in sheer numbers.\n\nSuffering is suffering and life is life, but at the end of the day I'm way more furious at those who continue to kill species that are on the brink, because gone is gone, forever is forever.",

It just raises too many questions about what captivity is, why it's bad, etc. and gets me into trouble because I like to debate a little too much.\n\nHaving a defined line of \"no harm or killing of animals\" makes much more sense and it's a very sound reasoning.

Long time r/vegan lurker here (mostly to learn more about something I'm not a part of, and generally don't completely understand). \n\n\nI'm interested in the response from r/vegan on this topic because I've never heard any negative personal impacts (health wise) from people switching their diets to veganism. Quite the opposite really. Everyone talks about their diet with optimism, and claims their health has never been better.\n\n\nOP's x-post reflects my understanding of a major drawback of veganism (from the diet end, not the animal cruelty end). That someone can experience serious vitamin deficiencies, or have issues sustaining on a carb heavy routine while following this diet.",

If everyone had the power to impose their views on the rest of the world the world would be an ugly place. \n\nResearch has shown that planting the seed and letting people come to their own conclusion by researching on their own initiative leads to much longer lasting changes in opinion. I'm not vegan yet but finding the vegan subreddit and doing further research and thinking on things convinced me far more than PETA ever did.",

My impression is that a lot of people think that just cutting out animal flesh and products is the only step to becoming vegan, but then you need to find foods to fill these new vacancies. Try substitutes for the days when you really miss comfort foods, but also try new things. I think people think that the options are reduced when really, so many possibilities open up. Maybe let him take a bite of something vegan that you make or order next time. It won't kill him; worst case, he just won't like it. But chances are he'll find something he does like.",

We can only do our best to make a better future. Like I said, I don't  know enough about invasive animals to give you a perfect solution. It's likely there is no perfect solution. That's not going to stop me from doing the best I can to avoid harming animals. \n\nI grew up with chickens too and I've seen them eat their eggs. They don't really do it unless one happens to break but they'll continue to eat them when they figure out what's inside. I don't worry too much about people eating pet chicken eggs, I just don't feel comfortable about doing myself.\n\nI've also worked in chicken houses and saw first hand and participate in some of the worst acts I've every seen done to animals. And even if their are places that treat them better, they still end up slaughtered or keeped inslaved for profit. There's no way to spin it being okay to me. Treating them better makes killing them even worse because then they had even more reason to want to live.\n\nI'm sure documentaries are exaggerating some of what they show or singling out worst case scenarios. That doesn't make me want to change my mind. I find it wrong no matter how well animals a treated. \n\nThere are also many cases were it's not possible for people to go vegan. Like tribal communities that live off the land or people who live in food deserts. I'm not naive enough to think everyone can go vegan, because of their situation. There are endless debates, but the reality is that most people today could be vegan if they choose to. \n\nMy biggest issues are with factory farming industries (no offense to you personally) and animal testing. I avoid supporting these to the best of my abilities by voting with my dollars.",

But you have to make some kind of effort to learn about these issues, otherwise the amount of information doesn’t make much of an impact when it is just „there“. I knew eating animal products was bad for the environment and that animals are treated horribly, but until I did my part to actively read about these issues the mountains of information out there didn’t get to me.\n\na sign like this might inspire someone to look further into the issue, sometimes all it takes is a little push for someone to become active (that’s how it was for me).",

But if I was in returning distance I would definitely take it back and get the correct order! Dont feel bad about wasting, because when you accept that you are condoning the waste by product of animal agriculture which is insanely more than 1 plate.\n\nEdit: had to add a lil extra note, always when eating out especially fast food make sure your order is correct before eating. Even before I was vegan mcdonalds or taco bell would fuck up my orders alot, especially if it's a large order or even a customized one",

To people within Deaf/ hard of hearing communities it's nice to be able to have media from people within similar communities that present things of interest in your language/ culture. Also, many from these communities do not see themselves as 'disabled' but more so as fully-abled people living in a world that does not accept or include them (for example, think of watching a youtube video that is presented in verbal English and has no captions- it just excludes people from the Deaf/ HoH community). \n\nI am a final year speech language pathology student who has been learning sign and working my way in specialising in working with the Deaf/ hard of hearing community. So I was fairly excited to support a Deaf creator and to have more exposure for my own learning (in this case both for Veganism and Deaf related things such as watching and understanding sign). \n\nI hope this was informative and not seen as aggressive or anything. This is an area I am very passionate about and I understand not everyone has exposure/ experience with this community which is unfortunate.",

I throw in so many veggies so there’s a ton variety, which oddly helps make it feel like you’re not eating the same thing every day if that makes sense? but we can also kind of eat it as we like each day. We can have tofu scramble with corn tortillas or throw it all in a burrito or have it on toast or as is. That seems to help too. :) also, having dinner to look forward to, as that changes each day of course.",

Instead, I saw a group of people willing to get off their fat fucking arses, and do something to make the world a better place. \n\nPeople will hate on these protests, 100%. More so because they’re vegans. But let me tell you something. The only reason vegans have a platform to speak on is because of people like these. The only reason we have amazing documentaries like dominion, earthlings, a land of hope and glory. conspiracy, seaspiracy, is because of people like these.\n\nBLM protests that turned into rioting we’re still in reddit’s good graces. HK protests were still in the world’s good graces (except China). The farmers protest in India were still in the world’s good graces (except Modhi supporters). What are non-vegans going to do? Get pissed off and be less vegan? That’s on them, not us. These protests make veganism a constant topic and that’s far more important than being in the good graces of someone too stubborn to ever consider going vegan.",

Frankly I find it hard to trust someone who's actively supporting that type of cruelty, and I don't have any sympathy for the excuses they give me.

Tea tree oil and chalk EVERYWHERE (ik, ur house will look like a toddler drew everywhere but its definitely worth it) helps over time, but it might take 2-3 months to see a reduction.",

"comment": "&gt;Not even the different types of utilitarianism allow for compatiability and you want to posit that a movement with a sense of finality about an inbuilt system of oppression being ended is somehow compatible with a philosophical system that is A ok with suffering as long as the most happiness is derived from said suffering. ok.\n\nYou linked an article on different types of utilitarianism which explained negative utilitarianism. If you read the description, you would know that negative utilitarianism is not a philosophical system which is okay with suffering as long as more happiness is derived, rather it posits that we should minimize the amount of suffering while ignoring possible pleasure caused by this suffering. While this is not exactly what I believe, I am definitely not okay with the immense amounts of suffering caused by bringing animals into the world for animal agriculture, despite the tiny bits of pleasure possibly derived by carnists. I think that it is not, and even \"humane\" farming is not justified. Because of this, I believe my views fit the definition of abolitionism you have provided. I think that animal agriculture is something that will always bring about suffering as long as it exists, and as such should be abolished.  \n\n\n&gt;But in regard to actions and justifying them, Utilitarianism is often used to justify an action after it's been commited or still being commited not as a form of determining what actions should or should not occur based on known consequences.\n\nIf someone is not using known consequences of the actions they are performing to decide what to do morally, they are by definition not a utilitarian. And anyways, it does not matter what other utilitarians do or justify. I personally use my best judgement and commit actions that will minimize suffering as much as I possibly can, which is why I went vegan. \n\n&gt; And while you might actually be adhering to the intended funtionality of consequentialism, it no longer stands for what it once was and as such I have no respect for it. Particularly when poor reasoning skills are involved. I however think that we can do better than Utilitarianism and that is why I uphold an abolitionist view as others before me have with veganism andas others have in regard to the rise of its popular use; combating slavery.\n\nI explained earlier in this reply why I believe my views are compatible with abolitionism. I don't see why you believe consequentialism doesn't \"stand for what it one was\". Could you please cite some specific examples of this?  \n\n\n&gt;Unironically, utilitarianism is the reason why slavery still exists as a lawful punishment in the american justice system under the 13th amendment. \n\nI don't understand where you got this from. Most utilitarian thinkers have been against slavery. Jeremy Betham, often credited as the founder of the philosophy called for the abolition of the practice. He is also known for being an early advocate for animal rights, famously writing \"The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?\". He believed that anyone who could suffer should be protected under the law, and of course that applied to oppressed groups such as slaves. Anyone claiming that keeping slaves is \"utilitarian\" is denying reality.\n\n&gt;Just like unironically utilitarianism will be the reason society will develop its current system into one that will still allow for animals to be abused and taken advantage of. That does not sit well with me because of humanity's current track record in regard to ethics for any sentient being.\n\nHow could this be true at all? Utilitarians are known for being the some of the first ideologies to take a stand for animals. I mentioned the quote from Bentham, but Peter Singer is also a very good example of someone who is vegan because of utilitarianism. He wrote the book \"Animal liberation\", and caused thousands to go vegan as a result of it.   \n\n\nYou make these claims of the bad things caused by utilitarianism without any explanation for how it is the cause of these things.  \n\n\n&gt;No, you're only against forms of farming as long as the scales of pleasure and displeasure tip away from disppleasure.\n\nI am a negative utilitarian so that is untrue.\n\n&gt;And as such that currently facilitates and validates speciesism within veganism. \n\nUtilitarianism is incompatible with speciesism. You can't be against suffering, but only human suffering. Suffering is universal, and as such any speciesist claiming to be a utilitarian is wrong.\n\n&gt;It justifies the cruelty within Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat and any other similar businessed that adopt a hedonistic views in regard to their ethics policy.\n\nHow does it justify these things?\n\n&gt; The definition of veganism states \"as far as is possible and practicable\" and it is certainly possible and practicable to live without those yet utiltarian \"vegans\" will justify it with the exact same reasoning: Their tastebuds are more important than than animal lives.\n\nAgain, what you are saying does not make any sense. How could a utilitarian, much less a negative utilitarian like myself, justify the immense amounts of suffering with \"my tastebuds are more important\". You are blatantly misrepresenting everything utilitarianism stands for.",

I'm just saying that it's ironic how many omnis warn of the risks of a vegan diet, when the vast majority of omnis in Western cultures are on a junk food diet and should worry about their own damn selves before pretending to give a crap about the health of vegans. Meanwhile most vegans are pretty smart about nutrition, because we know that leaving out an entire food group could put them at risk for deficiencies so we go out of our way to avoid that.",

I didn't become Vegan until forty.\n\nThere are open minds that explore in every walk of life that seek to understand the paths of others but do not stray off their own.\n\nThe small scope of people with whom you are aquainted do not represent all paths.\n\nThis is not r/atheism but I will say, in the small sample of atheists I have known, it has been an angry phase but a short one.  I don't pretend to know everything about all atheists so your mileage may very.\n\nBut again, this sub is about Vegans.  There are not many of us but those of us who are Vegan are Christian, Zorraster, Jewish, Atheist, Agnostic, and on and on and on.",
