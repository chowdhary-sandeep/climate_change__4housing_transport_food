{"transport":[{"comment_index":27000,"comment":"&gt;I've offered all along that EV production (including the battery) has a cost, but that it's easily overcome by the cost savings during the consumption phase. Here's a well-respected LCA...\n\nThose are not externalities.  Externalities, by definition, are not direct costs.  Some things did jump out at me from the abstract, though:\n\n\"The net present cost of all vehicles was also calculated resulting in the hybrid being the least expensive over its lifetime, followed by the CV, and finally the BEV. The main purpose of this study was to examine the environmental impact of each vehicle type, taking into account the lifecycle energy usage and both CO2 equivalents and air pollution emitted.\"\n\nSo the lifetime cost of the EV (BEV in their terms) is the most of the three categories.  The only other costs they actually consider is energy usage and CO2 emissions (or their equivalents).\n\n&gt;You on the other hand have completely ignored that there are also negative externalities associated with conventional vehicle production.\n\nNo.  If you re-read the thread, you'll note that I am very careful **not** to state that there are no negative externalities.  I simply stated that considering only negative externalities is not a complete analysis.  I won't reply to the rest of that paragraph since it was based on that incorrect claim.\n\n&gt;The Nissan Leaf battery, for example, weighs 660 lbs, 9 of which are lithium.\n\nGood to know.  Thanks for finding that.\n\nLet's do the next two in reverse order.  \n\n&gt;The article is not a comparative analysis, so I'm not sure what conclusion you're drawing from it.\n\nI cited it to point out the very negative externalities of battery-based EVs.  Sorry wasn't more clear on the reasoning.\n\n&gt;At some point expired EV batteries will need to be recycled, and they will be.\n\nThere are a great many countries that don't have the regulations we have in the U.S.  I am not as inclined to assume recycling will take place as you are.\n\n&gt;No, as I said it's not a comparative analysis, so it makes no such conclusion.\n\nIt needn't be a comparative analysis to identify the negative externalities of battery waste.\n\n&gt;I understand that, and I hope you're right - although the people of Kiribati, at least, will disagree with you.\n\nThis conversation is already getting very long, but to be brief, sea levels were rising prior to major consumption of fossil fuels, and a good portion of SLR is due to aquifers being pumped for agricultural purposes.  It is incorrect to blame only man's CO2 emissions for SLR.\n\n&gt;For that reason I don't understand the place of some junk article claiming that EVs have a low resale value in this sub.\n\nEVs are being pushed as solution by the alarmist crowd, just like windmills.  That's the relevance.  It's great that you like EVs for other reasons, but the chicken littles push EVs for exactly one reason.\n\n&gt;Not to apply a political label to you...\n\nThat would be wise, given that I don't fit easily into any of the common political boxes.\n\n&gt;As far as the EV price premium, that's a little more tricky...\n\nThat's why I suggested a net present value approach.  It allows a comparison of cash flows from both scenarios in terms of present dollars.  The article you cited suggests that the total cost of EVs, once all these costs are considered, is higher than ICE cars, but that ICE cars are more than hybrids at present.  Of course this could all change with higher or lower gasoline prices.\n\n&gt;There's no reason that we can't seek to work on the long term goals of fixing public transportation and re-planning communities at the same time.\n\nThe reason I bring it up is that public funds devoted to subsidies for EVs are funds that cannot be used for providing better public transportation or developing lower transit oriented communities.\n\n&gt;...not nearly enough to change the conclusion that EVs are more efficient overall.\n\nI will state here that I believe EVs are more energy efficient overall, but there is the 7% loss you just identified, plus the loss while charging batteries, plus the loss of powering the EV from the batteries, so it would not be correct to assume 93% efficiency.  (Not that you did.)\n\n&gt;Only Tesla uses these commodity cells for their EVs, and they're dramatically changing that market all by themselves.\n\nTesla is the big mover, so I think it's rather relevant.\n\n&gt;Also their cell costs make up only a small portion of their battery's ultimate price tag...\n\nThe Nissan Leaf battery, if memory serves, costs $15,000.  I don't know how much the price of cells is, but I understand the Leaf's battery is less fancy than Tesla's.\n\n&gt;Huh? Why do you bring up the joke that is the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle?\n\nYour argument was the EVs have massively extended range compared to what they used to have.  I'm pointing out that fuel cell vehicles have similar range, and have had all along.  It's not just about range, but about cost.  Fuel cell vehicles are ridiculously expensive (and will be until fuel cells can be built without platinum or palladium).  EVs, likewise, are much more expensive than ICE vehicles.\n\n&gt;Any talk of battery cost is wholly speculative at this point...\n\nI disagree that it is \"wholly\" speculative.  We can make decent ballpark guess based on, for example, lease prices of batteries and statements of costs made by manufacturers.\n\n&gt;Here's a good piece of speculation[6] you should read, however, that speaks quite to the contrary of whatever it is that you're observing.\n\nThat's actually very much in line with what I've been observing.  Musk is hopeful that, with improvements, their battery pack can drop to $10,000 to $12,000, which isn't too much lower than today's cost of $15,000 for the Leaf battery.\n\n&gt;Thanks for the discussion, by the way!\n\nLikewise.  It seems you've already replied to my reply to part 1, so I'll have a look.  It was my intent to reply to this comment yesterday, but I haven't had the time.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0016936142346821725,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25193016691652903,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.05875597676883141,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.015451406439145407,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2413039448753424,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2905479499421128,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0695147456910945,"ev_1":-0.23774644072302334,"ev_2":-0.21498400442013121,"ev_3":-0.18398481171533376,"ev_4":-0.06280342917434968,"ev_5":-0.09365947199693636,"ev_6":-0.18959006872980874},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Those poor people in Baden-Württemberg... it's going to be *such* a long commute ;)\n\nThey are also getting into the energy storage business:\nhttp://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/autoindustrie/nach-tesla-bringt-auch-daimler-hausbatterien-auf-den-markt-a-1035951.html\n\nNote that this is spearheaded by a certain [Harald Kröger](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=225390057&amp;ticker=TSLA&amp;previousCapId=28974806&amp;previousTitle=OneRiot%252C%2520Inc.), who used to be on [Tesla's board](http://www.autoblog.com/2012/12/22/daimler-exec-harald-kroeger-named-to-tesla-board/).\n\nMaybe Daimler [sold their Tesla shares](http://www.autonews.com/article/20141022/BLOG06/141029932/three-factors-in-daimlers-$780m-sale-of-tesla-stock) because they wanted to get a piece of the business themselves?  Or maybe Tesla practically forced Kröger off the board *because* they knew what he was up to at Daimler?\n\n---\n\nBMW -- or at least a company owned by the same family as BMW, namely the [Quandts](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quandt_(Familie%29) -- is also getting into the game through the company [Solarwatt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarwatt) in Dresden which [Stefan Quandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Quandt) [bought cheap a couple of years ago](http://www.rechargenews.com/solar/article1298057.ece).  They recently [introduced a home battery product](http://www.solarwatt.de/de/ueber_solarwatt/news/news_detailseite/news/solarwatt-gmbh-gewinnt-ees-award-2015-mit-neuem-stromspeicher-myreserve/News/detail/) that complements their solar panels (and works with competitors' as well) through the same DC-DC converter trick that Tesla uses.  Tesla's modules seem to be a lot cheaper, though.  More links:\n\nhttp://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/autoindustrie/stefan-quandt-macht-elon-musk-mit-batterie-konkurrenz-a-1032810.html#ref=plista\nhttp://www.solarwatt.de/index.php?id=4&amp;L=0\nhttp://www.solarwatt.de/speicher/\n\nIt seems to be a Li-Ion product (because it is light-weight and maintenance-free).  I have no idea where they get their cells from.\n\nEdit: grammar","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.26652369653634767,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06713337556257101,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1698527271477417,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1467493232089094,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12370554574897386,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13500513973824596,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21332115249242634,"ev_1":-0.15768713201763904,"ev_2":-0.21266302833134887,"ev_3":-0.10636500560065756,"ev_4":-0.12498230600414469,"ev_5":-0.24256280883370587,"ev_6":-0.1106133675346024},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

But let's focus on the cheap.\n\nA basic Chinese EV like Rowe or Chery (sorry guys, but you're my go-to basic manufacturers) has a something like 20kWh battery and costs under $20k USD.  They go up in quality and price with 40kWh packs common and various types from car-share econobox to... Well to the EP9 with an asking price in the millions of USD.\n\nThe traditional manufacturers (VW, BMW, Chevy, etc.) Maybe... MAYBE had one EV.  Usually either a concept or a hybrid or just nothing.  I think I saw a volt badged as a Buick?  I need to go back through pics.  Nissan badged the leaf as a local domestic.  \n\nI didn't even bother going to Ford.  I wanted to see EVs.\n\nSo if you ask if China is going to go electric, the answer is yes.

Sorry if I wasn't clear, but I'm not trying to argue what \\*is\\* but what \\*should be\\*. Think of things for the moment from the point of view of the average \"Joe 6 pack\" car buyer: A car is a black box that I put \"stuff\" in and it gets me from A to B. I don't care about how it does it; I just care about where to get that \"stuff\" and how much it costs.\n\nI posit that from this point of view the single most important determiner of what a car \\*should\\* be called is what \"stuff\" it uses:\n\n\\*A gasoline car is any car that takes gasoline as its sole energy input. This includes any \"hybrid\" without a plug like a Prius. There are efficient ones and inefficient ones, but all the same you put gas in and that makes it go.\n\n\\*An electric car is any car that takes electricity as its sole energy input. I don't care how the electricity is stored on-board the car, but you get it there by plugging it in (ok to be pedantic you could have wireless charging or whatever too). This in practice means a battery-electric car but it could in theory mean a flywheel or even a hydrogen car IF there's an onboard electrolyzer (not saying that makes sense but in theory it's possible).\n\n\\*A hydrogen car is any car that takes hydrogen as its sole energy input. This could include a FC car or a hydrogen ICE for example. Obviously the FC is more efficient and makes much more sense (yeah I know it uses electricity to spin the wheels just like an EV - duh), but again to Joe 6 pack it hardly make a difference. Find and buy some hydrogen and make it go.\n\n\\*A hybrid car is any car that takes 2 or more energy inputs. Those inputs are preferably named before hybrid - e.g. a Volt or any of today's PHEVs is a \"gas/electric hybrid\" but there could certainly be other kinds like \"hydrogen/electric\" if a FC car came with a plug. Note that under this definition only plug-in hybrids \"count\" - it's a shame that the Prius came along first and bastardized the term. By the way, to again be pedantic under your Prius-friendly definition of hybrid just about \\*any\\* gas car counts, since they all have 12V batteries and starter motors.\n\nThe naming convention we have now obviously doesn't fit this ideal, because it's mostly been settled upon via accident or marketing rather than via reason. So I'm just trying to strive for something better. :) The terms we choose to use have real consequences: If we're ok with calling Priuses \"hybrid electric\" or Mirais \"electric vehicles\" then don't be surprised when you see them parking in your charging stations (both of which I encountered today), as an example.

Currently Americans drive 19% more, or 924,358 million miles annually, or 2,532 million miles per day, or 106 million miles per hour.\n\nAt, say, 350 watt-hours per mile, the whole system would suck up 36,932 MW or 8.06% of the current US electricity consumption of 458,311 MW (4014.8 TWh/yr).  \n\nCurrently there are 4,154,727 miles of highways in the US.  With a gas station every 50 miles that's a power requirement of 444 kW.  Peak will be 2-3x that, with some stations obviously needing much higher.  Distribution along the highway would need less than 20 kVA (500 mile runs, 10 stations, 1.5 MW per station) which is a lot of load to add to a local substation but nothing crazy.  Larger substations won't even notice it.  Might even be able to use the same wires as the gas station.  \n\nMore highly used roads will require bigger links, but they'll also be *much* closer to much larger power distribution.  It should generally even out since mostly the ratio of people driving to people living nearby will be similar, and the limiting factor will be the local substation.  \n\nWith most level 3 chargers you'll probably need a battery, long term, to avoid special dispensations from power companies.  Even just 10 minutes of buffer would be more than enough; the life of the battery is far more important.  A single powerpack would be enough capacity to level out load, but the power out is pretty high.  Three (150 kW total) would probably be a minimum.

Honda, Toyota, and Subaru are practically non-existent in the EV market.\n\nUntil manufacturers can bring prices down and increase production capacity to meet mass market demands EV adoption will plateau probably around 20-25% market share for the next 10-15 years.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1755130541897525,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27187783163026324,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17839060228708375,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2088488361193465,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2912961946294672,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.05175443614522616,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.016319719531262915,"ev_1":-0.003797191573539749,"ev_2":-0.05907622750964947,"ev_3":-0.0007915105282639464,"ev_4":-0.00182733100761349,"ev_5":-0.00041776268335524946,"ev_6":-0.07562569191213697,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.05586401453256258},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

It is almost impossible to predict how this will turn out 5 or 10 or 20 years from now. \n\nFor example, the investor owned utilities in CA are moving to a 2 tier system over the next few years where Tier 2 will be 20% higher than tier 1. There will also be a \"Super User\" tier which presumably won't affect most customers, although I haven't seen details on that yet.  So lets say Tier 1 ends up increasing a bit to $0.17/kwh. Tier 2 would be about $0.21/kwh. Tiers 3 and 4 would go away.  With a PPA, you've locked in to $0.16/kwh, which I assume increases 3% every year. 3% compounded annually adds up pretty quickly, so how much will you really be saving in 5 years?  10 years?  15 years?\n\nThe reimbursement rates for excess electricity sold back to the grid WILL BE changing in the future. Right now, the utilities pay full retail rate, because solar is covering for expensive peaker plants.  However, 10 years from now when there is too much solar, they might only pay the wholesale rate of about $0.03/kwh for excess electricity sold back to the grid.  That's why Solar City wants to overbuild. They have a pretty good idea of where things are headed in the future, and are willing to lose money now if it means in the future they will be able to charge you $0.16/kwh, pay you $0.03/kwh and pocket the difference.\n\nAlso, does the contract require you to go on to time of use billing?  I'm guessing it does.  Even though Net Metering means you get 1 kwh back for every 1 kwh you give, the prices of those aren't the same if you are time of use billing. Right now 1 kwh has more value mid afternoon and less value in the evening/night.  However, that will soon be flipping so that 1 kwh will have more value at night and less value in the afternoon.  This means you could be paying $0.30 or $0.40/kwh for electricity at night when your solar panels aren't working. There goes all the money you saved....or didn't save...during the day.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.040325044731919966,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19128151679481603,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.30076101866894167,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2864034798995505,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24504128470405176,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.12840182582537332,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.027148297308788944,"solar_1":-0.2482089689641119,"solar_2":-0.049332527994314056,"solar_3":-0.058109957986630434,"solar_4":-0.2210255096100161,"solar_5":-0.04058711823017802,"solar_6":-0.08559353433469882,"solar_7":-0.1318358470549962,"solar_8":-0.1466661361038665,"solar_9":-0.19258752706860924,"solar_10":-0.1667517158061176},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro.

So the net-metered value, plus the RECs, transfer to the project developer and not the solar lease participant.\n\nOne participant I've talked with mentioned a price escalator of 2.75%/year, which is roughly 0.1% below expected Xcel rate hikes. However, the participant does not start to save money until year 16, because he starts at a higher premium rate. All said, the participant pays about 15% more on their electric bill to finance local solar in his area. Because the renewable capacity is utility mandated, the only real benefit in participation is to help the state voluntarily meet the goals without everybody having to pay for it, and project development in the local area (instead of state area). At this point, I think its worth noting that the particpant would see greater environmental benefit if he spent his money on solar recs which would be EXCLUDED from the state mandate market rather than INCLUDED. \n\nShould voluntary donations be used to meet state mandate goals? I think that's a matter of customer comprehension. But I don't think these participants are very well educated on what exactly they are supporting.\n\nThe solar lease participant is effectively providing the purchase guarantee the the project is profitable, but paying a premium above retail electric purchase rates, and not receiving any environmental benefits (RECs).

You can not feed in to the grid without a net metering agreement without serious fines, and risk of disconnection.\n\nThrowing around \"at retail rate\" is all well and good but you ignore the other fees, taxes, etc. associated.

They usually get it from large generators, and have to pay tax on it, as well as transmit charges to multiple transmissions carriers, and often other fees associated with the type of generation and fuel used.   There is further lose in the transmission such that they buy 1kwh something less than 1kwh.\nWith distributed (net metering) it is all on their distribution network, there are no taxes, very little if any losses, no additional load on sub stations to get the power from transmission to distribution.   Further in many states, there is nothing stopping the utilities from charging MORE for the power they get from net metering.

It has sunshine like in Alaska, and relatively constant wind can only be found close to the North Sea.\n\nBut it has about 44 million passenger cars.\n\nAssuming about 0.15 kWh needed to move your average car for a kilometer with an average usage of about 11.000 km per year, and 44 millions cars, you need about 73 TWh per year for individual transport in Germany.\n\nA BEV has a wheel-to-source-factor of no more than 1.5, so you need 73*1.5 ~ 110 TWh. Fuel cells with hydrogen from renewables have a wheel-to-source-factor of at least 3. So, one needs to build wind and solar power plants for 73 * 3 ~ 220 TWh. And if the numbers in the article (\"three times as many windmills\") are closer to the truth, you'll need close to 330 TWh.\n\nFor comparison, all of Germany's wind turbines (incl. offshore) produced just about 110 TWh in 2018.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0035516167990863323,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11661362449444823,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.29191448004699894,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17809706776407971,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3946271325120345,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.05757938822110494,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.015005175392919531,"solar_1":-0.13429908444643507,"solar_2":-0.11567222135745756,"solar_3":-0.15470858861608336,"solar_4":-0.05179794157443746,"solar_5":-0.2723158391597442,"solar_6":-0.006292826091036356,"solar_7":-0.00605277402549594,"solar_8":-0.08448640427620073,"solar_9":-0.03375377995507023,"solar_10":-0.16292151085264728},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Take a look at [Kaspersky's analysis of the CP25 Home unit](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/12/13084354/ChargePoint-Home-security-research_final.pdf).) and the CPE250 DC Fast stations are also built in-house. Tritum was a supplier for 50kW stations (commonly deployed with [Georgia Power's state-wide charger network](https://photos.plugshare.com/photos/197591.jpg)) and the [Express 100 CCS machines](https://www.chargepoint.com/files/datasheets/ds-cpe100.pdf) are made by some other company that I can't recall off the top of my head. ChargePoint has been working towards vertical integration, they're the only company I've seen going that route. Electrify, EVgo, and Greenlots all depend on third party hardware providers (ABB, Signet, BTCPower, Efacec).\n\nWhat I'd like to see are EVSE that have integrated batteries to help avoid the demand charges. I suspect ChargePoint might be the first to get to that, they're very aware of the demand charge issue.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008873869470941523,"1.1.1_stance":-0.07259731934730099,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24977371875598262,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09774455179770787,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3248869879965486,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2504362528938635,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06785749191961561,"solar_1":-0.0685069088600964,"solar_2":-0.046990324275005456,"solar_3":-0.020517247129949585,"solar_4":-0.0423158555355864,"solar_5":-0.00665301650587935,"solar_6":-0.1804691350310653,"solar_7":-0.017972762672191795,"solar_8":-0.01675693806585817,"solar_9":-0.16277002263086615,"solar_10":-0.10789361559485162},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Even existing plants emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant. However, all plants also emit 4.4\ng-CO2e/kWh from the water vapor and heat they release. This contrasts with solar panels and wind turbines, which reduce heat or water vapor fluxes to the air by about 2.2 g-CO2e/kWh for a net difference from this factor alone of 6.6 g-CO2e/kWh.  \n         \n>• On top of that, because all nuclear reactors take 10-19 years or more between planning and operation vs. 2-5 year for utility solar or wind, nuclear causes another 64-102 g-CO2/kWh over 100 years to be emitted from the background grid while consumers wait for it to come online or be refurbished, relative to wind or solar.  \n                \n>• Overall, emissions from new nuclear are 78 to 178 g-CO2/kWh, not close to 0.   \n               \n>Table 3.5 Total 100-year CO2e emissions from several different energy technologies ...

It makes money by just existing no matter if it works or not. \n\nConsumer, commercial & industral panels. \nConsumer are the flimsy, low output panels with no product liability insurance, and exclusively imported to make a huge profit margin since they are quality control scrubs/culls to start with. \n\nCommercial panels are what you see on most roof tops, metal frame, glass faced, meet a certain US standard so they don't quit working or burn the house down immedately... Then they are marked WAY up to maximize profits, and the installer gets paid to (Poorly) install the panels and (questionable) inverter. \n\nIndustral panels, like the power company uses, and big, heavy things with nearly bullet proof glass, incredibly strong steel frames, and you will play hell finding them, IF you could afford them...\n\nKeep in mind these are manufactured by an oil/fossil fuel company, (See: BP solar, Semana, etc) so profits for manufacturing goes right back into the pockets of fossil energy/grid companies... Then the BIG swindle begins when they are sold...\n\nThis is by design. The higher the cost, the more tax credits, rebates, carbon credits (they can sell) they will get. These are out there to PRETEND they are more efficient/longer lived than the lower cost panels. \n\nThe only real advantage industral panels had was higher operating voltages. The gap has closed between industral & commercial panels in that regard, which is good for the small consumer with big solar (big solar means a lot of panels that can produce the higher voltages).\n\nThe average home owner is still screwed with rooftop since space for panels is limited. The guys with ground mount or big warehouse rooftops benifit. \n\nJust follow the Department Of Defense recommendations from the early/mid 90s...\n\nDecentralized power grids, 'Mini-Grids' (instead of micro-grid). Local production and use us MUCH more efficient than power plant/grid since about 80% of the energy is wasted in production & distribution.\n\nOf course, you get to pay a premium for 100% of the costs, for deliver of 20% (or less) of the power. \n\nMini grids let you swap/loan excess power with neighbors without the gawd awful line losses over hundreds of miles. \n\nYou also get more reliable power since a storm or plant failure 100 or 200 miles away doesn't effect you in the slightest. \n\nThe third big deal is you own the equipment. No one can decide FOR YOU they want to spend billions on upgrades, or just decide they aren't making enough profit and jack your rates to the moon. \n\nGeo-whatever... \n\nThe amount of sun hours ÷ the sun angle, multiplied by the number of panels... not a big deal since this is THROUGHLY researched and available on line from a number of resources. \n\nThe rule in solar you can't seem to get through people's heads (30 years of experence in trying)... **SOLAR POWER & SHADE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE**\n\nPeriod. There are no exceptions. \n\n**It's simple, shaded panels produce little to no power.

I don't really see a reason to cut those things out completely (at least not personally). I still really like vegan cupcakes and rice milk chocolate. I'm not sure I could be \"really happy\" on any diet that didn't have chocolate. But then I don't consider myself to be \"on a diet\", anymore than a Jewish person is \"on a diet\" if they keep kosher.  \n\nI drink mostly water and sometimes homemade smoothies, but occasionally I'll have some tea or coffee. I do like stevia in some drinks (not as artificial as most no-cal sweeteners, but the more natural stevia tastes too \"green\" for me).   \n\nJust be careful not to overdo the weight loss. It is possible to lose too much or just too quickly. And when you are losing a lot of weight you often need to be careful about dietary deficiencies (whether you're vegan or not). \n\nIf you haven't already, you might want to pick up Eat to Live.

Shortly after making the decision I decided to get my Plant based certification through @ecornell_online and start up a whole food plant based online business, where I would help people make the transition in a healthy way. Shortly after this I became educated on the benefit this lifestyle has on the planet and for the animals. Since learning about how animals are treated through documentaries, @earthlinged YouTube videos and my own personal research I became big on vegan activism. Now I can truly say first in foremost I am vegan for the animals. Yes I am still a very health conscious person but once I was shown the truth and gained awareness around what was really going on in the animal agricultural industry I couldn’t stay quiet. Every single living being in this world is worthy of love and compassion. Every single living being should have the right to live out their days exactly as they please and NEVER have their life stripped away for unnecessary reasons. I am living proof that you can THRIVE on a WFPB Vegan lifestyle and I will spend the rest of my life sharing this knowledge with others. \n\nIf you need any help on transitioning just message me I got you ♥️🌱","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.008971354613701502,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2720894096419215,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.04409150173830767,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22261749489217664,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2732023131402959,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.010170719738804715,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.010699764243327081,"diet_1":-0.1277747823477995,"diet_2":-0.06582761923837666,"diet_3":-0.1220923939162617,"diet_4":-0.275546473989655,"diet_5":-0.14182654447541784,"diet_6":-0.17128616968528818,"diet_8":-0.00849913901402033,"diet_9":-0.04963166235635678,"diet_10":-0.06849665491608903,"diet_11":-0.009341157623566687,"diet_13":-0.12630685203512992,"diet_14":-0.09046023083889547,"diet_17":-0.23804367436499985},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.
