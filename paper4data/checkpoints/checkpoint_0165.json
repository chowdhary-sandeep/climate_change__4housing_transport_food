Looking at this, it doesn't actually change anything that has to do with charging an EV, it just changes the location. You still have to maintain the charging infrastructure, and there still has to be some management of that involved, so it looks like all that's happening is that the overhead is being shifted from individuals and businesses to local governments.\n\n&gt;need a place to charge for 3-4 hours (which I would not prefer to spend at a gas station), you can charge at the park and spend a few hours outside. \n\nSeems like it would be more reasonable to charge the vehicle while you're at work. You're there for 4-8 hours anyway, so it's not like you have to find the time to go there.\n\n&gt; Additionally, this is a made up model that is expected to be put into a community where people are traveling to and from home, work, and the grocery. so the park could be used as common area for community interaction, when you don't want to use your main vehicle for short trips. \n\nA laudable goal, but isn't that the goal of *all* parks? Given the lack of parks in the country in general I don't think we'd see a great groundswell of new parks, but rather see municipalities retrofit charging stations into existing parks, many of which are quite sizable.",

I'm reaping frankly ridiculous health benefits, as a side effect, it was never *why* I went vegan. I'm not sure I could pin my veganism down to any one reason, more like there were just too many reasons to go for it. The only things holding me back were societal norms and convenience, which are not a factor for me nowadays. \n\nReally the only hard part is having compassion for other humans. To me it all seems so damn simple, stop eating animals and look at all the good we can accomplish! But I have to remember, I was once an ignorant omni too, and I had to get to veganism on my own terms. If anybody would have been pushy to me I can almost guarantee I would of resisted simply to resist.\n\nIt has really brought out my inner 'hippy'; it's almost like I leveled up in being a responsible world citizen. I'm buying a new car before the new year. It will be an EV/plug-in hybrid (I really like the Chevy Volt), at the *very* least a Prius. I recycle more than I throw away, I actually have a tab open right now because I want to start composting in my apartment, my 'trash' is almost exclusively biomass.\n\nAnd it's been very easy the entire way.",

Commercial demand management is ~2-3x more cost effective application of grid-connected battery banks than energy arbitrage, therefore, it will suck up the batteries from the market as batteries transition into mainstream.\n\n2. Hawaii has installed &lt;1% of the United State's solar power, and it's an island, so that's not a great example. I think Australia has very harsh interconnection policies, which make batteries more appealing (you can install the solar on a switch to avoid interconnection).\n\n3. I'm not talking about the early adopter market. I agree that residential customers are more likely to be early adopters.",

There are countless people who bought a Model S instead of even cheaper ICE alternatives, for example - including some middle class consumers coming from used cars and lower-priced ICEs.  $40K for a Model 3 (and I do agree that people will be sorely tempted to option up *at least* to that, if not higher) where they no longer have to buy gas or oil changes or any of the other maintenance that comes with an ICE may very well be worth it...and an optioned-up Bolt is going to be in a very similar price range but it looks like *without* any infrastructure similar to the supercharger network.\n\nI agree about battery packs - perhaps the Gigafactory will have enough capacity to supply other manufacturers too, it sure seems like it...but even if they don't, battery tech seems to be evolving and coming down in price at a good clip.",

"comment": "In some areas, honestly, there is no good viable solution except home charging. I belong to an i3 Facebook group and Texas is particularly bad with charging stations. They're often 50 miles apart (or out of the way) and if one is broken... or there's a huge heatwave...\n\n(This is why a lot of higher end EVs have the option of a range extender to make it like a better Volt.) \n\nBut to answer your question: Any public or commuter parking garage. Any RV or trailer park. Any Ford/Nissian/BMW/Volkswagen/Smart/Chevy dealership. Their workplace might offer charging. A neighbor might offer charging through PlugShare (a search engine for charging stations). If they have a ground floor apartment, odds are they can reach an outside outlet if they're close enough to the street. \n\nAnother option might be to take the average $500/year you're going to save on fuel costs (and more on maintenance) and invest in a rental that would give you accessible charging. \n\nAnd odds are if someone in your area is selling used EVs, the charging infrastructure is there, you just need to do your research and see if it will work for you.",

"comment": "Personally I think this is a very complicated and nuanced issue that can’t be answered simply.\n\nLet’s assume that for any system not life-or-death safety critical over a given size and complexity it’s too expensive to prove that the software doesn’t contain any bugs. (These guys ought to know what they’re doing, right? https://it.slashdot.org/story/07/02/25/2038217/software-bug-halts-f-22-flight)\n\nWith that assumption made; updates can be issued to any system that is designed to allow software/firmware updates. How they are delivered has changed over the years. \n\nOperating systems and software used to be delivered on floppies. Then the Internet came and made patch distribution easier. Up to where we are now and some of our software is self-updating and most people probably don’t even know that chrome updates itself in the background and if you just restart your computer (or just chrome) every now and then the updates are entirely silent. \n\nThe amount of software in cars have grown significantly over the last 30 years, and modern electric cars are even more software oriented than ICE cars. Not that ICE vehicles don’t have a lot of software nowadays, but they have an electromechanical legacy. \n\nBuilding “good” software is difficult. Building good systems even more so. That’s how researchers were able to hack driving FCA vehicles using an FM radio transmitter. By updating the software on the radio they were able to disable the brakes. \n\nModern software problems require modern software solutions, like OTA updates and regular security patching throughout the product lifecycle. \n\nAbsence of this can lead to major issues down the road, like theft sprees that we’ve seen in Britain targeting older (pre 2011) BMWs or newer Range Rovers (a few years back), or recalls to fix software issues (Polestar 2). \n\nWhat OTA updates isn’t is a silver bullet. Design the system wrong and you’ve introduced a security hazard.\n\nOTA updates doesn’t absolve manufacturers from proper software design and testing, but it allows for proper rollout of fixes when a bug is inevitably found. It also allows for feature and interface updates, but the latter is obviously not required. \n\nPersonally I much prefer receiving updates that make my product on-par with what’s being sold today instead of sitting with the feeling that the manufacturers keep holding back things just so they can introduce something new for the next model year.",

Most of the interstate system is covered by both systems and most of what I came across when we had Tesla was gen2 so charging speed was cut in half unless we were in a rural area without any traffic. Add to that the Tesla stops were in shit locations like down a spur requiring doubling back to get on highways. Or in a parking lot of a single restaurant. EA was always full speed (no sharing), higher capacity (350kW vs 150kW if not sharing), and in shopping centers or at least just a Walmart super center where you can use the crapper without feeling bad for not eating there. Overall the locations, amenities, and speed was much better with EA. When we traded the Tesla in for an Audi the charging network was not even remotely a consideration.",

Plugged in using the granny cable daily in the warehouse at work. Because of it's limited range I never took it on road trips, I think in 3 years it only ever rapid charged once when we didn't have any spare fleet to borrow for a 150 mile round trip. Was ok, but then in the UK we're on 240v so even the granny charges at twice the speed of the same in the US\n\nEdit: we moved offices a few years ago and I installed a charger at the new workplace. Still only 16amp though, so 3.3kW max, still faster than the granny which would pull 2.7kW. Use it to charge my Kona daily and soon the Model 3 that will be replacing it. It gets more than enough mileage per work day to cover the commute and then some",

"comment": "The question is whether they will buck the trend of high end luxury trucks and jeeps with practical utility as an afterthought, or whether they will actually try to continue in International's footsteps as the maker of rugged and cheaper vehicles designed for work. International Harvester was first and foremost an agricultural equipment maker, and even after that a maker of heavy duty trucks. Their lineup of light trucks and utility vehicles always reflected their primarily industrial outlook in every way. They were rugged, not overly luxurious, and their styling was always a little outdated. They did not even have suburban dealerships, but only sold out of industrial parks and farm equipment retailers. But that was all what made them so endearing, a stodgy company that didn't try to please anyone, it just tried to make good trucks. \n\nIH's bankruptcy came less from market failure and more from an absurd case of anti-union hubris on the part of the new CEO, but even still it is difficult to see a similar company thriving, much less being born anew out of the current auto manufacturing world. This has every appearance as being a weak attempt to cash in on a venerable American brand, and more especially the Scout model, without really understanding or caring at all what made it special in the first place. I really hope VW knocks it out of the park on this one, but I am pretty much resigned to seeing some Rivian clones and generic suburb crawling SUVs. Maybe in 20 years there will be a proper heir to IH and the Scout under a different name.",

"comment": "Yeah that's not always accurate, but as always, it depends. The Hybrid Synergy Drive Toyota uses, for example, has 5 moving parts in the hybrid transmission. Atkinson cycle ICE engine means very low stresses, and less wear and tear. No ancilliaries run off the engine (making use of the battery instead) and the EV side of things is... well...a motor. It uses the same reduction gear design as any other EV, just with an extra gear meshed into it (the ring gear of the planetary gearset). Apart from an extra oil and filter change, it's closer to an EV than it is to most ICEs.\n\nWhereas having an EV and an ICE means all the associated costs of an ICE (along with your ancilliaries, clutches or multi-gear transmissions, or belt driven CVTs) and an EV as well (Which still has the reduction gear, another cooling system, etc.)\n\nThe majority of the costs of a vehicle are still outside the ICE engine and transmission - the vast majority of EVs still have CV joints, diffs, tyres, wheels, brakes, electronics, headlight bulbs, etc.  - doubling all of those up to have a \"less complex\" powertrain (that isn't actually less complex) isn't really that beneficial overall.\n\nBut there are bad PHEVs just as there are bad ICE cars and EVs - it just depends on the implementation.",

A site planned for 10 stalls could be enough today but not enough in a year once it’s built. \n\nI am sure companies like EA are very hesitant to put in big stations as they could be under utilized in the future when home and work charging becomes more common.",

If your panel is rated at 250w then you need 4 per kWh or about 800 solar panels in ideal sunlight would give you £10.00 per hour.\n\nYou can get panels for about £100, so ideally a 500 kwh setup of 2000 panels should easily give you an annual income of over £10.00 per hour over a year.  Initial investment in panels £200,000 then land, setup and installation and you could have a 20 year medium wage machine for an initial investment similar to a decent size mortgage.\n\nThe problem is the loan or mortgage with fixed and not sunlight linked repayments means that a cloudy year could wreck my dream solar farm.",

"comment": "This is a good question!  Thank you for asking it.  The question of \"is the world warming\" is an interesting one.  Yes, in the short term (measured in decades), it is warming. We are most certainly warmer today than we were 3 decades ago, 5 decades ago, 8 decades ago.  So, there are several questions that this observation sparks.  How much warmer are we?  Why have we warmed?  What harm has been caused thus far by this warming?  What will happen if we continue to warm?\n\nYou say **1+1 is fucking 2** and I agree that is true. We could say A+B=C, and then set A to 288.5, B to 0.6, and find that C is equal to 289.1.  Then, when this isn't scary enough, we adjust A to be equal to 288, and B to be equal to 1.2, so that when we measure 289.2 on the thermometer, we can say \"see!  warming is out of control!\"\n\nThe reason I bring this up is that this seems to be what the Climate Scientists have done.  They have adjusted the raw readings of the past to be about a half a degree cooler than what the scientists agreed upon 30 years ago, and adjusted the way we calculate today's readings to add a good bit of warming today.  \n\nStill, the warming isn't out of control, not like the Climate Scientists say that it must be.  They continue to harp on the idea that the temperature is a record high.  But, for the last 35 years, they've been telling us that we should be warming by more than 0.2º per decade.  It should be 0.3º to 0.4º warmer today than it was at the turn of the century, as an average, not just during peak years.  We should have \"warmest year ever\" a couple of times per decade, at least.\n\nThe other question is \"is this temperature unprecedented?\"  The climate scientists would have us believe that the temperature of the planet has been supremely stable over the last 10,000 years, and has spiked up in the last 35 years to way over any temperature we've ever seen.  I am CERTAIN this is a lie.  Not a mistake, but a deliberate falsehood. \n\nWe have very good evidence that warm periods have happened every 900 to 1100 years, and we're in one now.  This is natural.  We may have artificially increased the warming over what nature has done for us, but ignoring and denying the historical fact of warm periods that have happened is dishonest.  So, warm periods (the Medieval Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period, the Minoan Warm Period, etc.) were likely at least this warm, some of them may have been warmer.\n\nDid we all die out? no.  Did the Polar Bears all die out?  no.  Did civilization die out?  Actually, civilization thrived during the warm periods, and declined during the cold periods.  We are thriving today.   Is this a coincidence?  Is the human race better off when crops don't grow because of super short growing seasons?  Or when crops grow well, because of increased growing seasons?  Do crops grow better when starved of CO2, or when they have surplus CO2?  \n\nI would argue that we are in a sweet spot right now, where it's warmer than it was in the 1600s, where we have closer to optimal levels of CO2 for crops and other plant life than we did in the 1700s.  \n\nIf you look at the world of 100 years ago, it was warming at 0.075º C per decade, with a 60 year cyclical trend of amplification and dampening.  When the cycle was in the rising phase, we saw between 0.15º and 0.17º per decade rise in temperatures.  See 1910 to 1940, for example.  When it was in the falling cycle, we saw flat to slowly falling temperatures.  See 1880 to 1910 temperature trends, for example, and again from 1945 to 1975, and again from 2003 through this year (and likely through 2030).  \n\nIt is entirely possible that our land-use changes, our greenhouse gas emissions have altered the long term trend, moving it from, say 0.075º per decade to 0.09º per decade, or even slightly higher.  It's possible that we will continue to see the long term trend change to higher rates.  But, when will it become dangerous to our ecosystem?  I don't know.\n\nHonestly, I don't know.  \n\nWhat do we do about it?  Well, I think it's fairly clear that the time that we can continue to dig up fossil fuels to power our society is coming to an end.  There are a lot of reasons for this, and climate is one of them - but not the biggest one.  We have too much plastic in our ecosystem, too much carbon soot, too much complex chemicals given off by burning oil and coal.  We are also going to run out of easy and cheap fossil fuels.  \n\nAnd, besides, the sun puts a LOT of energy on the surface of the planet every day.  We're getting better and better at converting that energy into something can use.  Most of the energy systems that we think of as renewable are derivatives of solar energy.  Solar PV, solar heat, wind, hydro-electric and even coal and crude oil are all really just solar energy.  We should use all of that, and use a lot of it.\n\nIf we improve efficiency of transforming solar energy to electricity, to providing heat transportation (that's heating, cooling, cooking, refrigeration, etc.), goods transportation, and all of the things that we're doing, we use less energy doing each of these things.  If we improve the ability to collect that energy, we'll eventually get to the point where we can use excess energy to turn waste products into liquid energy storage - oil, for example.  We know how to do that today, but it's more expensive than just digging it out of the ground.  \n\nAt some point in the future, oil itself might be considered a renewable resource, because we won't be sucking it out of the ground, but rather growing the raw materials for it on farms.  It will not longer be a \"fossil fuel\" but rather a modern, renewable fuel.  Imagine that.",

I think the cost without the electrical upgrade was around $3.80/watt installed.\n\nWe went with SunPower 335W panels so we could get squeeze the entire 6kW system on one plane of our roof. 6kW should cover 95%  of our current annual usage.\n\nWe're paying for the whole thing out of pocket, to avoid loan fees and interest. Even so, it looks like it will take us around 15 years to break even on the purchase.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: the utilities aren't going to keep offering free net metering for the next 25 years. Eventually there's going to be some sort of connection fee, if there isn't already (My utility has a connection fee and is going to add a \"load factor adjustment\" fee next year).",

The rest is wiring a cutoff switch and connecting things to your power panel, something any qualified electrician can do.\n\nAs far as the permits, and negotiating with your power company (if you go grid-tie), every story is different apparently.\n\nBTW, you will need a shit ton of those “powerwalls” to go off-grid.  Either that, or you need to live really small.",

"comment": "So oversizing the bussbar allows you to ignore the panel enclosure rating? If you put a 200 amp busbar into a 100 amp enclosure, could you put 200 amps of continuous load breakers onto the panel? Nope.\n\nBut you are stating that you could feed 270 amps into a 200 amp rated enclosure, by using a \"solar ready\" panel with a 225A busbar. One problem is you might have 300A of residential load breakers on that panel - a common practice for non-continuous loads. \n\nUnless the panel itself is rated to match the busbar, such as a 225 amp panel rating on its sticker, then you could easily have an issue where the home is drawing ~190A from the utility and ~50A from the solar array, on a 200A rated panel. In other words, you are pulling more amperage through the panel than what the panel is rated for.  This can become problematic as the solar home gets hungry for more variable loads (EV charging, smart HVAC systems, etc).\n\nWhy are line side taps expensive? Typically they are fewer penetrations, and you don't have to deal with any existing electrical issues inside the client's existing electrical rooms? It often simplifies the wire run. \n\nSupply-side taps avoid the tendency to treat a solar breaker connection on the \"load side\" to be \"actually a line that could potentially meet all the electrical needs of the house\". Why not just feed all that through the 200A main breaker and not worry about over-loading the panel? Believe me, if the house ever burns down, they're going to look long and hard about whether or not the panel was over-loaded at the time.\n\nLikewise, \n\nThe largest point you are missing on batteries is that there will be a huge difference on the load center. If you are already maxing out your 20% extra space with your solar array, then later, when you retrofit a battery-bank on its own inverter, or perhaps a back-up generator, or perhaps both.... well, you're out of amperage.\n\nPutting some time in to think about the future electrical needs of your client, I can't imagine an instance where you need to use the 20% rule, where a supply-side tap isn't a better solution.\n\nFinally, there's the issue of whether your employer should allow you to work a service panel \"hot\". Under no circumstance can a line-side connection be performed hot, whereas I'd wager most load-side connections have the electrician mess around inside a hot panel. This is typically because they don't want to schedule the utility to pull the meter ahead of commissioning.",

"comment": "Is utilities are home solar \"unfriendly\" then they will shoot themselves in the foot when battery storage becomes cheap enough to go off grid.  Instead of tying to the grid for emergencies like too many cloudy days or a failure in the inverter one can simply put in a propane standyby generator.  Then they don't need the grid for backup.  Once you have enough  batteries to not need the grid, the grid becomes simply backup.\n\nNow if the person stays tied because the grid is solar friendly, then software and hardware gets developed to let the utility buy power from the home owners battery storage, then they truly don't need peak plants and the power is very distributed, making it more  robust.",

"comment": "&gt; Perhaps as much as 98% of the residential solar energy supplied to the grid is located where demand existed prior.\n\nThat's really an argument to support the utility buying solar power at peak wholesale rates, not peak retail rates.\n\nAlso, this argument falls apart pretty quickly as more solar is installed.  California only has 5% of energy use from solar and they are already starting to see problems with too much solar at wrong times of the day.\n\nAlso, as solar installs increase, there become engineering challenges/costs to deal with distributed power generation on the grid.",

"comment": "On a personal level, having electric vehicles and solar panels reduces my dependency on foreign nations and the local grid. Power storage takes that even further. On a national level, alternative energy shortens the logistics tail, which saves lives, and ideally keep our troops at home.\n\nWith a smarter grid, and greater proliferation of rooftop solar, the ability to take out a target that causes widespread outages gets lower and lower. Unfortunately there's significant resistant from all sides to making grids smarter. As you said, security is still an issue, but there should be the ability to go to island mode at the micro grid level, if not the building level. I don't see the grid as a bigger risk than pipelines. Take San Diego. A single pipeline brings all the gasoline into the majority of the county. I didn't like being that vulnerable. I want to be on the grid, but I don't want to depend 100% on the grid.",

"comment": "I purchased a home with a Solar system lease already in place. I didn't have much choice at that time, but I love solar. I would have likely gotten a system in a few years anyway. \n\nThe system is currently grid tied, but I'd like to get a battery system setup and reduce my dependency on the grid. Just the other day a few transformers blew up in spectacular black smokey fashion down the street and we were waiting on SCE to fix the power for about 6 hours.  That was 6 hours where because I'm grid tied I had no power, and wasn't generating any. Was a major bummer. The net metering is cool, we don't use a lot of power and the house was sized for a full 4 bedroom house, so i expect even in hotter months with A/C we'll not have to pay much to SCE and may even make a little back.",

"comment": "It is easy to look at the world and give up, but that doesn’t help. I learned to look at positive changes I can feasibly make in my own life, and then realized that other people can do it to when they have to. I know we need to change our lifestyles TODAY, but for a lot of people (myself included), that is just financially possible. But, write out a 5-year plan to significantly make these changes. The changes below won’t be easy, but they are extremely plausible. Do them, and convince other people to do the same. The amazing future utopia we all dream about can be here within the next few generations. We just have to make it there.\n\n-Immediately cut gasoline usage by &gt;10% by walking/biking for local errands. Within 3 years, at least one of our two cars will be hybrid or electric. Within 5 years, one will be electric, and the other will be hybrid or electric.\n\n-Within 2 months we can cut our electric consumption by 1/4 (retrofit house with LEDs and smart thermostats to start). Within 2 years, at least 50% of my home electric will be from renewable resources. Within 5 years, at least 90%. (This one also assumes that our local utility will also be partially providing from renewable resources as pressures mount).\n\n-Within 2 months reduce meat consumption by 75-80%. Plant a vegetable garden within a year and grow as much as possible.\n\n-Cut garbage waste by half within 4 months. This can be roughly measured by looking at how full your garbage can is when you bring it to the curb. \n\n-Convince my boss to setup a cogen system and consider a solar field. The cogen system make perfect sense for us (use waste heat from compressors in the drying stage of our process). The solar field is a tough sell, but if the money makes sense, he will pounce on it.",

Operational wastes need to be disposed daily, and must be disposed of daily to prevent toxic and unmanageable buildup.  Broken panels can theoretically be recycled at the factory level in small batches due to the one and done nature of the material.  Besides, more solar panels are being recycled in relative material generated as opposed to coal fly ash.\n\n\nWait.. THE VERGE?!?  Seriously?  The same people who screwed up a PC build and called all their critics racist?  THAT VERGE?",

"comment": "&gt;With the ability to design dielectric metamaterials in this way, Padilla and Nadell are working to engineer a new type of thermophotovoltaic device, which creates electricity from heat sources. Such devices work much like solar panels, except they absorb specific frequencies of infrared light instead of visible light.\n&gt;\n&gt;Current technologies radiate infrared light in a much wider frequency range than can be absorbed by the infrared solar cell, which wastes energy. A carefully engineered metamaterial tuned to that specific frequency, however, can emit infrared light in a much narrower band.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"Metal-based metamaterials are much easier to tune to these frequencies, but when metal heats up to the temperatures required in these types of devices, they tend to melt,\" said Padilla. \"You need a dielectric metamaterial that can withstand the heat. And now that we have the machine learning piece, it looks like this is indeed achievable.\"\n\nCould this also be used to build more efficient solar panels that generate more electricity? And are there other known applications in use which could use specific frequencies of infrared light? Wireless power transfer?\n\nStudy here: [Deep Learning for Accelerated All-Dielectric Metasurface Design](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-27-20-27523)",

What I don't like is that they are outside and exposed to the elements more, but the house blocks it, they're under the soffit, and we don't get much north to south rain, so that wouldn't be getting rained on much.

In another sub, it came up that in 70 degree weather, the inside of a car will still hit over 100 in 30 minutes, and so even when it's not what you would think of as a hot day, it's still a bad idea to leave a dog or kid in the car for as little as 30 minutes.\n\nNow I've been looking at van conversion projects and saw that a lot of people are going with solar panels on top of the van. It leads me to wonder - will those solar panels have any effect at all in reducing the heat buildup inside the van, either in how hot it gets or how fast it happens? Or is the part of the sun rays that the solar panel works with unrelated to why it gets hot inside?",

At their peak output, I suppose that would approach 200 amps but that would never be going back to the grid so I'm not entirely sure what the situation is there. He made it seem like his utility's reasoning was that his house could consume 200 amps from the grid and at the same time, pump 200 amps back to the grid thus the need for 400 amp service. That obviously makes no sense and isnt how any of this works. Haha",

"comment": "The only two things Sunpower has going for it now are panel efficiency and aesthetics. Since it enjoys the category of highest efficiency panel in the market right now, they get to play with pricing, but they have to also be competitive. They are still a fairly big player. However the majority of their customers realize that they would rather have a panel that's on the level of a Mercedes-Benz then to use a panel that might be on par with a Ford Fiesta.\n\nAs for Enphase, I've been hearing for the last year roughly that they have been having some issues, not only with product ( could be anything from procurement to reliability ), but possibly internally, as a company.  Not sure of the validity of this but perhaps this [article](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2019/07/31/enphase-revenue-up-77-profits-way-up-wants-to-be-your-home-energy-butler/) might clear that up.\n\nI am in Southern California",

No. They do the same with Powerwalls. You really think Tesla can produce, market and distribute a superior battery for 1/2 of what Sony, Panasonic or LG can? Cheaper than even the Chinese knock-off LiFePO you can buy on ebay? They have already registered as a Utility in the UK, and the next step is cornering the US market in residential solar/storage and using their distributed network to become a Utility, or at least contract with utilities to provide energy.",

Oftentimes, inverters can handle loads above their rated capacity as well, so there's even less justification for larger inverters.\n\nA fully sized inverter could handle maximum generation, but your system usually won't spend enough time at that level to make it justify the additional cost.",

Assuming a $250/mo bill, Tesla’s website is recommending their largest 15kW system and 4 Powerwalls. I have 2 cars I plug in daily (Model 3 and currently a Pacifica Plug-in Hybrid) with future plans for a pool and hot tub. I’m curious what your experience has been with the same sized system, but with two fewer Powerwalls?  Is your entire home backed up by them?  How long can you go self powered during the night or a power outage?",

"comment": "Yup, I had power go out today for 4 hours because of the storms in central FL.  Never noticed because of the Powerwalls.  Only thing that sucks is the internet goes out when power does, but I can use my hot spot to still surf the web on my computer at least.\n\nI will say since we had the Powerwalls installed, I feel like we lose power  A LOT more than before.   I feel like our breaker is weaker or something.  I always check the app immediately when the lights dim, to see if we are on back up energy or not.  If it's at night I can just look out the window, and during the day the neighborhood is pretty quiet, so I just go outside to see if the person that is a few houses down has their backup generator running.  I've found at times when the power goes out during the day it'll put us on backup energy, but when I go outside to hear for the generator, it isn't running.  I'll check the app and it says we are on backup power for about 5 minutes, then we return to the grid.  It's not a major issue, but it is kinda annoying when that does happen.\n\n\nI guess it's a safe fail type issue where it notices power go out for whatever reason, then puts us on back up energy for a few minutes, and then returns us to the grid.   I just wonder why our power \"goes out\" more often since installing the Powerwalls.\n\nDo you notice that?",

Even though prices may continue to fall, I understand your goal of getting panels while net metering is still an open market.\n\nNet metering:\nWhere do you see net metering credit never expiring?\nI found this website: https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DE/NetMetering.shtml\n\nIt states: Monthly net excess generation is carried forward into the subsequent month. At the end of each twelve-month net metering period, the utility customer may receive financial compensation for any excess generation by entering into a power purchase agreement with their electric utility.\n\nIt sounds similar to my current net metering where at the end of March every year my credits clear out and I get a money credit.\n\nSize of system:\nIf you think that you can reduce usage, def don't go up to the 110%. In my case I just started a family, so I know my usage is going to increase over the years.\n\nEV:\nI used the estimate of 1 kwh will give me 4 miles of range. So, consider your yearly driving and you might be able to est amount of kwh per year.\n\nI hope that gives some insight and opinions.\n\nAny questions?",

Meanwhile you could set up photovoltaic and battery storage to charge EVs almost anywhere; regardless of the current state of infrastructure.",

I had a Saturn SL1 that I got 37 miles per gallon in, and it was just a small, efficient car.  \n\nI estimate 3 cents per mile on the Nissan Leaf for discussion, but over it's life I've paid much less for miles.  For several years I used Georgia Power's plug in vehicle program, where I charged the car between 11 PM and 6 AM, and my per-kWh cost was $0.026.  That means that miles actually cost me less than a penny a mile.  We also charged at Nissan dealerships and at other free charging around the area.  \n\nWhen we moved to Virginia in 2016, we moved into an Apartment that had a free EVSE right outside our door.  So, for the time we lived there, charging cost us nothing at all.  I don't tell people about this on the first discussion, because if I lead with \"my cost per mile for energy is probably a half a cent\" they would either not believe me or demand proof.  I go with the 3 cents per mile, because that's a lot easier to show, and is more likely to be closer to their experience.\n\nImagine what the cost per mile will be using the new Aptera, with a 10 mile per kWh efficiency rating and solar panels on it?  I want to build a super efficient electric trike with a shell (a velomobile) that gets something like 40 or 50 miles per kWh.  I can get 30 mi/kWh on my electric bicycle with no fairings or streamlining at all.  If I could build a single person \"car\" with a third the aero cross-section and a quarter of the weight of the Aptera, it should be damn near free to drive.",

"comment": "[This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSqTw6SE-lbZnPKWK5m6jGrXp_mkpGjLVsH6mgxSiWE/edit?usp=sharing) stuff can be helpful although it's mostly american links. \n\nIf you're in a rut you can try the classic forms of activism. Fundraisers, petitioning businesses and law makers. Make calls, write personalized letters and such. Even a basic fundraiser could make an impact somewhere. Money does talk after all.\n\nI think a lot of people are feeling sluggish after the pandemic. I became really sedentary so it's hard to kick myself enough to get going. One thing that helps is trying to make events fun. Imagine if you did a fundraiser like a bake sale and you had a wheel. People spin the wheel and whatever climate charity it lands on could have their funds donated to. Keeps people intrigued enough to spread the word. Make whatever you do like a game and see how it goes.\n\nOne big fundraiser you could do is getting people to rally behind solar panels for public places like schools. In one of the southern states in the US, they funded a solar panel initiative for a school and used the money they saved on electricity to better fund the teachers. Win win.\n\nAnyway hope these random ideas help. Lots of room for creativity out there! Access your creativie side and have fun with it!",

"comment": "Airstream actually had a concept trailer earlier this year that was exactly what you describe. They had some neat proposed uses for the motors. In theory, it could park itself in a tight campsite or move throughout the day to keep its solar panels in the sun. I do like that a motorized trailer could also improve gas mileage when towed behind an ICE vehicle or allow smaller vehicles to tow a full size trailer. A lot of people buy full size trucks to tow their camper twice a year. They could get away with something smaller and more efficient if the trailer could do some of the work when towing.",

"comment": "Dont forget that California doesnt really actually have \"dollar for dollar\" net metering. We do on paper, according to the law. In reality, Utility's found a way around it to screw you over. With solar in CA you are forced onto a TOU plan, and that plan has its lowest rate time during the middle of the day when solar is producing. So sure you get paid back the retail rate, but then the retail rate charged to you doubles (or more) in the evening when you dont have solar power, so you are now being charged at 2x the rate you are getting paid. Effectively making it a 1:2 net metering, not 1:1 like it says on paper.",

"comment": "More heat in the atmosphere means more potential energy, that gets converted to kinetic energy (storms).  In the US that means more hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding in some areas, and droughts that lead to fires/agriculture issues.\n\nAlso, we've built our entire infrastructure around the current climate.  That includes farms, sea walls, cities, etc.  The world is heated and cooled unevenly by flow/current tracks (IE, N Atlantic flow).  Disrupting the potential energy to the whole system, changing where heat and moisture are distributed by these global weather patterns.  That results in areas that used to be wet or favorable to certain crops shifting or completely going away.  It might be terrible for a US wheat farmer, but great for a Canadian farmer, until it's not good for them either.  Evolution takes millions of years, but we're noticeably changing the atmosphere in a couple human life times.  The process may likely be too fast for entire ecosystems to stay caught up.\n\nAlso the FL peninsula has a porous lime stone bedrock for example.  So you can't shore up the sea wall because water can just come up from underneath.  So a sea level rise of a few feet could probably be managed in rich, high density cities that can invest in bigger sea walls, dams, dikes, etc, but I wouldn't buy a forever home in FL\n\nAlso, this argument is one small oversimplified piece of a massively complicated issue.  You'd probably feel a little bit peppier if the atmosphere had more oxygen, but if you didn't have enough water or food to survive, that really wouldn't matter much to you, would it?  Same with crops and forests.  Also once an area dies off it doesn't generally just recover later, on its own, even if conditions are favorable.  Anyone whose ever tended a garden or landscaped a yard knows this.  That's desertification in a nut shell.\n\nThe thing is there're lots of solutions out there that don't require any big changes to our daily lives.  IE, if everyone had rooftop solar, the same way they have central air, and an EV.  Commuter car traffic and electric production account for roughly half of all emissions and the vast majority of cars aren't going on massive thousand mile road trips.  \n\nPersonsonally, I'd rather be self sufficient and not have to rely on an electric grid or a MoGas supply chain to have a running vehicle anyway, but that's just me.  In most states right now they won't give you permits to install solar for more than 80% of your demand, so not openly sabotaging the tech would be a great fair competition start.",

"comment": "At first I thought it was a gimmick when I first learned about this Aptera. But putting everything in place how lightweight this EV weighs (+/- 1,800lbs), the low drag 0.13cd, the tri wheel low ground friction (vs average 4 wheels on ground) with in hub Elaphe wheel motors and how this is engineered for 100Wh/mi efficiency, the 700W solar panels isn’t a gimmick. This EV is essentially a road legal solar racer, designed for real world use. Here in Los Angeles, the solar charging abilities would be perfect for my DD/work commute case. It will also be cheaper to register and to insure (classified as an auto cycle/motorcycle). Low TCO.",

But I work at home and don’t need to fully charge my EV every day, or anywhere near that much really. And there will also be days when I fully charge my powerwalls and send extra energy to the grid if I forget to turn on my EV charger. I’d like to automatically divert that energy into my EV instead of selling it at a reduced rate. I’d also like to keep my powerwalls charged for my non-EV loads since things like my induction stove and laundry use a lot of energy.",

"comment": "It seems people are trying to game net metering such that one is always supplying to the grid and never consuming from it therefore making money, this is unsustainable for the power company.  If the sole purpose is for you to make money from the grid, this is gone until you can store energy for the grid.  As of today this is not feasible as your wear and tear will cost you more than arbitrage due to battery technology and costs.\n\nIf the purpose is to just reduce your electric bill or stop the dependence on fossil fuels, this will keep on going forever.  What is bad about having your AC running in the summer, charging your EV, and not having to pay the power company?",

"comment": "Wind turbines killing birds is just a straight up myth, as is their impact on desert tortoises. Look up the word [agrivoltaics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrivoltaics). Solar panels are not some blight on the land. \n\nSwitching to wind and solar is not about individuals carbon footprint. Individual carbon footprint are things like biking instead of driving, choosing the train instead of a flight, choosing and electric car over a gas one, getting extra insulation for your home, eat bugs instead of red meat, etc. The idea of the carbon footprint is that people make these choices that reduces their personal impact. The reality is that’s not how climate change works, that’s not how the responsibility shakes out, and the implication that normal people should make personal sacrifices in their lives in the name of climate change is fundamentally wrong. The reality of climate activism is about shifting power companies over to renewables while they are providing the same reliable power supply, but at lower cost. We just want the government to come in and cover the transition costs. That’s it. That’s what this is about.",

Assuming you have 4-6 hours of peak sun per day in North Carolina, you would need a system size of about 7-10 kW. This would require about 20-30 solar panels, depending on the type and efficiency of the panels. \n\nYou would also need a suitable inverter, a charge controller, and a mounting system. The cost of such a system would vary depending on the quality and installation of the components, but it could range from $15,000 to $25,000 before incentives and rebates.",

The fancy financing is now coming back to bite them in the ass.  \n\nTo that I say, 'bye then!'.  \n\nThe industry isn't going to collapse.  A few big names might implode.  But the industry will be just fine.  \n\nThere's a reason most electricians are local or regional operations, not big national companies.

If you look at complains from my Attorney General's office, a very high majority of complaints come from door to door knockers who lie, or are just too new to be educated themselves.  Again, there are some good door to door people, but get more quotes.\n\nAlso, through the quote process, you'll learn more about solar, more about net metering in your area, learn more about the equipment you'd want, etc.  \n\nWhat is the interest rate on that loan?  The ones with 2.99 or 4.99 rates have large fees up front, so if you go to pay it off, you may be paying off $50,000 on a system that new is only $32,000, something like that.  I'd suggest, if there is any possible way you'd be in the house shorter than 20 years, to get a full-interest rate loan, so your purchase price drops dramatically.",

IF SO, THEN WHY ARE YOU VEGAN?\" I don't care to recall or look up this particular logical fallacy/bias, but it's just ridiculous. Maybe it's coming from the fact that someone is questioning something that is very strongly pushed in our culture (animal \"resources\") but why aren't you asking where you yourself draw the line at being someone who doesn't drink bleach? what about 0.00001% bleach? why or why not? \n\nThe analogy doesn't exactly hold since you're not self-identifying as \"someone who doesn't drink bleach\", but that's fine because it's really late right now. :) Though at the same time it DOES sort of apply, because if one is opting out of the animals-as-resources idea, then they're going to have to have a label and people are going to ask them about it and they'll probably need a reason of some kind.\n\nImagine a parallel universe where almost nobody used animal products, and the people who did had a name. Or if there was two categories of food: \"Food\" and then \"Food made with flesh/breastmilk\" or whatever. I hope that illustrates what I mean.\n\nI guess I'd say if you're concerned about where other people draw their lines, you'd have to ask on an individual basis. If you're concerned where you should draw yours, you should deeply examine areas near that line to decide for yourself.",

That is, the above can be true and it still be not-vegan to eat honey.  Is it an issue worth thinking about for vegans?  Yes, but it is one independent of honey.\n\nRegarding honey, I don't eat it.  That said, I do think there is a compelling case to be made that honey bees do not suffer on a physiological level in the sense that vegans find troublesome and, therefore, their exploitation is not in violation of the justification for veganism which I espouse.  But, I don't care enough about honey to take that risk--I acknowledge a possibility that honey does cause suffering to bees in a meaningful way (ie the science might be wrong) and, as its not a particular difficulty to avoid, thus don't consume honey.\n\n[edited because I used \"that said\" way too many times]",

Both a clear vegan message and a pro cage free message can convince them to go cage free, even if that wasn't the original intent of the vegan message. That's a good reason why I avoid convincing people to go cage free. The best outcome I will get out of that is cage free. I would rather my best outcome be a possibility of someone going vegan, while keeping the possibility of a cage free outcome as a possible weaker result.",

I've never really liked cheese though so I doubt it tastes like the real deal but it's worth a shot!\n\n[Cheese](http://thecompassionatecook.blogspot.com/2011/04/melting-mozzarella-cheese.html)\n\nOh and I don't take any supplements, I eat a shit load of lentils and bread and I feel pretty good most of the time. I was low on B12 for a while (pre-vegan) but that's resolved itself after a B12 injection.\n\nJust be careful you don't stress constantly over whether you're getting enough vitamins and minerals - get a blood test done every now. Try to not get all \"being vegan made me sick\" &lt;-- it's a load of shit most of the time. Oh and try heaps of new foods! Seriously. I only tried pomegranate recently and almost slapped myself for not eating it sooner. Take advantage of seasonal foods!\n\nUhm..\n\nDon't be ashamed of missing the taste of meat. It's pretty easy to get past it when you learn to separate flavours.. a meat pie tastes that way because of the pastry, gravy, salt etc.. it's not all beef and TVP, lentils, wheat gluten can all be mad substitutes.\n\nGood luck! \n\nedit: forgot the link..",

There's nothing magical about whey protein. You can get all the amino acids you need from other, vegan sources.\n\n&gt;Also, if you get too much soy protein you have to start seriously worry8ing about estrogen production.\n\nThe risks of soy are extremely overblown, but if you don't want to ingest soy, don't. There are plenty of soy-free vegans, including athletes. Soy is no more a requirement for us vegans than parsnips.",

"comment": "I'm confused. So animals are allowed to kill other animals because it's \"natural\" and just how they evolved. Why isn't \"natural\" best for humans? They evolved killing and eating animals as well; shouldn't they also be allowed to live \"naturally\"? Why doesn't the argument apply to both? \n\n&gt;we have evolved as a species and a society to a position where we can sustain ourselves without interfering in the lives of animals or causing suffering\n\nIt's not evolution so much as advent of science. Using knowledge and technology we can now make it possible for people to be vegan through supplements and proper planning -- but why not use that same technology for other animals, if they're biologically capable of handling it? Why do they still get to \"interfer[e] in the lives of animals or caus[e] suffering\", and we don't, even though the resources are available for both of us?",

"comment": "Grocery Outlet\n\nEDIT: In case you don't have them where you live, they're a discount chain that buys stuff the normal grocery stores don't want for cheap, then sells it for a slight profit. [Here's how it works](http://www.groceryoutlet.com/Default/Outlet/HowItWorks.aspx). One can find shocking bargains there sometimes, but the best part is, they often have organic and vegetarian/vegan goodies like Yves deli slices, soy milk, vegan crackers, etc. Some of it is stuff I've never seen before and can't get anywhere else in my area. But stuff at Grocery Outlet is in limited supply so you need to jump on it while it's still in stock. You can count on finding *types* of things (cereal, frozen dinners, bread, shampoo, etc. etc.) but don't count on specific brands to still be there when you go back.\n\nSeasonal items can sometimes show up a few months later, as long as its still within the expiration date, like these Rice Krispies. You do have to read expiration dates for refrigerated items, because sometimes it's about to expire. For example, a while ago I bought about 30 packs of Silk soy yogurt, only to discover they needed to all be eaten within five days. \n\nYou can walk out of there having saved more than half of what you would have spent at a regular grocery store.",

I've also made pesto with them.  \n\nI didn't actually eat tempeh or seitan for the first few years that I was vegan.  Early on, I tried making seitan and it was just awful (even my two dogs wouldn't eat what I made which never happens) and it took a long time for me to try it again.  So, I highly recommend easing into it! Now, I'm a huge fan though I still don't make my own.",

They would probably bash the crap out of a book like \"Skinny Bitch\" because it supports fat shaming, even though almost no one wants to be fat, and it actually got alot of people interested in veganism to control their weight and figure. I made a lot of posts [attacking junk food veganism in a recent thread and got massively down-voted](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2p9wex/i_want_you_to_be_jealous/cmv1x2v?context=3). \n\nThey don't have a particular ideology in that pathetic sub besides being righteously against anything that could possibly promote veganism. They are so pro-capitalist and apathetic they keep making thread after thread dicussing about the press releases and news of Beyond Meat and pining hope that just one day they will invent the perfect product to make carnists into vegans. But I don't ever see why carnists would ever be jealous of high-priced imitations of the originals of what they are eating that is much easier to find anywhere.   \n\nBasically anything or anyone that actually makes people vegan upsets them. But Gardein, Beyond Meat, Beyond Eggs, whatever, allegedly make people into vegans with tasty junk food analogues of carnist food.",

Under one definition lab meat is vegan, under another it's not.\n\nI personally believe that lab meat is vegan, unless you consider the original animal who provided the cells to have been exploited. Though I'll admit I don't know how the cells are collected and/or whether it's a one time thing or if they have to keep getting more cows to collect their cells.",

After being vegan for about half a year I cannot believe how much my taste and cooking has matured. If you offered me what I eat daily now a few years ago I would have laughed in your face ;)",

You may have the best of intentions, but to her it may feel like you're being controlling.  My dad's a great guy but he often says things to my stepmother that he perceives as being helpful/constructive and she just feels judged &amp; criticized.  It may not be the meat eating (or not eating meat) that your wife has a problem with.  Just ask her if she has any issues with how you guys communicate &amp; go from there.  Good luck.",

"comment": "&gt; Does this mean I should still take the 500mcg per day since I'm vegan?\n\nNo, it's just the b12 that's supplemented is absorbed inefficiently, 500mcg every day or once every two to three days should be enough. I take 1000mcg a day simply because it's so cheap and the one I get is tasty but really you only need 25-50mcg/day, although I'd recommend 100-200mcg/day just to be sure, although with b12 the more the better, and if you take too much you just piss it out, so having more is absolutely no issue and if you have especially bad absorption it might be helpful to have more.\n\nIf your diet is overall good though I'd just buy a b12 and vitamin d supplement next time though as it's a bit cheaper and you probably don't need the other vitamins/minerals. Everyone can use more vitamin D so it's always good to have that too, which is likely in your multivitamin anyways though.",

I'm not looking for comfort vegan food either,  I'm trying to stay healthy at the same time sticking to whole grains etc, and I cant eat some things like tomato, chocolate, onion, and others, so I feel overwhelmed lol",

To know that the results are profitable to the race would not remove my hostility to it. The pains which it inflicts upon unconsenting animals is the basis of my enmity towards it, and it is to me sufficient justification of the enmity without looking further.\n\nEDIT: I must admit to being rather ruefully surprised by this reaction on /r/vegan. I leave you with one last thought [from Dostoyevsky](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28054/28054-h/28054-h.html#toc83) to consider before bidding you all a fond farewell:\n\n&gt; Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature...and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions?",

So my point is I love my partner and his family because they respect my diet choice although I don't respect their's exactly I don't think any less of them because they don't think any less of me. I think there is this stigma that vegans are \"against\" non vegans when in fact we are just against animal abuse. I know the only way people are going to see it our way is through pleasant and insightful conversation. Also I have so much respect for people who learn the horrors of the meat and dairy industry and make small steps to change. I have 100% time for these people.  So basically as long as your not one of those \"oooh but bacon \" jerks we good.",

And it ends up in some meals though usually I'm accommodated for pretty well and I'm not complaining.  And sometimes at a party or a restaurant if I have to eat a little dairy to be fed, I don't sweat it.  The amount of dairy I've had in the last 30 years compared to my first 30 years is probably 1:100 or less so as an engineer, I really can't be bothered to stress about it (whatever the Vegan society says).",

"comment": "I didn't lie. I shared my observations and opinions. I do not care if you believe me or not. Here's a definition of \"lying\": \n\nto knowingly say something that is not true in order to deceive\n\nIf you choose to assume the [veganfriendly.org](https://veganfriendly.org) group is the ultimate authority of truth and whose opinions you adopt, then you may be a victim of confirmation bias. Of course my own experiences affect my biases too. \n\nI'm sure there are dairy operations using some or all of these methods. I just haven't met these people. Some of the ideas the author claims about the cows feelings I would agree with, others not at all. A momma cow would not be happy with separation from her newborn calf, and she'll definitely tell you about it if you do that. However, soon after she denies her calf milk, they seem to be indifferent to separation. The operations where I know the people, and the cows, use a far more symbiotic strategy. If you sell a cow or horse for processed meat, the price is so low it's close to a breakeven with the transportation. The article is clearly written to elicit empathetic feelings in those unfamiliar with cattle. \n\nEveryone I know uses pasture land to grass feed their herds, so they don't buy much feed. They did this before it was cool. I see how a large dairy would need to use a high turnover strategy. They need to maximize milk production relative to expenses. So sure they would rotate reduced production cows out of their operation. These cows would either be sold at auction, or via contract. Cows in this position have substantial value, but not so much for meat. What happens beyond that is up to the buyers. Excess calves could certainly be used for meat. Again, I would expect large dairies would have an agreement to provide weaned calves to another entity, but there are many options. \n\nHere's another observation I've had you may find handy to expand your empathies toward treatment of animals. I assume Vegans feel consumption of vegetables grown without all those synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to be animal friendly. If so, they have never tilled soil. Top soil is filled with living creatures. Tilling of this soil kills an incredible number of these living organisms. Their bio matter helps to provide \"natural\" fertilizer. It helps a lot if you can mix in excrement from cows, pigs, and/or chickens. Does your empathy for animals not extend to these creatures? Just how many animals have to be killed so Vegans can feel good?",

So I guess we shouldn’t be consuming these products either? Oh, it was also deemed safe for consumption by the FDA.\n\nMethylcellulose: literally fiber. Cellulose is literally a part of a plants cellular structure, which is why plants have fiber. It’s actually good for us. Fiber helps the GI tract activate, which is probably why it’s a component in laxatives. \n\nPropylene Glycol: also found in bread, dairy, soda, salad dressing, fast food, and soup mix. Do you not consume any of those? \n\nFerric Phosphate: literally means iron. Do you not know that our bodies cannot produce iron but they need it, so that makes iron an essential nutrient? Good thing it’s in these plant based meats! Btw, guess what’s also a slug pesticide! Salt 🙂\n\nMagnesium Carbonate: a very much needed compound for bone health! So happy I can get it in my plant based meat. It’s also found in foods such as biscuits, cakes, sodas and more common products. Btw, you know what else is found in fire extinguishing compounds? Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide. Two compounds keeping us alive 🙂",

However, even when it comes to such a polarizing topic, there is common ground to be found by everyone ranging from vegans to die-hard meat eaters. No one can deny the destructive nature of the force that dominates our food system (i.e. industrial animal agriculture or factory farming). When you take into account the fact that factory farms raise 99.9 percent of chickens for meat, 97 percent of laying hens, 99 percent of turkeys, 95 percent of pigs, and 78 percent of cattle currently sold in the United States, it’s shocking how much time we waste debating each other, rather than trying to actually change the system. \n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/nil-zacharias/its-time-to-end-factory-f_b_1018840.html",
