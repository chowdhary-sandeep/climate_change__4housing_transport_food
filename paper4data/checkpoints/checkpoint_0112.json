People are not going to wait 3-6 hours for a charge so we can safely assume we are just talking about quick charging using Chademo.   30 minutes is still a lot of time to wait to add 80 miles. So range, not high pricing of charging is keeping people from using those stations. Like gas stations they only use them when they have to.",

By last resort I mean you don't qualify for outside financing or do not have any tax appetite.\n\nThere are financing options pretty much everywhere now. Some will let you re-amortize your loan once you receive the federal tax credit. You can find unsecured loans at 5-6% that will do just that.\n\nDo not give away the tax credit. I wish more people realized what a rip off leasing companies are, directly and indirectly. First it's the tax credit them depreciation on an overvalued PV system. They will probably assume ownership of RECs as well in your case.\n\nIt's time that solar benefits the end consumer not the corporations. Do not sign with them, talk to your neighbors to not sign with them. Get a contractor to discount based on 2-3 jobs in your block. \n\nDo not sign a lease/PPA. 20 year contract is nuts enough, why not own it and be done in 7? Or 5? Wake up people!",

"comment": "If you go on tirerack tesla tires can be had for similar prices as the i3 for the base model S. Any individual car can be a lemon from any maker. A make and model of car can be very reliable but some people will have lemons. I feel like BMW over sold the i3, showrooms had up signs saying the BEV had a hundred miles of range even after the EPA rated it 81 miles. Many did not know their range could be half that in Winter. Then this engine mount issue adds insult to injury for some. Some had issues with the rEX as well throwing a lot of warning lights. BMW has bought some of the cars back. Hopefully BMW finds a real solution to the engine mount weakness. Some people have had issues with limp mode on the rEX and BMW has been working on a fix to that as well.",

"comment": "Even if you standardize and define environmental impact in terms of harm to human health, ecosystem diversity loss and resource quality loss in order to capture the environmental impact of resource extraction for battery production, as is done by the EcoIndicator 99 benchmark, electric cars [are still better for the environment than normal cars overall](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903729a).  This is because the large majority of any car's environmental impact, electric or not, is inflicted in operations rather than manufacturing, and the efficiency gains resulting from electrification more than offset the increased production requirements.",

"comment": "The problem is that, with L2, the vehicle's onboard charger does all the work.  Most production EVs only have 30-32A chargers, and because of that, most public L2 chargers are in the same range.   Even if you  upgraded a public charger to 80A, most of the capacity would go unused.\n\nUpgrading to 80A is either impossible or costly.  Tesla is the only manufacturer who offers an upgrade.  It costs $2000 to go from 40A to 80A.  Not cheap, and considering most public charging tops out at 10A, not very useful.\n\nWith DCFC, the work of converting AC to DC is done outside of the vehicle.  This reduces vehicle cost significantly and this is why manufacturers are choosing DCFC as the way to go above 10kW.   It doesn't matter if L2 is cheaper, the manufacturers have already forced the issue.  DCFC will become the standard.  Eventually, it will become profitable for the charging companies as well.",

"comment": "I'd argue that had they built them out with solar covered parking from the start, there would be fewer Supercharger locations (or a similar number, but with fewer stalls) and it would have resulted in restrictions being put in place sooner. Again, the cost of electricity isn't the motivating factor here, it's discouraging abuse of the network so that there are stalls available for people passing through. Headlines touting \"long lines at Tesla Superchargers\" are fairly damaging to the Tesla brand. Tesla has tried numerous times to change peoples' behavior with e-mails, announcements about the network being for long distance travel only, and even letters sent out to owners, but nothing has worked.",

"comment": "More than half of CHAdeMO's in Japan are 25 kW or less. Directly comparing numbers alone is not as useful.\n\nFurther, most of these counts are per plug on the CHAdeMO and CCS side, but per location on the Tesla Supercharging side. So with 254 locations in the U.S., there are about 1,500 Supercharger plugs in the U.S. alone. Globally, CHAdeMO is 10,377 EVSE plugs, but Tesla is about 3,465 by itself.\n\nIn the U.S., non-Tesla BEVs will need a DC charging standard that can handle 200-400 amps. Maybe in the next year or two a revision of the CCS standard will provide that, which will then obsolete all existing CCS and CHAdeMO EVSE's. Further, the existing installations are really not geared towards supporting the upcoming longer range BEVs that are capable of 150-250 miles of all electric range. They are currently installed to supplemental charge the short range commuter vehicles available in the past 5 years. That entire infrastructure will need an overhaul.",

"comment": "Series hybrid heavy trucks make perfect sense. Think of a Chevy Volt style drivetrain with a medium sized battery (100kWh as stated in the article). I think the battery would be used differently than a Volt though. The Volt uses the battery exclusively until it is depleted. For a heavy truck I think it would be used as a power boost for acceleration and when climbing mountains. It would also provide for kinetic energy recovery during deceleration and while descending mountains. No more noisy compression brakes! \n\nIf I was Elon Musk I'd partner with a heavy truck manufacturer and share the Tesla technology (battery pack, motor, power electronics). You could probably fit a standard 90kWh Model S battery and motor. The project might actually be extremely simple and quick to make a prototype.",

Of course a big part of that is Superchargers are free while battery swapping comes with a cost, but that will always be the case - it's a much more involved process, and comes with the tricky issue of how to handle the fact that you're swapping out the component of your car that represents *the majority of the car's value*.",

GM and especially Toyota aren't anywhere near that threshold yet, so I wouldn't worry about it. Tesla is probably going to be the first to hit the threshold, once they start producing the Model 3 in volume. \n\nPersonally I think it unlikely that a unified Republican government will do away with anything at all that reduces peoples' taxes given Republicans' rabid anti-tax stance generally, so the EV credit is probably safe. Even if it's not, it's not likely to be high on the priority list of things to get rid of. \n\nAlso, the credit is on individuals' personal taxes, so it's on a calendar-year basis. If Congress got rid of it, it probably would either be retroactive for the entire current year or start in the next year, so that the credit might go away isn't by itself a reason to rush out and buy an EV right now, at the beginning of the year. \n\nEdit: [IRS source](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/plug-in-electric-drive-vehicle-credit-section-30d), [InsideEVs FAQ](http://insideevs.com/top-15-faqs-income-tax-credit-plug-vehicles/)",

(Although it’s stupid that they don’t, as they need to make up the shortfall in service lost to EVs. It might be a back-pocket project for those car manufacturers.)\n\nBatteries will get smaller and denser. Chemistry won’t matter in solid state batteries..only draw/charge and what can flow through. I expect SSBs ⅓ the size replacing the existing packs, with circuitry to support the step-down/charge-cycle dynamics of the new tech, but fitted into the older chassis. \n\nThe cars will charge and deplete at the same rate, but more density means range would be extended considerably. \n\nThat’s the goal - we’re not going to throw perfectly good cars away because of old batteries!",

"comment": "If that's round trip, the Bolt would probably work... if it's not too expensive.\n\nThe only way I was able to afford an EV is to buy a used LEAF since they depreciate so quickly.  And even still, it's the most expensive car I've bought in my life (that doesn't say too much though).  Make sure you factor in monthly gas savings to your monthly payment.  I wouldn't have felt comfortable buying an ICE (at this point in my life) for as much as I paid for our LEAF.  But last month, the gas savings paid for almost 65% of my car payment.  Depending on electricity and gas costs in your area and depending on what MPG you get, and EV can be pretty cheap compared to what you're driving now.\n\nI doubt the extra accessories are putting too much of a drain on the big battery in these cars.  Most EVs still have a 12v which powers all of this kind of stuff.  At least on the LEAF, the 12v is charged when the big battery is charging and is charged when the car is on and ready to drive.  I don't see the range drop from using the heated seats, steering wheel, etc.  Speed, outside temperature, and road conditions will impact your range much more than these types of accessories.",

"comment": "The underlying battery size is somewhat irrelevant. The question is how long it would take to add a particular amount of range. When the pack sizes get larger, you will be able to reach most of your destinations without charging at all.\n\nThat said, I agree that a 150-kW station would be better than a 25-kW station. However, the move from a 6.6-kW station to a 25-kW station is a *bigger* change than from a 25-kW to a 150-kW station. Particularly since most EVs can only charge at 50-kW max (the Bolt can charge at 70-kW and Teslas can charge at 125-kW). \n\nI want 150-kW infrastructure everywhere, but I still think that it would be better to make everything possible before we make everything easy. That is even more true because of the operating cost issues.\n\nThe argument is not that 25-kW infrastructure is better than (or even equivalent to) 150-kW infrastructure. It is, instead, that a full 25-kW infrastructure is better than a partially completed 150-kW infrastructure. I think that starting with the lower infrastructure (even if you targeted 50-kW) would increase the number of EVs, which would justify installing more 150-kW stations in the future.",

"comment": "I was in the same boat a coupe of months ago. Here's what I got out of my research - hope it helps:\n\nKona:\n\n* love the exterior\n* cramped interior (rear seats and leg space), some car seats don't fit\n* trunk too small, can't hold many stroller systems or larger luggage\n* centre console - lower level really hard to access\n* HUD\n* interior ambient lighting\n* buttons to shift gears\n* lower trunk loading height, and taller opening \n* electric seats, but no memory\n* better speakers than Niro (to my ears)\n\nNiro:\n\n* exterior a bit plain - almost too plain to stand out as an EV\n* Lights for charge status visible outside car\n* More leg room\n* more comfy rear seats\n* excellent 2 level center console storage\n* deeper and roomier trunk\n* knob to dial for shifting \n* memory seats\n* dimples in front not as deep as Kona, less bug/dirt catching\n* holds my bike in back folding the rear seats, that Kona and M3 couldn't do\n\nNow while I was searching between those two, I also looked at the M3 that's just slightly higher price but offers great AP, minimal interior styling, features and app support constantly improving; but limited trunk loading and space. If M3 had a hatchback style trunk opening like the MS, I know a couple of ppl who would've gotten it instead. \n\nNiro was a better option for me between the three, but I just couldn't conjure the payments for BEV. So I went with Niro PHEV instead and saved $12,000. Love my experience so far, all my commute is done on EV mode only, and I've used gas mainly on one long road trip so far. At this rate, I'll put in gas only twice a year. Love it!",

It's the real big outlier (*many* std. dev) in all this discussion, and the only EV that can achieve better than EPA at 75 mph.\n\nBefore you respond, I would suggest that you try plotting the data yourself:  It's all publicly available, and will be instructive.  NDEC vs. WLTP and WLTP vs. EPA scatterplots form nice tight lines, which indicates a constant ratio.  \n\nYou should also try plugging in one of your typical long-distance routes to ABRP with different EVs and check out the consumption.  ABRP has their own models (based on real world data).  Use the same scatterplot method.",

I really want at-home charging but I'll never be able to convince the strata council to spend $5k or more per spot to build this out.\n\nWhy assume every spot will need a dedicated charger?\n\nIf you present it as the only way to get any charging option is to spend $5k per spot, it would never be approved. If every spot is deeded, then each owner would be directly on the hook for their portion of a $500k project cost that will only benefit a few owners. Consider it from everyone else's point of view, if you don't have an EV why be forced to spend $5k for something you cant use. \n\nWhy not discuss installation of a set of common use chargers for residents? Since a level 2 should charge most cars within a few hours, there isnt much point in a shared lot installing individual chargers that will sit idle most of the time, particularly if 95% of resident don't even have EVs.",

The battery pack form factor and components are specific to the car, so there couldn’t be a generic replacement for a pack. Depending on the nature of the advancement, perhaps other components may also need to be swapped out, but generally speaking it’s not without question.\n\nNo doubt the replacement hardware and labor will be very expensive, though, so it better be a huge improvement (double the kWh at half the weight, I might go for it).",

I really loved that bike, but when I moved I didn't really have use for it anymore and sold it since I can't really commute to work anymore. \n\nNow for the scoot, that is purely for fun. I do ride it to different places but I haven't really built the confidence in my new location to drive anywhere other than to my sisters house close by yet. I am not sure where I could lock this up around here and trying to drive anywhere really would involve getting on a highway. So now it is mostly just for fun and stuff.",

In some areas it is super easy- in others it is downright impossible. \n\n\n\nSo often there is a giant chasm between what is technologically possible and what is not by way of human greed or stupidity.",

"comment": "//I think feed in tariffs are a good thing//\n\nBut it's not unreasonable to look at them as being parallel to a regressive tax.  You're giving a subsidy to people who \n\n1. own or control property that they can put panels on\n\n2.can afford to pay for ~10 years of electricity up front\n\nThese subsidies are going to be paid for out of taxes and non-renewable utility fees.   I think this is a good policy, but it's true that it's subsidizing the solar of people who already have more money.  This is starting to change some with loan programs, roof leasing, etc, but I think there are some legitimate points to be made...\n\nRace and class are difficult to separate in the US on a macro level.  People can twist that to make solar panels look racist.  This is a poor argument and looks like it's being delivered in a shady way, but there are true snippets in the argument.\n\nThus [these programs](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/free-solar-for-the-poor)",

So if anyone can point to some sort of tool or anything easy to figure this out on your own so that everyone who has this question but has a little bit of a different situation doesn't require some redditor to calculate it for them, they can simply go -&gt; \"here\" and do it themselves.\n\nI've only scratched the surface but my research led me to this, [\"Off-Grid Solar Calculator\"](http://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-information/start-here/offgrid-calculator#sunhoursmap) from Whole Sale Solar, which may kind of do that.\n\nSo if we use DingoDan22's heaviest usage month as an average (just to take into account the worst case scenario), We're talking\n\n- Monthly usage:1081\n- assuming he wants to generate 100% of his energy through this system\n- and that he is in zone 5 and has about 4.2 peak sun hours\n\nHe would need a system that produces at least **8579** Watts\n\nThen I read that you can expect about $4-$10 per Watt (Can someone verify that? I can't find the link.)\n\nSo with the traditional model we would be talking about a total price of somewhere between ***$34,316-85,790.***\n\n*Of course this doesn't include any amount of money the [Powerwall](http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall) helps reduce the price to, and it doesn't include any other price cutting factors (government tax write offs, etc.) so I didn't do the greatest job of answering your question, but it's a start.*\n\n\nCan someone that actually works with and understands these things check my work?",

"comment": "If I were you, I'd go with SunPower. LG may be a more stable company, but the SunPower module is the better product on multiple fronts (warranty, degradation, space efficiency, temperature coefficient). But again, these are the gold/silver medalists of the entire industry. Flipping a coin and moving in with your life would be just as acceptable way to decide this match up.\n\nEdit that: actually, I'd go with LG because as much as I like SMA (the SunPower inverter manufacturer) I don't see how your SunPower design would meet rapid shutdown requirements. So the choice is driven by the inverter system rather than by the module.",

PowerScout also found the price tag of the proposed project was wildly underestimated.\n\n&gt;Of course, if the goal is to build solar power, there are easier ways to do it.

I haven't seen a forecast yet that predicts no growth over 2016 in total for the U.S. But I haven't seen one that predicts greater growth in 2017 over 2016 compared to 2016 over 2015 either.\n\nAnd I know of installers in some states where solar is just starting to catch on (policy driven) that cannot hire enough people so far.\n\nWhat may also be true is the \"sell\" is harder now than it used to be. The low hanging fruit - wealthier homeowners and those who really were motivated to get in earlier for social reasons, etc. - is decreasing fast. And the growing market may be more of those who NEED the incentives and favorable financing in order to make the choice. That is why some are speculating that community solar will grow. But everyone is speculating.....",

"comment": "Siemens wrote a terrific [paper](http://w3.siemens.com/mcms/solar-inverter/de/Documents/Datas/Options/PV_field_grounding/sinvert_datas_pv_field_grounding_en_2009-02-24.pdf) about positive versus negative grounded panels. \n\nSummary: When back contact solar cell modules (e.g. SunPower A-300) are in operation, negative charge carriers collect on the cell surface. This static charge on the front face of the cell cannot be discharged because the front face is insulated from the arresters on the rear face. This effect is also referred to as \"surface polarization\" and it is known to gradually impair the performance of modules.\n It is however possible to reverse the effect of surface polarization. This is done by connecting the positive pole of the solar generator to ground potential across a high resistance; the connection is fuse-protected. This arrangement completely discharges the negative charge carriers on the cell surface, restoring the module to its original performance level, and even increasing the efficiency of the cell slightly. If the positive pole is not grounded, the system performance will be impaired.",

"comment": "Ok first there is no need to physically switch anything, you can regulate it just using ohms law of resistance.   \n\nSecond, if you have Net Metering there is NO need to do this as the net metering allows 100% efficient trading of kWh now for use latter. \n\nThat said yes you can do it with or without a battery.  Again no physical switching is needed (unless you want to work when the grid is down but that is a separate question).  \n\nInverters can measure the net at the interconnect point with the grid and produce more till this net value is zero.   IF there is no battery then solar production would be limited with this programming on the inverter (zero feed in, or grid zero).\n\nBimodal inverters can disconnect from the grid and produce power as well as do grid zero.  This is a very disadvantageous configuration as the batteries are cycled a lot more and the efficiency is cut dramatically because of the battery conversion losses.   If you have net metering, you want to use that and just keep the batteries fully charged till there is an outage, then use them.",

He said if I were to stop and re-do things all over,  that it would be more expensive.   This guy has been awesome from day 1 compared to a rep from a different company.\n\nI'm going to take his word.   When I called a 3rd company just for solar panels the best they could do was beat Tesla by about $1,000.   This rep admitted that they are giving me a pretty good deal, and could beat them, although it wouldn't be by much.    \n\nI'll just keep on trucking with the price my Tesla rep gave me and wait for my Feb. 25th install date.",

They've had lots of \"failed\" movements in the past. It might seem like what you are doing is having no impact right now, but if you keep at it, you can make a huge difference.\n\nIn terms of technology, I'm following projects based on Holochain being built as a response to the climate crisis. One is called [Redgrid](https://holo.host/project/redgrid/), which is aiming to enable an intelligent energy network to help the devices that capture and store energy (e.g., solar panels and batteries) more effectively communicate and coordinate with the devices that use energy.\n\nAnother one is a new startup called [Hypergroove](https://www.hypergroove.co.uk/), a platform for Community Supported Agriculture, with a focus on urban areas. It will involve a supply chain system with peer to peer direct trading. Participants can develop relationships with each other using social media tools with reputation and trust systems. Their goal is the democratize, decarbonize, and decentralize food systems, with the hope to empower active land-stewardship, environmental sustainability, conscious consumerism and to help prepare for climate-adaptive resilience in cities.",

"comment": "The biggest friction point in AZ IMO is that doing the math on what you can save is not at all simple. Take the demand plans as an example. The demand charge is calculated based upon the highest half hour of energy usage... But you can only download your usage data from SRP in hour blocks. This makes accurately calculating your demand charge impossible. Since the demand charge is the biggest part of your resulting bill, calculating it even a little wrong will cause huge swings in the actual bill you receive.\n\nIt is possible to save with SRP, but it's not easy. generalized guide to each of their price plans:\n\n- TOU export - You should do this if you plan to install a smaller solar setup, will not have a battery and your system has a majority of it's panels facing east/west. West facing is the best setup here so you offset during peak window. Over producing gets you peanuts, 2.8 cents/kWh, but producing during the peak window gets you the equivalent of ~22 cents/kWh.\n\n- Demand plan - Choose this if you have a larger solar array that is intended to generate ~80%+ of your usage and no battery. You will want to figure out ways to lower peak demand, even if that raises over all usage, as demand charges will be the majority of a typical bill. Look into things like demand governors, water heater timers, precooling your house, etc. precooling tends to work well here, assuming you are ok with the large temperature swing, as your panels are likely to be way overproducing in the middle of the day in summer.\n\n- Average demand - Choose this if you plan to get a battery with your solar to ride you through the peak windows. You want average demand so that when weather rolls through and stops your solar from producing for a day or two, stopping your battery from charging, the demand charge you get after would be averaged with all of the 0 demand use days from that month.\n\n---\n\nAssuming that your usage fits within ~12kWh total during the peak window, I believe it makes sense financially after you factor in the SRP $3600 rebate to get 1 powerwall, but just barely. Your payback timeline is going to land somewhere in the 9-12 year range, 10 years being the length of the battery warranty. You get 2 nice benefits from getting a powerwall though, beyond just saving on the demand charge:\n\n1. Your off peak electricity is much cheaper, at ~4 cents/kWh. The 9-12 year payback assumes 'standard' off peak loads and so already takes this into account mostly, but if you have large off peak loads, such as pool pumps, lots of people (hence lots of hot water), EVs, etc. the 4 cent offpeak pricing makes a bigger difference and pushes the ROI closer to the 9 year time period.\n2. You get some degree of blackout protection. During the night in summer, your battery is likely to be very low on charge due to the peak window shaving, but just having a battery will allow your panels to keep producing during the day, and in the spring/fall/winter, due to low typical electrical usage, you will have backup capability then. So you will gain \"free\" blackout protection in the off seasons and partial blackout protection in the summer.",

"comment": "No, I understand perfectly. Residential solar power customers get confused about the value of the power they generate all the time. How much is your connection fee?\n\nLet's try another way. You can buy Coke for $0.50 a can (7-11 charges $1/can); you have a buddy at 7-11 who lets you trade a warm can for a cold can. You say great deal, trade your coke, and you buy a $1 bag of chips. Probably not a great deal for 7-11 but sure whatever they're selling some chips so probably no big deal. Well the next day you say I have a better idea; I'll bring 2 cans of Coke and get the chips for free. Is this still a good deal for 7-11? Sort of the same thing you're talking about with your power company. \n\nPower is trickier then this example. Solar is valuable for the power company when it is new in an area because it can help take off peaking from the grid which tends to be very expensive for the power company to build. Once solar has become common in the market it starts to offer the grid more power then base usage and at that point the solar power just isn't as valuable because it is dependent on conditions. \n\nAnother way to put it is most power company's work out a negotiation with the regulators. Whatever you pay per kwh is probably 2-3 times what it cost the power company to buy. So the power company is offering you a great deal typically as a home owner; part of this deal then says any extra power you generate is put into the Low income/lifeline/financial hardship pot which is provided to needy families in your community. \n\nThink the connection fee is too expensive then go off-grid.",

I know we don’t have “net metering” but also my friends in town who already  have an installed system get a hefty bill credit for their generated energy (even when they don’t use it at home) that covers 75% of their annual electric bill.  Like, their summer credits are big enough to last to March. So if that’s not for putting energy into the grid, what is it?",

A large reason that there’s been a huge buildout of renewables is that massive government subsidies have created an environment where the roi is extremely high. Look at rooftop solar in some states - they can’t put it up quick enough!\n\nLike I said above, a market price for carbon would solve this problem effectively. People would be jumping over themselves to throw their blood sweat and tears into innovating, building and running CCS equipment if they could feed their families while doing so. Investment dollars would flow quicker than you could possibly imagine. \n\nRight now the brave souls engaging in this type of endeavor are true pioneers.

"comment": "* Do you own an electric vehicle? Yes\n* If so, what made you want to purchase one? If not, why not? Lower cost of ownership over time, longer life than ICE.\n* How have electric vehicles improved over the past decade? Better range (larger capacity), faster charge times, more places to charge.\n* Which countries are the biggest supporters of electric vehicles? Most developed countries, EU, China, USA.\n* How are governments around the world adjusting to the outburst of electric vehicles? Mixed, some are worried about loss of \"gas tax\" revenue so they are tacking on an EV road use surcharge to registrations. Many offer incentives to buy EV with the hope being to reduce emissions.\n* What is your opinion on “range anxiety”? Non issue, I charge nightly in my garage and start each day with a full charge. I get home with \\~100 miles of range to spare. The only time I consider range is on trips, the fast charger network is lacking in certain areas so I tend to avoid those routes.\n* Where do estimates like “By 2050, 70-90 percent of all driver fueling will be done either at home or work.” come from? Assuming nearly all cars are EV in 2050, then of course, most fueling will occur at home or work. 95% of driving is commuting, so the small percent of long distance travel might account for 10-30% of \"fueling\" occurring away from the daily routine. Further, there will likely still be ICE cars on the roads in 2050, cars tend to have a 15-20 year life when properly cared for. But, this overlooks another development and assumes people still buy cars (EV) to get to and from work. Autonomous vehicle fleets maintained by ridesharing services may be the predominant form of transportation by 2050, and if so, fleets will use dispatch facilities to charge. \n* What safety risks come with installing a charging station in a house? None, really no different than running an electric dryer.\n* How many charging stations are out there right now? Are there enough to support the fleet of electric vehicles? Thousands, generally enough to support the current fleet. When EV adoption takes off, there will need to be a huge growth in public charging, but again, mostly for long trips.\n* Do you foresee more and more homeowners using solar power self-consumption to run their homes and charge their electric vehicles? Sure, if it makes economic sense. There are a small number of uber \"environmentalists\" who embrace solar, but for masses to adapt, it needs to make economic sense. One might argue decentralized solar makes the grid more resilient to outages, and reduces the cost for all but average consumers stumble on the high initial cost of adding solar to their homes.\n* How clean are electric vehicles, really? Initially, less so than ICE due to intense energy requirements for battery mining and manufacturing. Over time, very much so. A lot depends on how clean utility companies are, but the trend is a move towards solar, wind, and storage (battery) due to it being less costly than coal and gas.\n* How can electric vehicle batteries be improved? Higher energy density, improve resiliency, improve safety, faster charging tolerances. \n* Lithium is a core component of the batteries found in electric vehicles. What are the environmental risks involved in using Lithium in batteries? Same as with smart phones and other small electrical devices, but on a larger scale if EV adoption takes off. Generally, cars will be junked before batteries are depleted, and re-using EV batteries for grid storage are but one of many ways to extend the life of them. The materials are valuable, so someone will find cost effective ways to recycle materials.\n* By 2030, what do you think the variety of vehicles on the road will look like? EV will dominate new car sales. But, a shift to fleet sales will likely replace individual ownership as Autonomous Vehicles and supporting services kick in. This will be particularly true in urban areas.\n* How much do you think the trucking industry will change due to the development of electric big rigs? Initially, short range trucking and delivery vehicles will be predominantly EV. The cost of owning and operating a fleet of EV will offer so much savings, using gas and diesel will no longer make sense. Long haul is trickier, big rigs today can go thousands of miles on a tank of fuel, getting thousands of miles of EV range will be costly. Battery improvements may change this down the road.",

"comment": "I've worked as an administrator of technology for a large 35K student district for 10+ years.  Your question is a good one, and there are a number of reasons you don't see solar on schools.  \n\n* Solar panels are heavy and the roof structure would need to be reinforced to support the extra weight. Retrofitting would be stupid expensive, stupid expensive.  In a world where just keeping the school doors open breaks the budget, reinforcing roofs with a payback of forever and a day is a complete non-starter.\n* What about building stronger roofs on new construction.  We have built 13 new schools in the past 10 years.  Only one school was built with 15% of its roof ready for solar. Even that little amount faced a huge budget hurdle.  Ask a principal would you like the roof of your building reinforced for a potential solar installation, or would you like 5 more classrooms. Their answer will always be \"I'd like solar, but I *need* classrooms.\"\n* Maintenance and repair.  I have solar and while it doesn't need a lot, it still needs some.  Multiply that by the 45 schools in my district and you have almost certainly added another head count.\n* Whackadoodles. Parents, school boards, and local communities are FULL of them.  Nothing triggers a certain kind of person more than tax dollars being spent on something they don't agree with.  Sure, you can spend literally millions on a football field, but heaven forbid if you try to help the environment.",

If you do that for one hour, you add the \"h\" so 1.5 kWh.\n\nSince the Growatt is 3 kW rated and you called out above as 12 Amperes at 120VAC you are at about 50% of the rated load for this Growatt.  This will be fine and I expect it to work for many years.\n\nWrite back when you have your solar panels selected along with general location so we can see if we'll get your 5 kWh a day.",

There is no room under the panels, this is a ballasted system with a total height of 2 feet at the most. If you didn't want to walk between the panels you could also pop up an entire row pretty easy, as this is a pop and lock type system. Also here is a brochure if anyone is interested in checking out more specs: https://us.sunpower.com/sites/default/files/helix-brochure-commercial-8x11-22oct15-v1.pdf Thanks for clarifying.",

Will the IRS find out? I don't know, I suppose that's your decision. You are allowed to do that after 5 years though (since the tax credit only requires solar is used for 5 years).\n2. Look into the net metering rules, it might not be possible. Here (NY) if you switch to TOU they'll give you net metering credits for your peak exports, but will bill you cash for your off peak imports which makes this kind of thing useless, they'll never pay out. It's also unlikely that the peak payout is anywhere near $0.27, it's probably half that (I'll poke around on their site and reply if I find anything).",

Now I cant comment as a whole but What I have been told is that installing solar panel to metal roofs is piss easy (and cheap) where I live you would have to look hard to find any house with a roof that isn't a colorbond roof, tiled roofing just isn't popular down here.\n\nThis isn't my installer, heck not even the same state, but here is how they mount solar panels to a metal roof here in Aus. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yggKKs9EDpE&amp;t=35s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yggKKs9EDpE&amp;t=35s)\n\nAnd here is another example https://youtu.be/z8o0-PeSeh8?t=79\n\nI can only assume my solar installer will be doing the same. My install is going in Thursday so I might ask them how they are mounted. My panels are going to be mounted with no angle adjustment, so they will be on the angle that my roof is, which is (looks at building plans...) 22.5°. The optimal tilt for my location is 37°  but from what I'm [reading online](https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/solar-panels-tilt-angle/) I will only lose 0.5% efficiency so what ever.",

Maybe someday but not any time soon and we are more likely to see better batteries that would  eliminate the need for this through more density and faster charging.",

Solar panels absorb the radiated heat and converts some of it to electricity. The non converted heat (IR) warms the panel or is reflected. Every other surface would also get hot and reflect some of the IR waves, but most wouldn't convert energy to other forms that don't directly heat the air. \nThe funny thing is, much of the electricity from solar is used to run air conditioning, which does in fact heat the outside air to some degree.",

"comment": "First off, planning for a full charge every day is likely too much, unless your brother-in-law uses the full plug-in capacity every day and is never home when the sun is out. With a plug-in hybrid and a longish commute you may actually be using the full range (40 miles?) most days. But if you're not, then being able to replace 50% or 75% of the hybrid battery is enough to really help get some free miles, without having to pay top dollar for capacity you won't need. (If he's got 40 miles of hybrid range, and only drives 20 miles most days, then 10 kWh is plenty to refresh with overnight. You'll save money on the install, and burn gas on the days you need to drive more.)\n\nIf your brother-in-law is at home during the day, then there's no need to use a battery at all. Just use solar panels and an inverter, which will save on the price of the battery. Even if he's 2 days a week in-office, it's still likely worth it to cut out the battery.\n\nBut if he's gone most days while the sun is out, then you need the \"full\" off-grid system. I would agree with most of /u/saintslolol's parts suggestions, but consider the EG4 PowerPro as a battery instead ($3800 for 14.3 kWh instead of over $5k for 20 kWh) if you don't need to go from 0 to full every day.\n\nTo actually size the solar array, it depends where you're located. Get the number of \"sun hours\" for your location (https://solarstory.com/peak-sun-hours-calculator), and divide the battery size by that. So, for 5 sun hours, a 20 kWh battery will fill up with 4 kW (4000 W) of solar panels. (Go at least 10% higher than this number to account for losses, and consider going even higher to account for a cloudy day - solar panels are pretty cheap.) Winter vs. summer matters a lot, so buy solar panels for the worst month if possible. \n\nIf you have more space than you need, then you can save money buying used solar panels, from https://www.santansolar.com/ or similar retailers. (If you live in AZ or close buy, picking up from SanTan can result in paying less than $0.15/W - $750 for 6250 W is a great deal.) If you're limited on space, than buying new panels will maximize the power you can get from the limited area, but they will cost more. \n\nIf the carport has a fixed angle and orientation, then you can find more advanced solar calculators to give you better results.",

"comment": "This reply is correct. A large load will try to start when the inverter wakes up, then it will go into a fault because the loads are greater than the available power from the solar panels. The inverter tries to replenish the battery AND try to supply the loads with the available solar.   If the demand is greater than what's available, the inverter will fault out.  This will happen 3 times, then go into a shutdown to protect the inverter. Then you will have to reset the inverter with the red switch.  Suggestion, turn off everything in the house and wait until the inverter starts to produce power, then only turn on what is absolutely necessary, like the fridge and internet,    Green light is solar production, flashing- panels are waking up.  Red light = fault.  Blue light = communications with the server, either by cellular, WiFi, or ethernet. So, if no power to the router, no comms.",

Also, see if your utility rates changed recently. I once had a surprise bill because of a rate hike I didn’t notice. Lastly, look at your usage to see if anything spiked. Maybe someone used a lot more power than usual? Hope you get it sorted out!",

"comment": "Well, if you really want my opinion, it sounds like you're into progress, as long as it's \"somewhere else\".  Honestly, that's been a sticking point with rural Republicans for a long time.  City folks want to make decisions as long as what happens is somewhere else.  You know, rural place where \"no one\" lives.  Those someone's are often like \"wtf?\".  You seem to be experiencing this phenomenon from both fronts, bc now you've moved somewhere more rural, but those who actually own that rural land want to do something else with it.\n\nMy opinion really falls squarely in the middle.  Like, as middle as you can get, but I always er on the side of everyone has the right to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   People should be able to use their land as they see fit.  The exception to this would be if that use conflicts with ANOTHER person's Life, Liberty, and pursuit of happiness.  Not in the qualitative way (you make me feel unhappy bc I dont like a solar field vs a corn field), but in the quantitative way (you poured chemicals on your land, it seeped into the water table, gave me cancer, and that impacts my right to life, liberty, and ability to pursue happiness).   There's a stark difference.\n\nNow, your issue of \"being sold to the highest bidder\" is just capitalism to me.  I don't think we should have pure, unregulated capitalism by any means (see my comments about life, liberty, etc).  BUT, If you are selling something, why not sell it to the person willing to pay the most?  \n\nFinal thought (let me know if I missed any of your questions):\nThe mega- solar- farm- industrial complex wouldn't be such a big issue if we were all allowed to install rooftop and personal solar setups to reduce our need for commercial power.   BUT commercial power companies in MI got out in front of all of this and lobbied the state to enshrine \"metering\" rules that benefit them, force grid connections, and perpetuate this middle-man for-profit BS of utilities.  The only difference (lately) is who the companies are supporting.\nThe old State Senator Mike Shirky lives (lived?) not too far down the road from me.  His property had a huge solar installation go in, right before laws were changed, requiring net metering.  Lucky for him that his installation was grandfathered in, and his family can enjoy \"free\" electricity for as long as they want. Meanwhile, the rest of us have to hook up to the grid and pay increasing costs year over year, which trend exactly in line with profit increases by the utility parent companies. \n\nAnd Don't apologize for rambling too much.  The older i get, the more I can do it too!",

If humans still did it that way, and did it mindfully (as in, didn't hunt to extinction), I would 100% be okay with eating meat.\n\nThat statement contains a moral decision reached through an appeal to nature. The implication is that things which are natural are moral, and things which are \"unnatural\" are immoral. You go on to qualify that you are a vegan not because you oppose killing animals for the human consumption of their bodies, but because the process which produces animal products is unnatural.\n\nAs such, you should oppose things like medicine, which prevent natural death, and toilets, which prevent the natural flow of feces from animals to the earth. You should be deathly opposed to [Transhumanism](http://humanityplus.org/), which proposes doing away with such things altogether. They are the height of unnaturality and have no place in a moral world as determined by your moral system.\n\nWhat you may have intended to say is that you find the current animal agriculture system \"icky\" and do not find traditional methods of killing animals for the consumption of their bodies \"icky,\" which would allow you to deem transhumanism \"not icky.\" But you didn't say that.",

It doesn't matter who the victim is, animal or human being, nor the gender, race, sexual preference, nationality or any other possible characteristic of the being in need of help. \n\nI would hope that any feeling, thinking person would associate negative feelings with the experiences of witnessing these kinds of activities. However, on the whole, I'd say that these negative feelings are surpassed by the positive feeling that result when I can intervene, or give material support to those who intervene on behalf of those who need help. For example, just because of my dietary changes, there are thousands of animals who will not suffer and die for my sake during my lifetime. This effect is multiplied when others become, or move toward a vegan lifestyle after seeing my example. This is tremendously rewarding. I have seen people turn their lives around and regain their health by rejecting animal products and adopting a whole-foods vegan diet. I have seen people get off the streets, and turn away from lives of drug addiction and destitution. I have seen formerly abused animals be rehabilitated at various sanctuaries up and down the west coast of the United Status. Each of these actions occurred in whole or in part because of my desire to see the wrongs heaved against sentient beings be remedied. Overall, I'd say that it is a tremendously joyous life, with the caveat that I choose not to ignore the more painfully difficult aspects of life, and choose to do something about it.",

So when people tell you not to call yourself a vegan, it's just due to a definition that has be established for a very long time, it's not a personal attack.\n\nQuestion number two: Is eating these eggs ok?\n\nAnswer: It's up to you, really. We aren't going to tell you what to do. Like I said, I see it as unnecessary and being inconsistent with my personal values, but my values are not the same as yours. Keep in mind though, you've only been vegan for six months. The cravings for animals products will continue to get weaker, and even eggs can be replaced. I made a quiche the other day that was indistinguishable from a traditional egg-baged one, for example.",

There actually are a lot of vegans that seem to think that other people have a right to do what they want, even if that involves actions like eating meat when it's not necessary.\n\nWe definitely agree that the methods vegans use for educating, evangelizing or influencing other people shouldn't be counterproductive.

You would also be contributing to the increasing demand for vegan chefs and help the newer culinary school gain recognition.\n\n\nIf however, you plan on getting any old culinary job you would be expected to prepare non-vegan meals and as such you will have to contribute to all those bad things anyway.

For example I've never prepared or bought meat or baked anything non-vegan before. Everything I've learned in the kitchen has been making vegan meals and desserts. I've never used a grocery store's deli/meat or cheese section. I have no idea what to do with an egg or beef patty. It's a different starting point than others who have had to change ways and habits they've had for years and learn a different style of preparing food. I can imagine it's not always easy.

Haha.\n\n\n[Garlic spinach](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/garlic-sauteed-spinach-recipe.html) - I left out the butter and just used the olive oil. Still came out very nice.\n\n\nMashed potatoes is pretty straight forward. I boiled 4 chopped up potatoes, added in about a pound of cauliflower, drained it, tossed in a stick of margarine (Paula Deen ain't got nothin' on me!), then mashed that the hell up with a potato masher. Also added in some salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\n\n[Mushroom gravy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlh1tz4ZZxE)\n\n\nBlackberry BBQ:\n\n\n1 cup fresh blackberries\n\nabout two cups of strawberries, chopped roughly\n\n1 cup veggie stock\n\n1/2 cup ketchup\n\n1/4 cup brown sugar (I had some lying around; to make this super vegan, use sucanat instead)\n\n2 tablespoons vinegar\n\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n\n2 teaspoons chili powder\n\n1/8 teaspoon cinnamon\n\n1/4 teaspoon dried mustard\n\n1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n\n1 pinch salt\n\n\nAdd blackberries and strawberries to pot. Add in veggie stock. Cook over medium heat, simmering the mixture until the veggie stock begins to grow darker. Mash the berries a bit and add to a blender. Blend, blend, blend it up!\n\n\nPour back into the pot. Mix in the rest of the ingredients and cook until the sauce becomes much thicker. This took me about 15-20 minutes or so over medium heat.\n\n\nI used this with chickpeas, but I'd argue it would be better with either cannelini beans or with some tofu/tempeh/seitan/etc. I used chickpeas because I just now realized the tofu I have is silken tofu, even though it says it's firm. -_-\n\n\n/u/Foodnetworkveg, what's your favourite vegan comfort food? And yes, I am simply bringing up your username to make you salivate over more images of my food. Sorry I haven't posted in a while, finals are eating up my time to cook!",

If so, I'm just going to amend point number 1 to make it relevant to the UK. Quorn is the most well known brand of mock meat here, but unfortunately for some weird reason it has egg in it so it isn't vegan :( but luckily, most supermarket own brand mock meat is vegan! It's also much cheaper! Tesco has a really good cheap range of frozen vegan food. They even do tesco value £1 frozen vegan products, like chickpea and spinach falafel (I actually use these as meatballs with spaghetti) and veggie burgers and the like. Also, join the Facebook page \"Vegan (Supermarket Finds) U.K.\" - it is sooo helpful. Finally, there is so much stuff that is accidentally vegan, most of which you'll find in that group! It genuinely isn't as hard as it seems.",

You can tell based on my upvotes that a majority of a small population in this sub agrees with me. You can also make this decision based on your communication with other vegans. I have had the pleasure of meeting hundreds of vegans during my time. I have had conversations about Peta with many of them. The fact of the matter is that they are a bit of a dramatic organization that tries too hard to shock and awe. Many vegans don't want them speaking for them, which is why alternative organizations like Mercy for Animals become a more positive and mature voice for vegans in recent years. It's like I'm expected to provide a source for every claim as if such a source exists. Personal experience can provide enough information to make such a claim, especially on an informal comment thread.",

Also you are a new vegan maybe in a few years you will  feel different about working in a research facility.  My question to the research animals would be 'Do you want to be separated from your family and live in a cage and have painful procedures performed on you?' The answer would be no, but they have no choice, or voice and vegans are the voice of the voiceless.\nWhy work in a research facility? What about a job in veterinary medicine or animal related field?",

He'd go on sometimes about the continent to the South of Antarctica.\n\nFunnily enough he gave me the hardest time about being vegan, while eating riculously huge (foot long) jerky sticks of some kind of chicken beef pork mixture.   Who knows what parts he was actually eating.",

When I started it was fritos and black beans and lentils all the time and driving 40 min to get earth balance (shout out to rural midwestern vegans). Now, I can get a vegan cashew cheese pizza delivered to my apt!  Definitely part of that was moving to an urban area, but when I go home I notice a lot more veggie options, thanks to all of you.",

The reason I could deal with it was in each case they ate vegan when we were at either their/my/our place. So they were eating vegan more because it became easier, one of them only ate non-vegan when we went out to eat. On reflection I think I was okay with it because they were open minded to veganism, and were on the pathway to be vegan. So maybe I'm less okay with it than I thought haha.",

I was roughly morally aligned with veganism for about two years before I worked up the guts to break out of my habits and actually try adhering to veganism, and I've never looked back. Were those two years wasted? Or were those two years that I needed to spend slowly intaking and synthesizing information that I needed to finally make that decision to align my behavior with my beliefs? If a carnist decides to start trying meatless mondays, they are already doing more for animals than I was during those two years. I know we're desperate to live in a world that aligns with our beliefs, but expecting everyone to be able to just change their behavior and culturally embedded beliefs with a snap of the fingers is unrealistic.",

I think most of our family thought that it was just a phase that we would eventually quit, but three successful, vegan pregnancies and growing and thriving vegan children and I think everyone got the message that we are fully committed for life. Thankfully we have, been able to educate our siblings and now my husband’s brother and sister are both vegan as well as my sister. It’s been almost a decade, but we found that works best when you come at them with love and facts. \n\nLike you said, though, having these groups to come to, to feel, a sense of community is absolutely wonderful! It makes us feel a lot less alone, and we have even found a couple of other vegan families in our homeschool community. I just want to send you a big hug and remind you that no matter how small it may feel, that living this compassionate life does, indeed make a huge impact!",

In fact you can save money by eating at home. When you eat with friends just enjoy the conversation and have a few drinks.\n\nI speak from experience here from when I dieted.\n\nSo long story short, stop being a dick.

So it makes sense there are probably vegans out there that either eat bivalves because of 1) an interpretation of the harm reduction principle, which I mentioned before, or 2) because they don't even realize bivalves are animals to start with, because they've never thought about it that deeply",
