"comment": "1. The hydrogen economy is already a mature industry and the introduction of these new draws on the industry will have significant impacts to the industry which means these car manufacturers will have to account for this which means 'at-home' generation which will be very inefficient. This is a big deal because the electric car industry's biggest weakness right now is the inevitable crash of the power grid as electric cars become mainstream. However if there are inefficient hydrogen cars which draw even more. It's going to be bad news bears for both electric and hydrogen. \n\n2. In my mind neither electric nor hydrogen is competitive with gasoline. So trying to compare them to gas would be silly. \n\n3. Not sure I agree refueling time is an advantage. I have seen Elon musk's battery replacement process which is far faster.\n\n4. The current discussion is cars. Context is important.\n\n5. As far as I am aware gasoline and/or diesel is king.\n\n6. People say stupid things all the time. 64bytes is all you'll ever need. Metal-air, graphite, nanotubes are all appearing to be on the 3 year range. Whereas the hydrogen fuel cell gas station conversions are more along the lines of 10+ to never timelines. \n\n7. The next gen battery techs are looking at more like 10x battery densities. Which means the tesla model s range of 400km is now 4000km. You can go a very long way on 4000km. That's atune to recharging your car 2-3 times a year. \n\n8. Gasoline is controllable. We know that because we do that every day. Meanwhile hydrogen has [a pretty big battle to fight to get any adoption in transportation.](http://apchemcyhs.wikispaces.com/file/view/hindenburg-771072.jpg/31728067/hindenburg-771072.jpg) I for 1 will certainly be on the NIMBY groups in an attempt to make sure there are no hydrogen cars in my jurisdiction.\n\n9. Go ask him.\n\n10. I disagree with the inference that electric car people are up in arms.",

Try http://phys.org/news/2013-11-co2-emissions-driven-china-coal.html for more details.\n\nAccording to the [Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency in The Hague](http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/pbl-2013-trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2013-report-1148.pdf) \n\n&gt;Comparing regional CO2 emission trends reveals large differences in underlying causes, which complicates the evaluation of the robustness of observed trends. For 2012, remarkable trends were seen in the top 3 emitting countries/regions, which accounted for 55% of total global CO2 emissions. Of these three, China (29% share) increased its CO2 emissions by 3%, which is low compared with **annual increases of about 10% over the last decade**. In the United States (16% share) and the European Union (11% share) **CO2 emissions decreased by 4% and 1.6%, respectively.** In addition, in I**ndia and Japan, emissions increased by 7% and 6%**\n\n\n&gt;I live in Sweden, travel by public transport and don't own a car.\n\nThe nearest public transport from my house is 25 kilometers away.  My children's school is 11 km away, but they ride a school bus, or go in the electric car, so...  I also live in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, not anywhere that is conducive to riding a bicycle.  At least, not for me, or I'd ride my bike more.\n\nThe thing is, I've always said that we should seek to reduce CO2, because we're rapidly changing CO2 levels.  Just not because I'm afraid of thermal Armageddon.  Wind and solar are more expensive than natural gas and coal.  Natural gas is the LEAST polluting fuel we have.  We should use it in place of other, more polluting fuels, and should continue to develop better renewables.\n\nI don't agree with the message that we're about to melt.  For me, the ends don't justify the means.",

"comment": "No, the problem is that while 80% of commutes are less than 60 miles, the occasional day of needing more range is what outweighs any benefits for most people.\n\nI am a huge EV fan, but I am also a practical person:\n\nWe lease a Leaf and have a conventional car.  My wife drives the Leaf to work and we use it for most of our around town commutes. In the rare case she needs to go further than 65 miles in a day she takes my car. That ONLY works because I often work from home. If I had a commute of 90 miles every day and if she needed more range just 10% of the time, this arrangement wouldn't work. \n\nSadly it's that occasional need for more range that keeps most from adopting (at least on the US east coast with less quick charge infrastructure.) Once EVs can get 120-150 miles per charge for $30k car, the EV will see real mass adoption.",

She's getting rid of a crossover (hate the term, it's a bloody SUV and has the crap mileage to prove it) and she wants something with safety foremost, closely followed by style. I'd be happy with a four-door hatchback, wagony. \n\nI'd love an EV but am not sure if the performance is there yet. Was reading up on the charge station situation. 95% of the driving will be within the home charge range of most EV's. I like the idea of plug-in hybrids but their electric-only range still sucks. \n\nI'm thinking we're gong to be stuck on an ICE for the next car and go electric for the one after that. I bike most days and would love to be able to keep the gas consumption on the car just as low.",

To carry the car in inventory, the dealer must become certified, which isn't a new thing; dealers had to become certified to sell the Volt before they stocked it as well. Certification has at least 3 requirements: install EVSEs so they can keep the vehicles charged for test drives and demonstrate charging, at least one sales person has to do online training for the car, and at least one service person has to do online training for the car. But I only heard that through a third person, so don't quote me on the details.",

I feel like if we really want to be making a change to combat this problem we need to stop speaking about it so scientifically. When the average human being hears big science words they turn off and feel like its too hard to help it. I think to really start making change we need to start talking about the opportunities attached to solving the problem. Tell a person they can no longer drive their car and they dont want to hear any more. Tell a person about the new Tesla Model 3 and they are actually keen to listen. \n\nSorry I have had a few beers and thought why not pipe up now.",

"comment": "&gt; time is the one thing nobody can buy\n\nFWIW, it's no where near just time. I've been renting for my trip for the last few years for other reasons, and to a first approximation that makes the trip cost in the same ballpark as a ticket. (Fortunately, that ends now, since I just bought a new car.)\n\nFirst, I don't even view the time in the car as completely wasted; I use it to listen to podcasts or audiobooks. And most of the drive (/me shakes fist at Chicago for \"most\") is actually pretty relaxing, and portions of it are relatively scenic. Even just on that front, it's probably a better experience for me than flying. (When I say flying I'm talking about commercial flights in coach of course; but honestly I think it may even apply to if I had a PPL and a Cessna or similar. But maybe I'm wrong about the latter.)\n\nSecond, driving gives you a lot more flexibility. Storm rolling in tomorrow? If you're driving, you can leave today. If you fly, have fun paying that change fee or being \"stranded\". (Occasionally airlines will let you move up a flight due to weather without paying, but that's not the norm, and you're still at the whim of whether there are seats available.) Want to make a quick stop somewhere along the way? Easy peasy.\n\nThird, I don't have to worry about cargo. I play cello, and it's nice to be able to bring that along with me when I go see family. If I were to fly that trip? No f'ing way.\n\nFinally, the cost thing *is* an issue; I'll address that next.\n\n&gt; I really don't see that many people entertaining 11 hour drives in either ICE or EV\n\nI don't know if you're weird or my family is weird, but to me a trip of at least sightly shorter seems actually quite normal.\n\n11 hours is pushing it a bit maybe, but if you drop down to 9 hours, something like that was actually pretty common for my family when I was growing up, at least when my brother and I got a bit older. We even twice did a trip that Google Maps says is about 18½ hours one-way, split overnight. (That trip, BTW, would only be barely doable in a LR Model 3 currently -- you'd have to do one charge to 100% at a supercharger and then probably baby it a bit for the next 296 miles. I hope it's not too hot out.)\n\nI have family that lives about 9 hours away from where we lived; when we went down to see them, probably that entire trip cost well under what a single plane ticket would have.\n\nLooking back, I wonder if money was more of an issue for my family than for many, at least before 3rd grade or so, but we weren't *poor* by any means. Even so, I was in college before I did a trip via airliner. I think there's likely a *large* segment of the population that would do a long road trip because flying is cost-prohibitive.",

"comment": "You will only be able to claim any tax credits/rebates if you own the system.\n\nIf you lease the system, the company who owns the equipment (e.g. SolarCity if you were to lease from them) takes both the tax credit and rebates associated with that system.\n\nI’m not sure about the 5 year time horizon to claim any rebates. My understanding is that the tax credit portion can only be claimed over a two year period. Consult your tax professional for firm advice.\n\nAlso, here in California, electricity rates continue to rise but the cost is rising for night time usage (M-F 3PM-8PM). Meaning the electricity you’re sending back to the grid with your system during the day is receiving less financial credit than it previously would when peak electricity pricing was from 1PM-7PM. \n\nThis makes a great case for energy storage but it may require those who already have a solar system to install a battery/storage system to continue to financially benefit. Make sure you ask the rep you’re talking to about the utility rate you would be put on when you go solar and when your system will be sending electricity back to the grid which determines the value the utility company is buying that electricity for.\n\nHope that helps! I own a solar company in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

"comment": "Yeah, the Kona and the Niro just came out so they'll be a bit more expensive.  It probably won't take quite as long as you're thinking for charging on the road trip.  Here's a generic 400-mile-ish road trip down the east coast compared between a few models:\n\n[Chevy Bolt - 5:50 driving, 1:38 charging](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=4f330ac0-6008-41a0-98e3-ceade61849d8) \\- 2 stops, you can pretty easily get a used Bolt in the low 30s, mid-high 20s now.\n\n[E-Golf - 6:23 driving, 2:23 charging](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=dbc283a3-bffd-4f65-bc83-c15315773d72) \\- 5 stops, take the charging times with a grain of salt, too, without cooling you'll charge fastest at the first stop, then slower at each subsequent stop.  \n\n[Kia Niro - 5:50 driving, 1:20 charging](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=0f4a7dbe-9a4c-4156-80d0-bcd6fbcb0d64) \\- 2 stops, these are very new still, so don't expect much less than a few k$ off MSRP for dealer discounts.  Very nice otherwise.  Kona would be similar\n\n[Tesla Model 3 SR+ - 5:50 driving, 0:37 charging](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=ac8ec501-e565-468b-8ace-bf410d57c6cf) \\- 2 stops, Tesla's charge speed advantage shows through.\n\nMy personal take, I own a Bolt, but if I were to buy an EV right now I'd either buy a Niro or a 3 SR+.  If cost is the primary driving factor, I'd consider a Bolt again.  The main reasons being:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Bolt|Niro|3SR+|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Cheap (20k$ and up used)|Adaptive Cruise|AutoPilot|\n|Slow charging (55kW)|Moderate charging (75kW)|Fast charging (100kW)|\n|Hatchback|Hatchback|Sedan Trunk (downside)|\n\nThe Niro and the 3SR+ are about the same price, the 3's advantage is autopilot and charging, the Niro's advantage is cargo space and service support.  The Bolt's only real advantage is its price.  You can get a new one in the low 30k$'s, and used in the low 20k$'s\n\nI wouldn't consider the Leaf because most charging locations with Chademo (Leaf's fast charger) only have 1 or 2 plugs, so it's much more risky if you arrive and that one or two plugs aren't working.",

"comment": "That makes a little sense - but vehicle theft is actually a very small part of insurance costs. The vast majority of your insurance premium is due to the risk of accidents\n\nIf your car is stolen, your insurance pays out perhaps 50-90% of the value of your car, and no more than 100% of the value of the car\n\nIf you're in a major accident, that can involve paying out the value of your car, the value of everything you hit, and the medical costs and compensation for the occupants of those vehicles. Hit a coach, for example, and that could be a $600k vehicle write off, plus 50 medical claims...\n\nAnti-theft features don't make that much difference. They do help, but not to any really significant extent. Plus, of course, a Tesla is a *much* more attractive target for theft than a Camry",

"comment": "This is a profoundly ignorant take on the issue. \n\nTo get to \"mass adoption\", each individual manufacturer needs to invest billions of dollars in new supply chains, design and learn to produce and support new products (motors, inverters, batteries, etc), build new factories, integrate the new tech in their sales and service networks, etc. This necessarily makes the earlier products more expensive, which is why new technology always starts off expensive, and the early adopters fund all this so that eventually they can reach scale and learn to manufacture more efficiently and years later make cheaper products with that technology. \n\nThe EV tax credit was organized as a ~$1.5 billion subsidy to each manufacturer, to help support and speed this transition each one has to individually go through. Turning it into a \"3 million total\" credit just ensures that only Tesla gets help -- when they don't need it any more -- as they'll eat that all up before other companies have a chance to. This would not be good for the industry or the consumer. \n\nAs for \"underlying issues\", the underlying issue is that gas is artificially cheap in the US making EVs relatively uncompetitive here compared to other countries.",

"comment": "From your photo, Chademo was a great start, but CCS is now showing to be superior and Tesla still doesn't have an adapter for it... \n\nPlus, if you think the circle of dislike/fangirling is bad on this group, poke around on /r/personalfinance and you'll see how opposed they are just to the idea that electric cars save owners a significant amount of time and money...\n\nMy personal opinion, the Nissan Leaf needs liquid cooling in the battery if you live in the southern half of America, but I have one here in TN because it's budget-friendly\n\nAt the rate I'm going, I could drive this car well over 100k mi and probably keep it around until the battery can't handle a 35mi commute...\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla is awesome, leading the way, and boldly pushing forward in ways I never expected... \n\nThe cars are sometimes a bit buggy, they need to be more flexible about repairs, and need a bigger support network to offer 3rd party certifications. \n\nOverall, top-notch innovation from all parties, but the rest of the automakers are really dragging their feet and not doing much or promoting anything to drum up consumer interest in the concept of how awesome electric cars are.",

I knew going in I was paying a premium for one of the top rated local installers and frankly my experience has sucked, 4 months to install, unexpected 2600 bill and now $10k more expensive then going with a cheap play like Tesla",

"comment": "A thoughtful transition of its ground transportation   \nsystem from one mainly reliant on the passenger car to one that is   \nmultimodal. . .\" though we diverge on the extent to which each aspect should be looked at (the vast majority of the article focuses on alternative fuels for personal transportation). My point is that, if the contents of the article's title are what the writer is concerned about, a shift to electric vehicles will probably offset little if any carbon overall. Moreso, the chances of INCREASING overall emissions are probably far greater if funding is primarily targeted towards EVs instead of public transit. Lastly I will reiterate, EV incentives disproportionately go towards those who are well off instead of the larger population of people who can barely afford to keep their car running in the first place.",

"comment": "&gt;But the current EV they make, the bZ4X is an awfully lackluster attempt by a company this big, and compares unfavorably to literally all of it’s competition.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If Toyota was really for BEVs, they could’ve 100% made something better.\n\nAnd here we go again. There are people in this very thread throwing out statements like [*\"on par with a ten year old ev!\"*](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/v9hylq/comment/ibxz87p/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and then repeating and repeating it in every thread they can find because they saw someone say *100kW* and they've made up their mind.\n\nTo the contrary:\n\n|Model|Range (WLTP)|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla Model 3 (RWD)|305mi|$48,490 / £48,590|\n|Kia EV6 Wind (RWD)|328mi|$47,000 / £41,695|\n|BZ4X Pure (FWD)|321mi|$42,000 / £41,950|\n\nIf you live in the UK, and you want a family car that does acceptable range, the BZ4X Pure is roughly in-line with the EV6 Wind on both price and range, and ***beats*** *the Tesla Model 3 SR.*\n\nRemarkably, in the US, the BZ4X FWD beats both the Tesla Model 3 RWD *and the EV6 RWD* on both price and range.\n\nIt has slower charging than both of those vehicles, but if you charge at home, the BZ4X ends up being not only a perfectly fine choice, but one which has received excellent reviews on attributes like cabin comfort and build quality. It comes standard with a heat pump, has class-leading ground clearance, and has been receiving rave feedback on handling and interior space.\n\nIn fact, reviewers have *specifically said things* like:\n\n&gt;*\"The BZ4X is the kind of EV that is definitely better in person than it may appear on paper.* ***A lot of people were concerned that Toyota had just phoned in their new EV and that is absolutely not the case***. *Toyota has definitely applied their own set of priorities and practicalities and pragmatic engineering design to the BZ4X, but I actually think that's an asset. It ends up performing better than people had expected. The range is going to be real world acceptable and real world comparable to the competition.\"*\n\n[— Alex on Autos](https://youtu.be/ueJZPRWMCkY?t=1660)\n\n&gt;*After spending the day driving the new 2023 BZ4X, just like the Subaru Soleterra that I drove a couple weeks ago this vehicle certainly is* ***much better in person when you actually drive the vehicle*** *versus when you're just looking at the specs on paper. In terms of competitiveness the interior is one of the most spacious in the segment — you guys saw the back seat is huge the cargo area is usable — and even though it's missing a frunk i imagine that shouldn't be a deal breaker for deal breaker for most of you...* ***really what shocks me about this platform is how it drives.***\n\n[— Redline Reviews](https://youtu.be/feqeTwe7WUM?t=1782)\n\nSeriously, go watch some reviews. Understand that I am not the outlier here, you are. The disconnect between the narrative in this community and what actual reviewers are saying **is vast.**\n\n*If the truth was so damning, we wouldn't need to constantly stretch it.*",

It's true that LFP's degrade *less* than NMCs, but it's not true that they don't degrade or that charging them to 100% is somehow good for them. 100% charge allows the BMS to callibrate the displayed range more easily, and is more convenient for the driver. That's it. 100% degrades LFP *more* than 90%, it's just a much slower degradation.\n\nI usually charge my LFP M3 to 90% day-to-day (as I don't usually need the full range), then 100% once a month or so or before/during long trips.",

No need to install all of them at once. \n\nEach EVSE can then provide a descently high current (more than 30A) but will regulate down if the system reaches maximum load (it probably never will)\n\nSo instead of capping the install at 30A pr. outlet and max 130 outlets you can have full provisioning of potential outlets and much higher practical speed with load sharing.",

They are light duty and don't hold up to 150-200 stops a day, day in day out. They are glorified minivans. Lucky if you get 5 yrs and 200k from them.\n\nThe Rivian EDV is a quarter step up. Amazon is a light delivery company, much like Express. The EDV won't hold up to heavier freight. Time will tell if it holds up at all. Call me when they hit 250k.\n\nThe 'Step Van' and the Workhorse are industry standards. They will continue to be industry leaders, likely acquiring a minimum 50% market share when all is aid and done. The more freight you can stuff in one truck, one driver, one route, the more money is made.\n\nThey're in business to make money, right?",

Also... wind power has been awful in my state..  killing tons of birds and not producing much.  Maybe offshore wind will be the solution.   This country needs to update power infrastucture more before pushing so hard on EVs.\n\nI'll take the downvotes...  still love my EV.. but it isnt usable in my democrat controlled state for trips, especially in the winter on the highway where my range is 130 miles.",

"comment": "Solar panels can handle charging electric vehicles well, but for a steady power supply, it's a good idea to include a battery system between the panels and charging units. This allows the battery to store extra energy, ensuring a constant power source even during periods of limited sunlight.  \n  \nI went through a similar decision-making process. Using this solar comparison site helped me assess different panel and battery options, considering factors like efficiency, cost, and reliability. It made the decision-making process much easier.",

"comment": ">I suppose that in some cases you could dump extra energy into a hydrogen generation system instead of turning off the power. \n\nSure, turn off the power! That's going to do great when the sun sets or the wind stops.\n\n >However, it would still be cheaper and more efficient to use it on-site to generate more electricity during the day than ship it across the country to be used in a less efficient car fuel cells.\n\nThat's literally what I'm saying. Hydrogen generation to power on-site energy storage/generation, and some use in heavy industry like global shipping. I've repeated this multiple times, but unsurprisingly this subreddit seems to have an understanding of the electric grid that begins and ends at \"EV car good!\" Yeah, no shit BEV personal vehicles are good, and are the obvious way forward. Developing hydrogen cars is a stupid waste of time. But hydrogen power in other applications is still far better than battery electric storage, and likely will be for at least the next century. The energy needs and use patterns of the entire world are complex, and there is no simple one-size solution because life is not a video game.",

It's barely been a month but so far I really like it. \n\nI was planning on buying a RAV4 hybrid but this was cheaper (with the rebate, plus 0% financing) and I honestly wanted a fully electric car so I was happy to find one. \n\nThe subscriptions on the equinox are less obscene than the Toyota from what I could see. The RAV4 locked out remote start features behind a subscription. Others have given a better breakdown of the price. But for me there won't be a reason to subscribe. Everything I want I get for free and I can use my phone's hotspot for everything else. \n\nAs a side note, while the car doesn't have apple car play you can still use iTunes on your phone through the car's Bluetooth.",

"comment": "To be clear. During the day, when the sun it out, a residential solar system will be producing energy. That energy feeds all the current loads in the house first. In situations where you are producing more solar energy than the loads in your house are consuming, the excess energy is sent out to the grid, and used by your neighbors presumably. A special electrical utility meter is installed which can keep track of any surplus energy sent out to the grid. This process is called \"net metering\", and is the standard in residential solar, although a few states and localities do not allow net metering or grid backfeeding. Typically, you get credit for the energy you send back to the grid, which is then subtracted from your use on your bill (night time use, for example).\n\nThere are also completely offgrid systems that typical have batteries (or another form of energy storage). You need the batteries to provide stable energy at all times. The solar is just used to charge the batteries. It is the batteries which is powering your house, and the batteries are powered by the sun. \n\nThen there are ac coupled hybrid systems, which would be a grid tied system with battery back up. Think of the batteries as a generator used to provide energy to often critical loads during power outages. In this situation the solar or the grid could be charging the batteries, depending on the load demand of the house.",

Anti-progress at its best. \n\nYou alarmists are the ones advocating a vegan cave man lifestyle... you tell everyone that all of humanity is a virus on the planet and demand that everyone listen to you.  You selfishly assume you are morally and scientifically superior, that your ideas are the only and ultimate solution and not just refuse, but demand that NOBODY listen to any criticism of what you propose or claim.\n\n&gt;Fossil fuels are finite, yet rather than looking to simple economic concepts like 'supply and demand,' we insist that our hands are tied. Bullshit.\n\nYou alarmist don't understand what would happen if we actually took your advice and cut all fossil fuel use... it would be an ecological and economic apocalypse as 7 billion people cut down anything burnable and hunt everything edible into extinction... All within a year. Fossil fuels keep the whales alive and the forests green. \n\nYou idiot alarmists assume nature is perfect... Mother nature is a cold hearted bitch and humanity, assuming we survive our  technological adolescence, will conquer it and the whole planet will be terraformed within 1000 years.  Natural biology will be a foreign concept within 10,000 years since we have already replaced natural selection with technologically guided selection.  Fuck nature... I want the future... and the future has no time for the bugs.\n\n\nObviously fossil fuels will not last forever... But they will not run out before technology gives us an economical replacement, we are nearly there already with non baseload solar power.  Regardless... its you fucking idiot alarmists who oppose the only green sustainable baseload power... nuclear power.\n\nWho its anti-progess? It's you alarmist idiots who oppose GMOs, Nuclear, and insist we live an agrarian lifestyle like a fucking caveman. \n\nYou want some respect?  Quit telling everyone they are a virus, and call out the more extremist idiots of your own tribe, because they are doing FAR more damage to your cuase then any \"denier\" ever could.  http://www.ecomodernism.org/",

Thanks!!!\n\nAnd the carrying solar panels with you was a joke, Knowing how you think, you would say that was an option so you can go far as a gas car.  \n\nEnjoy your leaf.  But around here, you don't have a place to plug in.  But that wouldn't matter to you, you couldn't get it here anyhow unless you loaded it on a trailer or took off a week to drive.  \n\nI guess for people that live in a big city, that work from home, a car like yours is not a bad idea.  But it sucks you used my tax dollars to buy it, and put panels on your roof.  I could of used that money for things that would change my life.",

"comment": "There's a very strong relationship between solar and computer tech, which has to do with material supply chain. If you look at the % market saturation if silicon-based consumer electronics in Western countries, it plateaus at 1998, followed by a crash in the global semi-conductor industry whose primary commodity is silicon.\n\nCheap silicon drove investment into solar-dedicated silicon refineries in the early 2000s built by REC. I worked for an engineering company that built some of those refineries, and they said in 2005 that it might not be a good idea because of how few man-hours solar project development required, as compared to traditional power plant construction.\n\nPrevious to that time, solar panels and silicon transitions hit the market at almost the same time (Irish twins) in the mid 1950s. Obviously computers won out on supply chain contracts until the late 90s semi-conductor crash. At which point silicon had ceased it's exponential growth curves and the  solar industry was required to maintain said growth curves.\n\nHence the price of solar starts to fall in the late 2000's as a result of those mid 2000's refineries coming online, as a result of the late 90s maturation of growth rates of silicon-based consumer electronics. Computers were getting smaller, not larger.\n\nWaiting is in nobody's favor. Donald J. Drumpf could issue an executive order tomorrow capping the ITC at $2000 and have historical precedent in his favor. The ITC used to be 40% for small residential solar projects, until Reagen decided to tackle corporate tax reform.\n\nSo yes, do solar now, but acknowledge growth in solar has more to do with the pull of the maturation of computer technology than the push of green energy policy (at least, this is what I believe). OP should look at buying previous generation module technology if he wants cost savings - similar to computers.",

I'm buying a place that will need the roofing replaced pretty soon which is going to cost $15k. \n\nIf I could go with a solar shingle I could probably subtract that $15k from the rest of my math since I'm going to be $15k in no matter what anyway.\n\nActual pricing data is actually pretty hard for find on them because they are a really niche product still but if the math made sense I have to suspect more people would be using them but they generally still aren't even considered for new construction so I have to assume the pricing/problems just isn't worth it yet.\n\nLong term they should eventually be viable because it's vertical integration and the pricing only has to beat roofing + traditional solar  panels combined to be worth it on paper.\n\nThat's probably at least 5 years away or Down Chemical probably wouldn't have decided their solar shingle product wasn't worth keeping considering they had a market lead and tossed it aside at the end of last year.",

Time to go looking for the next big thing.\n\n&gt;Renewable hydrogen produced using solar energy to split water is an energy fuel of the future. Accelerated innovation in both major domains of solar energy (photovoltaics and concentrated solar power) has resulted in the rapid fall of the solar electricity price, opening the route to a number of practical applications using solar H2.",

"comment": "&gt;No, they aren't; however, overestimation brings a whole lot of unwanted baggage. There have been a great number of false alarms over the last few decades, both environmental and otherwise. One of my favorite examples was Ancel Keys and his hypothesis that dietary fat leads to heart disease. Because the alarm was sounded before proper vetting could occur, and because government got involved *way* too early, people started reducing fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate. The obesity epidemic and the cavalcade of diseases related to metabolic syndrome that followed the push to reduce dietary fat is a great example of what happens when overestimation occurs. \n\nYes, this does happen. Unfortunately knowing when to make a move is not easily predicted. \n\n\n&gt;Maybe, maybe not. It's pretty hubristic to think a non-coupled chaotic system can accurately be modelled by throwing more computing power at it. Yes, models will improve, but the fact that the trigger was pulled on policy measures (most of which have been disastrous failures) demonstrates why there needs to be far more science before policy happens. Further, it demonstrates the need for identification of bias and groupthink through measures such as red teaming (and other mechanisms) before the alarm is raised.\n\nI agree, like hinted at above, jumping the gun is not a good idea. The problem here is how much more science before we make a move? There are some two thousand papers from a span of 3 years that I have access to, that either are directly or indirectly related to AGW. \n\nWe both agree it's happening, and I have ran into many people on debate boards that either deny it's happening or claim humans have not influenced it at all. \n\nI'm more concerned with getting everyone in the same book, before getting everyone on the same page.\n\nThere is a problem that needs a solution. \n\n&gt;Consider something, if you would. How many people actually claim climate doesn't change? How many claim that mankind has exactly zero impact on the climate? It's a pretty small percentage of the population, yet there has been so much poop flinging between that fringe and climate activists that climate change has become a topic to be avoided at all costs. \n\n&gt;What's more, there's this ridiculous myth out there among climate activists that failure to enact policy is the fault of this fringe of actual deniers. It's a viewpoint so naive that it's knee-slappingly laughable. Yet this myth has pitted folks like yourself against people who are dubious about some element of the climate narrative for 30 years now. The result? Everyone is talking past each other. I'll illustrate this with words from the very comment I'm responding to in a minute.\n\nConsidering the leader of the free world thinks it's a hoax and the leader of our environmental agency shares similar views, I have to disagree about it being a small percentage and both of the people above have decided to publicly take a step back from policy. I have to wonder if this is your blindspot maybe?\n\n\n&gt;Actually, no. Overestimating leads to ill-considered policy that is just as costly in net present value terms and inaction. We've seen this time and time again. I'll gore something of a sacred bull here to illustrate. Wind power. How many times have you heard that wind is now cheaper than ${fossil_fuel}? I hear it all the time. The assumption is that wind is offsetting fossil fuel use. In fact, it's not. Wind, because of its intermittency, cause **more** consumption of fossil fuels: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518300983\n\n&gt;We could also talk about the bad policy related to solar power. We could talk about how subsidies are a wealth transfer from poorer households to richer ones, on average; how subsidies caused production to shift to China where solar panels have double the embodied carbon of panels produced elsewhere; how emphasis on solar in some markets has actually caused a \"duck curve\" in power demand, which requires very fast responding fossil fuel generation.\n\n&gt;Or, we could talk about how hasty policy has created a market for biofuels that has consumed arable land, denuded old-growth forests, etc. \n\n&gt;There are more examples, but you get the idea.\n\n\nThis is the free market working as intended, is it not? New innovations take time to become cheap enough to gain traction.\n\n&gt;Do you support nuclear power?\n\nYes I do. \n\n&gt;This is the sentence I referred to earlier, which I wanted to use to illustrate how people talk (shout) past each other. I think perhaps you aren't aware of what it's like to be on the other end of things. There's a whole lot of name calling happening, almost always from folks on the political left, if one answers \"no\" to any of the following questions:\n\n&gt;- Is CO2 a greenhouse gas? \n\n&gt;- Is the climate system dominated by strong net positive feedbacks? \n\n&gt;- Is capitalism the root of anthropogenic climate change (AGW)?\n\n&gt;- Is a carbon tax necessary to fight AGW?\n\n&gt;- Can climate change be solved using only wind, water, solar, and conservation?\n\n&gt;I kid you not, I have seen people labelled \"deniers\" for answering \"yes\" to all those questions except one. Your team, if I can call them that, are complete assholes at times. So I am not too worried about you being called \"libtard\" or whatever. The poop flinging flies both ways, and always has. I'm sorry to inform you that by participating in it, you've only made matters worse. \n\nYes, it's the people that aren't precontemplative that should be the target. Outliers always get in the way and both sides are to blame for this. Unfortunately human behavior, like tribalism, isn't going away.\n\nThis brings me back to my initial concern though. Why is there so little skepticism on a sub called climate skeptics? \n\nI can't believe it's my inability to come across as sincere, when I see others, who are way better at this then me, get downvoted for holding the same position I do. This is the first sub I've ever commented on, and without your intervention, I can't get past the 10 minute post penalty.",

"comment": "&gt;Why is net metering bad? Ultimately, wouldn't I still be buying electricity back at a cheaper rate than if I had no solar at all?\n\nNet metering isn't bad.  But it gives the utility companies the ability to control what solar owners have to pay them.  For example, the utility company could change rates for solar owners to $.50/kwh at night time and $0.05/kwh during the mid afternoon.  Then for non-solar owners they could just make the rate $0.20/kwh all day long.  Under this scenario, it would be much more difficult to save money with solar unless the solar owner also spend a lot of money on batteries.\n\n&gt;I can only cover 71% of my bill here in LA. Is it not worth it?\n\nHard to say with certainty and depends on if you have SCE or DWP.  Lets say you use 10,000 kwh during the year.  That means you'd have to buy 2,900 kwh from utility company if you install solar.  You would pay a higher rate for that 2,900 kwh with solar than if you didn't have solar.  You might still save money, but savings goes down significantly.  Also, at only 71%, it would probably never make sense to install a battery, so you'd always be at the mercy of utility company's net metering policy.\n\nHave you looked at Sunpower panels?  They are more expensive, but they generate a lot more electricity for each panel.",

Is solar plus battery storage as viable in Texas as it is in say Hawaii? No, that's because in Texas people have access to cheaper power because of the O&amp;G production in the state. In Hawaii, where they have to ship fuel to generating facilities, thermo generation is expensive. Solar plus storage exceeds thermo in places like Hawaii. What about in a pace that has both O&amp;G production and cheap thermo power, but also has high solar production? Well in my state of Colorado, there was a recent RFP and bids were not only comparative to thermo, they actually got sub 3 cent/kw bids. What that means is that the gap is closed in places and closing fast in others.",

But yeah, I believe the equipment is still Sunrun’s, unless the owner ended up buying them outright... but that’s allowed maybe only at the end of the 20 year term? I’m thinking the equipment is still Sunrun’s and you’re just stuck with that PPA (paid off though!). \n\nHow are you feeling about a Powerwall, and what is your justification of need? Are you in an area that has reasonably frequent outages? I really wanted a Powerwall but after talking with folks on Reddit I realized it didn’t make financial sense to save energy for nighttime use when I could pull from the grid at the same credit as how I shared my energy via net metering. When thinking about outages, I realized I never had one in the 4 years I’ve been in this home. If I was worried about rare outages I should get a small and efficient generator. It doesn’t follow the narrative I want for my life, but my life is more than just clean energy at the moment, and the Powerwall isn’t cheap. One day when they’re cheaper definitely.\n\nCall Sunrun and ask if you can add a Powerwall. In my state, MA, they’re now allowing the energy companies to tap into consumers battery storage at peak load times to offset, and they’re paying the consumers the premium rate. It looks really good on paper, idk if your state does anything similar. But I’d just go and ask Sunrun what’s up you have nothing to lose.",

"comment": "This is just as much a regulatory question as it is a technical question.  \n\nFirst, make sure your local grid authority and your interconnection agreement allows charging from the grid.\n\nSecond, consider if you are claiming the federal tax credit on the battery associated with the solar.  There are IRS limitations around how much charge must come from the solar array.  \n\nThird, is you are in California and filed for the SGIP incentive then you also mist adhere to strict charging from solar and battery cycling requirements.\n\nAfter all of that?  Hell yeah.  Arbitrage away on your variable rate structure.  Any ability to shift stored energy use into your highest cost energy time will help break even in the investment faster.  TOU windows are a common target for this type of storage application.  Most battery energy storage products come with a simple scheduler that you can use to set times on the day when you want to discharge.  But you may need to manually switch from back up to scheduled dispatch on a daily basis.  \n\nFor more sophisticated solutions, look into commercial grade energy management systems (EMS).  Products these days are being developed with machine learning that forecast solar and load on a daily basis.  It then can establish daily discharge behaviors by layering in the value of energy at 15-min intervals.",

I should have set up the 3% $50k HELOC when I had the chance :-(. Alternatively, though, I could pull from investments, but that's probably more expensive in the long run than a loan... though current rates are 6%+, which isn't worth it.",

"comment": "Hi! I'm Rob, and I sell solar! I also try to keep up to date with the solar industry, especially as it pertains to RESIDENTIAL solar. Let me break it down:\n\n1. If you live in the U.S., and you're purchasing your system, then the U.S. government will pay for 1/3 of the cost of that system via a tax credit. So your 30k quote is -actually- closer to 20k!\n\n2. According to most projections, the cost of producing solar energy should drop from 40$ per megawatt hour to closer to 20$ per megawatt hour by 2030. In fact, some are even indicating residential solar rates at under 1 c per kilowatt hour from 2025 - 2032; but to be honest, this number comes from an industry publication, so take it with a grain of salt. Still, this is huge! Solar energy production is getting cheaper with time as the technology advances, so as your system ages and you upgrade it, your savings will continue to grow. You think saving $1,500 per year is good? By this time in 5 years, you could be saving double that.\n\n3. Your local utility company may offer a program that will buy your surplus solar energy from you. Give them a call!\n\n4. If you want to make the \"full leap\" and purchase an electric vehicle, as well, then you save EVEN MORE money! Studies indicate that people who own solar panels are more likely to drive electric vehicles, citing the low cost of operating the vehicle; you're not buying gas for the vehicle, but you're ALSO not charging it off of the grid - you charge the vehicle, for free, at home, off of your solar panels. Not only can solar save you money on your utility bill, but it can also totally eliminate your gas bill if you live in an area where an EV is practical.\n\n5. Energy independence - there are already plenty of examples of people enjoying electricity in their home while their neighbors suffer a power outage - not a huge selling point in most urban \nareas, but if you're a homesteader, a prepper, or you're just generally concerned with your dependence on your local utility company/government, then solar could be a great investment.\n\nAll of this being said, I would NOT consider Solar to be an investment. Solar panels are a depreciating asset; you're not buying solar panels with the expectation of the solar panels gaining value in the coming years, because they won't. Much like any component on your roof, your solar panels are constantly wearing away, and they'll need to be replaced eventually with newer, more efficient panels. Much like your cell phone or your car, your solar panels are losing value over time. So why buy solar?\n\n*Capability*. The solar panels THEMSELVES don't contribute much in the way of valuation to a home, but the home's CAPABILTIY to produce it's own electricity is becoming a more and more common selling point in real estate. As more and more Americans go Solar, you'll quickly find that solar panels will become a standard in American roofing and housing development. Even now, there are housing developments and apartment complexes adding solar capability on as a premium feature for residential rented spaces.",

There's nothing in there about additional charges if they get into it and find out it takes more work then they thought.  \n\n\nNow that I think of it, I had a text conversation with the sales guy who explicitly said that they budgeted some money for the fix of the old system and his CFO said that it will probably take more than that to fix it, but he was ok with it as I was adding a ton of solar panels to the system. So from the get-go they were under the impression that it would take extra work and they were ok with it.",

"comment": "All are entitled to their own opinion. Mine is I’d much rather have reliable power electronics. One reason is that’s a potential single point of failure compared to a possible failed module that might be one out of 500 attached to one inverter. \n\nAnother of the many reasons: a project can achieve Substantial Completion per its contract with multiple modules damaged or not producing. However, if that inverter isn’t working, ain’t nobody getting paid. \n\nOk I’ll keep going until I get bored … if a module fails during the warranty period, it won’t jeopardize a production guarantee. Opposite for the inverter. It also isn’t costly to replace. Opposite for the inverter. They’re cheap - we buy high-quality N-type modules, rated at 4000 Pa uplift (because I work in hurricane areas) for $0.20/WDC. That’s less than $100 each. Opposite for the inverter. Lastly, and I’m pretty sure I’m right about this - over the last 17 years other than bullet holes and hail I’m guessing I’ve had less than a dozen failed modules even after all that time in the field. And they’re just ordinary commercial product. \n\nOn a recent project, we evaluated Sunpower against Q-Cells against ET Solar. The cost of energy from Sunpower was the most expensive by about 15% after running a PVsyst production model on all three. That was because a charming Sunpower sales VP had dinner with my client and convinced her that it was a better and cheaper solution. BS. The client used ET Solar, the least marketed of the three. The project has about 2% less power capacity and 4% less energy, but the cheaper CapEx drove a lower overall Cost of Energy. \n\nWe could debate this until the cows come home. But it’s nappy time for me. \n\nThe only modules I’m opining about are crystalline silicon. Thin film other than First Solar isn’t worth the boxes it is shipped in; and First Solar is available only to generation-scale utility developers that can afford to buy them 2-3 years ahead of their COD.",

"comment": "Nope. SRECs are a property right like a deed. They exist as a result of the physical fact of generating solar energy.\n\nRenewable Portfolio Standards (and voluntary purchasers) create the incentive by imposing a fine if utilities do not procure enough renewable energy for their customers (or a willingness to pay on the voluntary side). SRECs are utilized as the accounting mechanism to fulfill RPSs. SRECs exist in states with no RPS, they just are worth much less.\n\nThe reason that nobody is arguing with companies over their use of tax credits while also claiming to use solar energy is that the latter accounting is all handled by RECs.\n\nWhen making a claim beyond just the use of solar, such as \"this solar project reduced the carbon intensity of the grid\" or \"this solar project is reducing [company]'s carbon footprint\", the tax credits would be considered to determine the additionality basis of that claim (i.e. whether the project would have happened anyway). Plenty of people are arguing that companies shouldn't be counting the environmental benefits of solar they would have installed anyway, or which the utility would have installed anyway somewhere else.",

Local credit union or bank is often the best honest rates without dealer fees\n\nIf you are thinking about adding more solar and batterie get additional quotes before you make your decision.\n\nAsk sunrun for a copy of the contract so you can see what it really says and what they really cover.

Food manufacturers put dairy, eggs, gelatin, and other meat by products in MANY things.  Things you would not expect them to be in.\n\nYou can take it as it comes, you are in a transition period, and we are all human mistakes get made (I have a 2+ year old jar of spaghetti sauce with milk in it in my cuboard, been meaning to give it away.  also, a box of veggie burgers that have egg in them.) but to hold yourself strictly to a vegan diet requires effort, especially if you aren't cooking a wide variety of foods for yourself.",

"comment": "American Dietetic Association:\n\n&gt;“It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life-cycle including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence and for athletes.”\n\nI agree. Any pregnant woman should have a well-planned diet, vegan or not, and any parent/guardian of a child should make sure they have a well-balanced diet, again, vegan or not. \n\nA lot of these articles, like the one linked to above, are full of bull. There are plenty of vegetarian (including vegan) parents raising vegan kids just fine. In fact, they tend to be healthier. (See: http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/realveganchildren for just a few.) What people should be up in arms about are the kids who are being fed a diet of sugar and fried meat products. We have a generation of children who are growing up with health problems that used to only be seen in much, much older people and even then fairly rarely. They might not die as quickly, but many of these diseases can absolutely be fatal. And that's FAR more prevalent. \n\nUnfortunately, there's the occasional family that really screws up. It happens with non-vegans, too, but you don't hear \"Death by carnism!\" -- at least not applied to such a situation. What really gets me is that often the people in these articles aren't even vegans. One article I read, I don't remember which, had a family that were called \"vegans\" but they ate fish. And sometimes the kids, it turns out, had health problems that led to the nutritional problems and not just the other way around.  \n\nIn any case, there's a lot of uncited stuff being said in that article. \"Studies show that...\" is not the same as actually citing studies. If that was a Wikipedia article, at least we could put \"uncited\" and \"original research\" and \"biased\" tags all over it.",

"comment": "In response to the assertation that humans' need for B12 means they are not meant for a vegan diet...\n\n(Quoting from [this article](http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/b12.htm)) \n\n\"Neither plants nor animals make vitamin B12. Bacteria are responsible for producing vitamin B12. Animals get their vitamin B12 from eating foods contaminated with vitamin B12 and then the animal becomes a source of vitamin B12.\"\n\nDue to our rigorous washing of fruits and veggies even before they hit the grocery store shelves, most all traces of soil, and therefore B12, are washed away. The only reason that meat-eaters get B12 is because the animals they eat ingested B12 through the soil. So it's not like B12 is a vitamin produced by animals and only available through meat.",

In fact his page has the same egg promo material that the egg lobby was found to have paid bloggers to promote during the Hampton Creek investigation.

Can you feel remorseful when you should and joyful the rest of the time?   \n\nYoutube is awesome for cooking shows and recipes.   Most of the world is not meat-centric in their diet,  learning new spices and ingredients is a great way to \"convert\" others even partway, especially parents who WANT to spend healthy quality time with you.   Do research on WHY you are choosing certain ingredients,  teach them and make their lives better along the way.",

Well, I was in college and thought going vegan would be challenging on many levels. My family members found just being vegetarian extreme already. I barely new how to eat vegetarian and was intimidated by changing my diet so much and so fast. \n\nPeople are bad at changing bad habits. Just look at all the people that still smoke and buy from sweatshops. If something is a norm, like smoking once was, and how eating animal products still is, it's really hard to change behavior even if you know that the behavior is bad. I eventually went vegan, but it's really hard to convince people who are set in their ways. \n\nI have the advantage of making these changes at the point in my life where I was just learned to cook for myself, so I'm developing vegan habits. I also have the advantage of their being other vegans in my life. It helps to see others make ethical choices when most of society just does things the way  they are used to.",

To me, it makes sense that vegans tend to be more preachy than vegetarians.\n\nI went vegetarian as a transition to vegan and I don’t fault people, but it seems like vegetarians can be a lot less preachy often because they still support the enslavement of animals for their taste buds. I mean it appears that dairy cows have a worse life than meat cows and egg laying hens live a worse life than chicken used for food. \n\nThis isn’t to point fingers, but eggs and dairy aren’t some benign food that somehow causes less suffering to animals.\n\nOn top of that many vegetarians consume more animal products than health Concious omnivores.",

So I'm not vegan yet but am looking for advice on a sustainable strategy. \n\nI've been vegetarian for about a year and half now and coped reasonably well with adjusting, I haven't broken ever which I feel good about but I've become increasingly aware of the suffering that the dairy industry causes, I have abstained from eggs for the most part as I was aware when going veggie, so don't foresee that as an issue. \n\nDid anyone try the vegan Mon-Fri, veggie on the weekend? Did anyone try the things they liked one more time or did you just go?\n\nI am mentally ready but I'm worried about breaking when I get drunk and want a pizza. Apologies for the lack of coherence in this. Thanks in advance for any advice your may be able to give.",

Last night my grandpa told me a soup with chicken broth was vegan, and when i repeated my restrictions he was like Well at least you can eat the salad! but that had cheese on it... he then heated me some spinach (which was sweet) but gave it to me with bread and butter lmao. I ate a burrito beforehand so I wasn’t even that upset, but this taught me how strangely hard veganism is for some people to understand.",

Some vegans were farmers [themselves](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/cx9alz/my_last_week_as_an_omnivore/eyjrs88?context=3).  \n\nIf you feel bad for farmers because of unemployment issues, that what you object to is the terrible way we treat poverty in this country, but you don't owe farmers your consumption just because they exist.  There are farmers who are growing the plant crops you would be using if you switched to veganism, and it doesn't make sense to put your own health at risk simply because we're doing a bad job supporting the unemployed transition into new industries or careers that keep up with the times.  You shouldn't feel obligated to drink milk or use other dairy products that make you sick in order to \"support the farmers\" any more than you should feel obligated to smoke cigarettes or use tobacco products just because tobacco farmers exist.  \n\n&gt; can't even imagine how much I would be shamed at family events\n\nYou don't have to present it as veganism if you don't want to.  You can talk about having a plant based diet, that you literally cannot digest lactose (most adults in the world cannot), or about how it's a personal health issue that isn't up for debate.",

Bill Gates even wants people to turn to fake, “synthetic meats”. But it’s all mostly hype and hysteria.\n\nAccording to Prof. Windisch, as reported by the Bavarian Agricultural Weekly News of November 25, 2021, “The role of ruminants with regards to climate protection has up to now been overestimated by at least a factor of 3 to 4. An enormous climate contribution to climate warming has been falsely attributed to ruminants: 15 to 20%”.\n\nThat means in reality the so-called contribution is closer to just 5%.\n\n……\n\nIt often goes unmentioned that the climate gases from agriculture come from balanced biogenic cycles and not from fossil fuels that transport additional CO2 into the atmosphere. This was also stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the first volume of the sixth IPCC Assessment Report.",

I did go to Oslo this weekend and for the first time I saw vegan hot dogs being sold at the Narvesen kiosk.\n\nThe only thing I will have to say did improve, especially since 2016-2017 is the boom in vegan grocery store products. In the beginning there was only Oatly, and now there are so many plant milks that I haven't even tried them all. There's a far greater variety in processed vegan products and brands such as for hot dogs, snitzels, nuggets, mince, balls, deli slices, patés, yoghurts, cream, ice cream, iced coffees and so on that didn't exist only a few years ago. These are great for people such as myself, because I'm lazy, and also it makes it easier to have a norwegian diet, as I can swap the meat, in the meat and potatoes dishes with the vegan version easily. The only thing I'm mad about is that my favorite vegan company doesn't sell it's products in Norway anymore. That would be Oumph :(\n\nDon't get me started on how impossible it is to date here.. haha",

"comment": "This will be my last comment here. I really want you to be right. And it’s possible some of what you are saying is right. But I have done this research and the evidence simply doesn’t support your conclusions. here is a great [review paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400843/) on this topic. Here is a quote from the conclusion. \n\n“This review and meta-analysis of the current available evidence on the association between PBDPs and cancer mortality show that there is limited evidence regarding the beneficial effects of vegetarian diets for the prevention of cancer-related outcomes in the general population and in cancer survivors. This review also shows that there is suggestive evidence regarding the association between the mediterranean diet pattern and cancer mortality. There were very few studies evaluating how these dietary patterns influence cancer mortality after the cancer diagnosis.”\n\nIn short, you might be right but you can’t know that you are right. And until we have actual, peer reviewed evidence that vegan diets treat cancer, we should not be steering people away from actual medicine. People are of course free to do as they choose and I would advocate for everyone, cancer patient or not, to become vegan because it is the right thing to do. But we shouldn’t be trying to persuade people with pseudoscience. \n\nOf course you may argue that this is a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies, but I have little interest in that discussion.",

She was kind enough to go to the Derm Store website and link me to a bunch of vegan face washes that were specially formulated for acne.\n\nRight now I'm using a Dessert Essene face wash for oily skin (wasn't on Derm store but it looked good) and it's really helped my complexion. She told me things like with tea tree and chamomille would be good for my face and it has those in it!\n\nMy dermatologist told me about these blue light therapies that I may want to look into. Not sure about if they had been tested on animals, but I'd feel more okay with them than pills. She also metioned another type of lazer or light treatment that is even more affective but I can't remember the name of it @_@ Imma try and find it\n\nhttp://acnetreatmentcenterwa.com/general/lasers-and-other-light-therapies-for-acne/\n\nhttp://www.ehow.com/about_5460883_light-therapy-acne.html",

It's just an excuse really. I wouldn't get too frustrated about it. Most people today will not turn vegan even if they are presented with the perfect facts and arguments but their children or grand children further down the line will because they will literally be faced with the worse of climate change, the new age of extinction, hunger, famine drought, pandemics etc. And most likely won't have much of a choice.",

"comment": "If you're already vegetarian, going vegan should be easy. Eggs and dairy will show up as an allergy on the ingredients list, so just start looking there and work your way up. Casein and Whey are milk derivatives, so watch out for those. Very few products I buy explicitly say they're vegan, and some products labeled as being vegan aren't actually vegan anyways. It only takes a few seconds to look at the ingredients list, so I just do that for everything.  \n\nI'm sure you're already aware of all the milk alternatives out there, but if not you're in for a treat. Personally, my favorite dairy alternative is Almond milk or cashew milk, but theres also soy milk, hemp milk, rice milk, and coconut milk to try out. Different kinds of milk are better for different situations, I wouldn't cook with sweetened vanilla almond milk but on its own it tastes amazing. I like all dairy alternatives I've tried better than cow's milk, so you're not going to be missing anything in that regard.  \n\nI haven't tried much vegan cheese, but I really liked [Amy's Mac &amp; Cheese](http://www.amys.com/products/product-detail/entrees/000043) that used daiya, and I've heard a lot of good things about Chao.  \n\nThere are a lot of vegan butter alternatives, personally I've tried Earth Balance and Smart Balance, both tasted great.  \n\nThere are some scrambled egg re-placers on the market (and a lot in development), but I haven't personally tried any. You can replace eggs in a lot of baked recipes with applesauce or bananas, or if you like your cookies nice and brittle you can just leave out egg replacers altogether. Lastly, if you're a mayo fan (or even if you're not), give Just Mayo a try. I love it, it tastes just like regular mayo without the \"weirdness\" if that makes sense, and on top of that it shouldn't kill you if it's left refrigerated for more than 10 minutes.  \n\nAnyways, thanks for going vegan and I wish you the best of luck!",
