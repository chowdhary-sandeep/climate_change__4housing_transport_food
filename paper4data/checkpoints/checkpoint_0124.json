A solar array to offset a home's electrical usage will cost $20k-40k (depending on energy needs / installation / climate) before incentives. This means that you need to have at least $7k - $13k of federal tax liability to get the full rebate. \n\nAs Mitt Romney once pointed out 47% of Americans don't pay ANY federal income tax so they aren't eligible for any federal tax credit.\n\nNow, consider that solar city gets the 30% tax credit in addition to a special tax deduction system for businesses known as MACRS, which means they can write off the full value of the solar array over 5 years. Depending on tax liability this could be an additional 30% tax credit - the higher your tax liability (often correlated with income) the quicker the payback period.\n\nMoral of the story: Politicians are corrupt and if they really wanted to level the playing field they'd do away with subsidies (which disproportionately benefit the rich), and use a steadily increasing tax on fossil fuels to make renewable energy cost effective for all without needing confusing tax forms and fly by night subsidies. \n\nTLDR: Solar city is a great workaround to get the people eligible for the subsidies to finance solar for those who are not eligible / can't afford initial expenses. Annually increasing Pigovian taxes would create a much more stable solution than subsidies for financial backers.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00257210987911094,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08384291754601918,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2768254122585485,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26575035146540854,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23282912641741405,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1883935907079214,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.27983657728570205,"ev_1":-0.11301285541307268,"ev_2":-0.28748532366806784,"ev_3":-0.10726855178169596,"ev_4":-0.010576547313879322,"ev_5":-0.006667216741334414,"ev_6":-0.005094599781538515},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

What I really wonder is this: under what circumstances would the pack degredation caused by excess charging and discharging be justified by the benefits? It seems to me like it would almost always make more sense to use a stationary battery pack rather than cycle a car's pack.\n\nThis actually came up in a question to a Tesla employee (can't remember which one) at the Tesla Motors Club Connect conference a month ago. In summary, they found the current battery chemistry would likely not handle this use case well (which I speculate is backed up by the fact their Powerwalls use a different chemistry). Further, it was noted that the Model S uses a one-way inverter, so at the very least it's a hardware upgrade for the current fleet.\n\nSo an interesting idea for the future, but perhaps no so useful on a Model S in the near term. Vehicle designers have to take degradation seriously if this is going to be an option, and may come to different battery solutions than if the car will just be a vehicle.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00023584356191956127,"1.1.1_stance":-0.04127061709536406,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.408090073122609,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.263524994874994,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1671697956734679,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24980609490910669,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13617536635138094,"ev_1":-0.1502014718775385,"ev_2":-0.04492979703233383,"ev_3":-0.09336493323159327,"ev_4":-0.03325457359339149,"ev_5":-0.04578143612889107,"ev_6":-0.21897153313377085},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Air cooled would probably be fine.\n\nBiggest hurdle would be finding a small enough engine that has appropriate emissions equipment, but if the usage is low enough you might have better emissions using a generic outdoor power equipment engine if that keeps you from driving a gasoline car the rest of the time.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0034119791234843433,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25553601306540485,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24758421414147844,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.15646671066970158,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23034789288916918,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2316900071784267,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22132989949069604,"ev_1":-0.18903354689416946,"ev_2":-0.02582163545594085,"ev_3":-0.03220189525745809,"ev_4":-0.02317293681699084,"ev_5":-0.012995351370288214,"ev_6":-0.16931881392762685},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

There are basically two ways, either as a byproduct from natural gas extraction or through electrolysis which is highly inefficient. Why bother to convert our entire transport sector to rely on a fuel that still releases CO2? So we would need electrolysis. I guess their plan is to use the excess power produced from wind farms. But battery storage solutions are falling rapidly in prices, so there might not be any excess power left as it would be bought by private citizens charging their power wall at home, their electric car, or commercial power companies. People just don't see a long term business case for a fuel that needs three times the energy as electricity does. You would also have to physically store it, move it around, keep it as a certain temperature, compress it before it can be transferred to the car. If it happens to burn, the flame is invisible, etc. Like, why would you do that? Batteries with the current technology are falling in price fairly quickly. At some point we will probably move to solid state batteries.

In a simplified view, when supplying the car, the flywheels discharge at 50 kW, and when no car is charging, the flywheels recharge at 50 kW. Ergo, the time it takes to charge is equal to the time they can supply power for. A 45 minute fast charging session is a lot of energy - about 37.5 kWh. A chemical battery of that size doesn't really charge faster, either.\n\nAlso note: this isn't a case of \"the charging station goes offline while the flywheels recharge\". There's nothing stopping you from hooking up your car while the wheels are half-empty. Or even when they are completely tapped out.

Thanks for the info. It was curious because I know sales were strong in Canada. The Kona sold units in the thousands here in 2019. \n\nThe MSRP for the Kona/Niro/Bolt are pretty similar. Chevy's taking a big hit with these massive discounts. I think it has more to do with Telsa eating the market growth GM was expecting than anything else. As a result they have too many units and not enough demand. It's great for the consumer but bad for Chevy's bottom line especially considering EVs have less margin than their ICE count-parts. \n\nI've driven all three, and the Leaf, I can tell you the Bolt feels the cheapest.

Ultimately, the most environmental option is picking the car that suits a person's needs, rather than the EV with the biggest battery or size on the assumption it's \"environmentally friendly\" - the big push from a regulatory perspective IMO should be for small vehicles in additional to low emissions drivetrains, and get people into cars they require rather than something bigger than whatever the neighbours have.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0070123787348469096,"1.1.1_stance":-0.03462035557924992,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21573972325738253,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3309580821230611,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24442891925532423,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2244590456932511,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10153712596123417,"ev_1":-0.21611711358152436,"ev_2":-0.02009003974611308,"ev_3":-0.004703691162527927,"ev_4":-0.025309624670020032,"ev_5":-0.014641731844676542,"ev_6":-0.1986510073506419},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Funny you should mention it because I don't go to dealers at all. I only go to my mechanic and for the first 6 years only once a year. \n\nI don't go to gas stations either. I go shopping and if I need gas I stop at the gas station. Or I just stop if I see no line at the gas station for 2 minutes to top off. Most of the time I pump gas once every two weeks. \n\nAs fr s economy it depends where you live and what kind of ICE car you drive. Some utility companies charge $0.30 per KW or more at night. It will get worst with demand. While gas in many states approaching $3 per gallon. And if you drive a decent hybrid like Toyota Camry Hybrid with over 50mpg it might be even cheaper than those EVs with 3miles/KW. And about the same as 4 miles/KW. Oh, and on the road many public chargers are so expensive now that it cost even more. Tesla charges $0.58 per KW now.\n\nCalculate yourself. If you have useful 80KWh battery pack and you get 4miles per KW (good luck with that on highway) you get 320 miles range from 0-100% charge which you don't do because you charge 20-80%. Now, at $0.58 per KW that $46.4 Now, Hybrid Camry only needs 6.4 gallons to cover that distance. Even at $5 per gallon that is $32. There goes your savings. On top of that because you charge 20-80% you have to do it every 200 miles or much less in good warm weather. Average is 150 miles. While Camry has over 600 miles range. And that is another thing. You have to exit highway, find a charger, charge, get back on highway. That adds more time than charging itself. Plus you probably going to get distracted by shiny things, food, toilet etc... and that adds time. I know what you are going to say. \"Oh but I need rest\" No you don't after only 2 hours of driving. It is all but illusion. I can do 300 miles of driving in a comfortable car standing on my head. \n\nNot to mention, Camry is half the price of any compatible EV to start with and great quality to boot. No need to visit dealers or mechanics for many years. Just an oil change once a year which in my case takes 20 minutes or less on the way to my office stopping at my mechanic. \n\nAs far as Russian dictatorship, there was only 5% of Russian oil was exported to US. We don't need it. There are ton of places where we can get oil if our government signs the act. But Democrats don't want to do it. So the next Republican government will. \n\nAll those issues you mentioned are all made up by you. There are no issues except range Anxiety disease you all EV owners have. And that is why you are constantly plugging and unplugging.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005295682077606519,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11063022166490555,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21223409008549562,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24404509742445515,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23176693567296525,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.040940003702417016,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3235527281528145,"ev_1":-0.16859964339528233,"ev_2":-0.19485077900753822,"ev_3":-0.158506847335957,"ev_4":-0.009323239280395986,"ev_5":-0.003161157001159154,"ev_6":-0.20282695306313275,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.10200254081282764},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Feedback from OEMs & dealers (according to the Detroit News) is that most first time EV buyers own a home and have 1 or 2 ICE vehicles already.  They're buying an EV as a 2nd or 3rd car because they feel safer that way.   Tesla seems to be more immune to this as Tesla seems to appeal to everyone.  But GM, Ford, VW, Kia, and others are starting to see (again according to the Detroit News) inventory turnover twice as slow for EVs as their ICE counterparts.   This situation has Ford, GM, and other smaller OEMs (Rivian, Lucid, FF) scared.   Ford, for example, has invested billions in EVs and they're having trouble selling them.   Getting some marketing going around infrastructure for charging can sooth a lot of people's minds but there has to be big push to get more charging infrastructure built and they have to figure out a way to make it easy for people.   Early adopters love their EVs but a lot of people are sitting on the sidelines until they get a nudge and reach a better comfort level.

We demonstrate that absorbers and reflectors can be combined in the absence of sun tracking to build three-dimensional photovoltaic (3DPV) structures that can generate measured energy densities (energy per base area, kWh/m2) higher by a factor of 2–20 than stationary flat PV panels for the structures considered here, compared to an increase by a factor of 1.3–1.8 for a flat panel with dual-axis sun tracking. The increased energy density is countered by a larger solar cell area per generated energy for 3DPV compared to flat panels (by a factor of 1.5–4 in our conditions), but accompanied by a vast range of improvements. 3DPV structures can mitigate some of the variability inherent to solar PV as they provide a more even source of solar energy generation at all latitudes: they can double the number of peak power generation hours and dramatically reduce the seasonal, latitude and weather variations of solar energy generation compared to a flat panel design. Self-supporting 3D shapes can create new schemes for PV installation and the increased energy density can facilitate the use of cheaper thin film materials in area-limited applications. Our findings suggest that harnessing solar energy in three dimensions can open new avenues towards Terawatt-scale generation.\n\nA factor of 4 is mentioned.

Would you prefer if they closed down the plant a day before the climate strikes? Not once did I say nuclear is bad, I have always said we need more nuclear, but I do not support it by saying it is zero-emissions. Saying it is zero greenhouse gas is one thing, anything else is downright propaganda and as someone told me yesterday on another unrelated thread, spreading false info even with good intentions is propaganda. \n\nRenewables are not the same as gas power plants, where there are no massive localised differences. Read this and you will see how renewables are cheaper than fossil fuel and coal power plants:  [https://www.irena.org/publications/2019/May/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2018](https://www.irena.org/publications/2019/May/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2018) \n\n* Onshore wind and solar PV power are now, frequently, less expensive than any fossil-fuel option, without financial assistance.\n* New solar and wind installations will increasingly undercut even the operating-only costs of existing coal-fired plants.\n* Low and falling technology costs make renewables the competitive backbone of energy decarbonization – a crucial climate goal.\n* Cost forecasts for solar PV and onshore wind continue to be revised as new data emerges, with renewables consistently beating earlier expectations.\n\nAlso read this in full, it clarifies many things which in my opinion you fail to understand:  [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-12/is-renewable-power-cheaper-than-coal-nuclear-malcolm-turnbull/11495558](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-12/is-renewable-power-cheaper-than-coal-nuclear-malcolm-turnbull/11495558)  If for some reason you don't want to read it, at least scroll down to the graphic comparing different costs of energies. Yes, these costs are NOT TRIVIAL, please keep perspective. \n\nYour article in the scientific American talks about the metal extraction aspect, what about the cement used for nuclear power plants? The cement industry is one of the largest contributors of green house gases. If they compared this too, then it could be a legit source, but they do not. \n\nYour other article talks about Texas and Arizona, mine focuses on Australia and the same is true for Europe and most of Asia.

And I feeEEEL that. Those a-holes cost my friend and his family their home. They, my friend and his family, drove out with the dogs and the clothes on their backs... Everything else is smoke.

The cost per KWh is not best calculated based on capacity but on how many of those KWh you actually pump through the system and use over its lifetime.... If it is just emergency use then a combination of :\n\na) a couple of circuits like the SMC Secure Power connections that can run directly from your inverter during the dayb) a plan for how to reduce your consumption during a shortagec) a small generator...would be a much more cash efficient method of getting power and you could spend the spite part of the budget on donations to PUC watchdog groups or shorting PG@E stocks (or straight-up buying them and doing shareholder stuff to improve their behavior?)\n\nAnother (more answering the question rather than challenging it) idea is: could you build a small building to hold \"indoor\" batteries over close(r) to the array? Maybe a \"PG&amp;E Sucks Clubhouse?\" or some other structure that meets the requirements for the battery storage and whatever else you might eventually like an out building for. Pottery shed? Out of season storage? Outbuildings sell like hotcakes so maybe even a prefab thing could qualify.

There is also the issue of reliability (long life) and sustained performance across a range of temperatures year after year and, of course, how cheaply a technology can be produced.\n\nThere is a balance between the cost of the panels and the cost of the installation. For example, it may cost a few hundred dollars to install a panel so when you use higher density panels, you save on the installation because you need fewer of them for your application. Also consider that even in places with net metering, it never makes economic sense to put more panels on a rood than you need (this doesn't apply to solar farms). For many, many applications (particularly in residential solar is southern areas), there is already enough roof on houses and many businesses to meet the application needs at current (or with near term gains using contemporary technologies) panel efficiencies. It will only make sense to have these theoretically higher efficiency cells when there is a real cost savings and long life too.\n\nSome people in the industry think that the coming vast economies of scale of today and near term low  to mid 20s% efficiency panels are going to create a \"ledge\" where those panels are going to be efficient enough and super cheap that the higher efficiency panels with \"out there\" technologies may be relegated to niche applications.\n\nThe real issue for solar is batteries!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00031128906751594815,"1.1.1_stance":-0.30943137430708545,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2692143983153651,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18189051871498427,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.02702759808448718,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32053841217043094,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08716570405522361,"solar_1":-0.060768484409588076,"solar_2":-0.006196064682929621,"solar_3":-0.2860753629901467,"solar_4":-0.020361943710061798,"solar_5":-0.005274681182830439,"solar_6":-0.026451154684764333,"solar_7":-0.0014654970521708794,"solar_8":-0.00036093773026853643,"solar_9":-0.20486575253986908,"solar_10":-0.15472415854552915},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

It depends on what the minimum service level is. And the demand and price of electricity. Perhaps we will have to accept higher electricity prices and a lower service level in order to reduce CO2 emissions? That means either brownouts or rapid and possibly extreme price changes, minute by minute, depending on demand and availability. At some times the electricity may be (almost?) free. And at some times perhaps cost 10 or 100 times more than it does today.\n\nIf the price of electricity was allowed to change between extremes, adding local storage to the grid may be profitable. Charge up with (almost) free electricity. Sell the electricity back for a very high price.\n\nThere are some other things that also can be done to reduce the need for storage. But that require new investments and upgrades. Replacing power hungry stuff with more efficient.\n\nTurn off high energy use industries temporarily. Or all together if they are not able to make a profit if average electricity prices rise and they are not able to improve efficiency. \n\nUse a smarter grid and smarter appliances that turn on/off depending on the price of electricity, every minute. For instance dish washers that only turn on at night when electricity is cheap and abundant. And stay off when electricity is expensive. Keep the fridge and most lights on, but turn off the hot water and heating in all but one room.\n\nDistributed micro-storage in or near critical devices to better handle brownouts or temporary extreme prices.\n\nUse spare capacity in EV batteries and home battery banks to trade electricity.

That is, it has the propensity to project current events and technologies along a straight timeline with a constant slope into the future, predicting what the future will look like, and when it will occur.\n\nUnfortunately, this talent is frequently vastly inaccurate.  History and human events rarely follow a straight line.  Some technological advancements occur on an exponential or geometric curve, while others flatline.\n\nIn the 1960’s, it was widely predicted that we would all be flying around in jetpacks and flying cars like the Jetsons by 1980.\n\n###[What Happened to This Future?](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/qt41e9/what_happened_to_this_future/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nLet us shoot ahead to the present day. The electric vehicle (EV) craze has struck the minds of progressives as the solution to all of our climate problems.  Reason and rationality are defenestrated.\n\nYou cannot tell progressive politicians that the technology for EV’s is still in its infancy. You cannot convince them that the current state of technology makes them completely impractical and unworkable on a national scale.\n\nWe are at the same point in technological history as we were in 1896, when we transitioned from “horseless carriages” powered by steam and electric motors to gasoline engines. What we see on the EV road today will in no way resemble what the technology ultimately comes up with.\n\nIf you examine the facts, you see this is true.  Current technology extrapolated into a nation of more than 250 million registered vehicles on the road will result in EV chaos.\n\nThe current electric grid will need to be strengthened by the development of hundreds of new nuclear power plants. There is no political will in this country to do that, especially among those promoting EVs the hardest. Hundreds of new windmill and solar farms aren’t going to cut it and will negatively impact the environment and wildlife much more than nuclear.\n\nElectric cable will need to be buried across perhaps hundreds of thousands of miles throughout the nation to support at least 145,000 charging stations needed to replace existing gas stations. They will be required at frequencies of at least every 100 miles of road, even across the Great Salt Lake and Mojave deserts and vast mountain ranges. The logistics behind this are staggering.\n\nHas anyone determined the economic impact of slowing road travel across the country due to the time required to wait in line at charging stations and to adequately charge an EV?  What will the impact be to crime and motorist safety in inner cities or lonely stretches of road?\n\n###[‘Sitting Ducks’: EV Charging Stations Leave Some Drivers Feeling Exposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/vf3yl3/sitting_ducks_ev_charging_stations_leave_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nBillions of giant batteries will need to be built.  When do we reach peak lithium or cobalt?  How much of the world will be devastated by strip mining using slave labor?  Where do we store the billions of batteries when they die? The potential costs to humanity and the environment are incalculable.\n\nSince Red China is the primary source for these batteries, as well as wind turbines and solar panels, will we become economically enslaved by our dependence on these products?\n\nUp to 17 states are geared to follow California down the rabbit hole and ban the sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, just twelve and-a-quarter years from now. Have they thought ahead to all of the potential costs and ramifications of this decision? No, of course not.\n\nThis is tantamount to throwing everyone off a high cliff and expecting someone to develop a parachute on the way down. You cannot force technology advancements by political edict.\n\nAdvancements will occur over time.  At some point, perhaps after most of our lifetimes, practical non-gasoline engines will become a reality. They will most likely look a lot different than the visions of today’s progressives.\n\nSolutions involving nuclear fusion or rechargeable hydrogen fuel cells may be the ultimate result. In the meantime, the technology fairy-dusters are intent on making our immediate lives miserable by imposing their unworkable fantasies.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.06234589902063211,"1.1.1_stance":-0.33194797690773864,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16634789403271147,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22694284787091115,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24851145762009505,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.054013280818859734,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2350546825114582,"solar_1":-0.1168106949667478,"solar_2":-0.15384389916543154,"solar_3":-0.23711588350235502,"solar_4":-0.2827797728399067,"solar_5":-0.11304551550262971,"solar_6":-0.09356544332937726,"solar_7":-0.08412995959176328,"solar_8":-0.06250138569642634,"solar_9":-0.2219371071244407,"solar_10":-0.20748543450042564,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.22686620180805525},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author expresses opposition to the current state of EV technology and the policies promoting it, without expressing support for any alternative or specific instance.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Pure Energy is a medium size local installer (low risk of going out of business) that gets good reviews, and helps you switch to a good buyback program.\n3. SunRun is a decent national brand that’s huge, and good warranties; only downside is that they often subcontract through Freedom Forever (they have ugly installs).\n\nAvoid:\n1. NIVO. They’ll install without permits; good luck getting PTO.\n2. Dealers. They are a race to the bottom, and who knows who will actually do the warranty work.\n3. Very young companies.

Emotionally people get extremely upset if a person would even dare to joke about killing and flaying a cat, but have no problem responding to pictures of piglets with an outburst of “BACON!”.\n\nThat is the conundrum that puzzles me the most. When I was alot younger, I thought all animals lived on a farm à la Old McDonald and they were humanely slaughtered after leading a happy life. Then I learned about factory farming. That in fact, a pig can't even turn around and that male chicks are thrown in the shredder. I just couldn't (and can't) understand how people can be moral and ethically sane, and have meaningful human-animal relationships with dogs/cats and yet eat meat and dairy for which animals had to suffer immensely. I for one, couldn't in good faith, contribute to this system any more. I did consider eating cruelty-free meat, but it turned out to be more work than just not eating it at all.\n\nIf I were to put my cat through a fraction of that misery, I'd get a Reddit/4chan mob hunting me down. How is that so many people exist, who are [outraged when you put socks on a cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SUGQkRfvUY), yet most likely still eat meat?

In our entire lives, most of us will maybe convince one or two people to care enough to join us.  \n\nEveryone else we talk to tells us we're crazy, that we're making a big deal out of nothing... or says things like \"I'm going to eat *more* animals because of idiots like you!\" \n\nAnd here, we see a post about 10,000 dogs being eaten.  Vegans think all animals deserve the same respect as dogs, and BILLIONS of animals (A MILLION TIMES MORE than 10,000) are killed every year... but for some reason, EVERYONE cares about this.  These dogs are special. \n\nWe'll struggle our whole lives to try to get one or two people to care about all animals... it's frustrating to watch how easily everyone gets upset when dogs or cats suffer... but see that they still don't care about any other animals.\n\nOP's post wasn't meant to be seen by \"meat eaters\" and taken as an attack.

It's a lot easier than raising chickens to find some loophole that allows you to eat eggs. I know this from personal experience having owned chickens and also having given up eggs for the last 5 years without missing them. Google egg replacements and you'll find options for pretty much any recipe you had in mind and in far less time than you'll spend caring for the chickens. \n\nIf you really strongly feel called to rescuing hens, good for you. But using and especially selling their eggs sends a very mixed message if your goal is to do away with animal exploitation. Veganism is about avoiding as much animal exploitation as is possible and practicable. If you end up calling yourself \"vegan\" and then eat eggs, that sends the message to others that eating eggs is ok, or somehow hard to give up. Neither is true. Selling them is even worse because then you end up actually promoting egg consumption. The best thing you can do is to be clear that the hens are being rescued for *their* benefit, not for their eggs, which will probably not be laid in much quantity anyhow if egg farmers are handing them over to you. At that point they are probably towards the end of their egg laying abilities and likely very sick birds with special needs due to being abused for so long. Be prepared to deal with that and the fact that you may not get any eggs from them at all. If that sounds great, sure, go ahead and rescue them. But it is still best to feed the eggs back to the hens like animal sanctuaries tend to do. It helps restore the nutrients they lose due to egg production and offset feed costs. It also emphasizes that their eggs are theirs, not ours, to use.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.08758609250435256,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2762337512642208,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2868153772652494,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16216991415485354,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2111082044504616,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3201233048156631,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.009744010535844913,"diet_1":-0.11897955053541409,"diet_2":-0.25251331665876836,"diet_3":-0.28563547779839255,"diet_4":-0.18458536935213488,"diet_5":-0.13564612492581396,"diet_6":-0.08747805968737611,"diet_8":-0.0034965343887355025,"diet_9":-0.01570572170991606,"diet_10":-0.09290357816486805,"diet_11":-0.04677461025373001,"diet_13":-0.25617705994196466,"diet_14":-0.14856305405690604,"diet_17":-0.014273514968711728},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Although he did say in the beginning of the video that if you are using vegetarianism to transition to veganism, or if you understand that dairy is not a suitable replacement for meat, then that's not a bad thing. \n\nI personally was a vegetarian for 1.5 yrs before being vegan, but I also had not replaced my meat with dairy. I replaced meat with plant options, and most of my dairy with plant options. I was just technically vegetarian because I hadn't cometely gotten over my cheese addiction, so I was more like a \"90% vegan\" type of vegetarian.\n\nI do think that there is an issue with being vegetarian if you have replaced all your meat with dairy (which is something that I considered doing, but ultimately recognized was a poor decision if I was changing my lifestyle for ethical reasons). Reducetarians should definitely be encouraged, but we should all be aware and able to inform others about how much death and cruelty dairy animals are subjugated to. \n\nWe should be particularly open to challenging those who would just replace meat with dairy and claim that they're moving in the right direction. To be intellectually honest, it's not the right move to replace meat with dairy. But it IS at least good that a vegetarian like that is clearly open to learning about how they can improve their lifestyle to help others. Constructive criticism is important.
