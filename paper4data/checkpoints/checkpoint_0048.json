You can just get a plug-in hybrid, which can already make it anywhere in the country, and still get the fuel savings benefits whenever you're not driving to the most obscure place you can think of (which can't realistically be very much of your driving behavior, anyway).",

But more importantly the system of burning fuel in a power plant and delivering it via the grid to charge and drive an electric car is *much more efficient* than refining and transporting oil into gasoline and then burning that gasoline in an ICEV.\n\nEven if an EV were 100% coal-powered, it would use less coal (by unit energy) than an ICEV would use gasoline to drive the same distance.",

"comment": "I wouldn't regard it as a publicity stunt in terms of \"promoting greener living\" but actually leading by example.\n\nHow many people can afford a Tesla Model S? Probably more than you'd think, although it's not the mass market car they have lined up next - which a vast proportion of the population can likely afford.\n\nHybrids just aren't all that... they say \"Look - we all think EVs are cool but they're not there yet! Range and cost and batteries and stuff and we still know lots about engines as they've been around for years...\" which is all tied to the big oil arguments against EVs. All of which are now defunct thanks to Tesla's own lead by example approach. There's just no good reason to choose a hybrid while Tesla are in business and expanding their own infrastructure as well as the others in that space.\n\nAgain, it's not really about PR from my perspective. It's that they have to buy cars for MPs, so what is the best value car on the market? Tesla Model S is one of those in the \"best value\" category. Especially as the running costs are zero!",

"comment": "&gt;Now, do you need to drastically change your life right this second, so you don't hurt the environment? No, but you should work your way to being environmentally friendly.\n\nYou misunderstand, but that's not unusual.  Many people think that my objection to the more extreme claims uttered by people who are alarmed by the thought of climate change is that I might have to change my lifestyle.  I have already changed my lifestyle, in ways that most people would object to.\n\nAs I've written many times before, I have made huge changes over the last few decades.  My driving habits are greatly reduced (seriously, to about 20% of what I used to drive) and more than half of my driving today is done using an all electric Leaf.  Most of the charging (60%) of that Leaf is done using environmentally friendly methods (well, when it comes to CO2), like hydro-electric and nuclear power.  I don't drive to work anymore, and I have replaced all of my light-bulbs with low wattage Florescent or LED.  \n\nI've given up high impact past-times and now sail my hand-made sailboat at the lake, or paddle a canoe on a local river, or take my Boy Scout troop out camping or doing Conservation related activities.  I also make and shoot my own bows, since self-bows and archery are more environmentally friendly than other shooting sports (no lead, etc.)\n\nI also have a kitchen garden, eat less meat than most Americans, compost, and have my own septic system rather than force sewage to a local water treatment plant.  My septic system naturally cleans (and it does clean, I've had it tested) all of my waste.\n\nI keep my winter thermostat on 57º, and my summer thermostat on 85º, so that I can keep from using too much energy.  My electric bills are half of what my neighbors are, and a quarter of what some others in my town claim that theirs are.  And a large part of those electric bills are charging my Nissan Leaf, remember!\n\nSo, no, I'm not saying that we won't have horrific effects of warming because I am trying to avoid life changing realizations.  The only way I can think of to use less energy is to cut power off to my home completely and stop buying anything commercially.  I'm not prepared to do THAT.  Well, not yet.  I have plans...\n\nAnyway, I think that they are wrong.  I think that the truth will show that they are wrong, and that the horrible future they claim is certain won't actually come to pass, but some people will pick small events like a regional drought to claim that they were right, and that horrible terrors have happened.\n\nGuess what?  Horrible events have happened from WEATHER for as long as we can remember, or discover through archeology.  We have had floods, we have had droughts, we've had famine, and we've had bounty.  The thought that the world would continue along perfectly and no one would ever go hungry if we just stopped burning fossil fuels is a fantasy that has no resemblance to reality.  Bad things will continue to happen, and we will all suffer at one point or another.\n\nThis does not mean that we are being punished for our sins, either from homosexuality or from sins against Gaia by burning fossil fuels.  It's just the nature of life on a planet with weather.",

AFAIK all EV's on the market today will not really allow you to discharge to zero.  They always keep a reserve to ensure the batteries won't be fully drained and have issues charging again.  Speed of charging/discharging goes hand in hand with temperature control.  Because it's not just the ambient temperature you must contend with, DC fast chargers pump a lot of heat into the battery packs charging at that rate, therefore they must be cooled during this charging in order to not exceed safe battery limits.  Discharging at high amp speed runs (Tesla 'ludicrous mode' I'm looking at you) also has a similar heating effect on the battery.",

Audi and BMW will certainly see a sales drop. \n\nThere is a wiggle. There are a lot of plugin hybrids available. The 330e is currently for sale. It is apparently a fast, fun car that is very green. The M3 will take at least a year, probably two to show up. BMW is also planning many other phev offerings before the M3 arrives.",

Realistically 75 or 80miles is all you can expect on the highway if you're going 70mph.\n\nYou'll need to stop at least twice to make that trip. And if you don't find a DC fast charge station to charge, you're looking at a 6 or 7 hour charge stop from empty because the Spark only has a 3.3kw on board charger.\n\nThis does not sound like the car for this journey.\n\nThey make short range cares for exactly the reason you state: for local city driving and shorter daily commutes.\n\nAnd batteries are still expensive. The only reason you would even be considering a Spark EV is because you can find them with low miles for under $9000. This is because of the subsidized cheap leases that are now coming to an end.\n\nIf you run out of juice in the middle of now where, you call a tow truck. \n\nUsed EV's are an absolute killer deal now but you need to make sure you have the means to charge it, and it fits your driving needs.\n\nRange anxiety isn't a thing if you use the car for which it was designed, which is going to and from work daily. For 3 years I drove  spark ev daily about 24 miles round-trip. I had a gas car for longer ranges. And it worked great by reducing visits to the gas station to maybe once every 1 or two months. The Spark is a fantastic little EV\n\nBottom line, Long range EV's will cost you a lot more money, get the spark but 190 miles will be tough.",

Keep a close eye one kWh vs kW.  Two EVs will pull a ton of power (kW).  But the energy (kWh) you need on a daily basis will entirely depend on how far you drive those EVs.  \n\nAlso, 60k should get you at least two powerwalls and a substantial PV array.  But two powerwalls at 7kW of power each likely could not charge your card while also sustaining your home during the night.",

I'm sorry but if it doesn't have 3 pedals and I can't hear a nice exhaust it just feels like an appliance to me. Yes yes yes the teslas are very fast and yes I've driven a model s p100d and it was very fast but it was still uninteresting. I'm fine with the introduction of more ev options. I'm not fine with government forcing that option as my only choice. I'll take my down votes now. I know I'm talking to the wrong crowd here. Just my opinion.",

"comment": "What if we get hit by an asteroid?\n\n4680 is a form factor, like AA or C or D in the consumer market. It doesn't define the internal structure and chemistry. What plausible stumbling block do you see for not being able to make a bigger cylinder? Note that other manufacturers are already working on 4680 cells - not just Tesla.\n\nIf you're talking about the internal improvements detailed at Battery Day - maybe some of them won't work out. That's not a dealkiller. Other improvements will happen and costs will keep coming down like they have been for well over a decade. \n\nI suggest looking up \"experience curve effects\" and/or \"Wright's Law\" - the application of that law to the semiconductor industry is known as \"Moore's Law\"",

"comment": "&gt; The 4680 cells are actually being made by Panasonic.\n\nFalse. Tesla is already making 4680s at Kato Road, and has been for months. And they'll be making them in Texas and Berlin soon, as well. Panasonic is just going to *also* be making them for Tesla (they haven't started yet), because Tesla realizes that they can't make all their own batteries if they want to keep up with their intended growth rate.\n\nAlso, claiming that the Model Y \"isn't innovative\" because it shares a lot of parts with the Model 3 is just hilariously wrong. There are numerous differences between the 2020 Model 3 and 2020 Model Y that Tesla discovered were major improvements, and they then back-ported to the 2021 Model 3.\n\nAnd you conveniently forgot to mention the Model S Plaid, which is wildly innovative in its own right, both in terms of the drivetrain and the interior. Just because the outside looks very similar to the pre-refresh Model S doesn't mean Tesla \"didn't innovate\". Just watch Sandy Munroe's newest video about the rear drivetrain cradle, which you can find being discussed on the frontpage of this sub right now. They go into a lot of detail about exactly how different that thing is compared to the previous Model S.",

It will take some more analysis and development to demonstrate that Solar PV with storage is up to the task.  It's not a matter of a few percentages points here or there.  It is essentially an order of magnitude increase in pumped hydro storage that is required.  No other storage system approaches the EEROI of pumped hydro.  No amount of green washing and wising will change the energy balance.\n\nAs far as solar PV cost goes.  The module is now less than half the cost of a typical installation.  And the module excess capacity that has driven costs below manufacturing costs is not longer there.  I would be very skeptical of those who project solar PV costs to continue to fall in cost at the rate per year of the last few years.  Solar PV costs are below what a skylight costs per square foot.  Either there is significant price gouging of skylights or solar PV is being sold at below cost because of capacity issues.  The later is more likely than the former.",

Moving into a house in a couple weeks that has enough solar panels to have net zero power bill with plenty of room left for more panels, so getting an electric vehicle makes a lot of sense for me.  Granted, motorcycles don't use a lot of fuel, but there's added convenience in not having to stop to refuel on a hot day while wearing ATGATT.\n\nThe FX actually makes even more sense to me since I'll be close to off road trails and be spending a lot more time camping.

Anker is using SunPower cells.\n\nExample: [GoalZero Nomad 20](http://www.goalzero.com/p/179/nomad-20-solar-panel), a 20-Watt folding array: $200 MSRP, compared to the $50 or so for the 21-Watt Anker PowerPort.\n\nThe only upside to the GoalZero stuff is it seems to output enough voltage for things like laptop or storage cell charging; with Anker, it's USB only.\n\nI would also suggest one of these:\nhttp://www.thrunite.com/bundle-u1-charger-1-18650-rechargeble-battery/\n\nIt's universal USB charger and power pack. The included 18650 Li-Ion battery can provide power to USB devices and the charger will charge most battery chemistries and sizes. (NiCad, NiMH, Li-Ion, AAA, AA, C, 18650, 18350, 10440 etc) Charge that with the solar array and then use it to power devices when the sun isn't out.",

Over this long history, winning teams have typically spent about 2.5 times the prize money attempting to win the prize (which effectively serves as a 'cheap' source of start-up capital, since it does not require giving up any equity or intellectual property in the winning entry), with the full roster of competing teams often spending more than 10 times the prize purse in aggregate.\n\nFor more discussion of incentive prizes like this one, please join the community over at /r/xprize -- we'd love to get some solar power experts to help us analyze this competition and the competing teams!",

Also, don't forget that there is probably $2,500 in marketing expenses included in the contractor's cost. Those solar salesmen don't work for free. \n\nIf you want to DIY, go for it. Not really feasible for most of us.",

I'm looking at solar on that house too.  \n\nWhat I'll be looking for (after going through the process once) is the following:\n\n- How long does it take to install Solar from the time I write you the down payment check?  I was disappointed in how long it took with my previous installer.\n- Monitoring.  This should be included and not an add-on cost.  Sure, you'll make up the difference in your price, but I had to pay more than I'd have liked to just so I could make sure the system is working.  My previous installer had packages with and without it, so they didn't hide the cost at all, but considering how little the monitoring stuff actually costs (in comparison to everything else) it should just be included.\n- Warranty / Reliability.  I really liked the 10 year full-system warranty from my installer.  I also liked that they had been in business (not solely as a solar installer) for 20 years already.  If for some reason your company is new, look into a 3rd party-backed extended warranty for peace of mind.\n- As other posters have said: money.  I want to know (not just fluff) how long it's going to take me to pay myself back.  Solar is fun and all, but I want to see a payback eventually.",

I have checked my local colleges and one does offer a solar course, but not until the fall, and they're not even sure if they're going to offer it. I don't have any solar experience at all, or in fact any electrical experience even. But I am prepared to take this on as a full-time job for the next few months. Also, I don't need to power the entire company or anything, I just need to know how to hook up a few solar panels to power something small. I had no idea it was so challenging!\n\nGetting in contact with people who have experience is certainly a good idea, and I'll check out those companies you mentioned and shoot them an email! Thank you for the names!",

Possibly but only if the powerwall is also going to handle the Solar component.   You do realize that the vast majority by far of solar installations do NOT have battery.   And that only a few regions can even benefit from having a battery, financially in a solar installation.\nThis would make it an inefficient combination of products (battery and inverter), and very similar to Enphase product with an AC battery, incapable of backing anything up.",

A few years ago when CA decided to unregulate electric utility, speculators like Enron cornered the market and extorted high prices from the CA.

That math doesn't work.  But we could handle travelers looking for a charge and and produce enough food to feed everyone (technically).\n\nGranted we will need to string 20 model s batteries together to make this work.\n\nSay I gave you a membership for 20 bucks a month and you get all the food your plot can grow (and you don't have to tend to it).\nPlus electric car charges for your car.\nPlus drone delivery to your front doorstep.\nThats a pretty good deal.\n\nI am not trying to power everyones homes but I can alleviate some of your day to day power concerns reducing the size of the solar array you would need at your house.\n\nAnd, If your solar PV's produce too much in the summer and you have no grid connection,  I got a really great idea to deliver that energy from your house to my MicroGrid via drone.\nLike a water pale my friend.",

"comment": "It all depends on what your loads are and how well you are at shedding them.   You are severely underfeeding a 200a service panel.  Most service panels are oversubscribed with 400+ amps on a 200a service panel with the expectations that everything using going to max at once.   So now you have ~400 amps of things connected to just 90amps of capability.   It is pretty easy to have the AC compressor kick on while the microwave and water heater are on.     But in any case it is a choice and you could have made the same choice with a D.C. Coupled inverter the same way, or more easily put in extra inverter capacity since VRLA batteries have more instant power capacity for less money.    \nThere is little different about the testa. Powerwall from other systems.   The batteries cost considerably more but and last about twice as long as lead acid.   Or I could get a LifPo battery which would be similar size, cost, and lifespan.   My system is 3kw inverter and solar, and could easily scale up to 12kw ( or 16kw or 32kw).   It cost me $12k for my 3kw which handles my emergency loads ( wells fridge, freezer, lights, internet, tv etc.).  I would ( and have ) used wood or kerosine to heat the house in power outages and gas to cook ( BBQ with gas range tops). But we have water, food, internet, tv, lights etc.    \nThis system cost me $12k installed,",

But even some of the Asian panel manufacturers are having a tough time. The loss of subsidy in parts of Europe and the resulting stagnation hasn't really be offset across the globe.\n\nSome predict SunPower will fall, but I think they are not in that much trouble. Yet.

Meaningful societal changes are often driven by a handful of people. \n\nPeople learn from one another all the time and change their behavior as a result. When enough people change, society will shift.\n\nSo if you want to help a specific change along, you should behave in a manner consistent with the change you want to see in the world.\n\nSocial or peer pressure is one of the most basic human behaviors.\n\nAs an example, neighborhoods where one home adds solar panels are more likely to see additional solar panels installed on other homes.",

"comment": "You put a sensor on the main cable into your property.  The sensor can detect the direction of flow of energy in or out.  If the flow of energy is from the grid the water heater is off.  If you are exporting to the grid the water heater is on, but only to an amount that means you aren't drawing from the grid.  I have micro inverters and it works just fine.\n\nSo imagine your home uses 100watts of energy just for standby devices like tv's phone chargers etc.  The sun comes up in the morning and as your solar array starts producing 101W then you are no longer importing from the grid, 1W is diverted to the water heater.  Later on you are making 2000W from solar and 1900W is dumping into you water heater, then you turn on your 3000W kettle to make a cup of tea, so you need 2000W from your solar and 1100W from the grid, during this time the water heater is off.  Once the kettle clicks off, you start heating water again.",

"comment": "SunPower was always known for high quality systems but also relatively high prices. Their business was built in the early days when utility-scale plants were not so large. In the US market, they were consistently underbid on the large (and steadily growing in size) projects by the big EPC's (Swinerton, Blattner, Mortensons, etc.). Also in the rooftop C&amp;I market, they did very well for years, but again this too has become hyper competitive. \n\nAnother effect hurting them is scale. Canadian Solar, one of the largest Tier 1 Chinese module makers, sold some 7 GWp of modules last year, Sunpower is much smaller. \n\nAlso, the company relied heavily on monocrystalline modules (vs. the cheaper polycrystalline, still probably 70-80% of the market), which is inherently more expensive. \n\nGenerally the company was considered to be well run, but market forces in solar move very, very quickly and with brutal efficiency. \n\nOne thing I don't understand is that while they have been majority-owned by Totale, the French oil giant for several years, they have been allowed to run at arm's length - it would be time for Totale to step in with the right support at this point, if they see a viable business model going forward.\n\nI fear this is the beginning of the end for SunPower. But solar is still in the midst of consolidation globally, many respected players have been absorbed or disappeared already.",

"comment": "It covers a lot of different topics, but here's the best I can do from memory having listened to it about 12 hours ago... Lots of different chemistries are in development, a lot of the focus is on finding materials that aren't as problematic as say cobalt. Sodium, nickel, and polymer were discussed (among others, but those were the ones that stuck out to me). Expect Europe and North America to get more battery production as mass battery shipments from China don't make as much sense from cost or safety standpoint, even less so with the current trade war. Don't expect to see true solid state batteries (using ceramic material) commercially available any time soon because of issues regarding rigidity and breakage, but there may be batteries marketed as solid state on the horizon that are gel based (and not as impressive). \n\nFlow batteries (for static locations, not EV based) are having a difficult time catching on because while the materials are readily available, prices are high since the materials are also used in the production of steel. Fuel cells have a decent chance for powering heavy duty vehicles (like trucking) because the grid demands may be too much for drawing that kind of power for BEVs. Hydrogen production from excess wind and solar might make a lot of sense compared to battery storage; hydrogen markets are likely going to be dependent on whether decent infrastructure for natural gas is already in place.",

"comment": "I always tell people that voting in America is the least important thing you can do to slow climate change by getting the world to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy. The fact of the matter is that both the Democratic and Republican parties have worked overtime to serve the interests of the fossil fuel executives and their affiliated Wall Street shareholders.  For example, Obama worked to repeal the 1970 ban on crude oil exports in 2015, and under Trump, those exports continue to boom. This is the result of the government promoting fracking throughout Obama’s term:\n\nhttps://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2018/1018/How-the-US-became-a-leading-fossil-fuels-exporter\n\nThe real push for renewables is coming from countries like Germany, China and Japan (in general, any country without domestic fossil fuel reserves) who don’t want to burn coal or pay to import oil and gas.  As a result of their R&amp;D efforts, the cost of solar panels and wind turbines and battery storage has dropped - it’s far cheaper than nuclear and about the same as fossil fuels (far cheaper if you price in the environmental damage fossil fuels do). \n\nThe push is also coming from individual Americans who can afford to buy homes with solar panels and electric vehicles - and it’s getting cheaper every year, thanks to the global trends.\n\nIn contrast, the two current US candidates are lifetime loyalists to Wall Street shareholders who don’t want to see their fossil fuel investments written off as losses, so both will work to block renewable energy growth at their behest. Face reality, the federal government is hopelessly corrupt and entirely controlled by oligarchs with large fossil fuel investments, such as Warren Buffett(D) and Charles Koch(R). This year, voting will have almost zero effect on that reality. Vote anyway, of course. But the outcome really won’t matter much.\n\nThere are however other ways to push for renewables (at the state level, at the consumer level, at the international level), so don’t get discouraged.",

"comment": "Since you chose to blatantly ignore the conclusions of that report in favor of your biased 'ah, gotcha!' one-line quote, I am compelled to post the ACTUAL conclusion here since you are openly being intellectually dishonest about this.\n\nFROM THE REPORT CONCLUSIONS:\n\n\"Many previous studies of deep decarbonization of electric power illustrate that much can be done with wind and solar power but that it is extremely difficult to achieve complete decarbonization of the energy system, even when using every current technology and tool available, including energy efficiency and wind, hydroelectric, and solar energy as well as carbon capture and storage, bioenergy, and nuclear energy (1⇓⇓⇓⇓–6, 8⇓–10). In contrast, ref. 11 asserts that it is cost-effective to fully decarbonize the US energy system primarily using just three inherently variable generating technologies: solar PV, solar CSP, and wind, to supply more than 95% of total energy in the proposal presented in ref. 11. **Such an extraordinarily constrained conclusion demands a standard of proof that ref. 11 does not meet.**\"",

"comment": "The Powerwalls back up the whole house.\nTwo weeks ago we lost power about 5pm.  My wife had a conference call, so she wasn't done till 6:30-6:45.   After she was done she started to cook dinner, so she had the stove going, and we were operating the house like normal.  She almost was about to turn on the microwave, but I told her to let me turn off the AC first.   Could the Powerwalls have handled all that?  Maybe, but I didn't want to risk it.  We were already running 7.8kW power with just those two items (stove, AC, and lights).   All those things in use were high use electricity items and they drain the Powerwalls pretty quick.  I think after she was done we went from about 97 to 82%.  After she was done with the stove and microwave I made coffee, and then ended up turning the AC back on.  She had the dryer running for about 30-40 minutes until the power came back on also.\n\nNow this was definitely a night out of the ordinary.  If we lost power during a hurricane we would be cooking dinner at 4-5pm at the latest, any washing/drying wouldn't get done unless it was 12-3pm so the sun could charge the batteries.  Even showers would be taken earlier in the day, so the water heater wouldn't have to run from the Powerwalls so much.    Speaking of water heater, that is another item I'm going to get done ASAP and get a hybrid water heater, as ours is 12 years old.  It's almost time for that to get upgraded anyways as it's near, or past it's life cycle.\n\nSo you can do a lot on the Powerwalls if you have at least two, and not a ton of high power appliances running.   If the sun is out I believe  you have much more than 10kW of continuous power, as the Powerwalls and sun are working together.   I'm sure if you have a newer house and it isn't too big that you could probably get by with 1 for the most part.   You might not be able to have the AC and stove/washer/dryer on at the same time, but you could probably still have AC.",

Do you think that's a much better option, if available?  I can't tell how much more expensive it would be.  From googling, looks like they estimate up to 20k installed, but that seems in line with the Panasonic option from Quote 1.  \n\nThanks so much for your thoughts on all of this!",

As utility rates get more fluid and expensive, it may be worth it, but usually residential rates are very straightforward without peak demands. \n\nIf you need back up - maybe get a battery, or at least think about it (it may change whether you do a string system or micro inverters - a lot of batteries are on the DC side of the system, but some take AC and convert it back). But, if you need backup, a generator is probably cheaper at the moment.",

"comment": "It uses a lot more power in winter - about 350 kWh in the coldest month compared to about 150 kWh/month in summer - but otherwise it works great.  Always starts and has near-instant heat (which is where all of that extra power goes).  The \\~60% winter range loss likely wouldn't be quite so bad if it was used for longer trips - a lot of energy gets used to warm the interior and warm the battery, but keeping the car warm would use less energy than the initial warmup.    Regardless, manufacturers really need to work on insulation for EVs - that could probably cut the extra 200 kWh in half.\n\nI was a bit optimistic about being able to keep the car charged with solar year-round.  Without the shading, I would expect about 250 kWh/month of solar power in November through January, so it wouldn't quite keep up when it got cold in those months.",

"comment": "What you need to worry about is not wattage, but voltage - that is what the charge controller (MPPT) of the Bluetti will care about. You should take the maximum Open Circuit Voltage (vOC) of your LG solar panels, multiply that number by 1.25, and compare that to the maximum voltage of the Bluetti’s solar input and also the minimum. For the AC200p, I believe the upper limit is 150 volts and the minimum is 35 volts.\n\nShort answer - I think they are compatible, but please check carefully before spending money and potentially breaking an expensive power station. \n\nWhen you connect more than one panel in series, you get the voltage of one multiplied by the number of panels. So if each panel is 40v, connecting two in series would give 80v and 3 would give 120v. Even 40v can be dangerous so use extreme caution. And remember, multiply the open circuit number by 1.25 just to give yourself some margin of error and not break your charge controller or battery.",

"comment": "Gotcha, nobody beat SunPower’s numbers in terms of low degradation and efficiency ratings. If you insist on getting a Non-SunPower alternative, you would need a really solid panel, the closest thing is Aptos and rec Solar. The other issue is who is doing the install. Any company can give you a warranty on installation and craftsmanship, But there is no telling if that company will be in business to honor that warranty. If they close down you will default to manufacturer warranties. At that point you have to chase down which manufacturer covers which product. I always say go factory direct SunPower first. If it’s a matter of you want to get something cheaper, you really need to do your homework, ask all the questions, where is each product made and who covers the warranties",

"comment": "Thus my point.  Using previous quarters preceding BYD's rapid ramp, you would have never seen it coming.  However, if you were paying attention to the industry overall, you would have known that they were boosting their cell production capabilities, and those cells have to go somewhere.. ie cars.  They're one of the few OEMs actually producing their own cells.  Heck, just realizing that Warren Buffett had invested so much money into BYD should have been a pretty big tip off.\n\nWe could have seen Tesla rapidly boosting production simply by way of them signing huge contracts with cell suppliers in China who had the production capacity to supply it.\n\nWe could have seen that other OEMs wouldn't boost production in the short term due to lack of available global capacity for cell production.  Yeah, they may want to boost production, but how can they without cell contracts?  Ford's sitting on 20 weeks of orders; clearly they'd love to be able to properly supply the market with EVs; if only they had the cells to do it.\n\nWe can forsee rapid boosts in production by just about every other OEM on the planet simply by looking at where cell production growth is coming from, and who has access to the cells.  For example, the 30+ cell plants I mentioned that are currently in development or already under construction, many of which are being built in partnership with major OEMs.\n\nWhy would OEMs do it this way and not simply go to China for cells?  For US OEMs, I imagine partially because they knew what legislation the Democratic party would try to push through with the IRA EV credit.  In fact, those OEMs may have written the legislation!  Chinese LFP cells are not eligible for the credit.  Had other OEMs ordered huge volumes of cells from China, they'd not only have gotten no advantage, but they'd also have gotten screwed.  Much like Tesla may be with their LFP imports for the model 3 RWD... and why Tesla suddenly started rushing to build cell production lines in the US,  why Tesla stopped orders for the model 3 LR, why they started shipping dirt cheap model Y RWDs (LFP cells) in parts of Europe, and why they suddenly ramped up battery storage units with LFP cells. To try and sell off the huge volumes of LFP cells they already ordered, and had intended to offload in the US through model 3 RWD.  Oops.\n\nFurther, the non-Tesla OEMs seem to be forming partnerships with cell producers to build cells, possibly joint ventures, meaning both companies own the production, sharing in the profits.  Tesla on the other hand doesn't own much of any production outside of their latest 4680 lines.  They buy almost all of their cells from other companies, primarily Chinese companies and Panasonic Nevada.  Which, no surprise, Tesla just announced an expansion of Panasonic's end of the Nevada factory.  Probably because they're going to need more 2170 cells that are eligible for the tax credit.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Europe suddenly moves to act against Chinese imports as well to protect their own regional manufacturing as their numerous new battery plants start coming on line.",

Had to call again on 2/09/2022. SunRun called t2/14/2022 to scheduled a tech to come 2/16/2022  between 8-11am. No show, called SunRun they canceled and didn't care or try to reach out to let me know. Lost a day waiting for service! Now apt is scheduled  2/24/2022. 11-2 pm. I don't have a system that i can get read outs or any way to monitor the system except to physically observe it. \n\nAgain can I pull the system my self and not void warranty? I do own the system out right, and it was paid for in cash/credit card for at Costco &amp; check to SunRun.\n\nSincerely \n\nSyncros86",

"comment": "Thanks for the quick reply. I think you helped me out on that original question. \n\nA protected-load panel is not entirely out of the question. However, the way the house is laid out, there are lots of sub-panels and isolating the desired loads from those panels is quite difficult. The main panel has almost no end-user loads running to it. \n\nThe other side of it is that during outages (which are not uncommon here) we might want to cook, etc. This is a convenience thing, of course. \n\nAm I correct that the 20A limit is just for the battery, right? During the day (assuming sunlight), could we pull higher amperage directly from the solar panels?",

"comment": "All this pain is self-inflicted. \n\nI remember I had a bad feeling when Tesla kept delaying battery day, BD, back in 2020. The more often it got punted down the road the more obvious it became that Tesla was hoping for some good news.\n\nWhen BD finally happened it was a major letdown. Nothing that got 'promised' went beyond what the market was already delivering.\n\nWell, here we are 3+ years later and Tesla is still working on the dry coating problem. Meanwhile CATL's Qilin CTP offering is 13% better than the 4680 pack's energy density in the Wh/kg metric.\n\nOne of my arguments back then was that Tesla should get out of the battery business, except for the R&D on the chemistries.  That is focus on the goo that goes into batteries, not how to get that goo into cans.\n\nOne thing that was new about the 4680 was the structural battery pack.  That was an error.  You can't trash the entire vehicle because the battery pack dies. Seriously!  I know that the superrich have been accused of buying a new Rolls Royce because the ashtray on the old one got full, but that is not many of us.\n\nCommodities are not S3XY. Batteries are commodity items. That's why Tesla should have been looking for the off ramp when CATL showed up.  Solar panels are also commodity items and they have no business being produced in the US, EU, or China, those economies are too advanced.",

"comment": "Not what I said. I said they saved me the cost of having to hire an electrician. I could have don't it myself, I have replaced at least 150 and installed several hundred of them when I was in the trade. To do it myself would have been a long day and about $800. Then you have to deal with permits, inspections, power company appointments and their same day inspections. No thanks. I don't have all the tools I used to and my time is worth a lot more than what I paid. I have been out of the trades for nearly 20 years and a lot has changed regarding codes and such. \nIf course that price is built into the install, but I have the option of paying it off now or over time. Electrician would have been pay now, period. I also get the tax savings from the entire job rather than just a smaller portion. \nBottom line is I made the best decision for me. I have seen a lot of the Sunrun panels and performance for similar sized homes, facing the same direction and comparing that to what I have, I made a better choice. I make more power for longer periods, even if it's just 30 minutes extra per day. \nWarranty and performance were the absolute top priorities for me. For 25 years, I don't have to worry about shit. In another 4 years my electric bills will be $0. If the local contractor goes out of business, SunPower handles any installation/workmanship problems. SunPower also managed and installed the MPU, again covered under the warranty. I will take that over cheaper panels/installation any day if the week.",

"comment": "Panasonic/REC panels are warranted by the manufacturer, not the installer/contractor, so that 25 year warranty is good.  If contractor goes out of business, you can contact Panasonic to replace/repair them.  Enphase currently produces the best microinverters, one installed per panel to facilitate monitoring solar panels individually from your smartphone’s app.  For only 8kWh usage per year, I’d go with at least a 5kW system.  I’m limited by space on my roof, so can only fit around 4.9kW of panels, and contractor estimates I’ll get around 7.8kWh annually at my location in northern CA.  I currently use around 12kWh annually, so my setup will only provide around 60% of my usage.\n\nSunRun has a terrible reputation, at least on Reddit, so I’d avoid them.  And, I definitely would NOT consider a lease with any solar company.  Buy, or not, but don’t lease.  You’ll be locked in to ever increasing electricity rates, and if they installed the system, which you wouldn’t own, on your roof, you’d have to buy them out anyway to facilitate a sale of your home.",

And they use LiFePO4 not NMC like Tesla. LiFePO4 on average has double the cycle count of NMC.",

"comment": "I do not believe that one can misunderstand what a philosophy is, this is a matter of personal definition.  Define what you mean by utilitarianism before declaring that is my philosophy.  Perhaps I was sloppy with my language in this regard: different people may have different reasons for their dietary choice of veganism, creating differing philosophies which reach the same conclusion regarding actions to be taken, but which all live under the same term.  This is a problem of the lack of fine enough language, and it is often an issue in areas far beyond the present discussion.\n\nWhile you want to draw me into a debate about the definition of veganism, and I applaud your efforts to avoid the issue *you* originally brought up, let us begin with the assertion you originally made and the numbers involved in it.  Then I would be happy delve into a deeper philosophical discussion regarding morality.  I am not trying to sidestep the definition or validity of veganism.\n\n&gt;I think however, people should also be forced to stomp on some insects and chop up some small mammals when they eat harvested crops, since that is part of that process.\n\nThe small mammals and insects have already been killed in harvesting the crops.  Under what ethical theory is it reasonable to kill more in this way?  While I again applaud your overall efforts to keep vegans honest and on their toes, this is simply trolling, is it not?\n\nI absolutely agree that in the hypothetical case that if a cow (~400lb beef) is raised eating grass and never fed from grain that involved the killing of small mammals (maybe 10%-15% of beef production?) and the maintenance of the cows grazing area does not involve the killing of small animals (this is never the case) *and* the production of the caloric (or protein equivalent) of 400lb beef as plant involves the killing of dozens or hundreds of smaller animals (this is not the case either, all the data I have seen suggests the number is less than one animal.. I have been through this before and I went over it again now) the moral choice is to eat the cow instead of the plant.\n\nBy actually looking at the data I have concluded that this hypothesis is not satisfied.  You have only resorted to an ad hominem attack attempting to dismiss this finding.  As somebody that identifies with philosophical reasoning, you should attack the argument being made (especially as it is well sourced) rather dismiss it as propaganda based on the website it comes from.  I agree it may be the case that more than 2.55 bugs die from 1 million calories of vegetables.  But who is to say more insects are not killed as a result of grazing cattle (on a per calorie or protein calorie basis) than harvesting grain?  The number of insects killed in either case is not (presently) knowable, we don't have a method for counting either that I am aware of.  Please address the argument made in the article and what is actually considered (and *practical/possible to consider*) before you dismiss it.  It is well argued and calculated and cited as far as I can tell.  What is your specific disagreement with the analysis made?  The one you gave in your P.S. is not a disagreement with their analysis.  In fact it is amusingly ironic that the very number you dismiss (2.55 deaths from 1 million calories for vegetables) actually comes from the Steven Davis article which was the original source of the claims that harvesting plants may kill more animals than eating meat!!  I will ask yet again: Do you have another calculation that determines the number (and type) of animals killed in harvesting grain that you wish to cite?  \n\nLet me point out, as I am sure you are aware, that we further have to remember the hypothesis that a cow eats grass rather than grain is somewhat exceptional.  In the case of grain-fed cattle, it is clear that, even with the lower bound cited in the Guardian editorial of a 2:1 conversion rate, more animals are killed by eating beef... by that same factor of 2:1 (plus the cow itself).  In fact a ratio of less than 1:1 would violate conservation of energy (assuming the cow only received energy from grain), showing that no matter what the exact number is, grain-fed cattle certainly causes more killing than the equivalent in calories from the grain itself.  Moreover, would you agree that, in order to reduce suffering, it is moral to eat plants rather than chicken faced with that dichotomy? pig rather than plants? grain-fed cattle rather than plants? \n\nRegarding the question you ask me, I don't believe the hypothesis is satisfied for a number of reasons, the most glaring being the moral calculus you have used.  Why does killing a cow cause an equal amount of suffering as killing an insect?  Of course you know that it is (presently) impossible to know that if a cow experiences x dolors in its death and an insect experiences y dolors in its death then x=y.  I would instead presume that they are far from equal, as I would guess you do and most people do.\n\nI know this is painting with a broad brush, so I don't necessarily mean to point fingers at you, but there is a tendency among some philosophers to sit in an armchair rather than to get their hands dirty actually trying to understand what they philosophize about.  This approach is lazy and anti-intellectual.  If you are not willing to actually see what the situation is \"on the ground\" with some sort of scientific analysis then it is impossible to have a developed idea on the matter that can be acted upon.  If you actually think that you kill less animals eating cows than wheat, soybeans, or broccoli, you should be able to produce some supporting data that led you to this belief.  The data I showed you (that you dismiss with erroneous reasoning) analyzes the original proposition of Steven Davis from 2003 that is the first (as far as I know) assertion that it would be less harmful to eat large grazing animals than plants.  It largely just takes numbers from this and other peer-reviewed articles and collects them into a table (after some unit conversions) in order to make a proper comparison.  By the way, for the purposes of determining the land use of crops to feed animals used for consumption, the author used a 2006 Cornell study.  If one were to consider only grazing cattle, obviously the results would be different.  Again, if you can point to another scientific analysis (that uses peer reviewed data preferably, as in the post I cited), please do.",

"comment": "Your question exposes your inherent [carnism](http://www.carnism.com/carnism.htm). You are posing the question from the point where it assumed that humans have some right over certain animals.\n\nI wouldn't ask \"if we are going to extend our sympathies to all non-human animals\". Rather, I would ask \"if we are *not* going to extend our sympathies to all non-human animals\" and this is where we enter a slippery slope - suddenly beastiality, crush videos etc etc all become acceptable by the same standards that meat and dairy are \"acceptable\". And then we have to ask how we distingiush between human and non-human animals - and we will find, in the words of Derrida, that \"None of the conventionally accepted limits between the so-called human living being and the so-called animal one, none of the oppositions, none of the supposedly linear and indivisible boundaries, resist a rational deconstruction.\" - i.e. if we start to deconstruct by intelligence or sentience, we very quickly enter the realm of questioning canabilism, farming of human babies, torture &amp; experimenting on mentally disabled humans etc etc.\n\nIts not a matter of sympathy - its a matter of rights of beings not to be property, not to be tortured and not to be murdered. \n\nWith regards to animal kingdom being \"special among living things\" - this is a common frame of questioning (ala \"vegans are carrot murders!\"). Biologically, of course, we know that plants do not have the capacity to feel and remember pain. BUT even if they did, veganism would still be the route of least harm given that animals are inefficient converters of plant protein into animal protein - i.e. meat-eaters consume more plants indirectly (all the plants the animals' ate) than vegans consume directly. As such, veganism attempts to respect all living things.",

"comment": "Well, if they can't understand why you would have a problem with it, then they really don't understand why you are a vegan, so maybe you could try to (bit by bit) educate them about it. And there is nothing wrong with saying \"Yes, I know I helped you make X (animal food) last year, but I've thought about it a lot since then, and I really don't feel comfortable with doing it again. \n\nI know that it's not easy to go against the grain in social situations (just today my SO and I had to tell someone who's house we are supposed to go to for a dinner party that we would show up after the dinner, because they are going to boil lobsters and we feel very uncomfortable being around that). It is \"easier\" in a way to just kind of say \"Oh well, that's ok, I'll help you guys make it, it doesn't bother me\". But it clearly does bother you, on some level, and I can definitely understand why it would. It's a bit more risky to say what you really feel about it. However, if you do that, you are standing up for the animals, you are standing up for veganism, and you are standing up for yourself. Maybe they might even start to see things the way you do. \n\nIn the end, I think, you will feel a lot better about having made that choice. Just do it in a kind and polite way. Plus, it's your family...what are they gonna do, put you up for adoption? (Btw, the lobster killers totally understood and we're cool... they even prepared a vegan dessert with us in mind!)\n\n* Edit: I just re-read your message and realized that you did refuse to help with the pork tamales last year. So, I guess my advice is just to find a way to communicate more peacefully with them about these things, even if that is just not letting their hysterics affect you. In any case, good job for standing up for yourself, you may find that they have calmed down a bit since the last time. Just remember to stay consistent, stay strong. You're doing the right thing.",

But we never really talked about it and he never, ever pressured me or anything. I'm sure he's ecstatic I made the decision to change (with the help of Cowspiracy), and it was pretty easy for me.

I think it's this weird mix of people who have been vegetarian for over 10 years and after dealing with bullshit from omnis for some long they're just impenetrable to criticisms and are so firmly set on \"what I'm doing is right and ethical\" that after all this time they can't fathom a more ethical dietary stance. You also get a mix of fresh vegetarians who are already strained by the change in diet and life style and feel let down cause vegans are ragging on the \"for not doing enough\". \n\nAlso some people have a serious problem when you point out, vegans are vegetarian. It's all just weird. For me the transition from omni to vegetarian was way harder than going from vegetarian to vegan. Giving up meat is what seems to really upset people and cause social bullshit, giving up milk and cheese just kind of confuses most people but they are not as hostile about it. It's just a weird insecure sub.",

It's not like the farmers quota will be a litre less that day and he won't be able to milk the last goat or cow... that's not at all how it works.\n\nAlso, milk and eggs aren't animal waste. These animals are bred and killed specifically for milk or eggs. They live a tiny fraction of their natural life span and they undergo an immense amount of discomfort and psychological/emotional abuse in the process. It really doesn't matter if you will ever be vegan (which you can't say with 100% confidence). It seems like the ball is rolling, so people's perceptions will change over time, especially once synthesized replacements are commercially available.",

That being said people are slowing reaching out, and becoming curious because they either want to improve their health, feel better, they love animals, realize the impact on the climate, or they just want to save money.  That combined with the fact that it seems there's new evidence everyday supporting why plant based diets are better in every regard.  People are also aware of the fact that you don't have to grow dreads and move to Vermont overnight.  You can gradually make small changes without changing your lifestyle. I meet vegans and vegetarians who you'd never guess were all the time.  It's becoming more popular to not try and push it upon people or mention it every second.  My father, who is super old school, became a vegan in his 70's because of health reasons and didn't tell me until about a year later.  He read a few books on the subject and was sick of going to doctors all the time.  He's definitely noticed a huge difference in his health.",

I wouldn’t go so far as to say I wouldn’t be friends with non-vegans because that’s unrealistic and that would mean dropping pretty much all my friends and my roommate (who is a vegetarian so it is at least nice to have a meat free household!!) but yeah every now and then i get really upset about it and confused to how others can be this blind.",

"comment": "If you want to try more types of vegetables, I highly recommend exploring cuisine from India's various cultures. \n\nSince you like chicken and are from Texas, I think you might like *gobi manchurian*. It's fried cauliflower covered in a sauce inspired by Chinese flavors. I know some communities in parts of the south use okra. *Bhindi* is an okra-based Indian dish. Don't worry, it's not slimy - unless you mess up.\n\nSome other nutritious, vegan staples in (northern/western) Indian food are *daal* (kind of like a legume soup), *channa masala* (chickpeas), *palak paneer* (caramelized spinach and cottage cheese - replace the cottage cheese with tofu or something similar), &amp; my personal favorite, *shimla mirch paneer* (capsicums and ~~cottage cheese~~ tofu).",

"comment": "Becoming more ethical in the choices made when choosing what (&amp; where) to consume is sometimes a difficult thing to balance. It’s marvellous to see more &amp; more choice available in vegan friendly products; am aware that my own shopping choices are not always from locally sourced, small retailers.  But I do what I can; buying more ethical &amp; environmentally friendly products from supermarkets results in them stocking more ethical goods, which means those products become available to more consumers.  I first became vegan 35 years ago &amp; it’s considerably easier now than it was then.  Part of the reasons for that are the response of big business to an expanding market; am generally pretty pleased when a new vegan product becomes available, but Nestle are on my “worst companies, avoid when possible list”.",

Maybe you should look into doing more research before saying ignorant thing to a bunch of people who have spent an abundance of time researching veganism. You sound pretty fucking ridiculous. Watch What the Health, Forks Over Knives, or Game Changers to see how meat consumption is the number one contributor to the destruction of our planet along with it's direct link to heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. So you can argue now, but when you die of a heart attack in your 50s, we'll still be here making our point and using you as an example.",

I really admire you for that- 2014 thats such a long time! I need this motivation to see that it’s possible to give up that love and to commit to being vegan. Thank you for the reply!",
