"comment": "Too soon. \n\nThe for-profit \"Blink\" network is headed for bankruptcy for [reasons I discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kd8du/supplier_of_electric_car_chargers_may_go_bankrupt/). A national network wouldn't serve the EVs we are likely to have for the next decade or so.\n\nTesla is building its own network for its big-battery cars. That's enough for now. We need more generations of EV design, and especially of battery advancement, before considering a network other than theirs. If we build one now, presumably with public money given that the private entity is going to collapse, I think it will be counterproductive. It will further open up EVs to the accusation of being just another federal boondoggle.\n\nThis isn't a matter of my being \"anti-EV.\" I own an EV. I really like my EV, and I believe that battery-driven electric motors will eventually become the dominant motive power for personal vehicles. But I think we need to wait until energy density and battery design matures before building that network, especially if it's going to be at public expense.\n\nIf there was a cost-effective means of embedding continuous electric power within roads, I'd change my mind. But the only ideas I've seen along those lines (so far, anyway) are in the realm of science fiction. If the concept could be scaled up at a reasonable cost, I'd be for it.",

"comment": "The typical Level 2 home charger is rated for 16 amps and designed to be used on a 20 amp circuit. In use, it draws up to 14 amps, varying through the cycle and averaging about 12.5 amps. Volts are constant; it's the amps that vary, or at least that's what the data dump from my Watts Up 240v appliance meter says.\n\nTesla's specs are one thing, but what people actually install in their houses is another. I'm sure there are people who install a bigger circuit, an example being my 50 amp hot tub heater circuit. I suppose if I paid $105K for my EV I might pop for a super-duper circuit upgrade and the $2K wall charger. All said and done, it'd be $4K or so.\n\nIf you're an ordinary joe with a LEAF, you'll get what I described above and pay a grand or so, and less if you can do any of the installation yourself.",

"comment": "Nice writeup. (I assume this is your post)\n\n\"There is an uneasy mood offered by most electric vehicles offered today, the drastic few that there are.\"\n\nDrastic few? There's a wide range of plugin vehicles today from virtually every major manufacturer. Most are plug-in hybrids, and that's fine.\n\n\"Truly the best approach to the electric car is the soft switch. Changing to a new brand of shampoo is no big deal, who cares. If it’s an electric car in the driveway, that looks the same, works the same, and is much cheaper to operate than a gasoline Rav4.\"\n\nThe soft switch works well for hybrids, and nearly as well for plug-in hybrids. There's virtually no change in the operation of the vehicle - you just pay more upfront and fill up less frequently. Both types of vehicles still lean heavily upon the existing gas infrastructure.\n\nPure battery EVs (BEVs) are significantly different, and at least require user education to determine where they work well. In commuter applications or with fixed routes, BEVs can work fine as a soft switch, as long as a secondary vehicle is available. This is true for many families; one or more cars could be BEV, provided range is adequate for daily driving. Just like every vehicle doesn't need to be able to haul a couch, not every vehicle needs to be able to drive across the country.\n\nHowever, to move beyond a commuter niche and into mass market acceptance, we need to fully flesh out a quick charging infrastructure and drive prices down close to the nearest gas-equivalent .. or at least close enough to see payback within 50-100k miles.\n\nFor example: Chevy Spark EV 1LT costs about $11700 more than the automatic Spark 1LT gas vehicle, or $4200 more after the federal subsidy.\n\nThat'll buy roughly 120 gallons of gas, or 40-50k miles at 36 mpg.\n\nSo we're close on price, with significant subsidies. The charging infrastructure is the sticking point.",

(It would be fine if it's an hour. Not enough range? Charge up again and go... but unfortunately not the case)\n\nIf you're working on a solar charger, you need to be mindful of your consumers. Unless you can store the energy somewhere, I would argue that most consumers wouldn't buy it for their homes since electric cars are usually used for commuting.\n\nIf you're going to market it to businesses, or to consumers to install it at their business locations then I believe there is definitely a market for that.",

It's about animal rights, and whether we consume products that exploit other animals. There are vegans at every point of the political spectrum.\n\nOf course many (perhaps most) vegans are also environmentalists that are concerned with their impact on the environment. And that's why they might support Tesla for non-vegan reasons: it provides a path for decreasing our use of fossil fuels, both on a personal level and on the society as a whole.\n\nIn this aspect, a vegan that is passionate about the environment may overlook Tesla's exploitation of animals. That's because unless we make drastic cuts to our carbon emission levels, climate change may reach catastrophic levels, both for us and for many other animals.\n\nElectric cars aren't enough to change the course of humanity, but Tesla is investing on another technology that *might* have an  enormous impact: cheaper and more efficient batteries. This may increase the viability all sorts of alternative energy sources, and dramatically lower our reliance on oil.\n\nLife is full of compromises, so I personally would still be sympathetic towards Tesla even if they didn't care about leather stuff.",

Don't put words in my mouth.  The Leaf and i3 are selling just fine.\n\n&gt;Tell me, tell me now. You seem to know, after all you're defending them.\n\nAll I said was that Nissan and Volkswagen (the brands, not the conglomerates) have no interest in putting out a six figure car because it wouldn't sell well from either of those brands.\n\n&gt;What, it's a huge gamble? How is that their gamble when it was made and proven right years ago by Tesla?\n\nThat's like asking how the Phaeton was a gamble when Audi had been making cars and had proven the model for years.\n\nNissan has the Leaf and Volkswagen has the e-Golf and the e-Up!.  Say what you will about those cars, but they're electric vehicles in the segment where both brands sell their cars.  It's silly to expect Nissan or Volkswagen to dump a bunch of cash into an expensive EV that wouldn't sell well when they can throw it under a different sister brand instead.",

"comment": "The weight wouldn't be a problem. I did the math somewhere, but loading the hood, roof, and trunk of a Tesla with solar would only warrant **up to** 10 miles a day.  For small commutes that's awesome, but again, it's only for very ideal conditions. Realistically it would probably only be 5 tops.  Remember the average battery pack for the Tesla has ~~85,000kwh.~~ 85,000Wh\n\nTo actually put the solar on the car, you need to spend millions in R&amp;D to reliably build these special car panels with high yield in a manufacturing environment.  Then you have to convince people to ignore aesthetics because most people don't want a car with solar squares all over it.",

"comment": "&gt; They should and better make them weigh less as well.\n\nThe NIO EP9 weighs significantly more than it's competition, and I feel like talking about hypercars in this context is pretty off the mark.\n\n&gt; Then why have they suggested that Polestar will be the EV focused sub brand of Volvo?\n\nI don't think you understand what \"halo car\" means. Polestar going on to producing a small SUV and affordable EV is perfectly consistent. Nobody is claiming that BEVs are bad.\n\n&gt; It couldn't compete with the Model S, it would need to grow up first and have a real man's battery pack.\n\nYou really just said that.\n\n&gt; It's more like a luxury Chevy Volt.\n\nOr maybe even, like a souped up and lightened S90-T8 coupe? Just maybe?\n\nhttps://insideevs.com/volvo-debuts-s90-sedan-with-t8-plug-in-hybrid-option/\n\n&gt; Why even focus on hybrid for Polestar if all they cared about was to make GT cars?\n\nWho said either of those things? Look at the lineup.\n\n&gt; Why not just make hybrid Volvos and leave Polestar to cater to high performance market with traditional ICE cars?\n\nThe Drive-E engine is likely the last engine Volvo ever does. At least it seems that way. How much power ultimately are they going to try to squeeze out of 2000cc? They've done a great job so far, but it just doesn't make sense for a low-volume sub-brand to develop a whole new ICE powertrain. Motors OTOH...\n\n&gt; Why even hold the reveal in China?\n\nBecause that's where the new factory and financiers are? Why reveal the Model 3 in Nevada?\n\n&gt; You know what this looks like? It's like they fucked up and couldn't make a decent range EV with high performance so they frankensteined a hybrid to meet whatever internal deadline they had and pushed the BEV back for a later release.\n\nOk. And back in the real world it looks like they took an S90 T8, boosted the battery pack, reconfigured a dual drive solution in the rear instead of the existing single motor, and carbonized the body panels. It even uses the same interior, taillights, headlights, hood, etc. Maybe it looks like a cop-out or compromise to someone like yourself, clearly unfamiliar with Volvo or Polestar, but this is clearly the most ambitious project in Polestar's short history and makes a ton of sense if you're familiar with the brands and the current SPA-T8 platform: https://youtu.be/oUPJFHo5c-A",

I did not want to risk getting a Tesla to discover they could not raise enough capital to pay off their bonds coming due or Mr. Musk falling ill and being unable to hold the cult of personality together. Tesla and he are too intertwined for me to be comfortable with, as I'm essentially making a large purchase on the mental and physical well being of a person that embodies a company. Personal decision and I respect your investment in a Tesla and that it is serving you well. If things were a bit less, let's say fluid, at Tesla I'd be content to get a lower end Model 3.",

"comment": "They didn’t mention anything other than Australia. Tesla is installing a lot of Powerwalls in Australia as they evidently have a very challenged power grid with exceptionally high prices. They’ve starting using a VPP idea there and evidently it saves the end users a lot of money. They recently unveiled their “Autobidder” software, which is meant to do exactly what we’re talking about. It will dynamically determine the value of energy at any specific time and bid to sell energy. Tesla has also applied to be a power utility in the UK. So the pieces seem to be there. Whether it actually happens or not we’ll see.\n\nIf there are trials of this idea anywhere else I think the main difference for Tesla is the amount of energy they would have under management. No other company I know of sells nearly as much stationary battery storage capacity around the world. Even one Model 3 has about 6 Powerwalls’ worth of energy so their “mobile” battery storage capacity is potentially enormous, even if your only factor in future cars with the “Million Mile Battery.”\n\nLet’s put it this way, the Hornsdale Battery in Australia is about two to three months’ worth of batteries, even with a good reserve, of Tesla car production at their current rate. With increased sales obviously that time comes down. Hornsdale has been very profitable for the company who commissioned it.",

"comment": "And Europe will magically generate large amounts of its electricity from solar and wind the next day?\n\nLook what’s happening with electricity prices throughout Europe right now (incl. Norway). Tight gas supplies, limited renewable production, and high consumption has resulted in a perfect storm for energy prices.\n\n\nThe gas won’t have a market eventually, but turning off the gas supply does not immediately end the demand for gas.\n\nNatural gas exports from Norway were not worth much in the last years… and now gas is valued nearly at the equivalent of 150USD/bbl oil. \n\nNorway’s gas exports are not some kind of isolated climate problem. Our problem is that we consume a hell of a lot of energy, and people just don’t really understand the magnitude of the problem. Renewables have insane growth right now and are attracting intense competition for investment, but the speed of the development is not going to allow us to move away from oil and gas overnight, or in the next year, or in the next decade. \n\nAlso - the money the Norwegian government has “spent” subsidizing electric cars is significant… and more than a few economic studies have shown that investing that money in a variety of other climate initiatives would have had a much bigger impact on climate. But Norway made a pledge to reduce emissions, and when most of its energy generation is already emissions free… well you need to find something to change. Even if it’s not the most effective measure.",

But the fact is, they are viable all over Nevada, and for most Americans in like under twenty years.  That’s incredible.  Plus they’re actively expanding, even in tiny little places like ely!\n\nYou can continually nitpick at little things like chargers being too slow, or not enough, or you’re scared of reliability.  Fine.  Once those issues are fixed, you will come up with some other obscure or niche scenario, because things staying the same is always easier to cope with.  \n\nThe world is moving on from gas.

"comment": "&gt; In the longer run there's going to be DCFC in every little town, and then range won't be a big concern anymore.\n\nI'll admit, even something like the CCS adapter coming stateside might help a bit with anxiety. I love the supercharger, but wouldn't mind it if I had options in the event that a given supercharger on a road trip is having trouble.\n\nedit: To be fair, another potential *big* issue with range anxiety is that the optimal charging method for EVs is also a *nightmare scenario* for drivers if something goes wrong. 20% of a MY LR/P is 60-65 miles, and one out-of-order Supercharger with that much remaining could completely screw you. At 500 miles, that's 100 miles of wiggle room. You could hit a supercharger with a line going back a mile and just _go to the next one_ instead. Or just start charging at the 200 mile mark instead.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm probably always gonna want more range, and I don't think I'll drop the obession 'til we're at the 600-700 mile mark on what is a 300mi EV today, price-wise. That would turn 300 mile EVs into something closer to mass-market pricing.",

"comment": "&gt;How is that so? $6 would be $2 fee + 4 hours at $1 an hour. That would be about 25 kWh of electric. That comes out to be $0.24 a kWh and $0.07 a mile at 3.5 mi/kWh. By comparison, a gas car at 35 MPG would be $0.13 a mile at the national average of $4.29 or $0.17 a mile using the current California average of $5.74 a gallon.\n\nThanks for the price breakdown.  I'm still learning about the $ per kWh measurements so I can't comment as fluently as I'd like to the costs you mentioned.  What I can say is that a full charge at one of my city's stations costs me $6 and I get about 36 miles with it, which comes out to about $0.16 per mile.  I realize newer EVs would get better mileage but I, as lower-middle income, don't have access to one.  At a similar rate of 36MPG and $5.65 / gallon of gas at a station down the street, it comes out to just shy of $0.1569.  That's the best price breakdown I'm able to offer this conversation so if there's something else I should look at as well then I'd like to hear about it.  It's a darn close price comparison, especially when 3 months ago gas prices were significantly lower.\n\n&gt;Are they currently getting free gas now? So why should they get free electric?\n\nThis is a valid question and I feel it comes down to, at least in part, why we as a society subsidize anything at all - to lower costs and promote consumption.  Gas is no stranger to subsidies and I feel that many folks who have lurked in this subreddit for any number of years would agree that the cost of EV relative to the available technology vs gas has been the biggest factor in preventing its widespread adoption.  I'd like to change a small part of the cost in my community.  I'm a perfect example as to how having access to free charging stations can sway a consumer into investing in an EV or not.\n\nTo really figure this out I need more information about the back end costs of ChargePoint and that's something I'm having a lot of difficulty finding, even in the ChargePoint subreddit.  I'm not naive - if every station in my city costs taxpayers $10,000 per year in maintenance/potential income then okay, totally free stations are likely out of the question, but what if its only $500 / year?  $1,000?  Is there a dollar amount where you'd say \"Okay, making the stations free isn't going to make a huge financial difference for the city/taxpayer\"?\n\nThanks for the chat, these are all good arguments that I'll likely hear in my community so I appreciate the devil's advocate.",

"comment": "It’s widely known that Germany’s electric power supply has the grid constantly on the brink power outages, even blackouts. This is in large part due to the rushed phasing out of baseload coal and nuclear power while installing mass capacities of unstable a wind and solar power.\n\nAs Germany pushes the ever greater burdens onto the power grid, its government continues taking measures to weaken the grid rather than to bolster it.\n\nSince Germany’s natural gas supply disruption has caused energy prices to skyrocket, homeowners and motorists are looking for alternative heating sources and modes of mobility. Little wonder Germans are looking more and more to heat pumps for home heating and electric cars for their mobility.\n\n\nBut there’s a problem, Blackout News reports: \n\n&gt;The President of the Federal Network Agency is now calling for the forced throttling of heat pumps and charging stations.\n\nThis is because the power grid cannot cope with the added load.\n\n&gt;The head of the network agency, Mr. Müller, sees new risks for the supply of electricity and gas. Private individuals installing charging stations or pumps could overload local grids. To prevent this, the power of these devices could be throttled.\n\nThe government wants to push electric cars and heat pumps, but the agencies are warning it’s not possible – because **over the past 20 years Germany has wrecked it’s once extremely stable electric power supply, which by the way was responsible for a tiny, inconsequential fraction of the world’s CO2 emissions**.",

"comment": "I was just watching videos last night about charging and what the best techniques are to extend battery life. Check these YouTube videos out:\n\n1. Everything You Need To Know About Lithium-Ion Batteries\n\n2. How To Ruin Your Electric Car's Battery - NMC Edition! (for nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry batteries)\n\n3. How To Ruin Your Electric Car's Battery - LFP Edition! (for lithium-iron-phosphate chemistry batteries)\n\nThey're from a guy named Jason Fenske who operates the Engineering Explained series of videos on YouTube.\n\nPretty much all modern electric cars use LITHIUM-ION high-voltage batteries. But the battery cells can have different internal chemistries.\n\nThe first step is to determine what kind of battery chemistry your car has: For premium, long-range cars it has tended to be either nickel-cobalt based. For standard/low-range and rear-wheel-drive cars it has often been iron-phosphate based. (The exact chemistries can vary, but the key is apparently whether the batteries use cobalt & nickel, which are problematic \"conflict materials,\" by the way. I.e., they tend to be expensive and come from countries who may not be friendly to the U.S.)\n\nSo it is interesting that Rivian is switching, even in its premier R1 models? The lithium-iron batteries will be cheaper, less prone to heat damage, and the components will come from \"friendlier\" nations. But Rivian will have to take steps to keep the range as high as it was.\n\nRegardless of which kind of batteries you have, check out the videos, because the advice Fenske gives based on automotive battery engineers may differ from what auto-makers recommend. Battery engineering can be complicated and mysterious (to the lay person).\n\nBut drivers may definitely want to treat the two major battery types--nickel-cobalt vs. lithium-iron--differently in order to get maximum battery longevity. (The high-voltage batteries are expensive to replace.)",

"comment": "Did you not read these paragraphs at all?  \n\n&gt; So even putting the climate change argument aside, it's clear that China is investing heavily into renewable energy. All the political infighting about climate change clouds the fact that renewable and sustainable energy is the industry of the future, not limited resource fossil fuels.\n\n&gt; So deny climate change all you want. Fact is when technology and innovation catch up for renewable sources of energy then the U.S. will be behind the eightball when the energy wars escalate.\n\nNo one wants to see China beat the U.S. economically in any way, shape or form, can we agree on that?  \n\nSo while we continue to fight wars in the Middle East trying to pursue cheap oil prices, China is vastly ramping up their *renewable and sustainable* energy infrastructure to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.  In the coming decades, this is going to have a massive multiplier effect when their energy input costs in whatever-industry-you-pick are going to be much, much cheaper than in the U.S.\n\nWhat's funny is that a strong conservative argument for investment in renewable energy is that of jobs.  Just [solar energy jobs alone have far outpaced those of coal jobs](http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/at-the-edge/2014/06/03/is-there-really-a-war-on-coal) in the past few years:\n\n&gt; Turns out, there are were about 89,000 people working in the coal industry in 2012, the most recent year available with statistics – and nearly half of them were concentrated in just two states, Kentucky and West Virginia.\n\n&gt; As of November 2013, the American solar industry employed nearly 143,000 people, according to the first ever census of solar jobs released a few weeks ago by the Solar Foundation. That was nearly 24,000 more solar jobs than the previous year – a jump of 20 percent in just one year.\n\nSo yes, because fossil fuel industries keep (unsurprisingly) pumping money into the denialist game it's affecting the political landscape by preventing long-term investment into renewal energy, which is good for *jobs* and the *consumer*.  I had solar panels installed just a few months ago and my electricity bills have been around $8-$10 a month, while my A/C's been cranked up every day to deal with the summer.  So yes, anecdotally I've benefitted from the economies of scale from the solar industry and the conservative argument is that *everyone* can benefit as well.",

"comment": "&gt;The only important thing is to move away from fossil fuels. It really doesn't matter what you move to.\n\nENGOs don't share your view.  Because they don't, they are shooting themselves in the foot.\n\n&gt;Individual countries can decide what has the best low-CO2 track record without input from me.\n\nDo you suppose antinuclear ENGOs have influence of governments?\n\n&gt;The states that have reduced CO2 emissions are not those with a particular nuclear stance, but those with a carbon trading scheme.\n\nThe states that have had the lowest CO2 emissions to being with are those with substantial nuclear power.  Look at France and Germany.  For all of Germany's efforts, France still emits slightly more half the CO2 per capita as Germany.  (5.6 tonnes versus 9.1 tonnes.)\n\n&gt;Okay, what is the expensive part now?\n\nThe plant itself.  BTW, your Wikpedia source put the storage component at $50/kWh of storage capacity.\n\n&gt;That's not obvious.\n\nI'll happily make the prediction that Spain will build no more CSP plants without returning to their prior subsidy levels.\n\n&gt;Concentrating solar power is one of several preferred methods of solar electricity production. In most places it has achieved 'grid-parity' when considering ROI over 35 years.\n\nWhat's your source on that?\n\n&gt;I didn't lie about you.\n\nYou most certainly did.  You followed me into /r/energy and /r/exmormon like a petulant child.  The mods of the former deleted your comment.  In the latter, stated that I was a climate denier, a characterization that you knew to by false.\n\n&gt;That's not more. That's the same amount. And until it reaches equilibrium it's less from the air.\n\nI don't follow you here.  If there is less CO2 dissolved in the oceans, they have a greater capacity to absorb more CO2 from the air.  This is pretty basic science.\n\n&gt;Both seeding the oceans with iron, causing algal blooms and what other measure are you talking about?\n\nI referred you to olivine as a form of capturing CO2 directly from the air.  I linked you to a rather lengthy document about it.\n\n&gt;You need a price on carbon for sequestration to be a viable business activity at any price. \n\nGovernments can run those programs separately from business activity if they so choose.\n\n&gt;But you also need to prove that the CO2 will remain on the ocean floor, and that's non-trivial.\n\nThe Nature article I linked you to discusses this.  Can you think of a process whereby carbon on the ocean floor would be brought back to the surface?\n\nAt the very least, experiments from people like Russ George should move forward.  Of course ENGOs oppose those as well.\n\n&gt;What have you read about the impacts of global warming?\n\nThe IPCC reports.\n\n&gt;Do you have an idea of how impacted biodiversity will be? Do you have an idea of how impacted agriculture will be? Do you have an idea of the infrastructure consequences of sea level rise are?\n\nYes, I do.  I've looked at estimates of how all of the above will be impacted.  I'm also aware that those impacts depend very much on how much warming will occur and it appears that that warming will be at the low end of what was hypothesized.\n\n&gt;I can't see her estimate of externalities. Can you point me to one of those please?\n\nNo.  You are purposely missing the point.  She thinks that nuclear power causes all sorts of problems that the science doesn't support.  According to her, you can't price externalities because there are too many of them.  *That* was the point in bringing her up.",

"comment": "If I pay $5,000 for solar panels and my electric bill goes from $300 a month to $25 a month that saves me $275 per month. After 18 months, I would have now saved $5,000 thus covering the cost of said panels.  Every month going forward that $275 worth of energy is now free because my panels have paid for themselves.  If I get another 15 years out of them, thats 15 years of free electric generation.  In fact, you can argue its better than free- it can actually make a profit if you sell back energy to the grid.",

Give either them, or, probably quicker, a local solar installer a call and ask if the program is still running, and still has money.\nI phrase that last part specifically for that implication - what happens with a lot of programs with utilities is they set aside XYZ dollars a year.  As companies go through them, the fund is depleted, and sometime throughout  the year, they put the program on hold, process a waiting list, and everyone waits for next year.\n\nB)  I don't know about Michigan incentives.  Again, call a local installer or 3, find out what they know.  I was going to mention this on the last bullet as well, but [DSIRE is a popular amalgamation of utility incentive programs](http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/3646) - it still lists DTE, and you can cruise through the michigan list for other possibilities.\n\n\nI'm not sure myself what the $357 was on your bill, but most folks just take the actual bill value, divide that by the KWH used off your meter, and average out the $/kWH.  all utilities have a number of flat service charges and nickel&amp;dime fees.  it's tough to model those when dealing with lots of different companies and billing methods.\n\nb)  up north, in michigan, that 20d pitch you put your pvwatts on is gonna nix a good % of your production, especially in winter.  if you're gas/wood heating, that's fine enough.  if you're electric heat... you may want to address that.\n\nd)  PVWatts... I don't use much PV watts for modelling anything but producction numbers... if you want to see the financial prospects of a system, you've got to see businesses and get real #'s, in my opinion.  two key #'s i think you'll beinterested in is the ROI (Return on Investment; a range of years in which the system pays for  itself), and the LCOE (Levelized cost of Energy; the $/kWH produced overthe lifetime of the system (take net costs of system, divide it by lifetime production kWH).  Down here in Tejas, I get LCOE's in the $.04-$.08 range, depending on system difficulty.  \n\nanyhow, I hope this helps a bit.  Good luck!.  ask anything else you care to!",

I came here to post ask why you didn't just link to the [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-627-fundamentals-of-photovoltaics-fall-2013/index.htm) website itself, since that has not only the videos, but reading material and problem sets, etc. But I now see that you are affiliated with the website in question.\n\nThats fine, these sorts of aggregating websites are good because people might find things this way that the otherwise would not. Just a few comments, though. For the MIT Intro to PV course, its kinda wierd that you put the tutorial videos first, not the 1st lesson. I would put the tutorials last.\n\nAlso, why not a search box on the front page of the site?",

"comment": "It really depends on how much electricity that you currently use.  You can get a good idea by looking at your electric company statements to see the average monthly kwh's used.   You'll also want to check with your electric company and see what their net metering program is/costs/what they pay you for overages/etc.    \n\nAnd of course, after your tax breaks and level of energy usage it will greatly vary the costs on how much the system will run.  I'd recommend contacting a few local installers to get quotes on what to expect cost wise and rebate wise.   Battery backups are quite expensive and really for something like a power outage that may or may not happen it's quite alot to justify spending.   Maybe in a few years down the road they'll be more cost effective and could be added on.   \n\nHow often do you lose power right now?  Does it happen after every major storm?  And when it does happen, is it out for long periods of time?",

In other words if you can offset 100% of your usage with 17% modules, There is no greater return on using 20% or imagined 35% efficient modules.   Your return on residential is generally only up to your usage.\n\n&gt; They are progressing quickly\n\nnot really, the efficiency is progressing slowly and is likely to continue at that rate.  \n\n&gt; with a big announcement by Tesla later this month\n\ncounting eggs before you have a chicken...   \n\n&gt; companies quickly developing solar shingles or entire solar roofs\n\nThere have been several companies making solar shingles.  Dow announced earlier this year that they are discontinuing their solar shingle product.   There are too many electrical permit, fire code, and reliability issues with them not to mention the high price.   With the fire codes, and electric codes currently in place not to mention rapid shut down and trend to module level electronics, I don't see solar shingles making a return.   \n\n&gt; I'll wait until either the efficiency improves or the square footage of my roof can be maximized with current efficiency. It's coming soon.\n\nI don't know the particulars of your roof ( I would be glad to look at them if you want to pm me) but there are not going to be any drastic performance improvements any time soon.    Tesla is making a factory announcement which may effect pricing, though that would be hard to imaging with the recent equipment price drops that have already happened, and the many reports of much larger producers economics.\n\n&gt; Ultra high efficiency being developed for residential\n\nthis is a concentrated solar research.   That means they are using optics and mechanical alignment on the roof to keep the optics focused on the modules.  They are using current (expensive) high efficiency but tiny modules and the optics.  But it requires a rub goldberg type machine to keep the optics aligned over the modules.   Having a this giant moving tray of lenses on your roof is going to be difficult to keep working for the life of the cells, not to mention passing code.",

"comment": "Checking in from r/all, it's incredible to see the amount of bad arguments defending meat consumption.\n\n\n\nReddit loves to salivate over rational, well spoken, science-backed arguments, that the biggest problem in society is that we don't listen to the research, that people who deny science are ignorant.\n\n\n\nBut when it comes to eating bacon, suddenly that goes out the window. Objectively speaking, animal agriculture contributes a huge amount to global warming. No amount of magical Elon Musk batteries or solar panels or self-driving cars can erase this. In fact, the single best thing you can do for the planet right now is stop eatnig meat.\n\n\n\n\"It's natural to eat meat.\" If you love research-backed, logical arguments, then you should already know appeals to nature are logical fallacies. We are rational beings, we do not need to eat meat.\n\n\n\n\"But plants are--\" no research supports the idea that plants are sentient or feel pain. Period. But we have oodles of research on animal mental health and behavior. They feel pain, they feel emotions, they do not wish to die. There is no such thing as an ethically killed farm animal.\n\n\n\n\"But Inuits and--\" the fact you have to resort to unique cases and societal outliers to justify meat eating says it all. You aren't an Inuit, you do not need to eat meat.\n\n\n\nVegans are not perfect. It's not possible to live a perfect life in which you harm nothing else. But eating plants does less harm, both to animals and the planet. Even if you reject the idea that a plant-based diet is healthier, completely ceasing animal consumption and switching to a plant-based existence is objectively better for the environment and produces far, far less harm. You can easily survive off of a plant-based diet. It is not prohibitively expensive. If your own reason to continue eating meat is culture or taste, you are using emotional, subjective reasoning. If you eat meat because you prefer the taste, you are essentially using an arbitrary preference to justify an exploitative, damaging industry.",

It was $40 to join a regional energy-non-profit to qualify for the loan, $180 fee to process the loan, and $5 credit union opening \"savings deposit\". The loans are secured by the solar panels (I think), and the only interest is the normal 3.99% interest rate.\n\nJust because there exist out there some atrocious exploitation doesn't mean you have any basis to assume some likelihood that anyone talking about a solar loan went that way.",

"comment": "Probably because it does not have a transfer switch...\n\nWhen I worked the 1st Gen of the powerwall, The battery had little overload capability. So even with a transfer switch, trying to run anything during an outage would shut down the inverter.  LG battery had much better specification for off grid application. \n\nIf you are going to use a PV system off-grid, the battery and the inverter need to be able to provide overload. Else you won't be able to start motors like pumps or even a heater. Also, it needs to safely island itself from the grid once there is an outage, and you need transfer switch  and a voltage mode to recreate the grid. (Normal grid-tie inverter does not have a voltage mode, so they cannot produce AC without a reference.)\n\nTesla is a great brand, but LG, Samsung and Mercedes-Benz will all have batteries in 2018. Another thing for you to consider is that, let's face it, Tesla is designing products for SolarCity and SolarCity is probably not going to sell hybrid system anytime soon. ROI is not there and they need to be profitable. Probably not impossible to make profit on hybrid system, but it is definitely not the easiest path. \n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that Tesla will eventually want to do hybrid inverters as the market will require it, but for the moment making SolarCity profitable is what they are concentrating on.",

A moving EV will use 15kWh driving at 100kph for one hour. You would need a surface 50x bigger than a car to sustain that speed, or you would need to park the car in direct sunlight for 50 hours to generate enough power to store in the battery to run the car for one hour.\n\nI have 16 260W panels on my house roof and on a good day that generates 25kWh which fits with the above pretty nicely.",

Colorado has the nation's sixth largest natural gas reserves, but proposition 112 is attempting to put a damper on the industry's unrelenting drilling in an effort to put people's health above the need for natural resources.  If the proposition passes, it could cause a spike in the prices.  Even if it doesn't pass, the oil &amp; gas industry knows that residents are fed up with being pushed around, and a lot of places up and down the Front Range (where the reserves are also located) have been investing in renewable energy which reduces our local dependency on them, with local surveys going ask to see how people feel about investing even more heavily in renewables.\n\nSo yeah, from a local perspective I can certainly see things heading this way already.  And really, all it takes is one significant break in battery storage technology and it will be game-over for O&amp;G.",

"comment": "The average household uses something like 20 kWh/day.  $100/kWh means that the battery storage component of living off grid becomes small.  Normally you figure on storing 5 * average power use to get 90% uptime.\n\nLooking up my location (central Alberta) I can generate 1200 kWh/year/Kw installed capacity. To average 20 kWh/day, I need 1200/365 = 6 kW installed capacity.\n\nWait:  Winter.  If I read the month x month charts, my production goes down to about half in winter, and to get that, I have to pitch my cells steeper, decreasing my summer use.\n\nSo, call it 15 kW installed capacity.\n\nSolar cells at 20% efficiency, and max insolation of 800W/m2 take about 7 square meters per kW.  So I need about 105 m2 or about 1000 square feet of solar cell.  Module pricing is about US$0.32/watt in large quantities.  Does not include support or installation. Inverters run about 10-20 c/W, but someone who is off grid doesn't need to invert the full capacity of the array.  Balancing that, however, you need some brains on the battery charger.\n\nSo 100 kWh storage at $100/kWh = $10K\n15 kW PV array cells @32c/W = $4.5K\nSupport and installation ad hoc assumed to be the same = 4.5K\nInverter/battery chargers 15c/watt = 2.2K\n\n20K would make you independent of the power grid.\n\nAdd a 1 kW Honda generator for the times when you use too much power.  It can run at max efficiency to recharge the batteries.\n\n***\n\nBest done with new construction:\n\n* Orient house and design roof to make solar system support easy.\n* Wire house with priorities:  E.g.  Sump pump, fridge, freezer, and furnace have first priority.",

"comment": "The typical off-grid setup is \n\nsolar panels connected in (optional) parallel (optional) strings that feed into a charge controller (typically mppt) that is attached to an array of (optionally) parallel set of (optionally) series batteries which then attach to an inverter that feeds a circuit.\n\nFor instance my setup is 2 strings of 4 100W panels that feed a 100 volt 50 amp MPPT into 4 parallel pairs of 12 volt batteries in series that then attach to a 24V inverter.\n\nThings get tricky because \"average PV hours\" assumes you have an infinite place to dump power.  In an off-grid setup for instance you might not run down your batteries when sunlight is low.  But sizing typically works like\n\n1.  What is your typical load\n2.  How long do you want to run it\n3.  How low do you want to discharge your storage.\n4.  How much PV hours do you get\n5.  How often do you get overcast/etc.\n\nFrom 1-3 you can size your storage.  For instance, for AGM batteries you want to only discharge to 80% (if you can help it) to have a decently long cycle length (honestly think of AGMs as UPS batteries not off-grid living batteries).  So a [say] 200W load for 4 hours would need 800Wh / 20% =&gt; 4kWh of storage (about 340Ah of 12V batteries).\n\nBut then factor in how many days between sun you might have.  In Canada in the fall for instance you can easily go 2-3 days without significant PV.  So say 3 days,  So that's 2400Wh meaning to keep &gt;80% SOC you need 12kWh of storage.\n\nThen you have to design your solar to match that.  If you're in Canada and you get say 4 PV hours per day say twice a week (this excludes hours which your PV array won't meet your load/charging needs).  Means you get 8 PV hours a week.  To run this load 7 days a week you need to generate at least 5600Wh of energy in 8 hours which is 700W of panels.  Then you have to take into account shading and angles/etc so you might be only 80% efficient on your location (for instance my setup is high 80% in the sun).  Realistically I'd bump that by 50% at least so plan to install north of 1kW of panels.  But that's just to meet load.  If you want to keep the batteries topped up it's a whole other song and dance...\n\nSo I guess the questions are\n\n1.  What load are you trying to run\n2.  How often\n3.  How much solar do you have installed\n4.  How much battery capacity do you have\n\netc...\n\nTo give an example, my setup is for my home office (on sunny days) and as a small home UPS to run the fridge/freezer/etc during blackouts.  So I have 1.6kW of panels (800W installed so far 800W soon ...) setup as 2 (soon 4) strings of 4 panels that feed into my MPPT that feed into my 8 105Ah 12V cells paired up into 24V pairs.  I have 10kWh of storage so in theory I could use ~2kWh regularly while still having 1500+ cycles.  I don't though.  I only use it if the sun is out or we're in a blackout so I rarely discharge more than ~5% or so.\n\nI used AGMs instead of li-po or lifepo4 cells because they're a heck ton cheaper and easier to install (no BMS needed).  The downside is unlike say lifepo4 I can't discharge as much as often.  If I were trying to maximize off-grid time in my office I would have gone lifepo4 but then the cost of the storage setup would have gone up 3 to 4x (honestly, as a UPS AGM batteries are just fine).\n\nI originally planned on keeping 800W for a while but got another 800W of solar because I really didn't factor in cloud coverage.  On a partially cloudy day my 800W array [in the fall] can barely and many times not keep my office load (200-300W) going.  So another 800W should allow me to go off-grid most days.  It also means during a blackout we have extra generation capacity.\n\nSome easy rookie mistakes to avoid\n\n1.  Make sure your inverter is pure sine.  They cost more than modified sine but you'll end up regretting your cheaper MSW purchase when you end up buying a pure sine\n2.  Buy an MPPT charger that is more than your planned capacity.  You might only have [say] 200W of solar today but might want to double or triple that later.  \n3.  Breakers.  Use breakers on everything.  Any connection to or from a power source (solar, batteries, etc) should have at least one breaker.  Don't skimp on this.\n4.  Ground your inverter.  \n5.  Ground your solar panels\n6.  Use proper cables.  Your inverter should be fed from something decently thick like 2/0 AWG.  Your charger should be using at least 6AWG to your batteries.  Your solar should be no higher than 10AWG.  \n\nOne of the stupid mistakes I made (several times) was trying to cheap out by buying small and then upgrading later.  I'm the proud owner of 3 MPPT chargers and 2 inverters (12V and 24V...)... So basically have an idea of what you want to achieve and then work backwards.",

"comment": "I'm the one in our company that does the installations of the Egauge. The egauges are the most accurate possible form of energy management possible. If it was done accurately then I would use the data from it. \n\nAlso, not sure how much you know about electrical work or how reliable the company who installed it are. But Egauges tech support are the best tech support group I have ever had the chance of dealing with EVER! Everytime I finish an installation I monitor it for about a week or two compared to solaredge/solar inverter monitoring, I call the Egauge tech support if I see anything weird. \n\nThey ask you what the serial # of the Egauge is and they are able to monitor it, include look to see if the sine waves are on point or off. If they are, that indicates that a setting is incorrect or an installation is wrong. They are very, very intelligent. I believe they are all electrical engineers. When they start talking, they usually lose me with their electrical theory. They can fix anything on their end to be accurate, as long as anything physical doesn't need to be changed. \n\nAnyway, If your up to it, I'd call them, give them your concern with the differences (which I've seen before), then they will look into everything. But tell them you didn't install it, because they generally have me check voltage with a multi-meter, which can be dangerous if you don't know what your doing. Just say you know it's installed correctly but would like their input. \n\n\nNothing wrong with just calling them and asking. But I will warn you, even though I'm an electrician they are very nerdy about electrical theory and usually lose me.\n\nI've installed the egauge's on Bush Brother's manufacturing warehouses and headquarter's. They are the best product in the industry.",

"comment": "Well, with the increasing rise of plant based milk alternatives, I'd hope that the growth of that industry will help offset some of the losses from the animal agriculture industry.\n\nA bit like an unemployed coal miner who finds a new job installing solar panels. \n\nClearly that's not going to work out for everyone, just as in the case of coal miners, but.. well, without getting too political, America does love its \"free markets\", and one of the side effects of those is that sometimes an industry just dies. Usually either through people realizing how awful it, as, for example, in the case of why we don't give our infants Heroin for cough symptoms any more (not joking, this was a real thing, and heroin was originally a [Bayer brand name](https://www.businessinsider.com/yes-bayer-promoted-heroin-for-children-here-are-the-ads-that-prove-it-2011-11)), or through technological replacement, as in why we have almost no horse-and-buggy drivers any more.\n\nThe dairy industry is susceptible to both at the same time, so.. the writing is on the wall, and ultimately it's probably best for folks to get out sooner rather than later.\n\nI want to say I do applaud your compassion though. Losing a job is never easy, even if it is in an awful industry. Most of the folks who work in dairy aren't directly throwing male chicks into shredders or inseminating cows though. They're shipping and receiving, marketing, accounting, I.T. insurance. They're just folks with a job.\n\nI'm not trying to whitewash here. I just see it as a bit like the heyday of big tobacco. Not that cigarettes are gone now, even, but it's not like it was decades ago when there were billboards on every corner, and recommendations from doctors on what kinds of cigarettes were best for your health.\n\nSure, some of those people knew the harm they were doing. But most of them were just people with jobs, happy to have employment.\n\nSo yeah, really long winded way of saying, I'm with you on that sentiment. I hope the employees can find better jobs in a healthier industry... in fact, this whole post should probably just be that last sentence, but I've written it now, so there you go.",

The LG one had minimal language where they only cover shipping/labor for like 12 years I think and a number of other caveats between that and the Enphase warranty that left room for surprises I felt.\n\nI would definitely consider battery down the road, but currently they seem toocost prohibitive and being on SMUD, we've been lucky to not have to deal with the shutdown power outtages so that's less of an issue in that discussion.\n\nAlso considering an EV but again, most likely 3-5 years out.

I'm not a huge fan of SUVs, whether EV or IC because of the loss in efficiency. \n\nUnfortunately that just seems to be the way the car industry is going, also for EVs the extra height provides some easy battery storage at the cost of efficiency.\n\nI also suspect that the powertrain efficiency in the PSA group cars is not the best (pretty average IMO), certainly not up to that of the Mini SE. I think with EVs there is a bit of complacency when it comes to powertrain efficiency, perhaps its just cheaper to increase the battery capacity.",

"comment": "Yeah. So it sounds promising. You need to find a real estate agent to partner with who understands or is willing to learn about solar to sell the home. They can do research on the area and find comps. They hopefully can point you in the direction of a good appraiser who will factor that in to the value of the home. \n\nAs for net metering, that sucks it’s not available but you really only need to have an agreement where you get some kind of payment or credit for your power. If that’s the case with your distributed generation program then it should be ok for the deduction. But I’d definitely recommend talking to a CPA there. \n\nYou’re on the right track there. Finding a good rep will be a little tough because you are doing something specialized and are looking for a different ROI than most homeowners just looking to cut their power bills. But once you find someone, you should absolutely be able to cut a deal to get the system for cheaper because you are doing several homes and will be a repeat customer. The rep should be able to help the real estate agent out to with how to market and sell the system. \n\nThere are a lot of other upgrades you can do along with solar such as putting on a new roof, upgrading the electrical panel, adding an EV charger, upgrading the lights to LED, and adding a smart thermostat. You should talk to your real estate agent to find out which upgrades will get you the most bang for your buck. \n\nAnother thing to consider, most solar financing comes with crazy high dealer (financing) fees that can be upwards of 30% of the total cost of the system. If you have the cash to pay for the system that will be the cheapest. But if you want to keep your cash freed up, make sure to find the lowest dealer fee loans. They likely will have high interest rates but you will be selling the home and paying the system off so paying 3-8% interest and only 6-15% dealer fees for a few months rather than 0.49-2.99% interest and having your financing fees upwards of 30% will help you keep costs down and keep things profitable!",

"comment": "Americans are paying higher prices now because of Biden’s regulatory war on fossil fuels. \n\nSenior Editor David Harsanyi put it well when he wrote:\n\n&gt;Democrats are rigging the market to force you to buy a car that has a 200-mile reach and uses erratic and expensive energy when you already have increasingly efficient models in your driveway and tens of billions of easily accessible barrels of offshore fossil fuels here at home — and much more around the world.\n\n&gt;We have centuries worth of the stuff waiting in the ground, Which gives us enough time to come up with some better ideas.\n\nAs David points out, a Berkeley study found over 90 percent of taxpayer subsidies for electric vehicles went to the top income quintile as of 2015. The numbers overall are striking. \n\n&gt;Since 2006, U.S. households have received more than $18 billion in federal income tax credits for weatherizing their homes, installing solar panels, buying hybrid and electric vehicles, and other ‘clean energy’ investments.\n\n&gt;We find that these tax expenditures have gone predominantly to higher-income Americans. The bottom three income quintiles have received about 10% of all credits, while the top quintile has received about 60%.\n\nTaxpayers have been funding subsidies for people who can already afford them. Money goes out of their paychecks and into their rich neighbors’ Chinese solar panels. Renewables in general will replace our dependence on OPEC with dependence on China. Alternatively, we could allow Americans to go about business as usual while eliminating excess emissions where it’s affordable, improving nuclear technology, and making other energy sources more efficient.\n\nIf countries like China and the quickly growing India don’t meet emission reduction goals, Americans will have suffered needlessly. China emits more greenhouse gases than every developed country combined.",

"comment": "&gt;Much of the legume crops are grown for livestock. Alfalfa is a yearly rotation, not a long term investment. Farming is also beginning to change in done radical ways. Organic soil building, reduction of water use, combining solar power with farming on the same land (agrisolar), permaculture, growing several crops at once instead of monoculture, etc.\n\n**In North America, legumes are not consumed by humans much but, in places like Africa and India, they are a lot more common.**  Milo is something that is used a lot in Africa that is basically just cow feed in North America.  Cereal grains and legumes used in cattle feed in North America are part of basic food stocks in other parts of the world.  The North American and European consumption of Beef drives most of our agricultural production that isn't driven by Ethanol production for gasoline.\n\nRegarding Alfalfa, anything that has a 3 year payoff to me is a long-term investment.  Where I grew up, the normal rotation on an Alfalfa field to a new field was 3 years due to low yields the first year and the need to fix Nitrogen in the soil for other crops to follow.\n\nI suspect this varies from where I lived to where you live due to weather and soil conditions.",

"comment": "The economics don't work at all, why install a $1,000 panel on the side when a glass window let's you raise the rent by $1,000/mo. Same with the roof, why install a panel on the roof when you can rent roof space to antennas for $10k/mo?\n\nSkyscrapers are in a weird position that their exterior is far far too expensive to justify solar. Many of them go for leed certification which requires buying solar power anyways, so they essentially just pay for a solar array outside of the city and let the power company transfer all the credits to their bill.",

"comment": "Your inverters are based on your battery voltage. They have nothing to do with the solar panels voltage. The charge controllers will have maximum PV voltage input limit as well as a total wattage input. But yes keeping the same size panels for each charge controller is a good thing. For each array running into a charge controller just make sure the voltage isn’t too high for it. Remember connecting in series increases voltage. Connecting in parallel increases the wattage but the voltage stays the same. I recommend you learn about wattage, voltage and amperage. Getting your mind around the differences of each of these really helps you in what you will need for your system.",

"comment": "The utilities convinced the politicians that roof top solar is stealing from the average consumer.  They tell them that roof top solar steals from the low income consumers.  Less than 3% of US power production is attributed to roof top solar. That only the rich can pay for solar and shift the cost to lower income consumers. They removed 1:1 net metering from all un regulated power providers. This gave back the power to providers and delivery companies all the profit back and made it possible to add up to $25 in monthly fees to be grid tied, plus per kilowatt charges if 5.3 cents on top of utilities rates. I went from paying $200 a year to almost $300 a month. It’s a money grab! \n\nMany consumers that bought solar when net metering was available are unable to get a return on investment. Lower income buyers are paying higher than normal rates and have been left with the liability of paying back the solar loans. I believe that this outs highly un ethical and robbery!\n\nYes there’s a high inequity between the rich and average American. Tax credits are only usable to high income consumers.  They can’t be used by fixed income consumers or your average US house hold.\n\nThey had to change the $7,500 tax credit for vehicles because your average American won’t ever have the liability to get back the tax credit.  Unless they do this to solar, it makes it impossible for the average American family to get solar that makes sense without ditching out another $30k for batteries to offset the net metering credits from the past.\n\nIt’s just a shame… greed wins each time…",

"comment": "I would encourage you to look at this from a different perspective. You are buy a house and the panels add some value to that home (not $40k but some). That value should be included in your offer. I have a second mortgage for a new driveway and HVAC. If I sold my house those things are part of the house not something the buyer would purchase separately.\n\nAnother strategy could be to leverage the low interest rate on the solar panels. Say the home is worth $520,000 you could offer to buy it for $480,000 with the agreement you are willing to assume the loan for the solar. You would be reducing the amount of money you need to borrow @ 7%.",

The solar company said I could not install in an unfinished garage and it would have to go outside. The area inside where it would go has no sheetrock after the breaker box. That would be where the Powerwall would need to go. I pressed the issue as to what \"unfinished\" meant. They told me that if I put up flame resistant sheetrock in that area they could by city code install it in the garage. That just got the gears turning in my head and started to question the likelihood of a fire. It seems from the comments thT they are pretty damn safe.",

"comment": "At the end of the day, PPAs are really just an alternative form of financing. If you ran the numbers for a loan at today’s rates for a 5kW system, your friend would probably be paying a similar rate. \n\nNot sure about your calculation for the costs on a 12.3kW system w/o battery. I would expect that to cost $30k-$32k for the base install plus any additional work that may be needed for your home. Either two batteries you’re probably looking at $55k-$65k. \n\nSolar is generally 10-20% more expensive in the islands because 1) there are additional shipping/import costs vs stateside (sometimes tariffs) and 2) the building codes have historically been less rigorous so getting everything tied in at your house can be tough and require more work and materials. \n\nDefinitely don’t do anything like add a generator if it would void your contract. One of the biggest values of a lease is that you’ve got a company that is incentivized to make sure your system is working. Another thing you may or may not be considering is that the company/SunRun is going to be paying to insure the system. That’s an additional cost that people often miss when calculating PPA vs buying outright, and it’s impactful in a place like PR.",

At this point you're just making up stuff without checking.\n\nYes it is: [Source](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/erneuerbare-energien-nehmen-2023-weiter-fahrt-auf) translated for you:\n\n*Investments in renewable energy systems rose sharply again in 2023 and amounted to EUR 36.6 billion (2022: EUR 22.3 billion). The strongest growth compared to the previous year was recorded in photovoltaics and geothermal/environmental heat, with a focus on heat pumps.* \n\nNot to mention that you don't even took this number in context. A lot of the high costs, besides from heat pumps, come from expensive forms of Solar installations like roof top and balcony (latter went really popular last year). Which by the was is also one of the reasons why the energy consumption in Germany decreased, lot of energy production from solar never sees the grid. \n\nAnd with that you are ignoring that on utility scale, solar and wind are significantly cheaper than nuclear by any metric. \n\n>It's actually likely that the EPR2 would be under budget rather than over budget since the preliminary budget is **extremely** generous.\n\nHaha you really are delusional.",

A very common thing in the US for home solar is the concept of \"third party ownership.\" In this case - the homeowner does not buy the solar panels. They are actually owned by a financial entity (maybe an LLC) that does business with the installer, that then either leases you the solar panels, or sells you the power generated by those solar panels. These are referred to as leases or Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and have been very common, and are a way to get solar with zero money down.\n\nBut, what they are offering you appears to just be a standard loan. I don't think you should be thinking about financial engineering an LLC to try to save some taxes on this. It's likely not worth the headache and I'm not even sure it's allowed.\n\nWhat I would do - is ask the solar installer for a cash price. Those loans they offer often have huge fees baked in that they don't always disclose, and can be really expensive loans. Get a cash price, and then see if you can get a home equity loan, or a loan from a local credit union, and compare the amount you will pay over the life of the loan in both cases. I'd bet anything that using the financing provided by the installer is going to be much more expensive for you.",

"comment": "Honest Florida Solar Broker here. I can do SunPower, SunRun, Sunnova and more. SunPower is great! Best panels and warranty’s are also good. \nI present both the lease and the loan option to everyone and I’m completely transparent for both. \n\nI just built a nearly identical proposal and that monthly payment would be the maximum amount for that system. The guy that pitched you would make about $6k on that deal.\n\nI could get that identical system done for a lease payment at about $100. My commissions would be below $2k. \n\nFor a loan option, it would be a slightly different system, but I can get the payment at around $90. This payment comes with a hefty financing dealer fee that I’m transparent about. There are loan options with zero % finance dealer fees, but the interest percentage is high. This would bring the payment closer to around $120, but I would only recommend this option if you planned on paying the system off within 8 years. Which is super doable when the system is priced fairly, and fees are dropped out for higher interest. The financing dealer fees wipe out the tax incentives completely and some, so opting for a high interest loan to pay it off earlier is the absolute best way to do it if you don’t want to do a HELOC.\n\nThere’s a few more liabilities and maintenance with ownership, but that’s the same with anything that you own. \n\nI love solar. I love educating people on it. I love integrity in sales. Happy to help yourself or anyone because I feel like I’m fighting the scammers daily, and it’s tough.",

I have about as vague a grasp of how to eat non-vegan food as most lifelong omnivores have of eating a vegan diet.  \n  \nEven if I didn't have compunctions regarding animal products, I've been set in this rhythm long enough that switching to an omnivorous diet would be a challenge I'd have to force on myself.  So I consider it rather unlikely that I ever would, for any reason (and yet more unlikely that ethical considerations would disappear).  My *entire life* since 'moving out' in undergrad and learning to provide for myself, I've been providing myself a vegan diet.  An omnivorous diet is alien to me.  I wouldn't know where to start, and have no desire to.  \n  \nMind you, my partner of the last several years and a few of my best friends are also vegan, so there'd be even more challenge (and ethical burden) in becoming omnivorous, in that regard.  Looking at my partner eating vegan and effectively saying \"I don't care about non-human suffering\" would be difficult.",

"comment": "It can either be easy or extraordinarily difficult to become a vegan, depending on how you approach it.  If you have basic cooking skills and prepare meals at home, it's as simple as buying a good cookbook and stocking up on a few essentials.  If you rely on fast food and eat at a lot of restaurants, it's going to be difficult.\n\nA good place to start is the managing editor of Serious Eats experience [being a vegan for a month](http://www.seriouseats.com/tags/The%20Vegan%20Experience).  That will tell you what to expect, what to be careful of (in terms of food labels or navigating menus), and give you some great recipes.  Beyond that a good cookbook is crucial; I always recommend [Veganomicon](http://www.theppk.com/books/veganomicon-the-ultimate-vegan-cookbook/).  It's got a lot of fantastic recipes, some complicated, some easy, none relying on the faux-meat-and-soy-cheese pitfalls that a lot of veganized food falls into.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest either trying to go vegan for a longer time (like a month or at least two weeks), or maybe instead going vegan for one day a week ([Meatless Monday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatless_Monday)?).  A week's very short, and it'll take that long just to start figuring everything out.    It gets easier the longer you do it.",

Like others said here, there are so many vegan recipes out there that a simple \"vegan + thing i'm craving\" google search will likely give you some ideas.\n\nIf that's not enough, then try to start off with a cheap and filling base, like pasta, rice, or potatoes, or things like soup, curry, ramen, and think about what you think would go tasty on top of or inside it.\n\nOne last tip: Smart Balance Light Butter is vegan even though the regular smart balance stuff isn't.

The owner is a dedicated vegan and AR activist. He takes in unwanted chickens and roosters and has hand-built a half-dozen pens. (Has somewhere around 20 hens and 3 or 4 roosters.) I have seen him bury dead donkeys on his property and shared his grief when one of his beloved roosters, Red, was killed by a hawk. I can assure you, he would never kill or sell and animal. \n\nNO animals are culled, sold - or even re-homed without proper credentials. Why would you assume you know more about my community and my friends than I do. Are you *so* vegan you can't imagine an animal thriving under the care of a human being? \n\nIf you'd like to contact myself or Rob, please feel free: http://www.goatmountainsanctuary.org/",

"comment": "Ok, this comment really makes your situation a lot clearer. \n\nFirst of all, yes, raw veganism is not easy! I know because I tried it too, for a month. So please don't think that raw/organic/superfoods = veganism. Regular old veganism is *so* much easier and the only supplementation you have to think about is B12, and possibly Vitamin D, and maybe other stuff if you're deficient or have health issues already. And if you love juices and shakes and raw food, you can just add those things to your diet. \n\nI can see why you don't like your SO's roommate's attitude. Maybe she's secretly in love with your SO or just jealous on some level? Personally, I would feel a bit weird if someone left animal products in my kitchen. Depending on what it was (ie. cookies with eggs/butter in them in a package? No biggie. Hunk of meat in my fridge? We're gonna need to have a little chat about boundaries.) But then you say \"I've been attacked by so many vegan/vegetarians in my life\"....ok, so besides her? Are you 100% sure they were \"attacking\" you? It wasn't just that you agreed with their reasoning on some level but you weren't ready to change? I can kind of understand how, if we're talking about someone who is so hostile and mean like your SO's roommate, you might not want to go vegan, even if you really did kinda want to go vegan, because it would be like \"letting the terrorists win\". But whatever. She is not someone who will be in your life forever. Ten years from now, you most likely won't even remember her name.\n\nAnd lastly, yeah I can kind of see how you might take the title about omnivores freaking out personally, because it *could* be interpreted as saying that *all* omnivores freak out, when you're right, it's only some that do.  \n\nI guarantee you that every single vegan subscriber here has people that they love and care about who are not vegan. Definitely we all wish those people *were* vegan, and that's why we try to persuade them, but it's with the best of intentions. I'm sure the JWs think they're doing something good too, but the difference is that they are a religious cult, and we are a diverse group of people who follow an ethical lifestyle because of a bunch of scientific facts.",

"comment": "For Thanksgiving the school, who provides the meat for our celebratory lunch, bought a Tofurky (at my explicit request) so that myself and the one vegan at the school could partake. The problem there is that everyone brings side-dishes to pass, and very few people think \"Hey, let's leave the cheese out of our mac and cheese\". \n\nThat said, a couple other teachers came up to us while we were making our Tofurky to let us know that the dishes they brought WERE vegan, and then recited the ingredients to us, just to make sure. As I'm slowly moving from veggie to vegan, I've got more options than a true vegan has at things like this, but I'm trying to train the rest of the school.",

One can scientifically prove we don't need to consume animals, that animals are sentient, and that they objectively suffer when we use them.\n\nThat said I agree while the highly skeptical person will seek out information on their own that is insufficient to get the message out. People stuck in their habits and who don't want to change will believe any convenient lie such as we need animals to be healthy, \"humane\" meat is possible, or simply we've always done it so that's that.\n\nStill for the vast majority of people if we can somehow encourage them to look into it I really think the facts speak for themselves. The trick of course is convincing them to look into it beyond handing them a pamphlet. \n\nI think the slow burn for this is just more and more vegans existing and not being ashamed of it. If 1/10 people you know think consuming animals as objects is wrong you might just look into why they think that.",

Mush up a ripe banana with a splash of non-dairy milk, a pinch of cinnamon, a few drops of vanilla extract, and (if you have it) some ground flax or chia. Dip some thick bread in the mix and pan fry in coconut oil or butter substitute as you would any other French toast. There are a ton of recipes online if you want specifics.

"comment": "After awhile of dealing with people's ignorance, refusal to listen, and continually battling against other vegans who are trying to help, you get tired of it. Many sound no different than the meat eaters who we have been trying to get to understand that they have been eating someone no something. Don't like my tone? Okay, continue to be your own tone. Some people will like a more straight, non sugar coated approach. \n\nI didn't go so much negative, more so went roll of eyes. It's also a strategy to get people to realize how ridiculous they would actually sound, before they say anything, so then I don't have to actually bother. If someone actually cared about being an advocate and being effective they would be supportive of others' campaigns but maybe inquisitive about other way they could get involved that might hold even more potential, or how to make these campaigns better, like the comments about the graphic design of the poster. The concern trolling is just hot air from people, many like I said wanting to appeal to meat eaters because they are lonely and just don't want to have to stand up for the animals in uncomfortable situations. The less talk about animals the better in their mind so they can just go on with their day in peace. Truth is there is no peace, neither for human or animal, and that will not change unless it is fought for. They end up targeting their own who are actually trying to help both them and the animals, and that's just so pathetically low that I have no patience for it anymore.",

For some people, they cannot stick with this forever. So let her eat the seafood when she wants to because if you're tackling it from an ethical stance, if you push too hard too quickly you r​un the risk of hitting the \"fuck it I don't care\" wall. \n\nYou want the best for your girlfriend, I understand. But sometimes we have to pace ourselves with helping our loved ones. It's easier to lose a pescatarian or even a vegetarian than a meat eater if you speak too much about veganism because they might see it as an attack. What if they're genuinely trying as hard as they can at this time, but by pushing you turn them away? We don't get to decide limits for other people just because we can go beyond.\n\nSo I say for now take the small victory. BUT. And this is the most important part, eat out less. Reason is, you can cook more vegan food at home and she'll get the hang of it. Eventually you will reach a point where she's been eating vegan for a week or two and she **will not realise she isn't missing seafood**. That's when you tell her and she'll realise that she can do it.",

If they have to make something fresh daily (and can't freeze it or use it tomorrow), it makes sense that it's priced higher. Not to say that I agree with their pricing or with anyone that purposefully prices vegan options higher. \n\nIf you would have instead emailed and said, \"I love that you offer a veggie burger! It's great that you took the time to add something like this to your menu. I would add that I felt it was a bit pricey for the amount and I hope that you can work to reduce the cost so that I can eat here more often.\"\n\nI think your current standpoint does nothing to encourage the owner to continue supporting vegans.",

Not more exploitative, the circumstances under which they are kept are rather similar, but I understand the sentiment to make me look bad. \n\nThat's not the point though, I am against consuming them and try to do so as little as possible. The point is that the act of consuming them, or even meat, doesn't take away from someone's ideology. Someone can eat meat and be more pro-vegan than an actual vegan. \n\nYou guys are making a false correlation between cause and effect. Being vegan doesn't mean you have a vegan ideology. Not being vegan doesn't mean you don't have a vegan ideology. There's no one on one correlation.\n\nTrying to invalidate someone's claim to an ideology is the dumbest, most embarassingly obvious pride motivated thing you could do.\n\nYou're legitimately trying to one up me with 'moral superiority' like this is some sort of contest instead of a matter of mass torture and murder. \n\nImagine people during slavery invalidating someone's speech about the rights of black people and trying to sabotage them because \"they don't avoid being served enough, like we do\".\n\nThis isn't an ideological conflict at all. You guys just want to have an ideology label that makes you feel part of an exclusive and special group, which is the exact opposite someone with the actual ideology would want. It's obnoxious.",

"comment": "Like you figured, I will tell you not to beat yourself up about that. I don’t know why someone would call you plant based for something as simple as consuming normal sugar. Many items that people buy and consider vegan (like Oreos) contain sugar that is likely not vegan. It makes no sense to draw such a harsh line there, and if anyone would say you’re not vegan for that they might find that they aren’t either if they think about it lol. If you don’t consume animal products like cheese and meat you are definitely vegan. Vegan is doing the least harm possible and that is what you’re doing. If it works for you to buy different sugar, do it, but if you weren’t able to that’s okay too. Some people are vegan on a budget and only can afford cheap staples like beans, rice etc. If they can’t afford a certain kind of sugar that doesn’t make them much different than every other vegan.",

My work colleagues will joke that I must just eat moss and twigs, I kind of just shrug and say yeah sure. One colleague tried to tell me on Friday that ghee is vegan and I was like “it’s literally butter??” and she continued insisting that it’s vegan. Like how do you even respond to that?

But there is a huge difference between coming up with a good non-violent solution to prevent these consequences and shooting all the deer that are deemed as overpopulation. \n \n&gt;also lol at vegans who put animals over or equal to humans\n\nMore things **no one** said, if you want to be taken seriously in this discussion you should stop throwing around arguments that you made up. In my first comment I wrote a sentence which could imply that I value animals over humans. I don't however. And no one else in this comment chain said anything to imply they do. \n\n&gt; liberal anti-science vegan\n\nThis is where you lost all your credibility. This is an insult on the level of [\"goddamn hippies!\"](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/47119886.jpg) (don't get me wrong, I love South Park, but this is a bad insult). \n\nAnti-science is bad, sure, can't deny that. But once again, **no one** in this comment chain said anything to actually imply they deny any scientific evidence. And is liberalism by definition a bad ideology? If so, please tell me why, I'd love to hear it. \n\nBut yes, most of us here are vegan, you got that part right. It is not an insult though, we're not ashamed of it.",
