I think that will probably become standard.\n\nAs for pulling the plug, you wouldn't go up to someone whilst they are pumping gas and pull the nozzle out, same applies here.",

I'm fine with 1kW hub motors in each wheel (it only cost me $300 per wheel!). I've seen videos of people flying around with 6, 8 and even 10kW of power. With 6kW you can go from 0-50 in less than 8 seconds so it's nothing to laugh at.",

There's less waste, and that's a good thing.\n\nYeah if you look at them without accounting for their source: Coal Power Plants. The power is actually generated there instead of in a combustion engine. Those inefficiencies along with the inefficiencies of power distribution along with the inefficiencies of charging the car batteries along with the batteries going bad after 10 years of use, make them not all that great.\n\n&gt;But they are good enough to replace some of the gas burning cars, and this is a good thing.\n\nAgreed.",

"comment": "&gt; I checked your post history, and you are very vocal/zealous about this tech, to the point it makes me believe you either work for a company in this industry, or have a financial incentive (nothing wrong with either option).\n\nI don't work for any company in the industry (yet) nor do I have a financial incentive (yet). I'm hoping to though because I'm convinced that Hydrogen is the future, as Amory Lovins and many others say. I'm looking into a few fuel cell stocks at this moment- have only been invested in Solar in the past.\n\nI'm motivated to post because months ago I posted an article about what I saw was a very cool tech item- a stack of metal that made electricity with no moving parts and that was eco friendly. \n\nThe vitriol and hate directed at that post was shocking and astounding. A bunch of armchair experts yammering about something they knew absolutely nothing about. So I started reading more and more and the more I read about Hydrogen the more I was convinced that it was the one thing that could end dependence on foreign oil in an environmentally friendly way and also in a decentralized way- anyone can make hydrogen gas at home.\n\nSo the haters caused the posting history. And the more they hate the more I post. Now that I've seen the pathetic attempts to silence this promising tech the emotional outbursts against Hydrogen are actually a bit amusing. Hope that helps. \n\nBy the way- there are legions of pro Tesla fan boys here and everywhere. Many of them seem to be full of hate towards anything and everything non Tesla. Do you ever ask if they have financial incentives to post what they do? I know for a fact that a one Julian Cox (a most unfriendly and childish person) favors Tesla ([he doesn't say here](http://seekingalpha.com/author/julian-cox) if he owns shares or not- I'm guessing he does) but no one questioned his financials on that thread called \"[The Fuel Cell is a big lie](http://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/27b0r3/the_fuel_cell_tech_is_a_big_lie/)\". Why is that?",

"comment": "Nope. Zero is using Farasis NMC cells according to this:\nhttp://electricmotorcycleforum.com/boards/index.php?topic=4280.0\n\nAt the cell level, that's 185 Wh/kg according to the manufacturer:\nhttps://evmc2.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/fei-datasheet-imp06160230p25a-pouch-25ah-v5.pdf\n\nThat's a far cry from the roughly 270 Wh/kg NCA+graphite/Si cells used by Tesla. However, the pack structure is less intense and doesn't have liquid cooling. At the pack level, it gets closer to Tesla's pack, although the setup is a bit different. You replace the entire pack on a Tesla, while in the Zero, you can replace each module. At the module level, the Zero is around 150 Wh/kg, while the Tesla at the pack level is around 160-165 Wh/kg. Again, there is a big difference in thermal management.",

Mitigating that is one of the key aspects of the series as well as maximizing the use of the energy that is available to them.  Season 5 of FE will have a new battery as well as a single car for the entire race so IMO they are still basically at the peak of what they can squeeze out of the current tech.  I don't think FE could compete with an F1 until at least season 10 but my prediction is that F1 will eventually be fully electric and FE will end up being a feeder series.  F1 is and will always be the pinnacle of racing whether they run on ICE or BE.",

"comment": "I think people are confused about how the stock market works. The stock market doesn't change as things happen, it changes in anticipation of things expected to happen(in days/months/years), and values a company of how much the company is expected to be worth in the futureeee. \n\nLike for example many months ago Tesla might have been expected to break records again this quarter because its kind of a given, they've expanded into new markets and production numbers keep slowly sliding up. So months ago the stock price would have went up to match the expected record quarter. So when the quarterly numbers came out weeks or months after then if they did exactly as expected and reported a record quarter then the stock should barely change at all, right? But since not long ago a document was leaked that raised the expectations even higher because Elon expected 100k sales this quarter, then the stock prices went up as if they would sell 100k this quarter, but then it turns out they didn't sell 100k so the stock went back down in line with the last expectations. All that makes logical sense, it's not the stock market being dumb or a conspiracy against Tesla.\n\nSame reason why Tesla now is worth so much less than it was in 2017 despite selling like 10x as many cars. In 2017 Elon was saying how they'd be shipping 10,000 a week by the end of the year back then and therefore probably more like 15,000 a week by now and probaby have lots of profit coming in. But that didn't happen so the stock plummeted to levels in line with how many cars are actually being made.",

"comment": "&gt; Consider these cars as disposable - give them a five to eight year life span and go from there.\n\nThis seems kind of counter intuitive to going green to me, especially as OP is seemingly concerned about the environment enough to install solar and want to swap an ICE car for an EV.\n\nWe've already seen that electric cars are quite capable of very high mileage with little repairs, as there are quite a few Tesla taxis with 400k+ miles on them and they've been much cheaper than ICE cars to get to that distance, and who knows how much longer they'll last? \n\nI feel like there is a lot of hypocrisy in the EV space where people will act like they're saving the planet by buying a new EV on a 3 year lease, and at the end they just chop it in for a brand new one, even though they've only driven say 20k miles or whatever. Now to be clear, that's still better than doing the same thing with an ICE car, and you are also advocating for buying a second hand car as well, so that's good, but I still feel like it's a little wasteful. \n\nI don't know much about people replacing the batteries with aftermarket ones, but I'm sure in 5-10 years it'll be a lot more common as we start to see these current crop of EVs drop out of warranty and enthusiasts who are keen to fix them without paying for the manufacturer markup get stuck in. Surely if the car is still reliable and capable of more mileage it would make more sense to recycle the current battery, stick a new one in and put another 100-200k on it? \n\nI'm sure you'd be giving up modern features, but I know I'd personally rather make more environmentally friendly decisions and give up a few fancy new features.\n\nWould be interested to hear what you think.",

The highlight was the hydrogen-based fuel cell concept truck Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck. It should be able to drive around 1000 kilometers (km) on one tank of fuel. Daimler Trucks relies on liquid hydrogen at -253 degrees Celsius.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Daimler Trucks also gave an outlook on a purely battery-electric long-haul truck that should be ready for series production by 2024. The E-Actros LongHaul should cover trips on plannable routes in an energy-efficient manner. Its range on one battery charge will be around 500 kilometers. The battery-electric E-Actros for distribution transport, which was presented in 2018, will go into series production from next year. The range of the prototypes of around 200 km is expected to significantly exceed the series counterpart.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***New modular platform architecture as the basis for future electric series trucks***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The technological basis of all future CO2-neutral, fully electric series-production trucks - regardless of whether they are battery-electric or fuel cell-powered - will be a new global modular platform architecture: the E-Powertrain.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The pulling power, range and performance of the GenH2 should be on par with the conventional Actros with diesel engine. With a total weight of 40 tons, it should offer a payload of 25 tons. Two special liquid hydrogen tanks and a high-performance fuel cell system should enable the long range.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Daimler Trucks prefers liquid hydrogen because of its higher energy density. The vehicle has stainless steel tanks with a capacity of 80 kilograms. In the series version of the GenH2 Truck, the fuel cell system is supposed to deliver 2x150 kW, while the battery will also provide up to 400 kilowatts (kW) for accelerating and braking for a limited time. The storage capacity of the battery is relatively low at 70 kilowatt hours, since the battery is mainly to be switched on to provide situational power support to the fuel cell - for example during load peaks during acceleration, when driving fully loaded uphill or when overtaking. The two electric motors are designed in a pre-series version for a total of 2x230 kW continuous and 2x330 kW maximum output. The torque is 2 times 1577 Newton meters (Nm)*",

But, we are in a time of high inflation, labor and supply chain shortages, and just generally stuff costing more. I suspect you are seeing market rate for your area today. You did the right thing - you got multiple quotes, and they are all coming back in a pretty tight range. You might be able to find someone cheaper, but I'd then be questioning why they can do it cheaper when nobody else will.\n\nIf you wait will prices go down? Maybe - but they might also go up. I suspect with the utility rates in So Cal, you will still have a pretty good payback.\n\nBest,\n\nCraig",

"comment": "I'm gonna disagree.\n\nWith the \"Big Three\" of US-based car makers on NACS, everyone else will be under immense pressure to fall in line.  Pragmatically, charging networks will have to add NACS plugs to their stations or die.  And politically, it'll become impossible for the US Govt to subsidize a charging standard used only by foreign car makers.  Whether NACS is \"truly open\" or not, they simply won't be able to toe that line.\n\nAnd even if they did, it wouldn't matter all that much.  The NEVI rules already allow funded stations to include NACS alongside CCS Type 1.  And although NEVI money seems like a big deal right now, several billion dollars, it's really a drop in the bucket compared with what will ultimately be spent building out charging infrastructure across America.  Even if the federal agencies never changed their stance at all, it wouldn't in any way prevent NACS from taking over.",

Especially in an area like EVs that definitely have their drawbacks if someone isn’t informed/prepared and just expects every day to be the same as owning an ICE. \n\nBut, hopefully it all works out, and maybe their sister isn’t the type to be that way even if there are issues. You hope most people are reasonable enough to understand that sometimes an issue happening to you isn’t the same as it being common, but my time with the public has shown that to often not be the case.",

"comment": ">To me, that is precisely fanaticism.\n\nI think it's more that the factual reasons I pointed out (and let's be honest, Musk's very public antics) have soured people on Tesla. So while you're right that a random tech bozo's opinion isn't really news or relevant, I think a lot of that is just people laughing at someone shitting on the company they already don't like (for largely legitimate reasons).\n\n>Are you suggesting all of the engineers on the project recognize it as futile but keep improving it anyway?\n\nNot at all. They are working on it because that's their job, and because that's what their bosses are telling them to do, largely because that's what's going to keep the stock price high. Engineers don't decide what they work on; they work on what they are told to work on. \n\nApple had plenty of talented engineers working on their self driving car right up to the point that they pulled the plug on it. Many of the various Hyperloop boondoggles had teams of passionate, skilled engineers working on it right up to the last minute.\n\nFor reference, I *am* an engineer, and I've worked on a *ton* of projects that I and everyone working on them knew were doomed from day 1. That's *very* common. Even more common is starting a project thinking something might be plausible, and discovering it isn't after you've sunk a ton of resources into it. Sometimes you try to come up with a way to explain to the big brain executives why what they're asking for is impossible, and sometimes (particularly if you work for Elon Musk), you just do what you can and update your LinkedIn page regularly. \n\n>The much more plausible description is that the problem is hard, harder than they imagined, but they believe it to be possible to deliver autonomous driving safer than the average human driver.\n\nBelieving something is possible, and believing it's possible in a reasonable timeframe with the hardware they have access to are two very different things. I don't necessarily think it's *impossible* to make a car that can drive as well as our better than a human, but I also don't think Tesla or anyone else is even remotely close to pulling it off.\n\n>I strongly disagree with this framing. Having used FSD Beta, I know its current state requires vigilance on behalf of the human driver. Anyone using this around me is far less dangerous to me and my car than the hundreds of distracted drivers I encounter daily.\n\nYou're not going to convince me of this one, sorry. Allowing non-test drivers to fiddle around with an experimental system which steers, accelerates, and brakes for them *on uncontrolled streets* is reckless to the point of being unethical. Particularly because they know that people aren't going to use it as intended, because the intended use isn't actually very useful: what is the point of a car that drives itself, but requires constant vigilance from the driver?\n\nIt has already killed a number of people, and while most of them weren't using it as intended, the fact that it's still even enabled on random people's cars is *insane.*\n\n>Any credible car reviewer has pointed out that the Cybertruck is weird, quirky, kinda cool, kinda compromised. But no credible review I've seen has called it a clusterfuck.\n\nThe clusterfuck here isn't that the car is unusable, or even that it's particularly bad all things considered; the clusterfuck is that it was years late and hugely over budget because they deliberately made a number of absolutely nonsensical design choices *for no other reason than Elon Musk thought it would be cool.* The fact that it works as well as it did is a testament to the talent of the people working on the project, but that doesn't make up for the absurdly and deliberately compromised design.\n\nI'm not going to get into the exact reasons the choice to make the body out of very thick, extremely hard stainless steel was ridiculous, but as someone who works with stainless sheet, believe me: there are a lot of reasons no one else does that. I mean shit, they didn't even deburr the panels; you can cut yourself on the door if you're not careful. The wonky tires eat themselves. The frunk will *cut your fucking fingers off* if you aren't careful. It didn't ship with the firmware to lock the diffs. With the amount of money and time they spent on that, they *could* have designed something genuinely good... but because of the way the company is structured (namely with Musk involved), what we got instead was *this.*",

So in the end, this looks like it financially benefits noone. Property owner doesn't benefit from reduced energy costs, renter doesn't benefit from reduced costs, same amount of energy used overall, and now thereare also solar panels on the roof. So other than promoting the advancement of renewables, all other benefits are negated?",

"comment": "We're on the same page on the nanny-state issue. But I'm really baffled that you are so concerned about CO2. I can tell that you're serious, you are genuinely worried about the effects of CO2 on climate. As far as I'm concerned, I think CO2 has *some* greenhouse warming effect, but it appears that the feedbacks are rather negative (warmer surface &gt;&gt; more ocean evaporation &gt;&gt; more clouds &gt;&gt; more radiation from the sun reflected back to space &gt;&gt; cooler surface). The climate sensitivity to CO2 (the number that describes the relation between CO2 amount and warming) is highly debated - that's one reason why most models overestimated the warming.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of IPCC, the IPCC was founded with the explicit goal of researching **man's contribution** to global warming. That's it. They research only the possible anthropogenic causes! No money is allocated for the study of other possible causes! And you know how it is, if you give me some money to find something, I'll find it :-) If you torture the data long enough, the data will confess.\n\nYou'd be surprised how many prominent skeptics used to be global warming/climate change champions in the past. Even people on this sub have solar panels, some are off the grid completely, I for one don't even own a car at the moment, ride an electric scooter to work.

Recently I've seen press from Green Mountain Energy about similar programs, to pick just one example.\n\n&gt;  In places like DC with high land costs you are not going to have utility scale installations, but larger community scale (size of commercial but with distributed virtual net metering).\n\nTrue. Already in CT there is a lot of \"buzz\" about the how the relatively small amount of solar farms is impacting the already dwindling agricultural economy. For locavores it is especially concerning.\n\nBut in other places like GA where the utility scale solar dwarfs everything else, land is plentiful especially in the areas that may be better suited for solar like the southern half. Very low population density and many landowners/farmers are excited for the revenue, whether from lease or sale.",

"comment": "It should be pointed out that studies about home equity and value have progressed over a decade or more, and some corroborating work was done by real estate related associations. So the trend that buyers will pay more for a home with solar (owned not leased) is true through repeated studies across that time frame. As with many cultural trends, that tendency grows in time. So some report it is easier to find a buyer who will value it than it was 2, 4, or more years ago.\n\nThe caution is that it is market dependent. So states that have the least solar installations and awareness, it may be that fewer buyers are aware or value it. But even in states like Ohio the data supports the conclusion about value. (Caveat: there are a number of factors like age of the system, whether net metering circumstances are changing or will change, etc.).",

But why can't you give one?\n\nOf course, it's easy for me will to answer the converse of my question: what if I am wrong and climate change is not real? The answer is that we still clean up the environment and have many non-economic benefits (decreased dependence on foreign oil, for one, as well as the ability for individual people to become more energy independent through their use of things like solar power).\n\nOf course, you could argue that it could be a big waste of money. But if the entire globe were all making major changes, we'd all be operating within the same economy and the \"losses\" would be universally shared (and thus, none of us would actually feel the losses).",

"comment": "Just a thought: Not all solar installations are created equal.\n\n1. All black panels. Ex: Some sunpower panels http://highnoonsolar.com/images/r-f-gj_7.56.jpg/image_preview\n\n2. Tight racking, and centered and squared off arrays also really help to look nice. (can be seen in the above photo as well).\n\n3. Here is a photo to contrast that type of installation. These have lines all over the panels and detract from the sleekness. http://www.solarcity.com/sites/default/files/ssr-gallery-05.jpg\n\n4. Conduit. Where the conduit runs is also VERY asthetically important. Here is an example of a VERY VERY poor conduit run (I gagged when I saw this) http://www.crodog.org/solar/conduit2.jpg\nhere is another bad, but more common, example : http://vig.extremetech.com/media/images/185515-roof-wiring-conduit.jpg\n\n5. The conduit problem above can be avoided with technology like this. http://www.quickmountpv.com/products/images/prodImg1-CPC-lrg.jpg Which allows the conduit to run UNDER the installation and into the home, while maintaining a tight water seal. (if dont property it will NOT violate your roof warranty)\n\nOverall: I think if you could see what nice sleek panels, that were evenly organized, that were all black and with tight racking and had conduit that ran under instead of around, you would end up pretty happy. Most homeowners I have talked to just assume all installations look as sloppy as an installation from a company like Solar city. I can assure you, they are not.\n\nIf that still does not satisfy you then you have only the option to put it on the back, or on the ground (if you have a lot of space).",

"comment": "I'm advocating destroying capitalism, actually. \n\nHowever government regulations and incentives have lead to things like the development of solar panels when they weren't cheap, and continuing research on the subject when it wasn't cheap and people never believed it would work, and continuing research to make it more efficient and cheaper until now when it's cheap enough that the market suddenly loves the idea. Without public investment and work for the common good rather than private profit we would not have cheap solar panel tech.\n\n&gt;then what incentive does a corporation have to ignore/skirt regulations?\n\nI don't understand this logic. Without regulations what incentive does a corporation have to treat their workers fairly? It took labour unions decades of literally dying in the fight for worker's rights legislation for businesses to even budge on the topic. Corporations very rarely even consider working for the public good - and when they try they are sued to the supreme court by their shareholders and it is decided that the business has a fiduciary duty to deliver profit instead of public good.\n\nThe profit motive is inherently inefficient, inherently short-sighted, and inherently damaging to all living things on this planet, and the environment itself.",

"comment": "&gt; hmm I think they don't. Looks like they shut down net metering in 2015. \n\nThat is OLD news.  it was temporarily shut down then reopened on neighborhood by neighborhood basis depending on the solar load on each leg of the distribution network.  Then opened for smart inverters.\n\nYou could always install a \"grid zero\" system though.   \nhttps://www.utilitydive.com/news/hawaii-rooftop-solar-installations-tumble-after-net-metering-changes/440011/\n\nThe point is still Does your girlfriends parents have a net metering contract?   Can you get one?\nIf not then you need to look at a grid zero system.\n\nhttps://www.hawaiianelectric.com/clean-energy-hawaii/integration-tools-and-resources/locational-value-maps\n\nIf you go with grid zero then is most of your load during the day time?  if so you have no need for a battery system.   You can get a system without batteries that can regulate to prevent back feeding such as any SolarEdge or Enphase inverter system (there are others as well).   If your load is more irregular (spikes) or you want to offset your night time loads then a bimodal system with batteries.   These systems cost considerably more though.",

But like I said, there are other use cases, and the range is a bonus. It's also a different tradeoff. You get the range without as much weight or volume.\n\nIt's a given that it's a vanity and PR item at the moment. That's all down to cost. It doesn't make rational sense. But you could've said that about the Tesla Roadster too in a way. The question is what it leads to in the end. There's nothing in physics that says solar panels have to be expensive.\n\nIn addition to PR, I would consider it R&amp;D.",

And the government would not be putting in recharging stations, or subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles. I'm perplexed what I'm not getting.

"comment": "I'm by no means an expert, but it seems to me that this will be far more trouble and significantly more cost than it would be worth. Your link was just to a single solar panel, not your list, so I don't know what you've been looking at, but a good place to start to get a rough idea of what is needed would be to look at the small off-grid kits that are available (eg. [this small 320W system](https://www.wholesalesolar.com/1890100/wholesale-solar/complete-systems/weekender-320-w-ac-2-panel-solarland-off-grid-solar-system)). As you can see, there's quite a number of components that are required, not to mention the additional wiring work needed to have an outlet in your home connected to the solar system. And this system, which costs $1350, most likely isn't sufficient to power your desktop as it only generates 300W continuous power (and that's only during peak generation), so you would actually need something more like this [$3670 system](https://www.wholesalesolar.com/1891434/wholesale-solar/complete-systems/weekender-640-w-ac-4-panel-solarland-off-grid-solar-system).\n\nYou would also need a battery storage system at considerable additional cost because I'm sure that you will want to run your computer even when the sun is not shining.\n\nAll this to show that a solar system just to run your computer isn't very practical. The cost of such a system would be considerably more than the cost of electricity to run the computer over its lifetime. If you're serious about solar, you should probably consider a house solar system that will help offset some of the electrical usage in your entire house.",

"comment": "NV Energy has both a Tiered and a TOU option for Net-Metering residential customers, and the TOU option has an EV rider. The TOU option features a massive $0.436/kWh rate for summer on-peak, and is around $0.05/kWh or $0.06/kWh, and for EV the rate is about $0.005/kWh cheaper. Summer on-peak hours are from 1pm to 7pm for option A, and EV Hours are 10pm to 8am. Summer months are June through the end of October.\n\nWhat this means is that if you can limit energy usage from 1pm-7pm and generate a boatload of energy that you can sell to the grid, you'll be able to offset a lot of your bill (like 80-90%) with a smaller system (offsetting 50-60% of your energy usage) even with the Tier 2 NMR-405 policy. I'd suggest starting with a more conservative system with the potential to expand. Among your quotes, Company C fits that bill the best since it's easier to add more panels with microinverters rather than string inverters. Skip the north-facing panels unless your roof is pretty flat.\n\nIf you're going to be getting home around 5pm or so, then this is a little more iffy. You could look into pre-cooling the house from 12-1pm if it's sufficiently well insulated, not sure if it'll stay cool for the next 5 hours. I'd say don't bother with storage just yet, it's something that can be retrofit on later and the regular tiered rates look like a good option.\n\nSpeaking of the tiered vs TOU rate, NV Energy looks like it offers a \"Time of Use Guarantee\" - which says that if you end up paying more under TOU than if you had regular rate, they'll refund you the difference - see their Net Metering doc here:\nhttps://www.nvenergy.com/publish/content/dam/nvenergy/brochures_arch/about-nvenergy/rates-regulatory/np_netmetering_rates.pdf",

I ask because [Solar Power Rocks](https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/connecticut/#compare) says that a 7.5 kW system should cost $15,400 after the state rebates and federal tax credits.   \n\nAlso, your $105 monthly cost is not consistent with your 10 year, 2.99% financing.  A $15,000 loan for 10 years at 2.99% has a monthly payment of about $145.",

"comment": "Imo, I think there are many factors involved. We can not deny that a lot of that stagnation is coming from America, as at a federal level we have yet to really acknowledge climate change as the threat it is. We really do have to keep fighting for 2020 to put someone in charge who has ambitious climate goals that can put us at the forefront of the revolution in becoming carbon neutral. Places like China, India, Europe and Africa are making changes to meet goals and there is a lot of innovation in that regard. If America truly joins the fight, there are many things that can be done, such as unite the world leaders and pool resources together to truly fight at a global scale like the problem is. \n\nInnovation is also getting faster exponentially. Beginning of the year people were laughing at renewables because of battery capacity and this month all I was reading about were breakthroughs in battery storage. Even regular people who usually don’t actively watch climate issues have begun to take up trends such as donating to tree planting non profits. We have systems deployed over the world to collect garbage from entering oceans. The coal industry is collapsing in on itself, which is one of the biggest contributors to warming. Prices of renewables are soon going to reach a point where many normal people can afford to purchase them for their houses or businesses because the money saved from electricity will offset the financing monthly payments. The revolution is coming despite the lackluster efforts of governments, and when we vote environmentally there is nothing we can’t do. Idc if some guy says we can’t hit 1.5 because we will try it anyway. Aim for the moon. Because we did that and we got there. It won’t be easy, we may fail to hit exactly 1.5 but we got nothing to lose by putting our all into it. Humans throughout history have overcame odds against us, and this will be no different. \n\nGet organized, take action, support people and causes that go forward to confront the problem head on. Shameless plug for Bernie Sanders if you’re American, if you’re not you can still phonebank for him (sorry mods if that’s not allowed.) We have a chance to stop the people causing this problem and we will either look back at this time as the biggest missed opportunity or the moment of pivotal change. All we can do is our best, so why not try?",

I wonder if more could be done with AI-guided design and metal foams, or if the airplanes of the future will use larger wings, slower speeds, and wingtop photovoltaics all as ways to save energy.  Large-scale consumer transit will not work on the energy density of incoming solar without falling all the way back to zeppelins, but if we're squeezing every drop of energyout of a design...\n\nLooking things up for the purpose of responding to your post, I found claims that the theoretical energy-density of lithium-air batteries (Li-O2) exceed that of aviation fuel.  2x energy density isn't necessary; equivalence should suffice.  That suggests at least that we're currently in the 3-5 years of labwork phase of your timeline.",

"comment": "Hi, I'm new to reddit and don't have the karma (I don't know what that is in this context) to post on the main solar page, but was told I could try here. So, here's the question I have:\n\nI've been searching through solar tax credit questions, but haven't found the answer I'm looking for. Trying to find a tax advisor, but looking for answers in the meantime.\n\nLooking to install solar on our property and finding the tax credits confusing. Someone explained them to me and I thought I had it all figured out, but then tried to fill out the tax forms as though we had done a solar project for 2019 and it got confusing again. So I'll lay out a scenario here and maybe someone has insight into it.\n\nYou work and pay taxes through your paycheck all year then go to file taxes. Your gross tax liability is $3,100. You paid out $3,500 in your paycheck. Normally you file and with regular credits (example: child credit) and you get a $2,400 refund. This year you bought solar and your credit is $5,800. So on your taxes your gross liability goes to $0. Now, I understand you carry over the unused $2,700 of your credit and can claim it the next year. All things being equal, your tax liability will go to $400 that year and back up to $3,100 the year after when your credit is used up. But what about your other credits? What is the refund check you receive from the fed? Is it the $3,500 you paid out? Or is it the $3,500 you get as credit for the solar, plus the $2,400 you would normally get as a refund for other credits?\n\nMy situation gets even more muddled because I work in a different state than I live. So I can claim a state tax credit as well. Given that I pay no taxes to my state all year, I always owe. Liability for the state is say $2,000, but after credits I actually only owe say $150. Same question applies here, do I get a refund from the state for the $2,000 or just not owe the $150?\n\nThanks to anyone with advice here.",

"comment": "Well, with the 7+, I would do the 335 or the 340 panels. Higher than that and you won't see any benefit. If the higher ones are on sale and happen to be cheaper, that would be the only reason I could think of.\n\nWith a 9000 kWh year roughly you will need around a 6.2 kW DC system (9000/365 days/5 sun hours/.8 efficiency). This is assuming net metering. You may decide to size differently depending on your goals. \n\nThat puts you at around 22 (6200/295) panels with the 7+. With SolarEdge you could get the higher wattage panels and potentially need fewer panels.\n\nAs far as SolarEdge is concerned, that puts you at the 6 kW inverter range. You could drop down to the 5 kW inverter for a higher ratio.\n\nNow, go to PVWatts, plug in your address with the various panel to inverter ratios and see if PVWatts says you will get your 9000 kWh. Adjust accordingly from there.\n\nThere may be other things to consider, like will all panels be facing the same direction, shading, etc. This will get you ball park though.",

"comment": "If you simply plug a UPS in to your panel and try to provide a voltage and frequency reference to your system it will either not work because all cheap UPS dont provide the proper sine wave, or would be dangerous and energize the lines from your house and would be illegal. You have to have a way to completely physically disconnect lines to the grid. This *could* be done with a manual transfer switch that would require you to go out and switch it between modes yourself and start the UPS, or with a standard system controller designed for it and would do automatic transfer switching.\n\n\n\nJust like with adding a battery, you will most likely need to install a new system controller for this. Either replacing what you have now, or place the new one in between the grid and your panel (or the main panel and critical load sub panel). The route you want to go would dictate which system controller you should be looking for.\n\nYou can either add one that connects to DC batteries, and then simply connect up 2-3 car batteries to the system. It wont have hardly any power in the batteries to keep the house going without the grid, but the main purpose is to simply provide a way for the house to continue running on solar and having a little bit of capacity to help you roll through a cloud passing by. Cost would probably be $3000-4000 and would keep things going as long as enough solar power is available.\n\nOr you could get a controller with a generator input and install a home generator somewhere. A basic gasoline generator is really cheap, like $1000 for one large enough to run the entire house. However, they are also expensive to run as gas costs a lot, and gas cannot be stored longer than 2-3 months so you would need to go fill up the gas tank on the genny during a time in summer when you know you could have a blackout coming. Or buy a more expensive one and run a natrual gas line to it so you dont have to worry about filling it up with gas. Cost for this would be about $4000-5000 for new controller, wiring, and generator and this would keep power on indefinitely as long as you had enough gas for the generator. This would really not be using the solar much or at all during a grid blackout. Sure the generator wont run as hard when there is 2-3kw of solar also available to use but youd still mostly be using generator power and not solar. Benefit is you keep power on all night if you need to and run the AC.\n\n\nYou could also buy a new Enphase controller, the sunlight backup controller, and load controllers. Place the Enphase system after your currewnt one, it wont matter and will simply see the power from your current system as solar energy just fine. The Enphase system would switch to its sunlight backup mode and provide house to the 6-8 loads on the subpanel connected to the load controllers. This would run as long as there is enough solar energy. Cost would be about $8000, so the most expensive option here and not really any better than option 1 is.",

"comment": "Note that 72 cell solar modules are exclusively used in large, utility-scale solar power plants. They are not made for residential systems. Small differences in efficiency can have a dramatic impact on the ROI calculations for a given plant or group of investors. Every single aspect of a large plant (equipment selection, output, revenue, interest rates, degradation, performance losses vs. system optimization) will be very carefully vetted before any bank financing is received. So yes, small differences in efficiency matter - especially when scaled up in larger installations - and can have a significant impact over the 25 year lifespan of a solar power plant.",

"comment": "So I'm supposed to believe that comparing solar power system to a vehicle is apples to apples? LOL \n\n\"Most cars are barely used a 5 years\" - LOL\n\nYou're not being serious are you?\n\nIs 20 years not near 15 years? \n\nThe other end of the high cost are the rate plans we're required to use just because we have solar. The power company jacks up rate during the late afternoon and evening when we would typically use more power. The also buy back the extra power we're generating at a fraction of the price they're selling us the power. \n\nSay at 4pm my system generates 5 more KWH than my house uses. That 5 KWH is transferred into the power companies system at $2.00 total. At 7pm we're cooking dinner and our solar system isn't producing power so we get the power from the grid and we have to pay $5 for that power because we're On-peak. At 8:01 pm that power would only cost $2.50\n\nIt's actually more convoluted than that and stupidly confusing. Which is of course on purpose. Why? Because the local power companies lose money when home owners install solar power.\n\nOn-peak hours from May 1 through October 31 consist of those hours from 2 p.m. \r  \nto 8 p.m., Monday through Friday, Mountain Standard Time, excluding the holidays \r  \nlisted in Condition B below. On-peak hours from November 1 through April 30 \r  \nconsist of those hours from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., Monday \r  \nthrough Friday, Mountain Standard Time, excluding the holidays listed in Condition \r  \nB below. All other hours are off-peak.\n\nIt's actually more beneficial for home owners to upgrade their A/C systems, windows, appliances, insulation and door seals then to install solar.",

Is there a way to provide more chargers, and what are the possibilities for making the stops more attractive, simplifying the charging, making it more reliable and attractive?\n\nA simplistic view might say that a stop at 75-200 from major centers would be a suitable location, but is there enough electrical supply to such?

"comment": "Try [Project Solar](https://projectsolar.com/), their online tool will give a pretty decent ball park price. Honestly, I think this pricing is high. I would want to be closer to the $2.00/Watt. I ended up using my Project Solar quote to get better local bids. \n\nFinancing solar is currently not easy, you either pay an extra 15-30% of your system cost in an upfront fee( usually your installer pays it, it just gets carried over to you) or you have a higher interest rate. \n\nI prefer no upfront fee and a higher interest rate, since you can always pay down early, saving you interest, but you aren't getting that upfront fee back no matter what. \n\nClean Energy Credit Union does solar loans (4-6% APR, no heavy upfront fees), but they switched to a authorized installer only program, meaning your installer would have to be registered with them already. Look for alternate ways to fund your solar panels outside of the installer, it usually ends up being cost effective. \n\nI would definitely get at least 1 more quote, if not 3 more.",

I say this because, if they were working for you, they would have spent about ⅓ if their time discussing your financial goals and options to achieve those. \n\nYour loan principal is high because the lender tacked on about 30%-40% in dealer fees.\nIf you are going to pay it back slowly, this is kinda ok. \nIf you're going to pay back this loan ASAP, you would want a different loan that has a higher interest rate (often 11% apr) because you wouldn't want to pay that dealer fee.\nIf your payback strategy is mid-length (7-10 years), more involved math would be needed to determine your best possible option.\n\nBasically, you spoke to a company rep who's job requires them to convince you to go to them. Look for a broker or consultant who will work on your behalf.",

"comment": "* It used underpaid / overworked foreign labor to create a huge transfer of wealth from the Western customers up to executives / owners / shareholders.\n* It allowed corporations to use a loophole to keep money offshore to avoid paying US tax on it.\n* It hurt Western jobs in many industries that were moved from the US to China.\n* It lead to a huge trade deficit.\n* It added emissions, given that China has been vastly increasing their coal based energy generation to fuel their massive manufacturing growth to supply Western nations...\n* How about the lack of regulation in China, which has lead to all sorts of things getting dumped into waterways?\n* It's certainly lead to overconsumption around the world...\n* It's lead to a weakening of workers rights in Western nations. Everyone blamed the unions for economic ills, when in reality the government opened the door to free trade with lower wage nations, against union wishes, and the corporate heads walked through it.  Shall we mention how many hours those low wage workers are essentially forced to put in every week?  How many days off they get?  How much vacation time and paid leave they get?\n* It lead to multiple state level market manipulation schemes.  Like dumping steel to kill the US steel industry.  Dumping solar panels to kill the solar industry.  Now last I checked, they're trying to swamp the world with Chinese made EVs.\n* Meanwhile, we've massively strengthened the Chinese' standing in the world, giving what's essentially a dictatorial government who cares very little about human rights far more power to influence the world and humanity.\n\nBTW, this isn't just a Chinese problem.  It's a problem of Western governments allowing free trade with significantly lower wage nations without mechanisms (such as tariffs) to even the labor cost playing field.  It's a problem of corporations replacing well paid / well treated Western employees with low paid / overworked labor in low wage nations.  This practice always leads to a transfer of wealth up from Western customers to the super rich without any mechanism to re-distribute that wealth back into the middle class.\n\nNormally when you employ people locally, a larger chunk of the revenue that company gets from selling products goes to the worker.  That worker spends the money back into the economy.  My spending is their income.  Their spending is my income.  The CEO makes a moderately higher paycheck than their employees, not the 300x+ that they do today.  The stock is kept at realistic levels.\n\nUsing low wage labor to drive down labor costs, but maintaining a high price tag in the wealthier nation, means less money is going to the workers, and more is cycling up to the rich without a mechanism (like a higher tax rate on the rich) to bring it back down to the middle class.\n\nIt's also a problem of these actions weakening the voice of Western workers in government, and strengthening the voice of corporate heads.  Who has the money and who can afford to do most of the lobbying and campaign finance?  The workers or the ultra rich companies headed by the ultra rich executives and shareholders?\n\nBTW, I hope no one here has something against the low paid foreign laborers.  We all just humans, baby.  I should hope we all have a problem with them being exploited to facilitate the transfer of wealth from the middle class Westerners up to the rich, making them ultra wealthy, while simultaneously empowering bad actors that make the world a terrible place to live.... or worse... cause catastrophic climate change that could devastate humanity.",

"comment": "I had my 13.5kW system with 2 powerwalls installed by Tesla 4 years ago. I financed mine and pay $265/mo for the loan. I got a 5 year locked in rate of .11c/kWh with 1:1 net metering.  The highest electric bill I've gotten was after the 2021 snowmageddon event in Texas. Otherwise, it's been under $10. I've paid less than $600 total for electricity over the last 4 years. \nMy experience with Tesla has been great so far. They actually contacted ME last month to inform me there was a problem with my system before I even noticed. They replaced it a week later. You may be better off with a local installer in the end, but I'd look at Tesla's pricing to get a good comparison with local quotes. \nAs others have said, do not lease, but you still have to do your research and ask for local customer references. My next-door neighbor just had a system installed but never asked me about mine. I didn't have the heart to tell him he paid twice as much for a smaller system with no battery backup. There are many YouTube videos explaining the pitfalls to look out for. Watch as many as you can before calling an installer.",

"comment": "> Effectively making the cost of ownership of an EV close to 0.\n\nThat's absolutely not right. \n\nUsing a friend's Model 3 as an example (based in Sydney), you're looking at over a grand a year in comprehensive motor insurance (that was before the last couple of years of large hikes as well, so probably nearer 2k now), along with ~$500 in comprehensive CTP insurance, and ~$400 in Rego. \n\nYou're saving on fuel, and rooftop solar saves 25c/kW, but rooftop solar or not, you're staring down thousands each year before even getting to consumables like tyres. \n\nThen factor in the fact anyone doing a lot of daily driving is likely taking the M2, M4, M5 or M7 to work, and you've got double the fuel cost in tolls. Then if you're working anywhere in the Sydney CBD, you're looking at a minimum of $14 per day for earlybird all day parking (if you arrive before 8am). \n\nThere's a tangible saving for an EV if you're doing big km still, but it's a fraction of the yearly ownership costs. Once we factor in depreciation over the last few years, those savings are pretty much wiped out.",

"comment": "Fact #1. \n\nEMP and CME have different effects and should NOT be compared. \n\n\n\nFact #2. \n\nNeither one will effect small scale solar. \n\nWhen EMP was the 'Boogie Man' (from science fiction, emphasis on 'fiction') through the 80s into the 2000s the military did billions of dollars of research... \n\nThe conclusion was LONG runs of wire were susceptible to magnetic induction pulse surges. The recommendation was local power grids consisting of solar PV and wind generators which are virtually impervious to EMP/EM. \n\nIf you are the observant type, you might have seen the solar fields and wind generators going up around military installations since then. \n\nThe magnetics lab at FSU has a crap ton of factual information on line about several of these studies.\n\nFact #3. \n\nIdiots, misinformation & intentional disinformation...\n\nWhole the myth is an EMP or CME will fry everything electrical, or it will fry ev we rything with a computer chip... Like in science FICTION... \n\nConsider a few facts...\n\nSince the advent of sailing ships, \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (light or plasma balls) have been observed. On metal aircraft it's somewhat still common, and the aircraft have electrical systems designed to handle it.\n\nFrom the 50s to the 80s, when RADAR was being developed for strength/power of signal, it disrupted aircraft and ground vehicle electronics. This has all been accounted for... Including 'micro-chips' and their support hardware. \n\n.....\n\nRemember, small civilian aircraft and large commercial aircraft fly through the same RADAR signals as military aircraft... \n\nIm the 80s automotive manufacturers had their own issies with computers for electronic fuel injection. Your alternator, starter, HVAC fan motors, and your power seat motors all put 'Signal Noise' onto the micro electrical grid of your vehicle...\n\nThe alternator alone makes a MUCH larger transient magnetic field than an EMP or CME, \n\nAND, it's INSIDE the metal shielding of the body of the vehicle with thw wiring harness... \n\nThis took about a decade of figuring out you need a reliable, uninterrupted NEGATIVE path back to the battery rather than a 'Chassis Ground' screwed to sheet metal, you should NOT run SWITCHING high current wires next to low current sensor wires (induction issues), etc. \n\nThere was also the foreign concept of SHEILDED low voltage sensor and control wiring, which they eventually learned from the computer industry...\n\nBrush/commutator motors make an 'On/Off' line noise, which 'Digital' wiring 'Sees' as a digital signal. Alternators used to surge on start up, which sensors and ECMs 'saw' as a huge voltage signal/incorrect input, and ECMs saw as a voltage surge... \n\nPersonally, I made a lot of money about that time keeping those vehicles running correctly since I knew about impedance, reluctance, induction, resistance, etc. \n\nFact 4.\n\nIt takes about 5 minutes to find out that solar PV is impervious to EMP/CME but probably not why you think...\n\nEMP, the ONLY way to generate a strong enough EMP to smoke the wire traces in solar panels is a NUCLEAR DETONATION. \n\nIf you are close enough to that nuclear detonation for it to effect your panels, you are dead anyway from the gamma or neutron burst, the shock wave will destroy the panels. \n\nThe 'Boogie Man' is a high altitude burst, and that will NOT damage your panels. \n\nCME pushes around the earth's intrinsic magnetic field, moving magnetic lines, then they snap back into place. \n\nSince this CAN NOT induce (indiction) a large enough difference in voltage in a short DC circuit to effect anything, it's not a concern.\n\nThe telegraph had LONG runs of IRON (not copper) wire for the CME (Carrington Event) to act upon, and being iron wire the induction effect was amplified, you can read about the results... \n\nSo I guess if you have a long distance telegraph you use regularly, it's a concern...\nOr if you have extremely sensitive magnetic naval mines and early communications satellites you might have issues like in the 1968 & 1972 CME events...  But I have a ground based solar PV field, so I'm not effected (or worried).\n\nI did use metal conduit instead of plastic, just like the military recommended. Added magnetic and detection shielding... \n\nI shielded my (metal) inverter & battery boxes with sheet magnets (see fridge door advertisment magnets). Research finds a STANDING magnetic field is almost insurmountable for a transient magnetic field to penetrate, since even a WEAK standing field is many times stronger than a transient field will be. \n\nThink of it as 'EMP Kryptonite'... The same way military vehicle computers were 'EMP Proofed', with what's basically a pizza store advertisement. \n\nA 'Faraday Cage' found on BoobTube, thats a metal garbage can to the rest of us... Is METAL, a magnetic field absorbing shield for electronics... \n\nThese same 'BoobTube Degree' *engineers* also put batteries (chemical energy) into their (not a) 'Faraday Cage' which makes no sense since magnetic fields have zero effect on chemical energy... So it's worth exactly what you paid for it... Science Fiction with no understanding of actual science.",

"comment": "I hope I haven’t been that toxic voice in this forum, but after dealing with coal rolling diesel heads, I know my tone can get a little aggressive. Apologies. Did you see that EV solar camper van from the Netherlands? So instead of inefficient massive powered pickup lugging a camper, this is a light teardrop RV whose all solar roof extends when parked to almost 3x the roof space. It went the equivalent of Netherlands to bottom of Spain without an external charge.  No it’s not a production vehicle yet, but it’s an interesting take on filling that use case. I love to see innovation that changes how we think about solving the problem. One issue I have with the world that petroleum built is that we got lazy in our thinking because there was always more power to burn. The limitations breed creativity, and creativity is fun!",

As I've said, I don't think killing animals is inherently wrong/abhorrent/immoral (as long as suffering is avoided as much as possible) Clearly you do.\n\nI'm mostly concerned with how an animal lives its life up until the point of slaughter. I wouldn't wish a lifetime of confinement and malnutrition (factory farming) on any living thing but I think that a relatively painless death after a healthy, happy life is perfectly reasonable. I also think that giving an animal food, shelter, and a place to roam represents a perfectly natural and symbiotic relationship.\n\nI'm a vegan because I can't accept *unnecessary* suffering. I don't align myself with the prevailing animal rights philosophy of /r/vegan. I don't think that raising animals for their flesh is unethical. I just personally believe there are too many questions involved for me to feel satisfied eating meat I purchased in a store. I would have to see the farm for myself and have a long chat with the farmers. As I live in the middle of Brooklyn at the moment, that's not a journey I have the time or energy to undertake.\n\ntl;dr I don't believe it's wrong to kill animals humanely for their meat. Sorry.",

"comment": "My husband turned to me one day and said, \"I think I want to go vegan.\" That was when he was still eating hardly anything but meat, eggs, dairy, and a bit of bread. I didn't think it would last, but I thought it was really awesome of him to try so I decided to do it with him in support. I had read up a lot about animal treatment and I knew I didn't agree with it and wasn't sure what I was o.k. with, but I didn't think I'd be able to make any big changes alone with Mr. Meat-eater being the primary cook here. We gave ourselves Thanksgiving off because that was really soon after and we didn't want to get killed by the in-laws, but otherwise we've been good. So, we pretty much went from meat-eaters to vegan (including no other animal products, too, best as we can). Here we are nearly two years later and we're both still vegan. It was easier than we thought. It took a bit of willpower, but we watched Earthlings (available free online) and that really sealed it for us. \n\nYes, it's wrong to eat free range organic eggs and dairy. Those animals are still exploited, still killed, and still live pretty awful lives. They're slaves. They're forcibly bred, children are stolen from their mothers, males are still killed super young, females are still killed when they slow in their production. It's not all grazing in big green pastures -- which often isn't even the case because labeling laws are so lax as to be near meaningless. But, bottom line, those animals can't consent to being used. It's exploitation and that's wrong. \n\nWhen we travel, we bring our own food a lot just so we never have to depend on someone else. I like to carry Earnest Eat granola planks in my bags. But there's plenty of stuff to eat at regular grocery stores and even gas stations. You'll learn that sort of thing over time. When I eat at others' places, I bring my own food or give them suggestions or we go out to eat. It's not so hard. People tend to be pretty understanding. And a lot of people these days have some other vegan friends. Sometimes you have to clear up misunderstandings -- like when people think honey or fish are vegan. But, offer to show them how to cook vegan stuff if they really want to cook for you.",

You can also use hemp protein, which is more expensive but has a complete amino acid profile, as well as your omegas. I go for the pea/rice with flax oil in my smoothies because it's cheaper - hemp is my treat. ;)\n\nAdditionally, nut butters of all types (I tend to burn out on PB) like hazelnut, cashew, and almond. Make sure you're getting at least two servings of beans and lentils a day - they will fill you up and provide you with protein and minerals. Quinoa is a great grain to use too, for stir fry, a base under veggies and beans, and in salad. Quinoa is a complete protein as well.\n\nOne of my usual meals after working out is a simple stirfry. I use tofu but you could use a 5-grain tempeh or seitan or whatever floats your fancy. I whip up a marinade/sauce for the tofu, and stir fry it with garlic, ginger, carrots, broccoli, bell pepper, and soba noodles. Filling, get yer veggies, and lots of protein.",

To the point where there is a movement to put nuns on birth control since breast cancer is considered an occupational hazard for them (due to the not having children part).",

You can still hang out and laugh and enjoy the love of friendship, but you just won't be participating in the same meals. You might get a few friendly jabs from people about it but 100% of the time (in my experience), it's just friends being little shits to each other. Besides, you get the satisfaction of sticking to your morality when you turn down the animal products that everyone else is having. Sometimes it's more awkward for them, since a lot of people (at first) think you're being deprived of pizzas or whatever, or they feel bad eating it in front of you. That goes away the more you hang out, trust. Good friends will understand and be supportive.\n\nAs a vegan in a very omni community, as long as you aren't harping at people for their choices and you're comfortable and confident with your own choices, maintaining friends shouldn't be a problem.",

My mom went Vegan about a year ago, and lately she has been getting really dizzy.  I am pretty sure she is anemic (Iron deficiency).  So your friend isn't wrong, while it is more healthy to be vegan if done correctly, you also have to do it correctly, which isn't easy.\n\nIron deficiency is a real thing.

Then this summer I watched Game Changers and felt similarly to what you posted. It was not until I watched Vegucated, the first documentary I saw that showed animal abuse footage, that I realized how things were in animal agriculture and finally decided to go vegetarian or vegan. Then I watched Dominion a few days later and that was it, full vegan for me. Nothing environmental or health-related impacted me nearly as much as the animal abuse footage. I don’t know how anyone can watch that and continue to use animal products.",

Most has beeswax or animal fat in it but you can make it yourself with soywax, or maybe look online for products not made from animal products then just apply it on whatever you want. Better for the environment too as it lasts super long and is all natural, unfortunately unlike a lot of vegan leather that is made from plastics.",

I once read that there's a huge barrier for vegan cuisine to enter class restaurants which is that for animal products you can practically upgrade the product for a higher price without any limit. I think the example is that you can keep adding 100$ to the price for a piece of meat and for a long while always get a \"better\" quality.\n\nWhere as vegetables don't have that kind of market. You reach the upper quality limit of carrots pretty quickly or there is just no infrastructure... you just won't get any carrots from France that were watered with I don't know french wine and them hand harvested... or some thing like that",

"comment": "It looks like other comments cover your questions pretty well, and I don't quite have anything to add to that part. However, I see that your friends have a set perception of \"somethin_else\" and \"how somethin_else behaves\" now and once you start to be more true to yourself there is a backlash because you are not fitting in to the kind of person that they think of you to be. You've noticed this in your post. \n\nSo keep that in mind. As you become more vocal, others who know you will perceive you as \"changing\" even though you've been feeling/thinking these things but chose to remain silent. If they have known you for a long time, that can be rather scary for them. They might, unknowingly, start feeling like they are losing you as a friend, or that other parts of your identity are changing as well. They might be afraid that the two of you won't be able to relate to eachother anymore. \n\nI suspect that they only think you're \"different\" than 'radical vegans' because your presence is not threatening to them. They can be around you and remain blissfully unaware. Once you start to bring veganism in to their awareness then it is a threat to them. You are at least partially aware of this because you mention them feeling like you are \"on their side.\" \n\nThey should definitely not be yelling at you or getting mad at you, personally. Nip this behavior in the bud. It is inappropriate adult behavior. The next time these things happen, calmly explain that you don't deserve to have them yell at you or treat you like that when you are their friend and you are trying to be considerate of their life choices. If they continue to yell at you, you must set a boundary and tell them that if they keep yelling at you then you will have to leave. If leaving feels too drastic to you, then reiterate that you do not appreciate the yelling and you do not deserve to be treated that way, and ask them to calm down. Then if they calm down you could encourage productive conversation... \"but, I don't want you to upset you guys, so maybe we can talk about what you're really worried about here. I'm still your friend\"",

"comment": "might not be able to eat at a restaurant but target has alot of stuff for vegans...\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.peta2.com/vegan-life/vegan-grocery-shopping-target/%3famp\n\neating at restaurant: alot of times restaurants have vegan items without them being a vegan friendly place. If you want mexican bean and rice burritos are often vegan, chinese restaurants often have alot of vegan options because they use tofu and vegetables and noodles alot (or even fried rice w/o egg) italian you can get spaghetti and most times their bread is vegan as well... fries are vegan. for breakfast hashbrowns / fruit / bagels / oatmeal are often carried... \n\nand if you want fastfood (idk where you live but some popular ones)\n\ncarls jr: beyond burger &amp; fries (w/o cheese &amp; no sauce / it is cooked on equipment that cooks meat so if you’re okay with that its a good option)\n\nblaze pizza / mod pizza / pieology : custom pizza places that all carry vegan cheese &amp; some vegan meats\n\nchipotle: sofritas substitute for meat ( a soy spicy “meat”) and whatever else you want thats not cheese or sourcream\n\ndel taco: plain bean burritos / also you can get the cali steak, substitute meat for beans , no sour cream and no cheese. fries\n\ntaco bell: crunchwrap supreme with black beans instead of meat and no cheese or sour cream, i think its called fresco style. their cinnamon twists are vegan. \n\nthese are just some ideas, you have to get creative when eating out. honestly most places started carrying vegan/vegetarian options now.  and don’t forget to always ask \n\ntheres things that are surprisingly vegan, for example oreos and unfrosted poptarts.. so dont be afraid to check the label even if it seems like it might have milk or eggs or something... do you have foods you like to eat ? id be able to help better if you knew what ur looking for / want",

"comment": "I totally get where you're coming from. When I first decided to go Vegan, I was met with some similar reactions as well. The most common were, \"You can't get enough proteins on that diet\", \"Animals eat each other\", \"Animals are placed on this Earth with the purpose of being eaten by us\", \"People evolved to eat animals\". There are a bunch of vegan debates that you can look up online. That's what really convinced me and solidified my stance logically. Most rebuttals that meat eaters throw at vegans aren't legitimate rebuttals anyways. Also, you don't need to justify your personal choices in the first place. As long as the acts that you're engaging in aren't harming anyone else, why bother having a debate? It seems really unnecessary to do so, unless your friends are just trying to inflate their own ego, in which case, you'd simply ask \"why do you care about my dietary choices?\".",
