"comment": "&gt;would it not be fair to discuss the benefits provided not only in the other direction, but from cheap energy as a whole to society at large?\n\n&gt;Is it your position that there is a much greater benefit to society as a whole than is reflected in the price at the pump?\n\nI've no disagreement about the progress humanity (and the U.S. in particular) has made in no small part due to the availability of cheap energy, as I pointed out before. However, we must recognize that despite all that cheap energy *has* done for us, if we continue to rely on those same sources of cheap energy *going forward*, and if we continue to socialize and/or delay their costs, what has been beneficial will become (if it hasn't already become) harmful.\n\n&gt;\"A subsidy is a form of financial or in kind support extended to an economic sector...\"\n\nYes, and if you read on into that \"...\" you'll see there's an entire section devoted to \"environmental externalities\" under \"types of subsidies.\" And to be clear, my idea of subsidy goes beyond even the list on that wiki page, with military costs related to ensuring our oil supply the most notable exception.\n\n&gt;The links you provided early tried to call a subsidy a lack of a tax. The two are not the same.\n\nA \"lack of tax\" is the same thing as a tax credit, which is precisely what EV buyers receive, so if that's not a subsidy, then EVs aren't subsidized either... :/\n\n&gt;but if you would like to move past that, I'm all for it.\n\nLet's! Whatever you want to call it, I think we can agree that the price of a gallon of gasoline is set not just by \"free market\" forces but by the influence of governments (but let's keep this U.S.-centric), whether through direct or indirect action (e.g. the programs you linked to, and military action, etc.), or through inaction (e.g. *not* taxing oil/gas enough to compensate for its deleterious effects on public health, the environment, property, and so on.)\n\nAnd of course for a fair comparison the same accounting needs to be done for the proposed alternative - in this case using electricity for transportation. Which leads us to...\n\n&gt;Sure. At present, [using electricity in lieu of gasoline] can't [achieve those same benefits with fewer negative externalities] though, so I am not sure why you identify EVs in particular\n\nSo now we get to the meat of the discussion! I knew you'd take issue with that **if**, and that's fine. But before we go there, I'm glad you agree that if the **if** is satisfied, that's a \"good thing.\" But would you then agree that government action (like the tax credit for EV buyers) is reasonable to promote such \"good things\", or do you think we should just leave it all to the \"free market\"?\n\nAnd now, to \"go there\": I previously alluded to the idea that trying to precisely account for the \"true cost\" of fueling our cars with oil is a tremendously difficult, if not impossible, problem. And doing the same for the alternative paradigm of fueling cars with electricity would be just as difficult. But there *are* true costs to each, even if we can only bound or approximate them.\n\nJust about any serious attempt at analyzing the costs of each paradigm (such as life cycle assessments of environmental impacts) puts EVs ahead by a significant margin, and the idea that EVs are more beneficial for the environment and for the national security and economy of the U.S. is what I'd consider \"generally accepted\" (after all, that's why our government has elected to put the EV tax credit in place.) So before I go off and find a bunch of links and so on to support that idea, and since this comment is already way too long, I'm curious to hear why you think otherwise.",

And all the battery tech in the works like lithium-air that will theroreticaly give several times the charge then EV are even more economical. And i think the makes sees that they done fucked up when it comes to innovation in this regard. \n\nTesla is like Apple when Apple released the først iPhone. It wasnt the først touch phone. But it was radicaly different and their aproach was something people wanted. Tesla is doing this in the automobile market but the old makers are to hessitent to go full EV and keep brining out hybrids.",

Their system is almost unsettlingly cheaper than other options and hopefully they didnt skimp to get to that price point but if they did not, this battery is definitely a game-changer.\n\nAlso powerplants are rated in watts, not watt-hours, because that is the more relevant unit to utilities as they need to know how much power is being supplied to the grid at any given time. This is why a 500 megawatt solar plant may seem equal to a 500 megawatt nuclear facility while in reality the nuclear plant produces far more energy.",

It seems to me like it would almost always make more sense to use a stationary battery pack rather than cycle a car's pack.\n\nControlling the load of the cars via wireless communication definitely makes sense, and I suspect Tesla implement a software update that adds this functionality sometime soon. It will be tricky to design software that controls charging times while minimizing inconvenience to owners as much as possible. But I think this will be greatly helped by the size of Tesla's battery compared to the average amount of energy it uses during a typical day.",

You know how the Chevy Bolt is coming out at the end of the year but there are already hundreds of them running around?  The first one came off the line back in March.  There's a whole validation process they are going through so that when the first one hits customer hands, its not riddled with issues.  \n\nTesla, honestly, has neither the time, money, or expertise to do the same.  What should have been pre-production test mules were instead immediately sold to customers with the idea that they would fix all the issues at the service centers after the fact.   It was a disaster, especially since all of those were in the $130,000 range.  Luckily Tesla has an extremely forgiving customer base.  If Caddy/BMW/Merc pulled anything like that, they would have been crucified.",

"comment": "PPA is a way for companies to make money by taking advantage of generous tax credits (aka, gov't money).  The difference is, instead of getting a gov't contract, they're getting the gov't money through other people.  General consumers are not always the most savvy so you end up with some good PPA agreements, and other not-so-good agreements.  The ones that hurt consumers (charge too much, too many restrictions, prevent houses from selling, etc) are the reasons why I think people don't like PPA.  The thing is, the tax credit is supposed to supposed to encourage solar consumption which is a general good thing (and it advances the industry -- which is the main purpose).  So, in the end, I'm not upset when someone gets a PPA, but the more financially viable a PPA is for a company, the more I want to see federal rebates scale back.  I want to see federal dollars spent on making the industry bigger so that economies of scale take over.  Unfortunately, I worry that we'll end up with another oil and gas subsidy in the future.  In my dreamy world, we'd scale back all of those energy subsidies a little at a time until they're gone and use the tax credits to promote the future of energy and not enrich businesses.  Not to say that there's anything wrong with enriching businesses, but the money shouldn't float an industry forever.\n\ntl;dr - PPAs are good if you get them for the right reasons and the PPA provider provides a fair (consumer friendly) set of terms.  They're getting paid.  That's not a bad thing, but lets not take advantage of people/gov't.",

Chevron and others have already started moving into other energy areas. They're not dumb. They have the money to do it, and as it makes more sense to change, then they will. The people who have this idea in their heads that oil companies are these old robber-baron dudes with twisty mustaches, sitting around a table, incapable of doing anything but selling oil to people... have no clue how big business works.

They lose $7,500 per car they sell so they're focussed on the compliance states rather than selling in the rest of the US. GM isn't going to make a RHD version of the Bolt so there's 40% of the world market ignored too. The rest of the car is pretty ordinary, but getting enough 60kWh batteries for the car is challenging. That's why Tesla built a factory (and will build more) just to supply their own demands for the Model 3. GM made a big noise about the Bolt but without batteries they're only capable of making a tiny fraction of the numbers that they could sell.\n\nI agree that GM makes crap cars, and they're unreliable, and that's how the dealers like it. Sell cheap crappy cars to people and you've got long term customers as they keep coming back for servicing and repairs. EVs are much more reliable and low maintenance so the dealers don't want them.",

By this standard the Bold and Ampera-E will be split up, too. I think this makes little sense, though. In both cases it's the same car.\n\n&gt;I'd like to see their source \ninformation, considering they run on a free blogspot blog doesn't exactly inspire confidence.\n\nI don't know their sources but I was checking different sites and it all looked OK. Their write ups and model overviews are pretty nice, too.\n\n&gt;The Bolt has barely started shipping worldwide, and so far in the US its beating the Leaf by good margins. \n\nMost products do better in the domestic market. You can't use US sales so highlight the strong sales of an American car. Just check sales numbers for the Zoe in France, the i3 in Germany or the Ioniq in Korea.\n\n&gt;It just seems to me that everytime a long range EV comes into the marketplace, it does really well.  I still respect the Leaf, but I definitely think it could do better with longer range in a day when when long range EVs are starting to come out more and more :) \n\n\nI agree, long range is important for strong sales. If the Nissan doesn't start offering a bigger battery in 2018, Leaf sales might drop. There is definitely more competition than 2 years ago.",

"comment": "I'm glad it works in the UK, if those companies make money; I guess the problem is solved.\n\nMy main concern with this approach (based on what I've seen here in Norway) is that charging stations like that will always cost more than home charging, i.e. when cars get enough range to virtually never use external chargers; they pretty much never will, making a hard business even harder. Hopefully these charging stations can be combined with restaurants etc. where people are willing to spend money; but as chargers become faster (&gt;350kW); that may also dry up.\n\nI've had an EV for almost 3 years now, and in that time I've spent ~ $40 on electricity from external chargers, other than the supercharger network (which are \"free\" or pre-paid); the rest I've charged at my house or public options..",

My local supermarket didn't carry brown rice pasta or gluten-free bread until recently, for example. Likewise, veganism is becoming mainstream and trendy, which results in more companies offering vegan options - there's money in it for them now. \n\nWhen I was growing up - early-mid 2000s -  the vegetarian section of the grocery store was just vegetables and like one kind of soy milk. Now there are almond, cashew, and coconut milks, as well as tofu, soy/coconut yogurt, black bean burgers, etc. It doesn't really matter if the expansion in vegan products is due to ethical/environmental/health concerns or just trendiness; the advancement is still made. If Tesla can make vegan leather cool, then that's a win in my book.",

"comment": "&gt; Like, for example, buying a house in the suburbs or 'country'\n\nI know I'm several days late to this discussion, but it bothered me enough that I felt compelled to reply. I think it's fairly revealing that you assume that the average person has the discretion to live wherever they want, or to buy a house in the first place. The cold reality is that the poorest of us have very little choice in where we live. People who work menial jobs in city centers often can not afford to live near their workplace. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, people living in very rural areas are would be effectively severed from society without a car. I was born and raised in a very poor, rural county in the southern US. When I was young, the nearest grocery store was 15 miles away. Years later, one opened up only 6-7 miles away, which we considered a godsend. For people living there, there is no public transport infrastructure, no Uber, no bike lanes. The only way people from my home county could give up their car would be if they completely left their life behind to move to a new city. However, most people do not have the financial cushion needed to move to a city, or are anchored to where they live because of family. For them, in order to give up their car, they would have to uproot, leave everything behind including any extended family or elderly parents who may depend on them, and start from scratch in a new city with no contacts. Even then, they would still probably only be able to afford to live in low-income apartments, which as previously discussed, are often far from any decent work. In that case, it's a toss-up if they have access to public transport infrastructure. If not, they're not working without a car.\n\nVeganism, though, is different. Virtually everyone can be vegan, regardless of socioeconomic restraints. It's a way that anyone can make a meaningful positive impact without having the drastically restructure their life. And yes, it really is just choosing beans over beef. Especially once you become aware of all the implications of that choice, it becomes an easy choice to make.",

The stock market isn’t a random draw, if you educate yourself and know a business you’ll do just fine. \n\nIn any case we’re way off track for a sub about EVs.",

Tesla reported Q3 sales numbers a few days ago, and while they don't break it down by month, the Q3 numbers are:\n\n    Q3 deliveries totaled 55,840 Model 3, 14,470 Model S, and 13,190 Model X\n\nSo that's 55k Model 3's sold in July, August and September with the most being sold in September according to intuition and other websites.  So 22k in September seems plausible.    And \"sold\" means that someone actually took delivery of the car.\n\nAs far as whether it's a luxury car, I don't know of a good definition of what makes a luxury car a luxury car beyond price.  Pigeonholing cars into categories based on features is a subjective decision.",

The justification is electric vehicles don't pay any gas tax that would normally go to road maintenance. The argument is fair, but the amount isn't IMO. I recall reading one analysis where it'd take a Civic or Corolla 15,000 miles to use have contributed $200 in taxes from gas. I think taxing tires or annual mileage would be fair; I already need to declare my mileage annually anyways when renewing my tag. I wouldn't mind pay $67 for the typical 5,000mi I drive in a year.",

You can't get both 120V and 240V from it unless you use the ground as a neutral. I don't think they'd do that for safety reasons.\n\nThere were some sources that said the 80A charging station is actually a CCS station (has the two extra DC pins) and has its own inverter, so it would be taking DC out of the battery and creating its own AC power. Definitely possible, but seems kind of wasteful to have an extra inverter when there's already one in the truck.\n\nAnother possibility is it pulls 240V out from the onboard inverter or charger, and then has an autotransformer to create 120V split phase from it.\n\nWe just need to wait for more info at this point. Unless something has come out in the past couple weeks since I last checked.",

"comment": "You have zero comprehension here. \n\nQ3 2021, Tesla had a GROSS margin of 30.5%. Holy cow, right? Only if you don’t understand the context. See, Tesla gets to count every retail dollar collected from the sale of their vehicles. This is “revenue”. Gross profit is Revenue less Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS), which is how we divide for Gross Margin. \n\nBut wait, since Tesla is the retailer, now ALL of the costs of selling that car is assigned to Tesla. All of those costs have to come off the GROSS profit line to calculate the NET profit line. All of the 188 properties they rent in the US to distribute and sell their cars. And every other cost of selling. Employees. Electric bills. Insurance. All of it. \n\nSo what does that look like? \n\nQ3 2021, Tesla had a NET margin of 11.76%\n\nWait, didn’t GM have a NET margin of 11%?? Yep. But they had a GROSS margin of only 20%!?? Yep, but their “sale” is wholesale. They have no retail expenses to come off their gross profits. That’s attributable to the dealers that assume that risk and expense. \n\nSo… Tesla’s distribution costs are NOT lower. They’re actually higher expressed as a percentage of sales, or per unit. Owning the retail distribution network costs Tesla money. They don’t do it to decrease costs or to increase profits. Tesla retails their own cars to control the retail experience off customers. It’s a great idea! But it doesn’t help their bottom line. Only their top line and GM. \n\nAnd so it goes for many of the other items on your list. They make their own seats!!! Cute, does that mean they cost less to make than if they simply contracted Lear or Recaro to make them? Likely not. They do it to control supply and quality and features. But it probably costs them more. And on down the line.",

Biomass, natural gas, and coal not only create more carbon emission in being converted to mechanical energy than their combustion alternative; they’re also very low efficiency conversions, meaning that—under our CURRENT energy sources—EV has lower end to end efficiency and higher carbon emissions than combustion. Which is bad enough already.\n2) EVs were not developed in a manner which allows them to be sourced, manufactured, and recycled/disposed of in any semblance of an ecologically sound manner. From child labor in lithium strip mines to a stunning and complete lack of environmental due diligence (like we’re seeing with the Michigan EV plants), the hazardous design of lithium ion batteries makes them dead on arrival in terms of any plausible alternative to petrol.\n\nThere are solutions to weaning off petrol. Lithium ion EV isn’t one.",

Those could and should be replaced with more efficient vehicles.\n\nThis doesn't mean you *have* to sell your car, you can have both to use what you need when you need it. Vehicles like motorcycles/mopeds are much are cheaper and cost less to run, so you'll make up the costs on gas anyway.\n\nSure, you can construct a contrived scenario where you live in a rural area and haul stuff every day, so you absolutely need to use a car basically all the time. This is like when people say some can't go vegan because they are athletes who need high protein and also have issues with certain plant based sources. These people exist, but they are rare.\n\n> Combining the carbon footprint of production and a fossil grid makes the difference negligible to the used car option. \n\nA used car is a little better sure, but most of the emissions of a gas car are \"tail pipe\" emissions. A lot more CO2 is emitted from the gas it burns than the energy/materials used to make it. You're not saving the planet buying used gas cars.\n\n> You have not addressed price or charging stations. \n\nMotorcycles/mopeds and smaller vehicles are cheaper than cars. Eletric ones can have well over 100 miles of range, which is ample for daily use, you don't need charging stations.\n\nHell, even if you use a *gas* motorcycle, it's dramatically more efficient than a car. There's so many options that are better than gas cars.\n\nDrawing the analogy to diet, saying you *have* to use a gas car is like saying you *have* to eat steak all the time. I'm not saying you need to be a full vegan, but you don't have to rely on the *worst* possible option.",

"comment": "You can tie in the solar array to your electric service panel even without a net-metering agreement. At a given instant in time, any surplus electricity you generate (i.e. demand) will naturally flow out of your panel into the grid. Likewise, any deficit will be naturally pulled in for the grid, as it does without solar installed.\n\nAbsent a net-metering policy of any sort, the instant you outflow power onto the grid, you are only entitled to the avoided cost rate of that power, minus a service fee, per PURPA regulations that govern all kinds of onsite power generators. Net-metering, at is core, is a policy to differentiate small, distributed, renewable power generators who want to offset their energy usage from large industrial scale facilities - such as a steel mill - whom might see an energy imbalance over their manufacturing cycle. PURPA was designed to allow those manufacturers to burp power onto the grid by forcing utilities to accept their interconnection applications. Net-metering is an expansion with additional rights, for small-scale power generators, which helps offset the monopolistic nature of a stable power grid.\n\nIn Texas specifically, unless you are on a co-op that offers net-metering, or a solar-friendly utility like AE, CPS, Oncor, or El Paso, then you are likely on a degregulated grid where you can purchase your power from multiple \"retail electric providers\". Amongst these, Green Mountain Energy offers a net-metering option. However, they have a reputation for being on the high end of the price spectrum, so it would be optimal to size the system to be ~100%-110% of your usage.",

"comment": "&gt; With two solar panels I could potentially run the amplifier at any time for any length of time and not impact my battery life (while daylight).       \n\nNot really, see hourly energy production from a [South facing system](http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_message/44771088#44771088), and from an [East-West setup](http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_message/44747625#44747625).     \n\nAt 06:00 the panels slowly start to charge the battery with 0.1A.    \nAt 08:00 you amplifier needs 4.5A, 0.5A from the panels, 4A from the battery.     \nAt 09:00 2.5A form the panels, 2A from the battery.    \nAt 10:00 4.5A from the panels to the amplifier only.     \nAt 10:30 4.5A to the amplifier, 1A to charge the battery.    \n11:00-14:00 4.5A for the amplifier, 5.5A to charge the battery.    \nIt is the ~10:00-14:00 peak that must both power the amplifier and (fully)charge the batteries, and the batteries slowly start *draining* current for the amplifier again at ~15:00-16:00.    \n\n&gt;4.5A (amplifier) * 6 (hours) = 27A      \n\nNot using the proper units makes it a bit confusing: \"4.5A (amplifier) * 6 (hours) = 27A**h**\", but the basic assumption/calculation looks good (but maybe a bit optimistic).      \n(Compared to my assumption of 12-16 hour per night, your 5-6 hours makes quite a difference).     \n\nDon't forget the solar charge controller.     \n\n*All this is still assuming you need a 50W amplifier at full blast, something I have no experience with.     \nUnless you know for a fact this 50W is adequate, spending all that money when in real life you need a 150W system would be sad.*    \n\n&gt;Does this logic seem sound?     \n\nYes it does, sort of.       \nAs for buying batteries, don't know how many friends with cars (and old-ish batteries in them) you have, but all garages in my area collect old batteries for recycling (law), they might have a few already or they will 'keep' them for my temporary use when they get them (some 'ownership' paperwork is appreciated), if you can borrow/rent several 'old' batteries (400Ah total), it looks even better.    \n\n&gt;It seems that since I wont be using this system regularly    \n\nMost people look for other uses for the panels+batteries, to lower the electricity bill.    \nIn the USA for such a small system it's probably not worth the hassle/cost to get a permit and feed energy back into the grid with a grid-tied inverter (connecting it to the grid is heavy regulated, (you could claim diminished mental faculties for your 'solar Plug&amp;Play system')), but 'off-grid' should not be too much of a problem, if your (families') house has a shed, you can power it with 12V lights, use a 12Vdc-120Vac inverter to power tools or the freezer, the fridge/radio if you have a blackout (and long extension cord), garden lights, swimming pool pumps, your E-bike, all the iThingies.     \n \nFind your location on http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/ for the kWh/kWp ratio, even at a low 800 kWh/kWp your 200W panels will produce 160 kWh (or $20) per year, not much, but the panels should last 30 years (the batteries don't).    \n\nNote on batteries, when not in use they *must* be kept charged or they will self-destruct, a proper 'trickle'-charger can be a bit tricky.",

"comment": "I already have solar so I'm grandfathered in under current NEM. As an existing solar owner, the proposed NEM 2.0 changes would actually benefit me financially so your \"you're being greedy\" argument doesn't work. And no, I'm not in the solar industry.\n\nHowever, I do think that we should continue to promote the installation of rooftop solar. Our public utilities should be figuring out ways to promote and work WITH rooftop solar instead of doing everything they can to kill it.  The utilities are looking out 5-10 years into the future, when they should be looking out 30-50 years.\n\nFor example, what if the utilities encouraged the use of battery systems charged by rooftop solar. They could offer financial incentives to battery owners if they let the utilities control the charging and discharging of the batteries.  That would give them a great deal of control over the grid, saving everyone money. Or maybe the utilities invest in additional infrastructure designed to handle increased rooftop solar generation instead of complaining because the existing infrastructure wasn't designed for so much rooftop solar. Or maybe some of the billions of dollars being collected in cap and trade money could be used to incentive rooftop solar. That kind of thing.\n\nAlso, there absolutely is a difference between energy generated from green sources and energy generated from fossil fuels. I see nothing wrong with giving financial incentives to encourage green energy production/use and penalizing fossil fuel energy/use.",

Once the changes are enacted, it will be better to store excess electricity generated during the day instead of selling to the grid at a discounted rate.

"comment": "&gt; aside from the obvious environmental and economical reasons.\n\nThat depends heavily on what sort of system you have...\n\nIf you've got a grid tied system, it's certainly likely to be cheaper than grid power - you're getting to use the grid for free, so are externalizing costs if you're net metering.  And, at least with the current wave of inverters, you're replacing generating capacity with \"empty KVA\" - the inverters just match the grid, they don't provide any stability services.  The newer stuff (1741-SA?) is a bit better on that front.\n\nIf you have a system that can run through grid outages, it's almost certainly not economical.  Batteries are expensive, and the way you have to design a system for that is typically more expensive than microinverters.\n\nTBH, there really aren't many \"perks\" to being off grid (my office is entirely off grid until I get around to trenching an awful lot of cable around).  You're pretty much limited to the energy coming in you have on any given day.  If you spent a lot in panels and overpaneled, you can get away with more, but you've got nothing to do with the excess power during the peak generating days (often not the peak of summer - cooler fall weather, at least for my array, leads to more overgeneration as the air is clearer and the panels are colder, and my cooling needs are less - I literally can't use all the power I generate right now, even with all my diversion compute loads running).\n\nAnd winter is pretty much an endless daily slog of cleaning snow off panels and fighting with your generator.",

I had my roof quoted from the website and it came to a bit over $30 a sq ft. (without value for energy). but even with value of energy there was a net cost of $5k.  Maybe because energy is so cheap here in Texas.",

All the online solar calculators are there to generate leads that are sold to multiple solar companies. You need somebody with experience to analyze your bills for consumption for a full year and for the demand charges and to use the info in a specialized solar design software to model your system size. Then they can run the number to check how much will cost and how long will take for you to break even. You may be eligible for federal tax credit 30%, local utility or state rebate, depreciation of the equipment.",

"comment": "Renewables are a source but they can’t replace fossil fuels. They’re intermittent. They only work at night and when the winds blowing. They might be cheaper to create energy once up and running, but the production cost and battery storage make it much more expensive than fossil fuels as of now and for the foreseeable future because the limits of the technology are nearing their end. Not to mention how much pollution they create in the process of building them.  If they were to somehow become economically feasible, im all for that, but the issue is they’re not currently. So they’re essentially a waste of money as of now. The only tech that can compete with fossil fuels is nuclear but alarmists don’t want that, the only real solution. \n\nSea levels rates of change are not rising. They’ve stayed relatively similar at about 3mm per year rise since recording began. Sure I can see their are positive feedbacks, but the models have greatly overestimated their impact. They’ve been completely off. Going off observation it seems like you get less than or up to 1.5 degrees of warming for a doubling of co2 including all feedbacks, not much, and certainly manageable. \n\nNo its not down to corporations greed. Corporations give the people what they want. Its yours and everyone elses greed that uses these fuels. Don’t blame others. If the world actually thought it was life or death, they’d stop using them. It’s not, so they continue. \n\nLike I’ve said, no it wont. The money would be much better spent on moving or adaption. Building levees. Investing in nuclear. Solar and wind are losers at the moment. This is why electricity is twice as expensive in europe than the U.S.  I wonder how many people died in the cold because they couldn’t afford to heat their homes. \n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/how-much-will-the-green-new-deal-cost/ Something like the green new deal would cost anywhere from 50-90 trillion to implement over 10 years. Or roughly 2-4X our annual gdp. Based on the ipcc https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/ar5_wgII_spm_en.pdf   Check page 19. The cost of climate change is anywhere between .2-2%. So taking the biggest estimate worst case scenario from the ipcc and the lowest estimate best case scenario from something like the green new deal, 20 trillion if we do nothing vs 40 trillion to implement green policy. So yes, it’s more expensive to fight climate change than to just adapt with it as have been done for 1000s of years. The doers and adapters survived, and the ones who believed the gods could stop the weather by sacrificing and dancing and rituals didn’t make it. Climate change has become a religion.",

Ours was 12yr at 1.99%, although they did fold a bunch of financing into the cost because cash up front was about $4k cheaper.  We get a lot more mileage out of ~28 panels, producing about 14mwh/yr, and our final cost after deductions was about $18K - which is still high I know but we'll be even in less than 10yrs.  \n\nWe had to act because of a time consideration.  Our utility provider was set to get rid of net metering, and they since have leaving us grandfathered in.",

Prices were good, but the batteries on most of them were degraded\n\nAdding a charger wouldn’t be an issue, my friend owns a company that would do the install for me.\n\nMy dream would be to get a 3, S, or X. I love the way the S looks! \n\nIn the future we plan to move up to our farm property. My hope is to use old hybrid/electric vehicle batteries tied to a controller system with a  solar array. This way I can be off grid, but still be tied to the grid through the controller should there be an issue the power would switch over in a way that would be transparent to us. At that same time I hope to potentially have some kind of fully electric truck",

The cost of running the whole supply chain will never allow it, not to mention the carbon required for it. \n\nTrains will move to electric because it's cheaper and those companies can move to it quite cheaply, trains are basically huge diesel generators anyway.\n\nSemi or lories will also move to battery as the cost per km is lower by about half, which will be further reduced by full self driving.\n\nShips might use hydrogen, that's about the only viable use case right now.\n\nGreen steel is cool and I think that'll be part of the future with solar panels making hydrogen for it.\n\nI know where my energy comes from and what percentage is renewable.  The argument is one my father in law uses all the time and I asked him the percentage of our grid that's renewable (~40%) and he didn't know the answer.  It's all the same recycled FUD for electric cars and climate change.  One minute they care about the grids renewable electricity production makeup when it's electric cars, then it's dismissing climate change because what's it matter if the climate gets 3°C hotter.  You start talking about the bleaching of coral and the percentage of people who rely on that ecosystem and they just glaze over and say \"but what about....\"\n\nHydrogen isn't going to work for most things and it's primarily going to be natural gas derived at first and transported by diesel burning trucks.

Proven nuclear designs take 10 years to build, the US nuclear industry today has near zero experience  with TMSRs\n\n&gt;Batteries and windmills and solar panels could be replaced with ultra reliable/clean nuclear \n\nNuclear is great at baseload, but other sources are needed for load following, e.g. natural gas peakers, batteries, hydro",

"comment": "At a price of $10k for the extra panels on the north roof, I would instead go with a battery for around the same price.\n\nThe battery will be drawn from during the time solar production is winding down and your Utility kicks in the extremely high TOU rate. So instead of trying to get a little bit more overproduction during the middle of the day at a low rate, my theory is that it is better to have the battery to power you through much of the high rate time of day (5-9pm). You need about 2kwh sold during the day for 1kwh used in the evening with SCE, and the extra 10 panels on a north sloped facing roof will honestly probably get you 8-9kwh extra production a day based on them being hooked to IQ8+ inverters. That means you have 4-4.5kwh of \"free power\" in the evening from them. If you had a 10kwh battery then you have over double the \"free power\" in the evening as the panels. Though really a bit less since you need to charge that battery in the day so you sell less. Still,I think the math works out in favor of the battery rather than 10 panels more.\n\nYou may also be able to use the battery in a way that charges it from the grid at low cost times (instead of panels) and uses it during high cost times on those few rainy days too when your solar panels aren't working really at all.\n\nBetter decision IMO.",

"comment": "First, you're a kind soul.\n\nSecond, can you build me a starship for two complete with a hibernation chamber, an inflatable outpost with a terraforma doohickey? The starship has to be purple. I need to get out of this hot mess.\n\nIf you are unable to oblige, I would suggest looking into a career in energy storage. We've lived with solar panels for close to a decade. I have no doubt that renewables is a significant part of the solution as it is capable of capturing lots of energy. On a sunny day, we generate enough electricity for up to 3 houses and export what we don't use back to the grid using existing infrastructure (and we haven't covered our entire roof with panels). \n\nAustralia, realized it's more economical to use software and batteries to move electricity where it's needed (VPPs) rather than building large solar farms and high transmission lines.\n\nhttps://cleantechnica.com/2023/07/22/can-project-symphony-put-the-duck-to-sleep/\n\n\"According to modelling by Dr Gabrielle Kuiper, Western Australia’s Project Symphony could lull the duck (curve) to sleep. With the massive penetration of rooftop solar in Australia, it would be better to find a way to use it, rather than curtail it. Combine that rooftop solar with batteries and put the duck to sleep. This would certainly be cheaper than upgrading poles and wires.\"\n\nFrom everything I've read, the barrier isn't in using renewables but in storing the energy generated by renewables. That's where human kind needs the most help. Its a physics and chemistry problem. Keep the cost down while increasing energy density. \n\nTo be precise, 6 TW of battery storage is needed in the us alone.\n\nhttps://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/28/six-terawatt-hours-of-grid-scale-energy-storage-by-2050/\n\nTwo thirds of fossil fuels is used for transportation. While industry has started building EVs, it's only scratched the surface when it comes to electrifying planes and ships. Both will need batteries with higher energy density.\n\nBatteries will be the key to a low carbon future. We'll need them in the community and in every mode of transportation. I hope this gives you some food for thought. Good luck.",

If you're comparing between companies, always ask for cash price or at least similar financing so you can compare apples to apples.",

"comment": "ALL LIES!!  Watch 'a conversation about climate'. Carbon dioxide is good for the environment. There have been multiple warming trends throughout earth's history all of which prove society flourishes during warming trends. Plants convert co2 to oxygen, food crops are more plentiful.\n\nData is based on information from last 150-200 years. No direct evidence extreme weather or hurricanes have increased. 2023 looks similar to hurricane data from early 1900s\n\nPolar ice caps could completely melt, will not change ocean level at all. Fill a glass with ice water, mark level. After ice has melted, notice the difference. It will be virtually unchanged.\n\nIncrease of forest fires created by environmental extremists in the 80s forcing governments to create policy to protect. Fire starts, fire departments have no access to stop spread due to overgrowth and Mismanagement. Trees do need co2 to survive. Currently earth is 415 ppm, 1200 ppm is considered unhealthy, 150 ppm plant life cannot survive, humans will soon follow.\n\nNet 0 by 2050  cost is estimated at 290 TRILLION DOLLARS (3× U.S. GDP), no evidence this will help planet. Windmill and solar panels last about 20 years and are not biodegradable \n\nActual data versus partial data in which these institutions use to prove their arguments and are funded by government or entity that have something to gain ($$$) prove at this point in earth's history air and water has never been cleaner and continues to improve.\n\nI would rather be considered 'uneducated' then a sheep.",

So for the purposes of comparing a new purchase to this existing system it would be fair to factor that in. \n\nThis same electricity from PG&E would cost around $350 to $400 / mo, easily going up to $400- $500 in the next 5 years or so. \n\nApples to apples or kWh to kWh, this is a good amount of savings over the long haul as long as you are confident there are not peripheral problems with the system that could cost $$ down the line. Sunpower's  INSTALLER dealer network (not the small sales orgs that they just stopped doing) is not perfect, but is generally a better quality and higher standard than most other big installers. Sunpower generally covers roof penetrations for at least 10 years on their lease, possibly up to 25 I cant remember off the top but that is in that contract. So depending on the original install date and where you are in escrow you may have one of their dealers come out and double check penetrations in your inspection process. Let me know the area I can recommend a few. \n\nFunctionality or \"production\" is guaranteed through the power reimbursement in the contract. \n\nSource - been partnering with brokers / relators and helping with solar inspections, transfers, education specifically with the real estate industry for 4+ years.",

"comment": "How big is your house? What period of time is this bill? What part of the country are you in?(I assume Southern California/SCE). What do you typically set your thermostat to? Is your home newer or older? Do you have a battery or solar only?\n\nLooking at your bill you appear to be on Nem 2.0 which is great news!! But your bill will only show you your net imports or exports for your time of use buckets. You are showing a net export for winter super off peak so that indicates that your solar is working and exporting electricity. However, you are net importing for your summer buckets and your other winter buckets. I have a 2000 sqft home in the inland empire with a 9.6kw system and a Tesla power wall home battery and generated 1400 kWh for August and 1200 kWh for September. You had an import of 800 kWh and export of 308 kWh, so net was importing about 500 kWh. My guess is that your home consumed about 1800 kWh total and you are paying a bill right now for approximately 500 kWh. You could benefit from some load shifting like you mentioned (heavy electric consumers move to off peak hours) and do what you can to decrease your on peak consumption. \n\nI would recommend reaching out to whoever installed the system for help to get yourself connected to the Tesla app for monitoring purposes. If that doesn’t work reach out to Tesla. If they can’t help, my system was installed by solar optimum and they were great, you could try reaching out to them for help with troubleshooting depending on your area.\n\nFor reference if your home consumed 1800 kWh (our home consumed 1300 kWh in August and 1100 kWh in September with no electric car. Even at 320 miles per month that is over 100 kWh of electricity)  (80% off peak and 20% peak for arguments sake) you would have a bill that is roughly $650! \n\n1440 kWh x $0.30 = $432\n360 kWh x $0.60 = $216\n$432+$216=$648.00",

"comment": "I think there are a lot of houses that aren't great fits. Roof is in shade, chimney in the way, best roof plane is the front of the house and some don't like the idea of putting panels there. Others can't put don't know they can afford it, others are convinced there are unacceptable risks or it doesn't align with their agenda.\n\nWhen you say 25 or 33 kW, do you mean kWh? I have a 10 kW DC (8.8 kW AC) system on my house that will create around 12,000 kWh of electricity per year. I could be wrong, but I thought with the SREC program that you get paid out in a lump sum as long as your project is less than 10 kW AC.\n\nPaying out in one year is nice, but you will have to get less solar than you need to get that. My only point was IF you can accord to get the SREC over 5 years, you could likely get more total value from your system. \n\n10 years seems short to determine the value of the project. When you say architectural look, do you mean your house might get torn down and rebuilt? Most people consider reroofing before solar. I put half my array on my garage which already needed a re-shingle, so I re-shingled and then added panels. Luckily the other roof was less than 10 years old and looked pretty much flawless. \n\nI am good with numbers so I'd be running my own comparison. Do I install a bigger system and take the SREC over 5 years, or do I install a smaller system and get the SREC in year 1 but have to pay an electricity bill as well. Given how valuable 1:1 net metering is and the fact it's going away soon, I expect the bigger system were better financially over the long term (in present value) but perhaps take a little longer to breakeven (cash flow). \n\nIf you can't do the numbers, a good solar installer would help you run that comparison. Just be careful you understand them, the installers will of course want the bigher system to pencil out. \n\nChanging the side of your system could affect your net metering status, that's worth doing some research into. \n\nEV as a home battery is cool in theory. Idea is as long as the car is home and plugged in, you could tap into it in an emergency. Limitation is even if it has 70 kWh of juice in the battery, they usually only send like 3 or 4 kW of energy which is not going to be enough if your monthly bill is $600. It won't power all of your ac, fridge, etc. Home batteries are more expensive but designed to handle higher home loads. At the end of the day, I thought of the EV-as-a-home-battery as not too realistic right now and not worth make decisions over. Maybe someday in the future it will be worth planning around.",

The most insidious thing about b12-deficiency is its slow onset and some of its effects being neurological.  I also regularly ate b12-fortified nutritional yeast (about once a week?).  I guess the amount of b12 in those foods just wasn't enough!",

"comment": "For those asking about the misleading info...\n\nI'll give you an example of how the movie presented certain correlations as cause and effect in an inappropriate manner. During the scene when they were talking about the change in Norwegian diet during German occupation and the change in mortality/disease risk the movie portrays it exclusively as a result of cessation of animal food intake; however, there is quite a bit of data that shows calorie restriction to also be a significant modifier of mortality/disease risk (see: research on the Dutch during 1944-1945) But, of course, that was not mentioned.\n\nI think that overall the science was presented inappropriately and in a careless manner.\n\nBut, what bothered me the most about this movie is that it is just a bad movie. Everything about it is poorly produced: the editing is clunky and disjointed, the animations are poor, and the narration is flat. \n\nAnd come on, canned synthesizer \"Chinese\" music for the Chinese proverbs...ugh. So bad.\n\n(Full disclosure: I'm a vegan and an RD.)",

Is giving a homeless person $1 immoral because of the possibility that they might buy a hamburger? You could argue that the $1 is unethical to begin with (which I'd agree with), but helping someone survive through monetary means, not quite as evil is it? I'm not trying to be a sophist here, but your arguments are musings of the stereotypical vegan fantasy of ethical purity, which pushes people away from trying veganism because they can't be perfect enough.",

"comment": "Everyone's different.\n\nI cut meat out over a year ago and never looked back. There was definitely a \"Why am I always hungry?\" period, but over time that subsided. Going vegan was actually a lot easier, and I didn't experience any cravings, even though I thought I would (especially with regard to cheese); I definitely don't have the hunger issues I experienced at first after going veg. Honestly, I don't really have an addictive personality, so it might have been easier from that standpoint. I'd suggest finding a vegan buddy who can talk you down when you get cravings, kind of like those quit smoking hotlines. Like it or not, meat is a food, and your body recognizes that - the stomach even [has its own \"brain\" of sorts](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gut-second-brain), which complicates the process even further. Perhaps as soon as you get the craving, head to Whole Foods (or the local equivalent) and purchase the vegan approximation.\n\nGood luck, and watch out for your cornhole, bud (you're gonna be doing a lot of pooping from here on out).",

"comment": "I applaud your open-mindedness. Many vegans seem to be completely closed off to anything that violates the Code of Veganism. Personally I'm still trying to decide about how likely it is that insects suffer (there is no scientific consensus). It's a complex subject, with lots of opinions and lots of people making unfounded assumptions.\n\nWiki cites an article from 1984 that states that most insects don't have nociceptors (pain receptors), although some do. The article is old and may be inaccurate; from my reading it seems some insects definitely do have nociceptors (e.g. fruit flies, bees), and I have no idea about the percentages. I would guess that worms are unlikely to have them.\n\nSo even if we have an idea of which insects have pain receptors, it's still not clear whether that is sufficient for them to experience suffering. So there really are a lot of unknowns.\n\nMy personal view is that higher levels of cognition don't necessarily produce greater capacity to suffer. Do pigs suffer less than humans for an equivalent injury? Do fish suffer less than pigs? Do insects suffer less than fish? It's difficult/near-impossible to quantify subjective suffering of other species. So maybe the best path is to avoid consuming any species that has pain receptors (or which we're not sure about), just to play it safe. It's still not clear whether fish can suffer, but they do have nociceptors. It's quite possible that being hauled out of the ocean by a hook in the mouth/gut, only to suffocate in the air, is excruciating beyond our comprehension. Even if I'm not sure that they suffer, I think I should play it safe and not eat them.\n\nWorms, though, that's tricky. Have you looked much into their biology?",

"comment": "It's not always income and access to vegan food that connotes privilege, I don't think.   It's also a matter of knowledge, cultural capital, and the capacity to make choices about what one eats. \n\nI come from a very poor family in a region with a high rate of poverty.   Tofu is cheap, yes, but I had never heard of it until I left for college.  To me, it was \"exotic rich people food\".   I now eat almost none of the foods I grew up with.   When I talk about veganism with my parents, I frame it in terms of animal exploitation, and especially exploitation of workers.  They can relate to that, and the whole system outrages them.\n\nBut look at how much ignorance there is about food in general - \"but how will you get your protein?\" is such a common question.  A dozen eggs can be $1.75 and they are so versatile they may very well seem like an indispensable commodity.  Just in this subreddit there are lots of posts on expensive vegan goodies and \"exotic\" foods, with many things foreign and out of reach.  \n\nThere is a learning curve to becoming vegan.  We have countless resources to count on, though.  My parents, on the other hand, worry about feeding themselves, period. How can I expect them to go online and research ingredients?  My mom knows how to make a tofu scramble now, thanks to me, and it's not like I think poor people are too stupid to know or care about where their food comes from, but they are already extraordinarily burdened and may not see veganism as a lifestyle that is accessible to them when rich hipsters are the face of the movement.",

Some people can't wrap their heads around such a change in eating habits, especially if they've grown up eating a diet heavy in meat and dairy (as many in the US do).",

It is like how all atheists are anti-theists and all have an agenda to get rid of religion.\n\n&gt;What, then, am I saying? In short, that animal rights only begins with your diet. \n\nExactly. I highly doubt every vegan wants to be the super active type (the 'annoying type') and (like me) just want to show that you can live a perfectly happy and healthy diet without any animal products in your food or clothing. I am not out to convert anyone but rather to show that they can tone down their usage.\n\nIf not else, would we not all constantly be wearing tshirts with horrible images on them? I prefer to use the Socratic method (might be wrong how I call it now that I think of it) and that is to kinda steer people into reaching a conclusion.",

Your suggestion about the vegan cookbook is the best piece of advice that anyone posted.  I own vegan cookbooks and use them often.  This is how I'm able to easily able to accommodate her diet within the context of a traditional family holiday meal without the others feeling deprived.  We belong to a progressive social group that includes a large number of vegetarians and vegans.  I cook for them often and have no objection or problem with either diet--but those are adults who are serious about their nutrition--and I'm concerned about a young girl with limited info making a choice out of fear and grief that she may not understand yet.  She's very, very thin.  We love her and want her to be healthy.  I believe she can be healthy on a vegan diet, just not sure if she knows how yet.  Thanks for your post.",

Almost all of the ground dwelling birds will either have their eggs destroyed or themself killed. But alas i get downvoted beacause you think being millitant is something to be proud over and there of bringing a bad image over veganism, people will not stop buying fur if you kill the fur farmers.

It was small at first, but we gained a lot of members after student recruitment week and a vegan bakesale (which was very successful). We had a few events that we also advertised  - like an all-vegan gourmet dinner, which was nice. I met a few new people through the group meetings, overall it was a comfortable atmosphere. There was really only one person there who fit the militant vegan stereotype, which is good considering 70+ people joined and 20+ regularly showed up to meetings and events.\nIf there's one at yours that you're imterested in, I'd check it out. It's nice to talk to like-minded people every now and then.\nIf you're thinkig about starting one then give that a try to! Advertise it on a local vegan group's page or university page if you can.",

Thanks to Calin Wynne for making it happen. It really is great to see younger kids understanding that the way we use animals is wrong and that they can do better. The kind, genuine man who was talking about not eating his beef burrito actually shed a tear after watching more footage and is genuinely a changed person. Please share this with people of all ages to help take down the dairy industry and show the people the truth in the right light.

Why don't you do all the work to try to see if there's some validity to my point?\"\n\nIt's probably really not worth engaging with someone who takes that stance. The onus of proving a point is on the person asserting it. This person wants to make you do all the work to see if they might be right - and they aren't even interested in sticking around to hear a rebuttal if it turns out their position is lacking.\n\n&gt;  86 percent of what livestock eat globally is human-inedible plants and leftovers \n\nProbably pretty misleading. One can produce for example feed corn and say \"Hey it's not human-edible\". That same land could likely have been used to produce some other food that *is* human-edible.\n\nSince 90% of food energy is lost per link in the food chain, we'd ultimately be able to use less land to produce enough food to feed our population. Extracting maximum value from *all* land isn't all that important - a lot of land could just be returned to nature if the world was vegan.",

And you’re apposing demand for that animal so they’ll keep breeding them more and more.",

The only type of athletes I've heard that can really thrive on a keto diet are distance/endurance athletes. \n\n\nThe article tries to make this argument that these doctors in the movie have a financial bias for the info theyre pushing. What, because a doctor writes and sells a diet book, his expertise doesn't matter? Meanwhile, that website blasted me with 2 or 3 ads before I could even read the article. So how can you make this argument while you're pushing keto ads?\n\n\nMic the vegan addressed a few things this article brought up in his recent game changer video response to Joe Rogan's podcast.",

Quick gander through and I see a lot of 'accidental vegan' high upvoted recipes posted under the vegetarian badge.

"comment": "I've been thinking for a long time that non-food related vegan topics (zoos, circusses, leather, wool, down, animal testing etc) have been underrepresented in vegan activism outlets for a long time now. These topics have been discussed much more strongly in the past and have shaped the animal rights movement. Especially animal testing. I feel we need to bring those topics up more. To make clear to everyone that being **vegan** is not only about what to **eat**. It is about the everyday ethical decision making process.  \n\nIf someone only eats vegan food, but is contributing to animal exploitation in every other area of their life, they can't consider themself a vegan. That's just how it is.",

I went vegan not only for the animals and the planet but for health reasons, so I had to try new things because I didn't want to get deficiencies in nutrients. Nowadays, I eat everything (if it's vegan, duh) because I've figured out how to make things taste good. If it doesn't taste good, I will find a way to like it. And I know it's good for my body so that makes the food taste better, too.",

I have my opinions but I don't push them on people .We have all been build differently  .No human can say we are the same \nPeople who  are vegan or vegetarian  good for you \nPeople who eat meat enjoy  \nAs the saying goes you are what you eat \nAnd FYI tofu  can not be compared to imitation meat \nTofu has its own taste and tastes nothing like imitation meat .And that is what makes it delicious 😋 \nI do have one opinion \nIf you claim you are vegan why do you have the need for imitation meat .There are so many recipes  that can be made from fruits and vegetables that you do not need the taste of imitation meat .",

You should be eating a minimum of 1600 calories a day (even people trying to lose weight, starvation is not the answer). This includes complex carbs, fats, and proteins in each meal for roughly 400-550 calories 3-4 times per day (again, minimum). Make sure you are eating enough fruit for your sugar intake and you are drinking enough water. You most likely are nutrient deficient based on meal choices and the portions you stated above. Make sure you take a multivitamin and omega 3 supplement daily (I do everyday). \n\nDo this and I promise you’ll never have to eat animal byproducts ever again.",

I must say it was worth it. I never felt so energized in my life and enjoy more range of food that isn't meat or any of its products.\n\nBut the system shock...that might be real just maybe wrong wording for it. I been through some withdrawal ages ago, this feels more like detox. Light headedness, slight aggressions towards wanting to eat meat....then after a week it was gone.\n\nI'm a month in, and still pushing hard, willpower seems to have stuck only because I want to be healthy and peace with my self.",

I prefer to use environmental and health talking points even though ethics is the main reason I went vegan, it's just that arguing with empirical evidence tends to be easier for people to grasp.",
