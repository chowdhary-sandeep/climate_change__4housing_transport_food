"comment": "Electric vehicle is a pretty broad term. In the most general sense it means any vehicle with an electric drive component; this includes closed-loop hybrids, non-battery EVs that used compressed air or flywheel kinetic energy storage, plug-in hybrids or range-extended EVs, and battery-only EVs (BEVs).\n\nThere are a diverse set of plug-in hybrids on the market today, with varying degrees of reliance upon their range-extender. The plug-in Prius and BMW i8 offer only a dozen or so miles of EV-only range, and strong acceleration requires assistance from the gas engine. The Volt offers 30 to 40 miles of EV-only range, and can achieve full performance without requiring the gas engine. The BMW i3 REX is a true serial hybrid, i.e. the gas engine has no mechanical connection to the wheels. And the BMW i3 REX has more battery-only range and performance than some smaller EVs like the Mitsubishi i-MiEV.\n\nWithout a clear distinction in electric-only range or performance between PHV/REEV and BEVs, the only reason I can see to say that PHV categorically are not EVs is if you define EV to mean only BEV. I don't see a need or a justification for that redefinition.",

Was [leasing](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2013/05/nearly-free-electric-car-leases-in-a-state-near-you/) a new one not an option for you?\n\nLoss of range started at about 15k miles. I am not unique. Nissan was already [sued](https://www.google.com/search?q=nissan+leaf+class+action) about this right after I bought my LEAF.\n\nClimate is moderate. Never goes below 10, never above 32 C.\n\nNo snow. No fires.\n\nIf you read LEAF owners experiences, you will most likely experience similar range loss, when you reach this mileage. I cannot go beyond 96 km/day/charge now, after just 2 years of ownership. Used to get around 144km.\n\nMeanwhile our Mitsubishi has no discernable range loss after 2 years, bought a month apart. It has an active battery cooling system (radiator), unlike the LEAF, which has no battery cooling system.\n\nEven Tesla says you must have a active battery cooling system, and told [Boeing](https://www.google.com/search?q=tesla+boeing+active+cooling) that.",

I couldn't plug in at the hotel so I had to hit the Blink level 3 chargers about every other day. Fortunately, up there, they have level 3 chargers at several grocery stores, so you can plug in, go spend 20 minutes grabbing small bag of groceries and when you come out, you're charged. \n\nLevel 2 chargers are more widespread, but they really only do you much good if you're at work, or somewhere where you'll be for an hour or two like a movie theater. Level 2 chargers aren't something you treat like a gas pump where you plug in and sit there waiting for it to fill up like you can with a level 3 charger.\n\nCheck with your apartment and see if there's any available regular 110v plugs you can park next to. Some complexes have level 2 chargers, but a 110v regular wall socket with the charger that comes in the trunk will charge the average commute while you sleep. I have mine plugged into a power strip.\n \nIt can be done, but you'll want to do some research and find what resources are available in your neighborhoods.",

Similar to racing, towing places the entire drivetrain under a higher level of stress than would be seen in normal driving.\n\nI don't know of any full EVs that are rated for towing. The Chevrolet Volt, Tesla Model S, and perhaps Nissan e-NV200 are perhaps the closest to full power EVs that might be expected to have a tow rating, but none do. The Model X may be the first tow-capable EV.\n\nSome mild plug-in hybrids are rated for towing. These will lean primarily on the gas engine for towing power, and the electric motor will provide assistance for accelerating from a stop.\n\nThe UK [Outlander PHEV](http://www.mitsubishi-cars.co.uk/outlander/specifications.aspx) is rated at 1500 kg towing capacity, braked.\n\nThe [Porsche Cayenne e-Hybrid](http://press.porsche.com/vehicles/2015/2015-Cayenne-Technical-Information.pdf) is rated at 3500 kg towing capacity, braked.",

(At least if you're in a high income tax category where that tax credit matters.)\n\nNot to mention that the source for all of those numbers is the company SELLING the product (but gee, there couldn't be any bias there, could there? I mean, it's not like CORPORATIONS would ever have any INCENTIVE to mislead people would they?)\n\nIt's akin to the \"save money by using a Keurig k-cup coffee maker\" -- well, yeah if you compare it to the price of buying a \"$5 per cup venti mocca\" at Starbuck every day -- but otherwise, ROTFLMAO no.\n\n&gt;Obviously the difference varies depending upon a number of factors, but to state that driving electric is never cheaper than gas is simply false.\n\nWell, undoubtedly driving a Nissan Leaf will have a lower cost than driving a Ferrari Testarossa, but that's hardly a valid claim.",

I'm sure there will be some software the decides when to use the battery and when to pull 100% from the grid leaving the batteries charged.\n\nIf you get a solar array now and decide to get the tesla battery down the line, you will have to replace your current inverter. Adding on a powerwall will require an inverter (made by solaredge) that is specifically made to work with the powerwall (it doesn't exist yet)",

It's not an exaggeration \n\nhttps://youtu.be/cVFkreHsTHI?t=12m47s\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nkry2VkEkDU?t=2m36s\n\nObviously battery energy density isn't there yet (not even close, it's less by a  10 to 15 times), however we don't have to wait for parity. My guess is that 60 kWh or higher is good enough for the majority of the market. It's also the point where it starts to attract not only EV enthusiasts but also regular people. It satisfies the minimum requirements and then some. It might not be the cross country car a similar priced ICE vehicle would have been but it won't matter, most people rarely take such long trips for which a 60 kWh EV would be inadequate.\n\nPersonally I do think it's an important point in the electric car's history, at least I think it will considered to be so years from now.",

The reason the merger makes sense to use resources between the companies.\n\nA grid  tie inverter and approval is hardly a big challenge for Tesla, even  a hack like me helped design one 15 years ago (now controlling over 1GW of gridtied generation).  The idea of them not using the inverter expertise of Tesla is strange.  I would guess that in a year to 18 months we will see:\n\n* Tesla panels using SiC based DC/DC converters hard mounted on each panel, about 1/8 DIN brick sized, similar to SolarEdge optimizers.  SiC converters have very low failure rates at high temperatures, the PowerPack is moving to SiC inverters from a third party.\n\n* Tesla will make a grid tie inverter that integrates with the DC/DC converters, and includes HPWC functionality as an option.\n\n* The mounting system that SolarCity makes will be modified with: Pass-throughs to accommodate wiring from adjacent panels, side of panel mounting to lower the profile, allow for irregular shaped panels or aesthetically similar blanks to allow the panel edges to be parallel to roof edges\n\nBonus: The powerwall 2.5 will include a grid tie inverter, between 3kWh to 10 kWh of a car battery can be used as a powerwall battery, Tesla buys a SiC foundry.",

"comment": "&gt; the PowerPack battery farm will top 100 megawatts of capacity and provide 129 megawatt-hours of energy\n\nIt's actually 129 MWh and discharges at 100 MW or around 134102 hp and you don't have to pack even 500 kWh before it becomes usable. People want 1 to 1 replacements with a current mass produced battery, that's not going to happen, but useful battery electric tractors can be made with up to 1 MWh right now. The reason why it's not being built is cost not some etherial property of diesel powered tractors that can't be matched. In 3 to 4 years thin lithium metal solid state batteries will double or potentially triple the energy density. That's when exact carbon copies electric tractors will be viable, however price will be again an issue. In 10 years the energy density will increase again to close to 1 kWh/kg and electric tractors will have more range than diesel ones. There is no reason to wait for that, the only reason worth waiting for is cost of current batteries to drop to about half of what they are today.",

I was really close to buying a used 2014 recently (lizard battery) and in the end I opted not to because my commute is more like 50 miles a day.  Even then I would have loved the car, but I wouldn't have been able to (on a 4 year old battery) go to and from work AND to the airport with comfort to spare in any temp (my 2013 could do it in the first 2.5 years though).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 Years with the leaf and I only had 1 bad 2AM experience (it was only 2 weeks after buying it -- took my hubris down a little bit).  Once you learn your limits and don't get overconfident, all range anxiety goes away (for me at least).  Just use it like a commuter car and you're golden.  Have fun pocketing that extra cash you used to spend on gas!",

It falls short of its competitors in its price category and will likely be more on par with  the Kona EV in terms of range and Cross-Over category (which, despite the designer's claim that \"this car cannot be categorized\", it clearly is).",

To reflect EV's latest technology of Toyota, reflect on the EV of C-HR scheduled to be released in 2020. \n\n&gt;In addition, Toyota is promoting local production in China regarding batteries, inverters, drive system units, etc. of core technology of electric vehicles. By doing so, we are aiming to further accelerate vehicle electricization rooted in the field.",

I still love railing a beatifully banked on-ramp at 60mph or whatever, but I'm equally annoyed at not being able to ever fit stuff in my car or always having to ask one of my coworkers to drive if 3 of us are going out for lunch.\n\nThat 70mph stretch is crazy, at 70mph I'm in the right lane and getting tailgated or passed by semis doing 80. The left lane goes 90, and I'm sure most BEVs are slurping electrons like no tomorrow at that speed. Having a 1.5x safety factor on EPA-rated range would be nice, but really the Leaf is the only option in the 110-125 mile range bucket. Seems like there are a ton of 22-25 kWh cars with 70-80 miles, and then you jump right up to the 60+ kWh cars that do 220+ miles. \n\nI did look at the i3 with the range extender motor, but there wasn't a ton of selection.",

That when the Model S ranges updwards of $90k but how that another Tesla is available for “only” $46k that somehow nothing has changed and it’s only once the car is worth $35k that suddenly public opinion is valid.\n\nJust ridiculous",

"comment": "Can you give a couple examples? I just reviewed their last dozen or so Tesla articles and don't see this as an issue. They gave *Black Tesla* credit for some new pedestrian animations. They gave Bjorn credit for a range test. Sometimes they cite Tesla itself as the source (e.g., \"*Update: Tesla just told us that Fallout Shelter currently doesn’t support an Xbox controller.*\"). Or release notes from Tesla. Or tweets from Elon Musk. Or *SF Weekly* as the source for a recent article about some employees who are worried about returning to work in the midst of the Covid stuff. They cited *Motortrend* in an article about turning Model 3 into convertibles. They cited CNBC as the source for an email to employees about going back to work. They linked to 乌瓦's drone flight of the Shanghai gigafactory... I'm sure I could go on. But in 100% of the stories I checked, they gave credit.\n\nIf you're upset because they aren't the entity that came up with an exclusive scoop for every story -- well, that's pretty much par for the course on the internet these days. Is there any EV website, Youtuber, etc., that isn't frequently reporting on stories they didn't source themselves. My sense from following EV bloggers, Youtubers, news sites, etc., for many years is that Electrek does this less than others (who frequently regurgitate Electrek's original content).\n\nI genuinely think people just have decided they don't like Fred or his opinions or something and therefore Electrek gets singled out as \"sucking\". I'm curious if someone can tell me what EV news site, Youtuber, etc. doesn't do this? Maybe a very niche thing like *The Limiting Factor* (more about battery tech than news per se) or Sandy Munro. But those aren't really news sites.",

"comment": "This post made me curious about the distribtion of brand mentions on this sub, so I did a very quick-and-dirty survey of the first two pages (50 posts), sorted by \"New\". The oldest post in that list was from Tuesday at 00:30 UTC, whereas this reply was written on Thursday at 09:50 UTC. Therefore the survey spans just over two days worth of posts.\n\nI counted not just press release posts or news, but any and all brand mentions *in the title* of the post. I did not click through into neutral posts to see if they mentioned any brands inside.\n\nResults:\n\n* 22 - Neutral / no brand mention\n* 7 - Tesla\n* 5 - Volkswagen\n* 3 - Porsche\n* 2 - Lucid\n* 2 - Renault\n* 1 - Chevrolet\n* 1 - Volvo\n* 1 - Byton\n* 1 - Ford\n* 1 - Audi\n* 1 - Bollinger\n* 1 - Mercedes\n* 1 - Kia\n* 1 - Bentley\n\nMeaning, right now about 10% of all recent posts mention VW or one of their cars in the title, which is apparently too much for OP to bear (though ironically, his own post is one of these five). However, Tesla is still more prevalent, making it the most frequently mentioned brand. And the vast majority of posts - almost half of them - do not address any specific brand.",

Sure - but that isn't relegated to German cars, as this post suggests. \n\nPersonally, I prefer a community where people don't constantly accuse people of being a shill or a short, or question motives by implying their are employed or paid by a corporation.\n\nBut hey, let's address what you think is an argument. There has recently been an influx of people that like German cars and are excited about some of the EVs come out of there. Some of them are defensive. But here's what I saw before I stopped ghosting. I saw posts about the VW and Porsche offerings, where there were many comments along the lines of VW sucks. Dieselgate was a catch all - 'oh they aren't actually making EVs, they are forced to.' The Taycan laps the ring fairly quickly, and Elon sends some prototypes to compete. 'LOL Porsche sucks - so expensive and decades behind.' 'Oh they are just selling to old men.' Favorable reviews come out and there's plenty of calls that Porsche paid for reviews. Every test is rigged. And if it weren't, then 'Plaid power train, Porsche is so far behind.' If not that 'Roadster with rocket thruster lol.'\n\nDo you see why his points are a bit of a miss? There have been very vocal elements in this sub that are constantly putting down any of the German cars and insulting people that might be interested in them. I've seen everything from distortion to outright lies and accusations. It's constant and exhausting. The most visible people that shit on everything else tend to come from teslainvestorsclub.\n\nIn this very sub had someone imply I was an employee for Porsche in an outsourced office in India. I've had someone call me a short, despite not holding any position in Tesla. I've pretty much only posted in threads related to Porsche (surprise, I like their cars), but have been accused of shorting Tesla in those threads because I called someone out when they said Porsche has been unlocking the full battery for press cars to lie about the range.\n\nThis sub has been downright hostile to anyone that likes VW or Porsche, and this post is just an extension of that.",

"comment": "&gt;  Especially at the low end, where combustion engines are awful.\n\nWell, internal combustion engines.  *External* combustion engines make peak torque at zero rpm, and then torque drops off linearly with speed.  They're actually fairly ideal engines as far as output power is concerned; you never need a transmission and you're always making almost peak power.\n\nFor example a steam engine outputs a constant volume of steam per second.  At low rpm that volume accumulates, causing a buildup of pressure that directly creates torque.  As the engine speeds up, each push of the pistons has less accumulated steam-time behind it.  The upshot is that with a sturdy piston you have absolutely *insane* torque; a steam engine making 5 hp can *easily* out-torque a 500 hp gas truck in low gear.  It'll just happily chug along until the trucks wheels are going backwards.\n\nGas engines on the other hand have an effectively static piston pressure.  You have the pressure of a single explosion in the cylinder, and that's it.  If the engine isn't spinning fast enough to get air into the cylinders properly, it isn't working.  The slower it goes, the fewer explosions, the less power.  Adding turbos or superchargers makes it even worse.\n\n&gt; It can generate peak torque pretty much from standstill, and then hold that peak torque over a very wide band. It typically gets weaker at the very high end\n\n[No, you mean power](https://nationalspeedinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tesla-Dyno-Graph.jpg).  Gas engines have near-constant torque, because torque is created by the pressure of each explosion and they have no ability to build up bigger explosions- only more of them.  That's a really undesireable driving quality, because you're always making less than peak power.  By the time you're at peak power, you're also at top speed... so there's nowhere left to accelerate to.  Lame.\n\nElectric motors, like steam engines, can make peak power all the time by creating *extra* torque at medium speeds.  At very low speeds they reach max torque, but they quickly reach max power and from that point they can trade torque for speed at almost 1:1, which is perfect.  At max rpm, that 1:1 trade starts breaking down and the max power decreases slightly, but with a much lower penalty than you'd pay at low rpms for extra torque.  Fundamentally we can't make electrical conductors as well as we can make magnetic field conductors.  Copper carrying power just tends to have higher losses than electrical steel carrying power in a magnetic field[1].\n\nElectric motors are neat because they're extremely tune-able.  The max power of an electric motor is proportional to I^2 + I^2 x RPM^2 where all three of those terms can be altered very easily with design changes.  The additive I^2 there represents resistive losses, which flatten the torque curve away from the natural linearly descending line of eg a steam engine.  I^2 x RPM^2 is also the equation for a circle- that means that by adjusting those two parameters you can stretch the circle out in the RPM direction, like an air-core motor, or in the current direction, like most motors.\n\n[1]: why don't we use electrical steel instead of copper wires?  Well, by transmitting power at higher voltage we can basically have arbitrarily small losses in copper.  You can't do the same thing in electrical steel.  If we ran motors at super high voltages to avoid copper losses, then we'd end up with very high megnetic losses in the steel.",

"comment": "There are only 4 major US manufacturers who make this type of equipment, and no manufacturers that make the alternative. The equipment is highly expensive and complicated to manufacture so there will not be any competitor to come along and put them out of business, it’s essentially 4 companies that control the industry just like airlines and wireless carriers.\n\nI don’t think this issue is anywhere near any politicians main agenda. EVs, solar, and wind are easy and common ways for politicians and the general public to address climate change, but a little known electrical insulator isn’t going to be high on anyone’s list that I can tell.",

Plugging in battery storage allows the time of production to be stored until the time of use. I understand that is expensive to install to the grid. However, not all EVs can be plugged in all the time. I am thinking about apartment dwellers or denser housing where outlets aren't always accessible to stay connected.",

Look at the EQC SUV. wasn't competitive. etc.... I don't own a Tesla. But  I've owned Audis, french and japanese and drive a Kia Soul now. I have no skin in this fight.

L2 gives BEV owners the ability to arrive home near empty from a road trip and  have decent range available in the morning. If I had a BEV, L2 at home would be a necessity as  there is only one supercharger and one EA DCFC location within an 80mi radius. With a PHEV L1 works fine.",

Seems like the vision only finally has matched if not beat it. \n\nI think Teslas biggest issue with removing things like USS is to make sure it works before they remove the dang things. It just puts a sour taste in peoples mouth to ship it half baked, and then people remember the initial issues and not the software update that fixed it. \n\nI think that’s one aspect that fails in their more tech approach to move quickly and break things.",

You likely saw the difficulties with charging the prototype motorcycles when it was cold outside. Plus with tow to charge, you need the second driver to use the brakes, and I don’t think you’re allowed to normally have a person in the towed vehicle? \n\nStill a fun series to watch though👍\n\nI’m reading up now on maintaining the 12v in the hybrid (probably similar for your electric) with the traction battery in Ready Mode \n\nhttps://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2022/MC-10227923-9999.pdf",

"comment": "I agree on all counts. The actual Solmetric Suneye is an invaluable tool, and so much easier than the old dome solar path finder. The only issues I've had with the Solmetric is some metal roofs and other metal objects screwing with the internal compass (but this happens maybe 5% of the time). I don't know who would talk bad about the Suneye (unless they are referring to the app).\n\nI've had problems with just about all monitoring systems, and over half of the time it is caused by user error (home owner unplugging something, moving something, upgrading the router, etc). Sunpower SMS 1.2 has been the worst (it uses a weak, unreliable, internal wireless signal, in addition to relying on home owner's network equipment). Envoys can be tricky. Part of it is a matter of educating the home owner, but that still won't stop their security system installer from unplugging the Envoy to open up a new port or whatever unforeseeable event may occur down the line. I think it is funny that Enphase has moved away from showing home owners panel level production information. The new web platform is slick looking for sure, but they clearly had way too many home owners looking at their lifetime production numbers per panel and asking why one panel produced so much less than the one next to it (yes, that is the panel we put next to the chimney which gets 15% more shade, but we went with a microinverter to account for such losses).\n\nMy bigger issue with Enphase is the high, high failure rate of the m210s we've had in the field for the last couple of years. Sure they are covered by warranty, and they may have fixed the issue with the latest batch of m210s, but the amount of money we get from them rarely covers our cost of persistent service calls. And sure they pay the homeowner, in some cases, for lost production and at a good rate, but it doesn't make us (or them) look good to call every 4 months \"hey, looks like another device has gone down, sorry about that, is it OK if we get on your roof and change it out again, and again, and again\". M215s seemingly have a significantly less failure rate. We will see how things end up in a couple of years.",

"comment": "It is true that we are getting better at getting hard-to-reach oil -- so long as we are willing to pay the price.  There are hard price floors for different kinds of oil.  For example, if the price drops much below $70, production in North Dakota shuts down until the price recovers.\n\nYou are right that it's damn hard to find anything with the utility, transportability, stability, and energy density of oil.  The billions of dollars spent trying to find alternatives testify of that.  My hope is that demand will naturally follow the decline path of production so we can smartly transition to other things.  Unfortunately, we tend to have problems when those two things don't match up well.  For example, all one one of the post WWII recessions was immediately preceded by an oil price shock.\n\nI agree about nuclear.  When you have 1,000,000 times the energy density of oil, you can waste a lot of energy (or fuel) and still have lots to spare.  You are also correct about battery storage.  There is progress, but it isn't nearly as rapid as people generally believe.  I hope to see something like SkyTran replace cars in certain cities in the future.",

"comment": "Right, but even before solar was around demand itself was never flat. It was predictable so they adjusted energy production for it and they knew which times of the day demand would be highest.\n\nIf you pull up a different diagram for a different day of use in CA it will look mostly just like that one. Solar panels make power when the sun is out, no news there. \n\nThe times of the day coal, natural gas etc. is needed to meet demand will shift but its not completely unpredictable. \n\nCoal plants will sacrifice some economies of scale because fewer and fewer of them will need to be running 24/7 but that's kind of the point.. If a coal plant can't stay profitable selling power for just 6 hours a day then raise the wholesale cost of coal power for those 6 hours so that they can. \n\nPower demand is still higher in the day then it is at night and solar power is meeting demand for 11 of the 15 or 16 high demand hours. Here is another interesting tidbit from the article: \n\n&gt;Sometimes the price goes to zero. Oddly, it can go even lower. When demand is very low in the middle of the night and the wind is blowing hard, there may be too much electricity on the system and grid operators will charge generators that want to add more. \n\nThe author even admitted here lowest demand is typically in the middle of the night. As soon as its not the middle of the night, solar panels pick up the heavy lifting from that point forward until just before sunset. The author seems to be guilty of heavy bias too.\n\n\n&gt; But if the hourly price for energy is suppressed by wind and sun, suddenly the nuclear plants can’t make enough money to keep running....The 40-year-old Robert E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant on the shores of Lake Ontario in upstate New York is becoming an example of an emerging trend. Its income from selling energy is down because cheap **natural gas** and growing sources of renewable energy have depressed the market.\n\nSolar is not currently a significant contributor to upstate NY energy production, but natural gas is and has a very low LCOE. He is blaming renewables because a nuclear plant is getting edged out of the market by a fossil fuel. \n\nAlso:\n&gt; In most states they get “net metering” — that is, if a utility charges them 15 cents a kilowatt-hour for energy, it pays them at the same rate when they produce. The payment relieves the panel owner of all the other costs of electricity — maintaining capacity for hours when the sun does not shine, and moving the electricity from the producer to the consumer, all wrapped into the retail rate that consumers traditionally paid, and that now the utility pays the panel owner.\n\n\nBy the authors own admission, the cost of wholesale electricity is lowest in the middle of the night, sometimes 0 due to the nuclear power plants and such not wanting to spin down operations. Home owners are trading credits in the middle of the day (when wholesale costs are higher) for credits at night (when wholesale costs are lower). Overall the utility is still on the winning end of this trade agreement but author seems to go out of his way not to present it that way.\n\nIf the system actually reflected wholesale energy pricing like the author implies 1 credit given to the utility company in the day would likely be worth 2 or more at night, not 1.",

"comment": "First off, ask your accountant how much do you pay in state taxes each year (and involve him on the project). \n\nFederal Tax Credit is 30% of total cost. This can be taken in year one and carried forward 20 years.\n\nDepreciable Basis is 85% of total cost. The effective value is roughly 85% x $4.50/W x Your Tax Rate. However, it must be taken over 5.5 years, so its actually slightly less than that. Typically another 30%.\n\nNorth Carolina Tax Credit is 35% of $4.50/W. However, it must be taken evenly over 5 years, with a 5 year carry over if you can't use it all. It can only be up to 50% of your tax liability each year. So if you buy a $100k solar array, you will need to pay between $10k - $20k in taxes each year for 10 years to use its full value.\n\n30% + 30% + 35% = 95% subsidized. My disgusting recommendation is that you should go with the most quality builder on the bid list, irregardless of price, as you really aren't paying for the array, provided you have the tax basis to do so.",

Of course, I also assume the rating of the battery can't be bigger than the rating on the inverter.  I have a tiny 3kw (SolarEdge SE3000). I suppose I won't have the ability to stack a second powerwall without buying another inverter.",

"comment": "Aside from the permits and such, solar power is really not all that hard to understand, and spec out.\n\nIf you own a UPS (you know those battery powered boxes that keep your computer running when the power goes out), you are already using a battery and inverter to power stuff in your home.  Solar works like that, except the solar panels power the inverter, and the power is routed to your power panel.\n\nYou map out the space (south facing and slightly angled is best) on your roof so you know how many panels you can/want to install.  You pick your panel (get a pallet if you can to reduce costs).  I like Enphase; having a little inverter on each panel really works for me and I love the monitoring aspect of Enphase.  Pick the rails you want to use (I went with wholesalesolar on specing things out).  You will need a bunch of hardware to lag bolt the rails to your roof, a switch box for the power, the \"big cable\" to interconnect all the inverters, but that's about it.  The electrician will wire everything together.\n\nFind an electrician that does not mind getting his hands dirty installing panels and pulling the permits.  Someone that has done it before is best I would think.",

I mean let's say that it is true that you would only get an extra couple of thousand dollars.  \n\nYou have 10 kw of solar so you have $6,000 worth of modules and $3000 in the inverter and another $1000 in racking etc.\n\n$10,000 give or take.  Now you take it off your house (do you hire someone?).  You have to fix the roof holes and pay for that.  Now you transport your system to Texas.  You now have to pay for permits, installation etc. and hope that the utility has favorable metering laws and accepts used equipment.  I would guess that your $10,000 worth of product is now worth considerably less.\n\nI would document any savings you get per month in a \"For Dummies\" format and I would guess that you will be able to show that someone could afford a higher priced house based solely on the savings.  That is if it is saving money.\n\nI am not saying that the appraisers are wrong, but the value of a bunch of used solar panels and an inverter is not as great as you would think.  I would leave it on the house unless I had a solid plan for the materials.",

They had to examine the new rates and fees for net metering because the previous cap had been reached.  People expected the rates etc. to decrease and solar to be less of a bargain.\n\nWhere it went all haywire is when they chose to change the rates for all existing solar customers.  Now peoples investments are severely compromised.  Some people will never even break even.\n\nPeople who have leases like with Solar City may pay more than if they had nothing on their roofs which will create a potential shit show.  Look at Solar City's stock today.\n\nI was at the Carson City meeting and it was filled with pissed off people who had serious concerns and felt totally screwed.\n\nThey are getting away with this because they are the authority for these matters.",

"comment": "I definitely agree that Cowspiracy used a lot of misleading statistics and downplayed other major actions we should take as a society, like political support for renewables and divestment from fossil fuel. So shame on them for that.\nThe thing is, veganism is something you can to today, that also has a major impact on the climate.\n\n A lot of people can't afford a Tesla, or to put solar panels on their roof yet. It will take time to get political incentives and technological advances before these are widely available. The article you link cites a 15% figure for contribution to climate change for meat eating. That's huge when you consider my next most in realistic options are changing my light bulbs to LEDs and reusable grocery bags.",

You didn't account for number of cloudy days in a row in the cloudy or rainy seasons.\n\n&gt; 1x 250W solar panel * 5.5 = 1375W...\n\n2) This calculation is meaningless. \"Sun hours\" are a squishing of actual hours. We get more than 5.5 hours of sunlight in the summer and 4.5 hours of sunlight in the winter. We're not vampires.\n\n3) 12 solar panels x 250W x 80% = ~~13.2KWD in the winter\n~~ 3kW D in winter at high noon. FTFY. \n\n&gt; Battery Calculations...\n4) 12V system Lead Acid = 50% AH Lithium ION = 80% AH\nThis is also meaningless. Which battery technology are you actually trying to use? It looks like you're trying to use lead acid. IF you size for 50%, you're going to drain them all the way to zero and they won't like it. You need to size to an average depth of discharge of around 15% if you're going 10% lead acid with no backup generator, and use industrial forklift FLA batteries. So without checking the rest of the calculations, you need to increase your battery size by 4x.\n\n5) Assuming you use 1kWh/day and don't want to do any load leveling, you need a 260W array to offset 100% of your annual electric use. For off-grid FLA, you really want to look at winter when your production is less. In all liklihood, you need 2x 260W solar panels, 1 kW charge controller, 12kW inverter, and 5kWh high-end FLA battery bank or 3kWh lithium ion bank.",

I understand I will not be able to bring that kind of PC with me on the road, but the build I linked in my original post is a small form-factor, energy efficient PC that will still handle some of the gaming I like to do. Since I don't have access to that PC to test the wattage, all I can do is go off the power supply it uses (which I think is 500w)",

Apparently, my “contract” is with the park not me.\n\nSo, I contacted the park for permission, got it (I was the first, and still the only), and proceeded to install my panels.\n\nNo permit, no “net metering”, no worries about changes to the contract :-).  If I pull x kwh from the grid, and my panels feed x kwh into the grid… we are good… I pay $0 to the park, and my credit never expires.\n\nI wish everyone could have it as simple…",

While it doesn't invalidate the findings here, obviously the practical side of this is a major challenge, as industrial-scale ag will not work effectively if it has to navigate relatively tightly-spaced solar plants.\n\nSo I doubt this would be cost effective for farmers unless they're growing a unique, specialty crop whose high prices can support productivity losses, and/or if they're facing shortages of suitable land or severe water costs (future of the American West?) and that's the main cost they need to minimize. And even in a case where all of that's true, I'd think inside within a controlled greenhouse is a better bet than outdoors beneath solar panels.",

"comment": "I would talk to some of the local (not national) solar installers in your area. They will know the particular things to look out for in your set up and might be a big help in designing and permitting. Can’t hurt to ask\nYou might have better luck if you get the electrician or solar installer on board before you buy the equipment. There are better and worse parts out there and you can’t make a good system with poor parts. \nI don’t know what things are like in Texas but where I work many electricians will let you work with them. If you and your kids are handy I bet you could mount the panels which is a time consuming part of the job that many electricians don’t like. \nAs far as your budget I think it’s workable if you do most of the labor and if the system is small. While this size system may not wash away all your bill from the pool it would lower your cost. I think it would be a great project and a nice size to take on for your first one.  \nIt makes me smile that you want your boys to help. Working for my dad is where I started. \nGood luck",

If you are financing then it is important to take into account the interest at the end of the loan when calculating everything.\n\nI used this site to find out the total principle + interest for each loan.

I plan on paying it off sooner as it'll drop my cost per watt.\n\nI know the panels you are looking at are premium panels and mine are not.  Silfab has a 25 year production warranty on them down to 82%.  Most premium panels are 90-92% at 25 years.  So you are covered under warranty to produce a bit more from them over the full 25% years.  I'm hoping that 25 years from now panels will be dirt cheap and I can just replace them.  Making that 8-10% difference not worth the cost.\n\nI'd try and find another installer or two, get some more quotes and make them fight for your business.  Maybe even look into non-premium panels similar to Silfab.  They might be worth checking out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

They are like guns they are expensive toys that give people the illusion of freedom. But the reality is that if your earthquake happens on a cloudy day the next day your batteries will be flat.\n\nAnd while you are claiming that \"we\" are forgetting maintenance on the genny you are forgetting the equivalent on the powerwalls. No, there isn't a yearly maintenance cost on them but every year they become less and less useful which is a cost. In 10 years a well maintained generator is likely to work as well as it does today whereas the powerwalls will run at a reasonable fraction of their capacity. Year 11 the powerwalls could pack it in and suddenly your \"yearly\" maintenance costs were the cost of the things /11.\n\nAlso as gets pointed out in all these threads they are a terrible terrible financial decision. They'll never recoup their costs without massive install subsidies and tax breaks.",

This is a common occurrence if grid voltage is already above normal and thin or long wires are used to connect the solar inverter. \nThis is why you won't see it in the morning or evening or at lower power levels.\n\nYou should check the error messages on Sunnyportal or the EnnexOS portal. This will give you the reason if there are interruptions to the operation.",

So when the panel gets shaded or it gets cloudy, the incoming dc voltage doesn't dip and knock the inverter out of it tolerance range. If you tried to direct wire it in from a pv panel, then you'd risk having the inverter shut off every couple minutes due to a cloud or a bird shitting on the panel depending how close your system was designed to specs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs Hank said, for an emergency situation you can't be the price comparison of a gas generator. Solar is a long term solution that is definitely worth the investment for prolonged outages. But a small system you may only need for a few days, twice a year, isn't cost efficient.",

"comment": "Why do you want to go off grid? Going off grid is going to really increase the price.\n\nI say don't get the batteries. Batteries are expensive, especially compared to net metering cost. Here are some links to net metering with Southern California Edison:\n\n* [https://www.sce.com/residential/generating-your-own-power/net-energy-metering/getting-started](https://www.sce.com/residential/generating-your-own-power/net-energy-metering/getting-started)\n* [https://www.sce.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/NEM%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf](https://www.sce.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/NEM%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf)\n\nUsing net metering is most like using the grid as a battery, but at an almost unlimited size.\n\nIf you want to get into the details, figure out the difference in cost of your system for with and without batteries. Then figure out the difference in your monthly cost for with and without batteries (i.e. to cost to connect to the grid). Then figure out the [payback period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paybackperiod.asp) for the batteries.  My guess is that the payback period for the batteries will be more than the life of the batteries--meaning buying the batteries will not be worth.\n\nFor example, lets say that you want to get $10,000 of batteries (after incentives), but the fee to connect to the grid is $25.  Basically, you're spending $10,000 to save $25 per month.  At that rate, it will take you over 33 years of monthly savings to get your $10,000 back.  Since the batteries probably won't last 33 years, that's a bad investment.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to get batteries to protect yourself during power outages, that's fine, but then you have to look at the cost of alternatives like a generator and gas--which is probably cheaper unless you have some sort of horribly unreliable power company.",

"comment": "&gt;\t100€ per year.\n\nThat sounds like an extremely small house.\n\nYou need several numbers:\n\n* cost of pellet stove installation, and cost of heating per year\n* cost of electric heating installation, and how much electricity he needs for heating per year\n* how much electricity he uses per year (not including heating)\n* cost of electricity in €/kWh\n* what price your power company buys electricity if you produce too much\n\nA solar install would provide electricity all 12 months, so even if heating is more expensive, your total yearly costs might be less.  Or not!  You have to gather your number and do the math to find out.\n\nSomething else to consider is solar hot water heating - not making electricity, just using the sun to heat your hot water.  You can have both solar water heating and solar electricity, if you have enough space.  Solar panels can be mounted on the ground if you don’t have enough roof, but do have space.",

"comment": "Sure - and that’s the reason 50% of rooftops in California have solar, yet &lt;5% in FL do. It’s also possible to get much closer to $2/W, especially after the tax credit, if you steer clear of Enphase and REC/LG - but most residential consumers only seem to get a hard on for that infrastructure. \n\nIf you start a solar farm, you only get paid wholesale. The thing is - solar is still proving to be a good investment. Many companies are signing long term power purchase agreements - Facebook signed a 170MW PPA, Anheuser-Busch signed a 310MW PPA, Amazon did over 6.2GW of PPAs worldwide in 2021. This means that the independent power producer is still making money, the utility still charges distribution costs, and the company is still getting power cheaper than before. \n\nIt’s the people who sign on at $4.5/W with Sunpower who are losing, but most people seem willing to do at least a minimal amount of research.",

"comment": "I don't think using a battery in this way would make financial sense. Best case scenario, I see is that there's a 10 year payback period, which is just kinda of ok. I think someone would be better off just investing their $8,050 (a low-end cost of a Powerwall after the federal tax credit) into the stock market.\n\nAs best as I can tell, electricity in Georgia cost $0.20 per kWh. A 90% time of use discount would mean that it the cheaper rate is $0.02 per kWh.\n\n[A Tesla Powerwall costs $11,500](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/solar-alternative-energy/reviews/tesla-powerwall-cost) (which is actually low for right now, but I'm just going with that) and if originally installed in 2023, that would qualify for the 30% federal tax credit. Net cost: $8,050  \n\nThe Tesla Powerwall has a usable capacity of 12.2 kWh. Also, it has a roundtrip efficiency of 92.5% so, 12.2 kWh x ($0.20 per kWh - ($0.02 per kWh / 0.925)) = $2.18 savings per day. \n\n $2.18 savings per day x 365 days per week = $794.32 savings per year.\n\nIf we assume a 2% - 3% annual electricity price increase and that the Powerwall will lose something around 2% - 3% capacity per year (the Powewall has a warranty saying that it will retain at least 70% capacity at 10 years), then the savings will remain more or less constant. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to say that annual savings will remain at $794.32. \n\n$8,050 / $794.32 per year = **10.13 year payback period**\n\nI wouldn't get a battery to take advantage of TOU charges here.",

"comment": "From a portion of that study:\n\n\"If any excess electricity exists after inflexible and current flexible loads are met, the excess electricity is sent to fill electricity, heat, cold, or hydrogen storage. Electricity storage is filled first. Excess CSP energy goes to CSP electricity storage. Remaining instantaneous CSP electricity and excess electricity from other sources are used next to charge pumped hydropower storage followed by battery storage, cold water, storage, ice storage, hot water tank storage, and underground thermal energy storage. Remaining electricity is used to produce hydrogen. Any residual after that is shed.\"\n\nIt's basically a magic box solution.  They just assume storage technology will be there.  They even gave a prioritized list of how it should be filled!  LOL!",

"comment": "Sorry friend, you have been fed the Enphase and solar edge coolaid. Watch this video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9GvhDhCSJgo. Modern solar panels will prevent shading on their own. The main reason Solar edge and Enphase type systems have something attached to every panel is mostly to accommodate rapid shutdown at every panel which is required by code. Detached non habitable structures such as a barn. Do not require rapid shut downs to protect first responders in the event of a fire. The OP absolutely should do a central inverter with no optimizers to save cost. I would pick a fronius or if they can afford it SolArk. Those are both considered commercial string inverters and will last longer than a Solaredge which does require optimizers.",

"comment": "> Yes, the standard enphase chargers work as usual, with priority from solar and whatever software features. If you are asking if your Autel charger can be controlled by the enphase system - not directly. You'd need some home automation stuff in the middle like home assistant. Bidirectional charging is coming and may influence your future battery plans.\n\nDangit - I just got the Autel too, LOL! Ok - well at least I can use the Tesla charging scheduler. I can work with home-assistant as well; needed an excuse to set it up anyway. \n\n> Normal on grid operation works as it does for you now, there are no extra limits. The batteries and PV are only limiting you when off grid.\n\nI guess this is where my confusion is: If I have the battery wired up not as backup, but as consumption (i.e. grid-tied) and say the solar array produced 10 kWh when I want to charge at 10 kWh - then that's what would be used and not the battery, or the grid, right? But if the solar array can only do say 8 kWh - then it'd be solar + battery for combined 10 kWhy rate? And - if it's night time and the battery's max output is say 3.5 kWh - then it'd be battery + grid?",

Using an EV battery pack for your solar bank sounds like a genius move, especially with those kinds of specs and price tags you're eyeing. Plus, sharing that solar power between houses is just next-level neighbor goals. \n\nI haven't personally tried it, but I've heard some success stories from folks who've gone down that route. Just make sure to do your research and maybe consult with a solar expert to ensure everything's good to go.",

The return on investment will be slower because you’re not using the surplus yet. Pending on your utility’s nm policy, you would effectively have a piggy bank of additional energy that you plan on using in the future.\n\n  \nHaving said that, it may be wise to get your electrical upgrades completed on the earlier side rather than waiting.",

"comment": "Aside from the lack of common sense or scientific support for any of her claims, it annoys the piss out of me when people say that there is some sort of divine right or mandate about meat eating. According to Genesis, animals were not made to be eaten. \nGenesis 1:29 says \"Then G-d said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.\" \nG-d wanted Adam to eat plants. The animals were his companions that he was supposed to care for. It was not until after the Fall that humans began eating meat. It seems like if I were going to try and be a good Christian, I would want to behave more the way I was supposed to before I got kicked out of the garden. Wouldn't it possibly be upsetting to G-d that people are eating the animals that were originally created to be our companions? There are in fact people who have gone vegan for biblical reasons.\nJust saying it, cause I figured no one else would bring it up.",

That's reality b/c the shame of not being a part of the group is more intense than the shame of doing even the minimum ethical action that's unpopular. I mean, just look at this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegans Do people seriously think that veganism is stupid? Maybe it's not for you, maybe you're addicted to meat fat and dairy protein or whatever but it's certainly an intelligent choice with generally only positive personal results. I don't argue with people any more, there's no point. The reasons for veganism are \"all of the above\", there actually isn't a bad reason to be a vegan (or vegetarian).\n\nAn animal is just a concentrated transmission device for plants. The majority of our soybean production (GMA mind you) is fed to animals bred for consumption along with actual animal parts mixed in. Why not just skip the middle man and eat the plants? It will feed 12x more people and we don't have to deal with the disgusting animal issues. Veganism is actually the easiest and simplest mental leap to make but it's the most difficult socially but there is no wisdom in the crowd. In fact, your life depends on going against the crowd in most cases.",

I'm not talking about people who have chickens and eat their own eggs. There's nothing environmentally wrong with that.\nSome Facts:\n70% of all the grains we produce in the US and 50% of the freshwater goes to raising livestock for slaughter. Raising animals for food uses 30 percent of the planets land mass. Livestock are also responsible for 64% of anthropogenic ammonia emissions, which contribute significantly to acid rain and acidification of ecosystems, 6% of CO2 emissions, 65% of nitrous oxide emissions, 37% of methane emissions.\n\nhttp://veganskeptic.blogspot.com/2010/11/being-vegan-is-worse-for-environment.html?m=1\n\nhttp://guardiannews.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet\n\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/infographic-veganism-and-the-environment/",

What are you getting at? Restrict peoples reproductive capacities to a certain amount of children? Hell no. As much as I hate to see stupid people reproduce I am even more opposed forced abortions, sterilization or contraceptives. \n\nWhat can you do? Pay nice taxes, make education free for all throughout higher education. Problem will solve itself. \n\nNow... what the hell does this have to do with veganism if one is not also an anti-natalist of some kind?",

But she's also a really forceful and abrasive advocate for x-treme (even in raw vegan terms) diet faddism. Her diet plan is 30-40 bananas or countless sugary dates all day, every day -- then some sort of fat-free soup for dinner. She blends them up in enormous revolting smoothies. Needless to say she comes from a background of disordered eating/anorexia.\n\nEdit: even more disturbing is that her videos and posts on instagram get hundreds of comments from people with legitimate medical disorders like type 2 diabetes saying they are ignoring their doctors and switching to her super-high-sugar plan because \"her results speak for themselves\" (she is super skinny).",

That's not necessarily a good thing, but I've had blood work done, and am doing quite well thanks, I imagine in part to my vegan diet, but that is a side bonus.  That is like like 1/1,000th of the strength of the ethical reasons for being vegan for me.\n\nEvery raw place I've been to has gussied up the plate to seem like something it's not.  I don't want a raw \"burrito\" because it tastes like crap and a normal salad would have been so much better...  Some of it's ok, but I usually get some sort of stomach issue after eating at one of those places.",

"comment": "For those who are really missing cheese, two types of cheese that are fairly new that IMO really are amazing are:\n\n* [Chao cheese](http://fieldroast.com/chaostory/) from Field Roast (as someone above mentioned). Really tasty, doesn't really melt as well as daiya but it reminds me a lot of the aged mozzarella my Nonna used to have for me or the cheddar I'd love eating with apples. The texture is a little more on the processed cheese side but still very good.\n* [Miyoko's Creamery.](http://miyokoskitchen.com/products-miyoko/) Harder to find (I live in Canada and I get it from vegansupply.ca, it's expensive though) but so. good. This stuff tastes just like the fancy aged cheeses I missed. I went to a talk with her at Veg fest and I tried samples of most of her cheeses. They are all amazing and all have that \"sharpness\" that I find lacking in other vegan cheeses. This is expensive but so is fancy aged dairy cheese. Miyoko has a book on how to make her cheeses too (although I understand the recipes are sort of hard to get right) and just as an aside I really love her [homemade vegan pantry book](http://www.amazon.ca/The-Homemade-Vegan-Pantry-Staples/dp/1607746778), it's really a \"game changing\" book for me. \n\nKeep in mind I've been vegan for 5 years and I've been dairy free for longer due to an allergy. So your mileage may vary but damn this stuff is soooo much better than pretty much every other cheese on the market, and I'm a Daiya liker.\n\nedit: grammar",

"comment": "But, the agave can be removed from the old agricultural model by using ethical vegan business models. For all we know, they could be grown in space fifty years from now. Honey bees can't come to a golden moment, they're the essential element in an institutionalized form of fauna abuse. Vegans are on a pathway. \r\rIt's no different from developing a country through a labor model. When developed it can reduce the impact of labor on the country. It's a pathway where in the early stages the country is no different from any other 'brute' society. In conclusion we know many societies turned out to be radically different to a nation of tribes and clans. \r\rIt's not as overly sophisticated as the author believes. Avoiding honey abides by a clear and obvious logic which doesn't follow the cognitive dissonance products of the omni world.\r\rOmnis can risk everything (including world war) for a dog or cat. But, flip their lids when vegans complain about dead pigs on the dinner table. If they flip it over honey, it's probably just another cognitive dissonance issue that prevents them seeing eye to eye with vegans.",

My position is that [being vegan is a binary state](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/you-cannot-be-100-percent-vegan/resources) (either you are or you aren't), and consuming/using animal-source products when you have no other choice _absolutely_ fits with [the \"practicable\" part of the definition](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) of the philosophy of veganism. Of note, [BSV has a great report in which she covers exactly this issue](http://bitesizevegan.com/vegan-health/is-medication-vegan/).",

"comment": "But how do you feel? The way I see it carnivores eating other animals is just the circle of life. What I don't support is the needless suffering and death of animals used for consumption by herbivores/frugivores. When sourcing your pets food you can always try to find a source that doesn't support factory farming. But if you must theres always the vegan pet food option. Even if it did shorten the life of your pet by a year or 2 you would save countless other lives. Most pets get overfed and become obese and don't get exercised anywhere near as much as they need. So if u went with a vegan pet food but only feed once a day and exercised your pet properly I'm sure it would live a long healthy life.",

"comment": "There are no strict rules for being a vegan. Being a vegan means you try to avoid unnecessary animal suffering wherever you can and as much as it is practical for you. There are some things that come naturally with being a vegan like not eating meat or animal products this also includes buying leather. It is not very hard to find faux leather and it's usually cheaper than the leather alternative. You are consistent with your beliefs as long as you can justify it to yourself. Just being alive will have an impact on other animals and especially insects. Everyone has to decide for themselves what is acceptable and what is not. Some vegans eat honey some don't for example. But once again leather is something not very hard to avoid. Just ask yourself the question: \"is the life of a cow worth less than the comfort of not having to find a belt, and shoes without leather in them\". And there you have the answer. Good luck !",

Also as I mentioned in a different comment, all meat causes cancer. It's the heating of ANY muscle tissue that causes carcinogens to form, and so yes, even just eating meat once, that's increasing inflammation in your body, your risk for cancer goes up, cholesterol, sure these numbers and negatives don't go up drastically from one time, but the point is you WERE harmed even by just one time, and so if it was even one time with small harms, it's small harms that you didn't choose and that someone put upon you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can LIVE on an omnivore diet, that doesn't make it healthy. Just like you can live while smoking cigarettes. That's not proof of it being acceptable for your health, just that you can maintain life even with that unhealthy lifestyle. You CAN be unhealthy as a vegan, but you're always unhealthy as an omnivore or carnivore. All the same nutrients you get from meat, can be gotten from plants without the negative side effects like inflammation and carcinogens. So this is still definitely on topic.",

The way I look at is is that the product I am purchasing is a good product, and we need more products like it in the world to replace animal products.  \n\nThe grocery store where we buy vegan products makes lots of money selling meat, dairy, and eggs.  They are big supporters of those industries.  It's great to support vegan products sold by completely vegan companies, but I do not find it necessary or even helpful to restrict all purchases to these items alone.  Ultimately the goal is the elimination of animal agriculture, and there will be many players involved in this process.",

"comment": "[The Honey Industry | The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/why-go-vegan/honey-industry) (sources cited in article)\n\n&gt; **Unethical practices**\n\n&gt; Conventional beekeepers aim to harvest the maximum amount of honey, with high honey yields being viewed as a mark of success. When farmers remove honey from a hive, they replace it with a sugar substitute which is significantly worse for the bees’ health since it lacks the essential micro-nutrients of honey.\n\n&gt; In conventional beekeeping, honey bees are specifically bred to increase productivity. This selective breeding narrows the population gene pool and increases susceptibility to disease and large-scale die-offs. Diseases are also caused by importing different species of bees for use in hives.\n\n&gt; These diseases are then spread to the thousands of other pollinators we and other animals rely on, disputing the common myth that honey production is good for our environment.\n\n&gt; In addition, hives can be culled post-harvest to keep farmer costs down. Queen bees often have their wings clipped by beekeepers to prevent them leaving the hive to produce a new colony elsewhere, which would decrease productivity and lessen profit.\n\n&gt; Honey’s popularity shows no sign of slowing. The honey industry, like many other commercial industries, is profit-driven where the welfare of the bees is often secondary to commercial gain.\n\n&gt; **Environmental effects**\n\n&gt; Mass breeding of honeybees affects the populations of other competing nectar-foraging insects, including other bees. Overwhelmed by the ever-inflating quantities of farmed bees, the numbers of native bumblebees have declined.\n\n&gt; The importing of honey into the UK also increases our carbon footprint through the emissions associated with transport. Of the honey consumed in the UK, 95% of it is imported, mostly from China and Turkey.",

"comment": "My biggest struggle is that my toddler doesn't want to stop playing or go inside to eat so I have to make food soooo enticing and fun. Not sure if you are in the same boat. \n\nMy toddler LOVES soup even tho its a fuckin mess so I get a lot of good food in her through soup. She loves a coconut red lentil curry soup, potato/corn/quinoa chowder, basically anything especially if it's \"creamy\" with soy milk or coconut milk. I think a lot of kids love soup. \n\nShe prefers raw tofu so I set hers aside after I press it and don't mess with it. Loves rice, quinoa, roasted vegetables. Calls most sauces \"sour\" or \"hot\" so I cook plain food in bulk to build bowls and meals, set aside sauces and chili pepper for the adult meals for now. \n\nAlso, I call every seed or ground nut topping \"sprinkles\" and let her put it on herself. 😂👍 this is a very enticing activity for her. and if we are having a vegan treat for dessert I put it on her dinner plate with the rest of her food. she will come to the table because she wants the cookie and alternate bites between the treat and dinner (I find it weird but whatever) Or eat the treat and realize she's still hungry and eat dinner. \n\nLikes cashew milk the most and loves the b12 \"candy spray\".\n\nConsidering how picky toddlers are, offering from scratch vegan meals which she eats some of instead of chicken nuggets she eats some of.. I would say she is getting better nutrition than a kid who is not vegan.",

They will see a rise and use them to open up more franchises that will result in more animal deaths. Even if the menu is half vegan that still leaves the other half animal products. Instead of aiding in the expansion vegans should be advocating for vegan grocery stores and better supply routes for those who have it hard to get vegetables. You don't need vegan mock meat from restaurants/fast food businesses but you need beans rice potatoes etc to live. Shop local. If you absolutely feel the need to have these mock meats then do research and find vegan companies and support them or look up recipes and make your own.",

I have seen quite a few people going vegan because of us showing graphic footage on streets. It's maybe a couple people per day in our somewhat small city, but it works. \n\nHowever, nobody gets converted, every single person I have witnessed going vegan because of our activism already had the right mindset and heart. We didn't need to convince them, their 'what about protein', etc arguments came from a place of not knowing, while their heart was already full of compassion.",

But I don’t eat plant-based as a “fad” to lose weight, it is about reducing needless suffering. I am also driven by the environmental benefits, and the amount of water saved. I do it because in a climate emergency, it is the single most impactful thing for the planet that I can do as an individual. \n\nI’m sorry that we, as vegans, so often feel that people are out to “troll” us that when someone is trying to start a dialogue about something that your immediate instinct is to attack them. This is a community where standing together is important because one voice won’t make the mass change we need to globally move to a plant based diet. \n\nI’m genuinely curious about the dating apps because it’s so morally significant to me that I couldn’t be in a relationship with someone who turns a blind eye at animal cruelty. I have met many people who have encountered hostility because they are vegan, that’s a potentially dangerous thing I should be aware of as a young woman wanting to get into the dating scene. \n\nIt’s too bad that vegans get a bad rep because of vegans with attitudes like yours! I’ll try to make this an encouraging space for people to be curious  and make mistakes in their journeys of veganism and self discovery.\n\nEdit: typos",

It’s really not that hard for us to find things at regular restaurants and usually there is more than one option for us so honestly, she’s just being stubborn. I totally get going to New Orleans and wanting to eat creole food I feel like a lot of people would really enjoy that but then she has every right to try some of it on her own! \n\nA few weeks ago I was away on a bachelorette trip. I had literally zero issues finding food at all the regular places we went and I was the only vegan. Except one day, we wanted to eat one place but there was no parking. We went to another place and I could kinda tell lmao but the girl literally said yeah we’re not really vegan friendly here. I knew everyone was starving and I really wasn’t at the time so I’m like y’all can just stay I’ll find something later on and everyone disagreed and said they’d rather find a place we could all eat EXCEPT FOR one stick in the mud who had a hissy fit about it and acted like I was a huge inconvenience. It was so weird. Honestly no one cared except her it was like a bar restaurant too it wasn’t like the food was gonna be out of this world.",

"comment": "I admired him for his good heart and said morally he is right. I'll be honest, I was a bit bummed at times that we couldn't share in certain experiences and I might have rolled my eyes once or twice when something had to be made vegan that we both ate over the years. But that was immature on my half. He never pressured me. And I ate lamb... And things. I was even on keto for a while. But I made it clear to him that I think morally he's right and I'm wrong.\n\nWhat led me to become vegan was more of an accident rather than a conscious effort.\nThere was my friend's 11 year old autistic but vegetarian son. I helped him pick his buffet foods at scouts at the Xmas party and his resolve to not eat anything that wasn't vegetarian (he doesn't understand vegan yet. He's the only vegetarian in his family and his family is trying to get away with that as long as possible) was very heart warming. No matter how yummy it looked, he made me check the back of the packet and it took us forever to fill his plate. That left an impression. Mentally he's seven but his resolve is so strong.\n\nThen we watched the twin experiment on netflix. My husband asked if we could skip on the animal bits as he doesn't like seeing it as he's seen enough. But I said I wanted to see it. It showed me that no matter how much I try to buy higher welfare meat, I will inadvertently eat the most cruel one as well. And it's everything. Fish, chicken, beef, pork...At this point we were 5 years into our relationship. Not much happened really but when we went out for dinner a few days later I planned on getting a ribeye. But when we got to the restaurant, his favourite meal was off the menu. He couldn't decide between the two options so eventually I offered to just share them with him and not have my steak. The meal was very nice and so.. I kinda went oh. I won't have meat as much I guess. A few days later I noticed I still didn't have any and said you know what. I'll try be vegetarian and allow myself 3 cheat meals a month. 3 weeks later I noticed how I couldn't bring myself to order meat, even when out with my friend for lunch. So then on my way to work I ordered an oat milk latte instead of a regular one (I used to hate the replacement milks) and found to my surprise that it was quite nice. So then I thought that vegetarian was just half assing it.. So decided to just go the whole hog.\nSo yeah I slipped into it really. I don't see myself going back. I don't miss meat and it's kinda gross now to see it in a supermarket. Getting over dairy was surprisingly easy. \nAnd now I find myself talking to colleagues who are curious and informing them about how bad the UK is for mass production of animal products. How much suffering there is. I watched the proper documentaries after i made the switch, just to educate myself.",

How do I get out of paying taxes?\n\n\n3. How do I feed a child in Africa when I live here and Canada and cannot afford my own groceries at times?\n\n\n4. How do I make the world stop discriminating against women and black children?\n\n\nNo really, tell me how I as an individual can solve these issues and Ill do it right away. I'm really so excited that I can cure world hunger and racism around the world with whatever method you have in mind. Thanks!",
