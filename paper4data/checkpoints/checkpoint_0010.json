I also read things I don't post. Before last week (when I finally stepped into 2008 and got a smart phone) I spent my first hour at work reading the stories then posting what I liked. Now I do that during my hour long train ride. Do you really think it takes more than an hour to read a couple dozen news stories? ...How slow must you read, to think that it would be a problem to read what I post? \n\nI get paid to read the stories, so suggesting I don't read them is silly. I don't get paid to post them, that I do for funsies. We've been over this. You can't possibly think that someone would pay an employee to post things to reddit (that they aren't getting ad money or link referrals or making sales on, obviously). \n\nAnd the news I get in the morning isn't somehow filtered or edited for maximum alarmism. It's just the most important climate stories, or really it's just most of the climate stories. \n\nIts intended audience isn't the public or activists, it's the media. Reporters need to know what other reporters are talking about in order to avoid unintentional plagiarism.  By performing this service, we allow reporters to figure out what hasn't been written yet.\n\nAny sort of biased preselection of which you're referring to would defeat the purpose and alienate the intended audience. At the end of this comment, I'll paste in all today's stories. You can decide if there's some sort of insidious bias. \n\n&gt;I'm suggesting you are paid to push ~~an agenda, yes.~~ climate science.\n\nFTFY. If we had an agenda (besides 'pay attention to the science'), we would lose credibility with the media. That should be pretty easy to understand. As biased as you may feel the media is, remember to think about it from their point of view-they'd be mortified if they were tricked by advocates into running something misleading or biased.\n\nToday's Climate Stories: (They are split into an 'above' and 'below' 'the fold', categorized by US News, then World News, then Opinion, top half bigger stories, bottom half lesser stories)\n\nWapo - Obama plans to renew immigration, climate change efforts \n\nWSJ - U.S. Boosts Pipeline-Safety Research \n\nBloomberg - Low Natural Gas Price to Hamper U.S Energy Efficiency,IEA Says\n\nNational Journal - Interview: California's Top Oil Regulator on Fracking, Climate Change, and Fossil Fuels \n\nLAT - South Los Angeles residents fuming over oil field\n\nBloomberg - GM Chief With Eye on Tesla Announces Natural-Gas-Powered Impala \n\nLAT - Cadillac announces price of all-new ELR plug-in coupe\n\nBloomberg - Outdoor Air Pollution Causes Lung Cancer, WHO Says \n\nGuardian - Australian scientists plan to relocate wildlife threatened by climate change \n\nWSJ - Wildfires Rage in Australia, Homes Destroyed\n\nBusiness Spectator - Carbon tax repeal could be costly \n\nWapo - Japan’s shocking, deadly deluge from Typhoon Wipha: 33 inches of rain in 24 hours\n\nAP - EU Carbon Tax Plan Would Impose Fee On All Flights In European Airspace \n\nReuters - European airspace carbon-fee plan set for bumpy ride \n\nWSJ - Asylum-Seeking Man Cites Rising Seas \n\nReuters - Pacific man seeks climate change asylum in New Zealand\n\nGuardian - Coal executive turned climate change activist fights for seat on BHP board \n\nBloomberg - TransCanada Expects U.S. Decision on Keystone XL by End of March \n\nAP - US shutdown threatens hopes for Antarctic reserve\n\nGuardian - German Green party ends coalition talks with Merkel's CDU \n\nGuardian - Attenborough: poorer countries are just as concerned about the environment \n\nNYT Ed - The Disappearing Moose\n\nOregonian Oped - Chris Wold - Living within our carbon budget \n\nWSJ Oped - By Fred Upton &amp; Greg Walden - How Obama Puts the Brakes on Business\n\nPatriot News Ed - Corbett administration not eager to issue global warming reports required by state law  \n\nFox News Oped - Marlo Lewis - Balance is not bias -- Fox News critics mislead public on climate change\n\nNYT - Nicholas Kristof Column - This Is Your Brain on Toxins\n\nBellingham Herald - Environmentalists sue EPA over ocean acidification\n\nAP - Mass.

BBB is a paid service just so you know, no indication of quality whatsoever. Same with diamond certified. \n\nPm me if you'd like more advice. HERO is not a bad program/company but their interest rates are typically in the 8 - 10% range. Their target market is really people who don't qualify for traditional financing (lease or HELOC) if that gives you any clues...

Since the most obnoxious, squeakiest wheel, always get the grease... They drove the local politicians nuts in L.A. recently, demanding that various streets in the city have lanes removed and turned into dedicated bike lanes. *Blah blah, exercise, blah blah, good for the environment.* Problem is, this city doesn't have enough lanes to begin with, so taking more away is beyond stupid and going to cause massive problems. Especially when a minority of unemployed losers were the only people who were going to use the bike lanes. After all, who's going to ride their bike to work in 95 degree heat and smell like BO all day?\n\nSo when the traffic on those streets got even worse than before, the backlash was pretty bad. They've now put many of them back to the way they were. Question is, why do politicians listen to a minority of zealots in the first place? I got into it with one of these people a while back here on reddit. This obsessed bike guy (I assume young and single) thought the fact that he only owning a bike and doing everything in his life within a couple miles of his place.. meant that there was no reason why everybody couldn't live like that. And if they resist, well... No problem, we'll just FORCE them to get out of their cars, by making their lives even more miserable in traffic. HE just rides a bike, so what's the problem? The fact that some people maybe actually want, or have, to travel more than two miles from their home (because they actually have a life), didn't register with this guy. The concept of a mom having to pick up her kids, go to the store and do other things that can't be done on a bike... made no difference to him. Because, hey, fuck them, blah blah, bikes are good for the environment. The moms can suck it, right? This is the mentality of people like this.

I could actually seeing someone for whom price isn't a big concern getting the BEV version to use around town, perhaps even picking it above a Tesla.\n\nBut at the same time, the REX version, to me at least, seems really silly. The gas tank makes it so that using it for medium-length to long trips wouldn't work (\"drive an hour, stop, fill up, drive an hour, stop, fill up, drive a hour, stop, fill up\" sounds like the worst drive ever), so like... what's REX's purpose?

I just made a family vacation with one leg from Minnesota to Louisiana and using the Tesla supercharger trip planner it had me making 9 stops (using a Model Y long-range model) which added at least 350-400 miles over the route I drove and 5 or so hours total charging time to the trip. I was towing a 3-4000 pound trailer on that leg so it ended up being a 2 day drive with 4 stops for fuel totalling perhaps an hour. If I'd had the Model Y LR it probably would have stretched the drive to 3 days. Glib comments like no one needs a truck are ridiculous and demonstrate a pronounced inability to understand needs beyond one's own. Some areas of the country have don't really have the charging infrastructure yet and are not amenable to trips that are more energetically taxing.

This shows that the ICE fleet has remained constant and that EVs are supplementing ICE cars and not replacing them.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.22145651068503033,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2814377819244328,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24035848069455806,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09266076609492302,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23302628522013716,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2796132125357538,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1069005186339685,"ev_1":-0.16193942442885328,"ev_2":-0.19597889033490898,"ev_3":-0.09370884802078518,"ev_4":-0.08503978031997643,"ev_5":-0.20359110516893142,"ev_6":-0.11870322313623177,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.07098611141118454},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

When you get a house you can use it there as well, and even sell it to someone else latter for a downpayment on your own residential system.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006109069101512432,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13618694794790934,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3137674526986685,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2447922450049873,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13821918316898518,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16662064923582298,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1314428111848732,"solar_1":-0.12555801398231026,"solar_2":-0.06445927841514126,"solar_3":-0.027397344483688357,"solar_4":-0.09364866207335568,"solar_5":-0.003080886621319223,"solar_6":-0.009515049304657927,"solar_7":-0.008712845906605557,"solar_8":-0.12268225326382283,"solar_9":-0.025798673328360167,"solar_10":-0.18444032329918075},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

My client has taken his small town in Mississippi to over 15x more PV generation than the state average. \n\nOur local power utility co-op often makes the top 10 central USA \"solar friendly\" utilities list due to our efforts. This is depsite Mississippi lacking any sort of net-metering law. In fact only 25% of our state has any sort of large array interconnection policy, and we have to compete/participate within a multi-state incentive program just to qualify for our local interconnection! \n\nAfter we install our 1MW project later this year, we will have brought our state up to the national level of solar power production per kwh consumed, almost singlehandedly. We're participating in some SunShot projects, developing some commercial solar leases, and spending some time on our own R&amp;D. \n\nPolicy set backs can be frustrating (Arizona, Oklahoma), but ultimately, solar power is unique in that it is a market-ready consumer product. Exponentially increasing demand for storage systems will give fuel cells, batteries, ultra-capacitors, and other storage technologies significantly more investment dollars to propel us past the 10% market saturation point we'll acheive over the next two decades. \n\nI personally believe solar has the potential to completely wipe out the fossil fuel market over the next 150 years, and could even result in a society that generates electricity for \"free\" in the distant future, eliminating many problems such as carbon pollution, starvation, access to fresh water, and poverty in general. Star Trek universe anyone? If any market ready technology can get us there, it's solar power.\n\nHopefully we'll be able to avoid drastic climate change + nuclear arms proliferation in the meantime.

I don't buy tools that I'll use a lot.  but tools I use a little, or arn't intended to be used \"hard\"... yeah, no problem, especially when I was first starting to kit out my tool boxes.  Now that I'm several years, and many mistakes, in I don't spend too much time/money there for tools.  But they have plenty of other things that help augment my home projects.\n\nC)  Onto the solar Panels... Me and several of my buddies work in the solar industry, and have various projects centered around these kits.  One guy uses one to power an irrigation system at his house.  another uses one for a portable work stereo/battery charging station.  Another uses one to power a dog house fan and a couple of outdoor lights.   \n\nThey are great for those kind of micro-projects.  You might have to re-solder, or somehow modify them to fit exactly your needs in the project, but they tend to produce exactly what they say they produce, at their given voltage and current values.   nice and stable.  Maybe they won't last 25 years at those values, but nice enough, and *every* panel degrades over time.\n\nYou're not goingto integrate it into your home, however.  chiefly for legal reasons.  Your local utility will have interconnection requirements and safety standards.  a 45W harbor freight module won't meet them.   aside from that, 45W is smaller than the proverbial 'drop in the bucket'.  I design/install 8kW systems every day that handle only 60% of a homes needs.  Fine that your needs are different, but let's say a 4k handles 80% of your needs (which is a fairly common occurance too, given teh right home and homeowner); that 45W module is going to supply less than 1% of your bill.  On an average bill of $80, that's less than $.80 a month.   Even if you stacked these, and then tied them into your panel, you're still just not being cost effective.\n\nIf you are serious, or even half serious, about going solar for your home, look into a real system.  I put small systems on homes for anywhere from $1/W to $2.70/W, depending on local incentives and installation situations.   In practical terms, what this means is that for anywhere between $3k and $8k (waaaay less than the cost of a brand new car), you can have a 25 year money making investment sitting on your roof.  Let me write that out.... a measly $5000 can put solar on your roof.  Look into it.  [Call contractors in your area](http://www.nabcep.org/installer-locator).\n\nAnyhow, I highly suggest you get your kit and start farting around with it.  figure out a few projects you want to do around the house.  \n\nGood Luck!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.325834044226871,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24987443825375522,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11636843243987573,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2153600931570682,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11106557716385623,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25908428126507643,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09528254899487365,"solar_1":-0.3147167202744943,"solar_2":-0.05333284181538147,"solar_3":-0.005273128951860902,"solar_4":-0.01677999053208623,"solar_5":-0.0017235137614359057,"solar_6":-0.04087786944971109,"solar_7":-0.002287946847597292,"solar_8":-0.015474393675200796,"solar_9":-0.05301846570391433,"solar_10":-0.0418495786919569},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (for option C, as it describes shared expectations among the group of friends who use Harbor Freight solar panels for micro-projects).","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

So storage does matter because big renewable infrastructure ideas don't float in the \"free market\" and if storage matters then I don't see how you can dismiss solar thermal with thermal storage out of hand. To the contrary, it seems the perfect mix would be PV alongside solar thermal with excess storage and the base storage would be maintained by the solar thermal and the power curve of PV could be evened out by storing the excess in the solar thermal storage units. \n\nBatteries will never be as cheap as thermal storage because the primary media in many thermal storage systems is gravel. You can't get much cheaper than that. What could happen is that the cost of batteries can be transferred to the public in the form of automobile batteries and that the production scale can become so vast that the prices will seem reasonable to a public that is already accustomed to being gouged with retail prices. I think most assume the latter is what will happen but thermal storage is still a viable option and there's not reason you can't use it with PV as well as thermal or to integrate the two into a single facility. \n\nI estimate that at $0.30 per watt PV becomes equivalent to thermal at the point of production. Here is what I mean by that: Currently, solar thermal really is very cheap at the point of production --it's a solved problem-- but the issue is where you go from the point of production. Thermal energy is very difficult to transfer once it is concentrated and that's where the costs begin to come in. When I say \"point of production\" I mean literally the point at which the concentration of sunlight occurs. Once you begin pumping the working fluid you start to lose fast and then you lose more in storage and more in conversion from thermal to electric and more in your grid interconnect. But if PV panels were really thirty cents a watt it would be quite reasonable from a cost perspective to use them in place of thermal panels to simply dump their heat into resistant heating elements in molten salt storage. \n\nMoreover, molten salts are not the ultimate form of thermal storage. There's nothing about gravel that says it can't go over 600C. Instead of salts you can go with eutectic metals as your fluid in vats of recycled glass and bring the temperatures well into the 1500C range where you begin to see both superheated steam which can run much larger and more efficient turbines but also all kinds of industrial applications like cement, glass, aluminum and steel production or high temperature waste incineration. Solar thermal is not tapped out by a long shot.

I agree that solar must \"pay its fair share\" for use of the grid.  What has happened in Nevada is a bit weird, as the rates and rules for the customers that were incentivized to build solar have recently been changed.  Previously most states have kept people who were early adopters \"grandfathered\" in a certain rate class.  With the current rate structure proposed by NV Energy ($38 monthly charge for solar customers by 2020) small solar arrays will never pencil out.  The main issue seems to be a bait and switch technique where customers were incentivized to build solar and then get very little benefit.\n\nThat's why I commented on this story because I see many inaccuracies in assuming that grid tied PV is a sure safe investment.

Our text states:\n“Because year 2020 electric generation infrastructure is not predetermined, we explore a range of electricity technologies rather than attempting to predict future electrical generation and dispatch deterministically”. In general, we take the differences in coal fraction among projections to be evidence that the future electricity fuel mix is not predetermined, which reinforces our decision to frame our results as alternative scenarios rather than deterministic predictions.\n\nYou also glossed over a key conclusion, \n\n&gt;\"EVs powered by low-emitting electricity from natural gas, wind, water, or solar power reduce environmental health impacts by 50%\" \n\nPNAS subsequently published this rebuttal from Assaf Oron, \"[Electric vehicle footprint analysis is misleading](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/30/E3973.full)\"\n\n&gt;Second, for coal proportion, Tessum et al.

All signs indicate the trend will continue: coal plant closures are announced frequently with almost no new ones built (4), and renewables increase faster than the EIA’s projections. The EIA now adds a more realistic “accelerated coal retirement” version, forecasting coal fractions of 34% in 2020 and 29% in 2030 \n\nThe study authors (Tessum, et. al.) offered this [Reply to Oron: Electric vehicles provide an opportunity to reduce environmental health effects of transportation.]\n(http://www.pnas.org/content/112/30/E3974.full.pdf) \n\n&gt;As we conclude in our report, EVs present an opportunity—the only opportunity\nwe found in the scenarios we analyzed—to substantially decrease the health\ndamages from our transportation system, but only if we as a society ensure that\nthey are powered by electricity from low emitting sources. \n\nThis study is the centerpiece in a video from the controversial climate contrarian, Bjorn Lomborg and the ultra-right wing PragerU.

If you live in Texas where your nighttime grid is mostly wind or the PNW where it's mostly hydro, that nets out in terms of carbon, but other places you may still be using fossil fuels if that's what your night-time grid uses.\n\nThe next step of the analysis though is utility rates -- how much comes out of your wallet. You may net out your *energy*, but does that net out the *price* you pay? A lot of places that have EV-specific rates are on Time-of-Use (peak and off-peak pricing instead of monthly tiers) so you have cheaper electricity at night. And when you layer on top of that things like the rate your utility buys solar electricity from you isn't the price you buy electricity from them (or worse, have the annual true-up months...), well, it gets quite complicated.\n\nAll that said, though, you DO still save money in the long run.  EV's are just more efficient energy-wise (hence the MPGe's in the 100's), and adding solar makes you more resilient and self-sufficient! Solar is a great investment, solar + EV is better.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2149910582229495,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3000471630675135,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20283665980508428,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3149983803674919,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19446380233466698,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06306245144999896,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08040604783066858,"solar_1":-0.20915889233337445,"solar_2":-0.31014330308703175,"solar_3":-0.0012793326583656988,"solar_4":-0.3033402161793977,"solar_5":-0.0034669226782474047,"solar_6":-0.001361915276599272,"solar_7":-0.002721249471505871,"solar_8":-0.007145859880135201,"solar_9":-0.04607971335578043,"solar_10":-0.24270414640583718},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (implies that solar is a good investment but acknowledges complications with grid and utility rates)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Not everyone cares about that reason which is my main point. If the financial aspect was more lucrative, more people would care.\n\nAlso Kansas homes just don't have solar panels, and it's not something many people would even care about when buying a home, so it's really hard to gauge and bank on any added resale value. Especially since your average American family moves every 3-5 years, there's just no payback yet.\n\nI guess my main thing is: if my payback period was less then 10 years I would do it in a heartbeat, but that's not the case. The majority of homeowners would do it if the payback was 5 years because most people can see themselves living in a house for 5 years. \n\nMy sister lives in Phoenix, AZ and it's always so neat to see how many homes have solar panels - because their payback is closer to 7 years there due to all the sunshine and air conditioning costs.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2600351121153853,"1.1.1_stance":-0.028208925767102194,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.25407153550975164,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17698451885299468,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06012478843331337,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3297775066139964,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1975385491581013,"solar_1":-0.16600605375609978,"solar_2":-0.1995119738918219,"solar_3":-0.19370337315861738,"solar_4":-0.27981475290078084,"solar_5":-0.12608528776956948,"solar_6":-0.0010549610597081482,"solar_7":-0.002623230654232126,"solar_8":-0.07624865063977875,"solar_9":-0.09154700219975591,"solar_10":-0.1279940896104866},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The fees come out to only around $8-10 a month which isn't bad at all. Its the principal more than anything. It bugs me that I can produce a huge surplus but no matter what, the profit to the electric company from selling that power never goes towards those charges. Paying ~$120 a year to stay connected to the grid is certainly a pretty good deal in my state. Some states where they are charging over $100 a month in basic service charges to solar customers would certainly change my opinion and I would really start looking to go off-grid with 2-3 Tesla Powerwalls at that point.\n\nI would absolutely let my neighbors charge their cars at my house for, say $20 a month, but EVs are not particularly prevalent in this area and I am pretty sure the two BMW i3s I have are the only electric vehicles in the whole neighborhood. \n\nI have a hybrid hot water heater in my Home Depot online shopping cart. Still trying to decide if I want to switch my gas water heater out for it. The payback period would be like over 10 years even with the $550 rebate my power company offers for hybrid water heaters. Natural gas is just so darn cheap but I really want to cut down on my carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions so I might just go for it anyway despite it not making much sense financially. Its the same deal with the gas dryer and house heating I have. The gas is so cheap that it makes it really tough to swallow the price of changing that equipment over to electric models. I think I am going to live for a year without switching anything out and see where it all stands at the end of the year. I do plan on getting a few electric heaters for the rooms I spend the most time in. That will be cheaper than going to a whole house heat pump and it will allow me to burn up some of the excess electricity banked through the year while reducing my gas bill from an average high in the winter of around $200/month.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.26781821375091636,"1.1.1_stance":-0.04849703442908192,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2790725345025561,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21049375740664356,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14781960689190948,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19635010341746478,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05316401940460006,"solar_1":-0.21717170473198016,"solar_2":-0.1447511278746539,"solar_3":-0.17995402339955122,"solar_4":-0.2815478192567644,"solar_5":-0.04096764470159542,"solar_6":-0.01549397258834991,"solar_7":-0.03696234361996176,"solar_8":-0.07538687226376277,"solar_9":-0.025151275700395104,"solar_10":-0.17762469534357372},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear\n\nThe text mentions some behaviors and prevalence of electric vehicles in the neighborhood, but it's not clear if these are descriptive norms as they are not explicitly stated as such.

Your CC likely has a max output of around 3500W which would be three strings of three, so most likely it will not take advantage of this extra solar, though it shouldn't damage it. You may even get a little boost in low irradiance times during a Bulk charge when the battery is low. Keep in mind that other than when the battery is low and bulk charging (an hour or so a day), rest of the time it is in an absorb or float charge which is using only a fraction of the available solar power.\n\nWhat I am trying to say, is it should be fine as far as device ratings go, it may even help in low irradiance times, but your system may not get a ton of benefit from it most of the day depending on a number of factors.\n\nThe reason I sound unsure is I dont normally work with Victron equipment so I do not know for absolute certainty.

Without breaking out my load calc spreadsheet, I'd guesstimate you are right near or over capacity. The SunPower guys probably saw this as a physical space issue, and since they likely want to finish your install as fast as possible, they wouldn't suggest a panel upgrade as that is another day onsite. If I were quoting this job, I would recommend an upgrade. I charge min $2800 for them though. If you go the replace route, make sure the solar guy hires a stucco/plaster sub to repair the wall. If he insists he can do it, say \"no thanks\" and hire your own.

One of the reasons I like this idea is its potential for multiple uses - retrieving nuclear space junk that could cause a disaster when it comes down - once that junk is dealt with - building a giant solar array that folds out from the top of the tower - and prevents polar regions from sunlight hitting newly melted/melting ice caps. Could also serve as a space-based launching pad for the moon etc - so that space companies could cut fuel needs in half for satellite deployment. This would not mess with the whole atmosphere of the earth the way sulphur dioxide would - it would reflect sunlight from the fridge of the earth though - our polar regions. \n\nIn addition to gigantic world influencing projects at the poles, substituting cargo airships for containerships could block sunlight from hitting the ocean in the tropics - and help humanity decarbonize transportation worldwide:\n\nsee r/airship for my 'Arguments for airships'","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.003849739364037911,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28736204585584224,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16229902148890762,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14966787459949651,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2405555176352196,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2721828125570783,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20369380402068296,"solar_1":-0.13998758494785885,"solar_2":-0.1304490827510893,"solar_3":-0.15233749127825527,"solar_4":-0.0813286303273344,"solar_5":-0.07276406898132509,"solar_6":-0.0097024519018305,"solar_7":-0.017586003142544843,"solar_8":-0.01818804180220468,"solar_9":-0.21560613246401772,"solar_10":-0.19413164870543093},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

To try to answer your question, I would point out that all the costs you’re considering are prior to installation and assume that the job will be done well, and if it isn’t the cost or liability of fixing your roof, electrical wiring, or even just the aesthetics of an ugly install will be absorbed by the installer. \n\nYes, you could potentially save $10-$20k diy. So you order the parts all separately. You’ve got 25 solar panels leaning against a wall in your garage somewhere for the 6-9 months or more that it takes for you to navigate permitting, designing and submitting admissible blueprints that you presumably don’t pay an engineer to do for you (saves money). \n\nYou finally do get the greenlight and install the system yourself on weekends where you find time. Assuming you are a very handy or lucky and manage to correctly install the system on your first ever attempt without making any mistakes and it comes out looking acceptable to your personal standards, then congrats, you just saved $10k over 10 months having done quite a bit of time consuming unpaid research and labor. \n\nMore likely, you will make a mistake being that its your first attempt at doing so. You will likely get sick of dealing with all the headaches that never reach most people as they are handled by a back office who are of course real people who require salaries and benefits etc to make the whole experience as quick and painless for the homeowner as possible. \n\nAlso consider that you would be testing this project for the first time ever on what is probably most valuable and expensive asset you own/ever will own, and your primary if not your only dwelling. \n\nDon’t forget the roof warranty. If you install solar on any roof it voids the current warranty. This is typically replaced by the installer with a new 10-25 year roof warranty to cover their work. This too would be backed by your own bank account instead.\n\nSo with that and probably a handful of other factors to consider, is it worth saving $10-$20k (that you’d likely finance anyway, so $50/month) to diy? Again it goes back to how handy you are, and if you consider it worth the risk that you screw something up and end up offsetting that savings having to redo it. \n\nAlso consider that while you evaluate the objective investment value of solar from the perspective of an investor who can do or not do it, your “investment capital” is being syphoned into a sunk recurring expense that is objectively more expensive, unpredictable, and offers you no closure or ownership/equity in the situation. You are already tied up in that. So, while waiting for the perfect deal might be wise in a neutral position, waiting for the next iphone while you tote around a 1990’s brick phone is less prudent imo. \n\nSide note: I would imagine you could probably order all of the parts to a BMW and assemble it yourself and save some money. Same goes for your house. Some people do build their own homes and it turns out great for them. Most don’t.

I eat vegan because I don't trust a label to tell me how something was raised, kept, or slaughtered. According to M4124124, I'm not really a vegan because of my beliefs and because I eat honey (I grew up on a bee farm... I know what they're like and I don't think there's anything wrong with it). Maybe I'm not a vegan by definition but that's the closest adjective I can come up with to describe my philosophy toward eating (and it's what virtually anyone with a concept of veganism in the general public would call me). I know there are others like me in this subreddit. I know for a fact that one of the mods takes cod liver oil for his health. I guess it just feels like this subreddit has changed. It feels like it used to be more about eating vegan food and less about animal rights. There's a whole other subreddit for AR. Does this make any sense or am I just rambling?

There are a lot of people with a lot of different conditions. And while there are people who could probably abstain from those things given the right doctors, dietitians, and access to food/supplements/meds/whatever, there are people who do have issues and don't know what else to do. In those cases, I do think it is excusable for them to do what it takes to keep themselves reasonably healthy. It doesn't help the animals they eat, of course, but I don't see a difference between doing that and taking a prescription that was tested on animals and may contain lactose or gelatin. And, perhaps I am wrong, but I think most vegans wouldn't sweat the latter too much if their health was at stake. \n\nBut have I heard of a condition that requires one to eat meat, etc.? No, not really. There was something about a temporary extremely low carb diet for extreme cases seizures I read about but that was the closest and I'm not sure there wasn't a vegan version or couldn't be if people were committed to developing one. And if you think you have a disorder that requires you to eat other animals, then I think you should continue to look for ways to avoid eating animal products even if you do eat them for now. And, certainly, eat as little of them as you absolutely have to. \n\nThere are a lot of people out there (doctors included) who are very misinformed about diet. And so, there are a lot of people who don't find the help they need when they have nutritional problems on a vegan diet. It's often assumed that there isn't a vegan solution when there is. For example, if you have low iron, you might be told that you have to eat animal products to get the right type of iron. That is wrong. Plant/non-heme iron can work just as well if not better than animal/heme iron, BUT you need to take it with vitamin C. And if your doctor encourages you to eat animal products like eggs and dairy for iron, then you should really be skeptical of their nutrition advice. See http://www.theveganrd.com/2010/11/do-ex-vegans%E2%80%99-stories-make-the-case-against-vegan-diets.html for more info. \n\nAlso, others here have mentioned it, but everyone on a vegan or near vegan diet should be taking a B12 supplement. Do not wait until your B12 stores diminish. Take it now. Low B12 can definitely cause mental health problems. See http://veganhealth.org/articles/vitaminb12 for more info.  \n\n&gt;(The actual consumption of meat feels good, and there are also feelings of satisfaction after the eating process which is not the same as vegetarian meals)\n\nThat part is psychological. I get it. It doesn't excuse it, imho, but I do get it. Maybe you can look into vegetarian meals that are more \"meaty\" or have more fat? Seitan, TVP, and Gardein would be high on my list.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.17284585908055305,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2945169737388943,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22993239752521052,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26404999642599064,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.36975002929151696,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.28042375029485894,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.28562982380385193,"diet_1":-0.21972374141689327,"diet_2":-0.2609023225813871,"diet_3":-0.10442245701710817,"diet_4":-0.07311981965153472,"diet_5":-0.07863385464346113,"diet_6":-0.1991770860258839,"diet_8":-0.052318319562497585,"diet_9":-0.09188232554394442,"diet_10":-0.21185198087672083,"diet_11":-0.06784309290378587,"diet_13":-0.0421608647350998,"diet_14":-0.10393188286814355,"diet_17":-0.09816764611605322},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Small portions of meat (particularly some types of fish) to boost the protein, B vitamins, etc will improve that.

You'll actually not be cutting that many things out of your diet.  For example... how many different types of meat do most people normally eat?  Beef, chicken, and pork make up the vast majority of meats consumed.  And then, when you consider those are often drowned in sauces, it becomes even more clear that you won't miss them much when they are gone.  You may, however, want some heavier foods to fill the general craving... like potatoes, avacados, nuts, tofu, or things like that.  And again, you can put very similar sauces on them.  \n\nOne thing I'd suggest is to be very selective about which meat and dairy substitutes you use.  While some are very good, some are god awful.  Certain vegan \"cheeses\" make me cringe at the mere thought.  On the other hand... there are some fairly common meat substitutes, usually tofu-based, that are really tasty.  You've just got to learn to differentiate.  The same thing goes for soy-based ice cream alternatives.  \n\nBut really... it's mostly about getting into the habit and not making a big deal out of it.  Contrary to popular belief, I don't think most other people usually care whether or not you are a vegan these days and that's even more true for simple vegetarians.  Just learn what you like, experiment, and go with that.  There is no shortage of variety in terms of plant-based foods you can eat.  \n\nAlso, if you are concerned about nutritional requirements, I'd suggest finding a good multivitamin.  You don't necessarily have to take 3 horse pills a day, but one a day would probably fill any nutritional needs if you're accidentally doing the whole vegan thing wrong.  The secret is to eat a broad variety of vegan foods and then you won't have a problem.  \n\nGood luck.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16355873132124543,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0434111130113403,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27864133440196087,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3033358580139376,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.35565279937803834,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2691201615402346,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03175330423978551,"diet_1":-0.012762341531924903,"diet_2":-0.0009827703203579101,"diet_3":-0.009501148324488895,"diet_4":-0.22849978225770218,"diet_5":-0.007038305121265391,"diet_6":-0.005458323763984178,"diet_8":-0.0014382509555919871,"diet_9":-0.008141451651075235,"diet_10":-0.19009218563670982,"diet_11":-0.0031504427812857707,"diet_13":-0.005240981481620111,"diet_14":-0.0121142476091336,"diet_17":-0.0008421215000756396},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Yes, eating 50g of processed meat will raise your cancer risk by 18% but relatively that's 5.2% -&gt; 5.9% (quoting from memory). They also said processed meat was the same as smoking because it's in the same carcinogen band. That is true, but the bands are not a measurement of severity - it just means they're both definitely carcinogenic. Finally I believed they tried to compare eggs to cigarettes if I'm remembering right - which is unproven.\n\nOverall it's a good movie that shot itself in the foot by being needlessly misleading about those things.

Yet, when talking with a religious family member or friend, there are things that I keep to myself because it’s not something I will be able to change their personal belief on, right?? Like, they know I’m an atheist, I know they’re religious. That’s… it. Me directly or indirectly berating them for their belief isn’t going to help a single person in that situation, just like berating a person for eating meat is (90% of the time) not going to stop them from continuing to eat meat. It might actually push them farther away from being willing to understand or accommodate veganism. \n\nIt’s not necessarily that OP is *hiding* themselves, but that speaking up won’t do anything in certain situations.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00015335628268076107,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05013451855270432,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17852248772569013,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.0667088342209657,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.33205534719163554,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.05864364528891031,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1407805440527833,"diet_1":-0.009507623947380731,"diet_2":-0.000835332913993625,"diet_3":-0.015847578360990155,"diet_4":-0.002978345739393262,"diet_5":-0.001144009239700002,"diet_6":-0.0018529578519519418,"diet_8":-0.0010800270720210392,"diet_9":-0.0007888805800272772,"diet_10":-0.007448767535000418,"diet_11":-0.0020384590558630102,"diet_13":-0.008733329372868562,"diet_14":-0.03601653006626293,"diet_17":-0.004143379347321267},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

She has accidentally been getting 'infertile' people pregnant in her clinical trials, which is incredible. I came on here searching for some plant based recipes that closely follow the incredible nutrition that is in the Wahls Protocol (Dr Wahls yerself does help her patients modify the protocol for vegetarians).\n\n\nI encourage you to take a look at the nutrition parts of the protocol and borrow her books (recipe book and more importantly book on the protocol) from the library.

The number 1 reason people fail to maintain a vegan diet when first starting out is that they under-consume on calories.  Vegan diets are by nature less calorically dense than vegetarian or omnivorous diets so anyone who has lived thier whole life eating a set portion based volume (how much of the plate is covered) is going to eat that same amount and not get the right amount of calories.  This leaves people feeling cranky, tired, and generally not good causing them to think \"maybe veganism isn't for me\".  Eat like this for too long and you might become underweight or suffer a nutrient deficiency.\n\nTo combat this I recommend that at least while starting off, try to eat as close to whole food plant based as you can.  This means you should try to cook your meals yourself from scratch with little to no processed oils or refined sugars.  Center your meals around a whole grain (brown rice, barley, oats, quinoa, millet, rye, etc) and a vegan protein (tofu, tempeh, lentils, beans, and chickpeas).  Then also include a healthy portion of vegetables and leafy greens.  I personally struggle with leafy greens but have had success cooking them into savory dishes for dinner.  They are super important.\n\nIn the begining, allow yourself to over-eat if you want but don't force yourself to.  Your trying to find the sweet spot that will make your body feel happy and healthy and this is different for everyone, every day.  If you do feel hungry throughout the day, keep a snack handy... like fresh or dried fruit, nuts &amp; seeds, or a veggie smoothie.  I personally like pitted dates filled with peanut butter, or trail mix.\n\nMany people in the US are deficient in vitamin D and B12, so it's a good idea to supplement those two wether you are vegan or not.  Vegans unsure of thier levels should supplement both of these.\n\nIf your not trying hard to reverse a disease or optimize your health feel free to reward yourself with a tasty vegan treat every once in a while.  There have never been more/ better options for awesome vegan restaurants, plant based ice-creams or other sweet treats, faux meats that regularly fool meat eaters, and plant based cheeses that get better every year.\n\nIt's not a race, and nobody is perfect right away.  You will fail and that's ok.  Concentrate on filling your stomach with good food that didn't have a mom or a face and didn't come out of something that did and you will be just fine.
