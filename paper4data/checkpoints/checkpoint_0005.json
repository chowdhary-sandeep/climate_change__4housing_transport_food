"comment": "I don't think Tesla Motors intend for battery swap to be the main method for recharging, but it's a great way to ensure newcomers to EVs aren't turned away immediately by the idea of plugging in and charging all the time.\n\nMusk has stated that he wants to boost the plugin charge speed to become competitive with gasoline refueling and I expect that for their range of vehicles, very high rate plugin charging will be the main solution for away from home charging.\n\nFor all EVs, wireless charging standards could become at least partially cross compatible at lower charge rates, and be linked with some form of data connection, either through the charger itself or via the car's built-in data connection, to enable higher speed charging for either subscription or some kind of points system.\n\nThe maths needs to be done on this and I'm sure it would work at a higher market saturation of EVs, but at the moment I'm not sure it's a viable model.",

"comment": "Hello, we at Portland State have been working hard to start Portland State's first ever formula electric race car.  PSU has done a combustion race car for several years and gets a significant budget, but since the electric race car is a brand new project, there's no funding for it yet.  So we've started a crowdfunding page &amp; video.  We've got a motor, controller, some batteries and electronics, but still have a ways to go.\n\nIf you could help spread the word and pass this along to anyone you think could help, that would be outstanding.  This is only the second year of the formula electric competition in the U.S.  We are hoping to expand collegiate racing by creating a race car that can be powered by 100% renewable energy, and be competitive with the combustion race cars, and some day leave them in the dust! \n\nIn the 2013 formula electric competition, only 5 out of 20 registered teams had a car in the event last year, and only one team passed tech inspection and was allowed to race their car.  We would like to strengthen the formula electric competition.  We have a talented team that is skilled in building electric vehicles and gas race cars, together we plan to build one outstanding electric race car!  \n\nThanks for your time.",

"comment": "Done some questionnaires and I always come out as green party. So I think that makes me pretty left. So far I've always voted democrat, but unfortunately it's largely motivated by fear of Republican human rights issues. I really wish I could vote for different representatives based on economy, society, and rights, but unfortunately I can't, they get lumped together in these over stuffed packages you have to deal with.\n\nAs far as politics go, I tend to look at it as there's no one correct method. If you're familiar with Sam Harris's \"moral landscape\", I think there is also a political landscape, with various peaks and valleys. I don't identify as capitalist, socialist, communist, democratic, whatever. I don't think it even makes sense to label a single country as one. The US has a capitalist oligarchy economy, a mix of democratic and oligarchy representation, with socialist public services. (I'm obviously misplacing some of those definitions, but you get my point)\n\nIt would be like trying to label all cars as either mechanically powered (combustion engine) or electrical powered (electric car). Neither is true, both are mechanical, chemical, electrical, kinetic, etc... depending on the part you look at. And then comes the hybrid or a dynamo, theyre right in the middle. Certain designs will surely work better than others, hence the landscape of peaks and valleys, but every possible combination could be hypothetically built. Many would be doomed to failure while others work great, but you'll never find a perfect design, there's always pluses and minuses depending on the needs. \n\nGovernments are no different, some can surely be horrible, but you'll never find a perfect one. Two seemingly opposite governments could easily be equal in terms of performance. China is starting to look like they are going to pull the name communist out of the mud that it was dragged through by various horrible dictators while the US, among other countries, has shown quite clearly that democracy can have some serious downfalls. I prefer to not claim any allegiances, although the US system has certainly been kind to me and my family, it has been cruel to many others.",

"comment": "The Volt will discharge down to a certain state-of-charge in its battery pack, then it will operate as a conventional hybrid; i.e. it will recover energy from deceleration and the electric motor will assist the gas engine when needed.\n\nThis is true for the other plugin hybrids as well, but the Volt is the most capable of operating purely as a battery EV before it reaches the low state-of-charge point where the engine kicks on.\n\nTwo caveats:\n\nThe Volt has a \"mountain\" mode, where the gas engine will run harder than necessary in order to charge the battery pack. The primary motor can use more power than the gas engine can normally provide, so this allows the Volt to use slightly more power in certain situations, like climbing steep elevations.\n\n2013 model year Volts also gained an \"EV hold\" mode, where the engine would kick on earlier and the battery charge could be held for a later time. This allows for example the gas engine to be used on the highway when it is most efficient, and then the Volt can switch to a battery EV mode with the remaining charge in urban environments where it is most efficient.\n\nhttp://gm-volt.com/2012/09/18/optimizing-route-efficiency-using-hold-mode/",

"comment": "&gt;That doesn't mean they are more right...\n\nOnly time will tell; however, the rate of heat accumulation in the entire climate system, including oceans, indicates that the more recent papers will eventually prove better.\n\n&gt;even the Curry/Lewis paper has an upper bound of 4C\n\nTrue.  That is a lower upper bound, if you'll pardon the verbiage, than those seen in the paleo papers, though.\n\n&gt;Yes, nuclear would be an excellent, but it's such a hard sell anywhere that it seems unlikely we'll see a boom in nuclear plants any time soon (pun not intended).\n\nExcellent pun, whether intended or not.  I think nuclear is expanding quite well outside of the U.S. and Europe.  I expect new plants to roughly offset retiring plants in the U.S. in the near term.  I expect nuclear will decline in Europe, except in France and Northern Europe.  Maybe Eastern Europe will see some sort of partnership with Russia, but I kind of doubt it.  Russia itself will keep plowing forward with new nuclear.  They are actually ahead in some respects, given that they are building their second active breeder reactor as we type (third overall, the first was retired).\n\nChina and India will be building nuclear at an increasing rate in coming years, and China has already been building like mad.  Several other countries in Asia and the Middle East will be bringing reactors on line in coming years as well.\n\nI'll be watching next gen reactors very closely.  There are a number of companies in the U.S. and Canada that are doing some good developmental work on small modular reactors.  The great part about modular reactors is that they can be factory built, not built on site.  It's China that really takes the prize with nuclear R&amp;D, though.  Last I heard, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had 400 PhDs working on their molten salt stuff.  They expected to have a test reactor online in five years, then start factory producing the things within ten.\n\n&gt;Renewables may or may not be as good a choice, but they do have the momentum, and when dealing with such large-scale projects momentum is the key. \n\nI am a fan of renewables in the right locations for the right purposes.  A year ago, I think I would have agreed with you that renewables have the momentum.  Lately, though, I'm beginning to wonder.  It seems that as subsidies have been withdrawn, the number of planned projects has dropped off rather precipitously.  The idea with subsidies was that they would be temporary while production facilities scaled up.  Now it seems as though the economies of scale weren't enough on their own.  It's still too early to say for sure, so I'll simply state that I have some reservations about drawing exponential curves on \"installed renewables\" charts.\n\nPersonally, I think that there should be some consideration of very large scale storage systems, particularly pumped hydro.  This would help every sort of production, renewable and nuclear alike.  Baseload capacity (nuclear) could be oversized, with spare production filling high-elevation reservoirs at night, then excess renewable energy could fill the same reservoirs during the day.  I think this becomes even more compelling if we factor electric vehicles into the equation.  Oversized baseload would allow cheaper charging at night.  A rough, sketch, I know, and really most applicable to areas with mountains, but that's what I envision.\n\n&gt;Anyway, I don't expect we'll agree on everything, but thanks again for the polite, reasoned argument.\n\nThank you as well.  I've enjoyed this conversation.",

Bulldozers don't travel huge distances, they work in a very limited area. Similar to the reason why corded electric lawnmowers exist, and work just fine so long as you avoid the cord.\n\n&gt;The problem is battery degredation.\n\nThis is not universal to all battery types. The Spark has a battery chemistry which can endure multiple quick charges a day, every day, with no premature degradation. Battery chemistries in the pipeline now have cycle lives of ~40 years. Reducing their lifespans by a few years wouldn't make any noticeable difference.",

Once I began to thrive on a vegan diet, my eyes were opened to how senseless all of the violence was, and I became more passionate about animal rights. I think this passion is what drives a lot of vegans to make arguments that many omnis find off putting, because it challenges the morals of good people who simply have a different set of priorities.\n\nI agree with you then that suggesting \"plant based living\" for those less concerned about animal rights is a good solution for environmentalists who are looking for affordable ways to help the planet when our leaders lack the will to do so. Not everyone can afford a Tesla, but most of us who can afford meat can afford a can of beans. \n\nI get a lot of curious questions from omnis who I know will never go vegan as long as meat prices and availability remain the same, and I try to advocate reduction since that seems like a manageable first step that people feel good about trying. Many of the curious are conservative Christians/ climate deniers, and to them I package veganism as a humanitarian issue, pointing out how many hungry people could be fed with the outsized resources dedicated to raising livestock. Many of these folks go on mission trips in Central America and Africa and this argument seems to resonate with them.\n\nHonestly, I don't care why people reduce the amount of animal products they consume. I'm just glad more people are doing it.",

"comment": "There is literally just one player. They could ask double of what Tesla does and still sell tens of thousands of units per year just because people want alternatives. Even CocaCola has Pepsi as an alternative, million dollar cars have more than one brand. This is just ridiculous to claim that it's too risky to compete against just one company that doesn't make even 10% in terms of units of what the big auto makers do. It's as if you're painting Tesla to be an unbeatable giant and asking me to view VW and the others as scared little mice. What is wrong with this picture? It's in stark contrast with the posturing they take as established brands and Tesla as a new brand with small manufacturing capacity. They can't be both impressive and meek at the same time. It's deception, warped reality, anti-EV propaganda. Not profitable? Too risky? Tell GM that, they went bankrupt making ICE cars which was supposed to be the non risky and profitable thing to do. Case in point, it's BS.",

"comment": "Tesla announced a million miles after being satisfied that 8 years and unlimited miles was reasonable, which is in line with Mercedes' 15 year warranty but not quite up to Hyundai's unlimited mile warranty for unlimited years.  These are simply things that have never and will never exist on a car with an engine.  \n\nIt sounds like you don't know what \"wear out\" means.  Batteries physically can't wear.  They can be chemically damaged but there is no wear because there is no movement.  This is why the same battery in a leaf with no thermal protections built in can lose 33% of its capacity while the same battery in another manufacturer's car won't.  Thermal damage is what kills batteries, extreme high and extreme low states of charge are what kills batteries, not use or physical \"wear\" - in fact, constant use avtually helps extend the lifetime of a battery - and in that way they are similar to engines - sitting for extended periods of time can destroy both an engine and a battery, and neither is destroyed from wear.\n\nI urge you to look these things up for yourself, there is a huge difference between chemistry and physical wear, and chemistry is the reason manufacturers are getting comfortable with infinite duration warranties on batteries.",

"comment": "As an owner of more than 6 EVs over the last 7 years, it might help to ask for insight from those who have owned for more than 30,000 miles or 5 years. Its hard to tell from the current answers how long one has had a car or how much they've been used, which play a part in the amount of repair or maintenance obtained.\n\nA few of my cars experienced hurricane Irma over a year ago. They were parked outside in a gated driveway tightly packed next to each other. No walls near the cars but between 2 two story buildings. No flooding occurred. 5 Mitsubishi i_Mievs. No functional damage. Damage to my fleet was 1 windshield, 1 side window, 1 tail light on separate vehicles was the extent.\n\nIf the battery had been flooded, it wouldn't have been covered under warranty. BTW, you can drive into 12 inches of water no issue. It likely would have been a considered a total loss, since the price of a replacement car would have been near the same as the battery plus installation, +$5000.\n\nIt is to your advantage to seriously consider the reliability of whatever car you're choosing if you're asking this question. I brought my cars out of the USA, so it means I'm SOL if any of the 6 big batteries bite the dust before my ROI. I choose very carefully, picking the car that has proven itself being sold all over the world, used by global municipalities and individuals. It has been the longest selling EV starting in 2009, with no real updates.\n\nI've also owned a 2012, 2015 Leaf and a commercial electric van not sold to individuals, the eStar.\n\nMechanics are few and far between outside of certain progressive states. Once you find a car, check its repair network and forums online for how their community copes.",

"comment": "This is a really tough situation, very much like Apple. They really want us to keep buying their new phone every single new phone that they’ve got. With each new iOS update the old handsets get software thats purposely slowed down gradually until Apple decides to no longer support the device. Catalina OS just made it impossible to run software that is 32 bit. If you bought the very expensive Adobe photoshop, illustrator and other software, they are no longer supported and you now have to buy the software subscription instead. This is an endless subscription whereas in the past you could buy and never pay again and use it for years.\n\nBTW, The iPhone hardware is made so spectacularly that nobody should ever have to buy another phone again for quite some time.\n\nThis is the same case with all electric cars. Theoretically you should not have to get another car until the interior and exterior of the car are completely worn down and even so, it still could get refurbished.\n\nThese companies get pretty greedy because they’re worried about their future sales. If their product is too good, why would somebody need to buy a second Tesla or a new iPhone?And of course as I mentioned they are software is being throttled just like the telecommunications companies throttle you when you’re using too much bandwidth on your “unlimited plan”.\n\nI do get concerned about buying a car that has 3G or 4G in its connection to the network. A car is a rather large investment for most people and I don’t think It was the best idea to integrate that into the consoles of the Car. It would just be better to have the ability to integrate something like a mobile device tablet that is less expensive and is more frequently updated.\n\nThe manufacture always wants to be as in control as they possibly can, they sometimes make mistakes that we are able to exploit (jailbreaking) but they also have ways of retaliating, usually in newer models.\n\nI don’t think Tesla can legally take Supercharging away from models made before they stopped the unlimited, but if you are found to have jailbroken the system and got supercharging or any other feature the model you have didn’t have access to, that would be considered stealing. I also think that jailbreaking your tesla could result in some serious safety problem. Just imagine if we are allowed to use the autonomous driving feature and someone altered the software. We really could have a serious disaster on our hands. Really, think of the possibilities the most advanced hackers could do...",

"comment": "You're thinking in ICE terms comparing to an EV.\n\nMotors don't matter as much anymore, especially a transmission when it comes to putting power to the ground. In fact adding more motors beyond 2 has proven to be best in improving output vs having a transmission. \n\nSoftware and batteries determine your output. You can only draw as much power as your battery can handle within reasonable levels without risking accelerated wear. Software controls it to put the power to the ground without smoking out the tires and losing traction. EVs typically do this perfectly unless you turn off traction control. However no EV on the market will let you completely turn it off. It's highly dangerous as you have hundreds of LBs of touque coming out of an open differential at literally 0 RPM. Turning if off completely would be guaranteed crowd killing.",

We've tripled density in ten years ( [sauce](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/02/19/bloombergnef-lithium-ion-battery-cell-densities-have-almost-tripled-since-2010/) ) which just isn't possible to continue.  Batteries are going to get much cheaper, and still get more dense for sure as there's some low-lying fruit in terms of anode materials, but after the next few years it's not so clear where we are headed.\n\nThe problem is also that even if you make it more dense then you have a harder problem to solve in terms of thermal management.    It's similar problem to cpus and how clock speed on CPUs eventually stabilized.  even if you have the ability to go smaller and generate more power there's a limit to what you can do without putting in a bunch of crazy active cooling.  I think it's probably safe to assume over the long run we'll figure it out, but I think Moore's law has kind of broken our brains and the expectation is that we'll keep progressing at our current rate, which is impossible even if the material science innovation happens a lot faster than a pessimist like myself expects.",

A Nissan Leaf lists for $28k or a bolt... the average is higher because it includes the lucid sapphire, Hummer EV, EV trucks etc. The fact remains you can get reasonably priced ev's if you want. They exist. Also the average new car is close to 48k, which I'll agree is out of reach of many Americans now, but its still the average new car sales price.",

I am surprised that the Peugeot e-208 consumes as much electricity as an all-wheel drive Tesla Model 3 and that an equivalent gasoline 208 only consumes 5.5 liters / 100 km, but let's compare them anyway. \n\nTo calculate the break-even points, we equate the costs of each car to drive a set distance:\n\nPe * Ee = Pg * Eg\n\nWhere:\n* Pe = price of electricity in € / kWh\n* Pg = price of gasoline in € / liter\n* Ee = efficiency of electric car in kWh / 100 km\n* Eg = efficiency of gasoline car in liters / 100 km\n\nFor electricity at € 0.55, the break-even price for gasoline is at:\n\n0.55 * 16 = Pg * 5.5 - - > Pg = € 1.60.\n\nFor gasoline at € 1.78, the break-even price for electricity is at:\n\nPe * 16 = 1.78 * 5.5 - - > Pe = € 0.62 / kWh. \n\nThus, it is still cheaper to drive the electric car.\n\nEdit: typo",

Case in point, I own a PHEV and haven't used gas in about 2 months, and then probably a good 6 months before that.  2 months ago... get this... I used a whole gallon of gas.\n\nI can make my 28 mile daily commute over 2x with my car's battery without charging.  \n\nMy car is a Chevy Volt.  While not a large car, it's enough for me.  Clearly you can fit an electric and gas powertrain into a small vehicle.  Just ask BYD.\n\nYou have nearly all the strengths of an EV... and all of the strengths of a hybrid.  Sure, car performance isn't the best.  It's not a sports care. Since when do we all need fucking sports cars anyways?  Most people have gotten by just fine with vehicles with 0-60 times in the 8-10 second range.  My Volt can do it in 7.5 seconds, and it still has that instant mas torque from a stop, so takes off from the line pretty fast.\n\nYes, you still need oil changes in a PHEV... but the period between is longer than an ICE.  That said, very few if any gas station trips.  The ability to charge at home with cheap electricity, and pre-heat in a closed garage.  Brake pads last forever on account of regen braking.  Less engine wear, and thus less ICE maintenance.",

"comment": "Flat-roof commercial installation is being held back by demand-based billing structures (which PV does not adequately address without batteries or smart controls). So that explains your lack of office parks, strip malls, commercial buildings - except in areas where utilities offer direct FITs.\n\nApartments and condos are being held back by regulations against the condo unit being able to sell electricity to the tenant - and that you generally need the complex owner to back the effort. If solar leases barely offer any savings to the tenants, and the MIRR of solar PV is not significantly higher than other expansion efforts, then why would the apartment complex invest? \n\nThis explains why you only see solar on apartments in condos in areas that have good local subsidies (North Carolina) or very high electric rates (California).",

I'll wait.\n\nThat isn't remotely similar to your first comment, but thanks for waiting.\n\nRooftop Solar, without a grid backup will require alternate generation or local storage, which is currently not cheap, although a second life for EV batteries is one the more practical possibilities. In that case, you would need overcapacity of solar power in winter, with enough energy storage to last until the next day, without draining the batteries so much their lifetime capacity is badly affected.",

You might find a nice price point in the Canadian Solar 260W modules compared to your two options as well.   All said and done you should be looking at something like $3.50/w installed or less.",

For a 4,550-square-foot house he uses a salvaged Tesla battery and is installing 36 panels on his roof and 66 in his yard.\n\nUsing 102 300 watt solar panels that would put his rig at 30kWh which seems a little crazy but makes more sense when you realize he is using the power to charge 2 Teslas in the garage. \n\nIt looks like a fun way to spend money if nothing else.",

Your next step would be to [file as a REC generator with PUCT](https://www.puc.texas.gov/industry/electric/business/rec/Rec.aspx) and then you're able to sell your RECs to utilities if you find a buyer.\n\nBut that really doesn't give you much, since wind recs = solar recs and Texas has alot of wind and lax REC requirements. So RECs aren't worth much (&lt;$1/.REC).\n\nThat said, there still could be buyers out there - the same buyers who purchase \"green energy plans\" from the utility for $10-$25/REC.\n\nSo let's assume you find a REC buyer and can get $20/REC in an easy process. Is that something you might be interested in?",

"comment": "Here are the questions your spreadsheet does not ask or answer:  \nHow much power do you *need*?  \nHow much roof space do you have?\n\nIf you are aiming for 5,500kWh/year, do not pay for power you won't use!  You rarely get that back as cash from the power company, and anything in excess of your total bill is paid at wholesale rates in DWP territory, if memory serves.  So that extra 1,000kWh that you are paying $3000 to Sunpower for will get you a return of something like $20 a year.  That extra power is paid back in the year 2166....\n\nThe only time to get Sunpower is if you have extremely limited space.  Remember, that panel efficiency % is not how much of the panel wattage you get to use, it's how much power you get per 'unit' of sun that hits the panels.  All that math is done already.  A 300W Sunpower panel makes the same amount of electricity as a 300W LG, or 300W Suniva, etc. (aside from a few minor circumstances, none of which are worth a 14% price increase).  The difference is this:  Sunpower needs 18ft2 to generate 345 DC Watts.  LG generates 310 DC watts from the same amount of space.  So your LG system needs 2 extra panels to generate the same amount of power - roughly an extra 15% physical space.  The power flowing into your house is the same from two similarly sized (electrical sized, not physical sized) systems.  My company routinely uses relatively low efficiency thin film panels that take up a LOT of extra space.  They are 14% efficiency, instead of 21% efficient (Sunpower).  So we need 33% MORE space than Sunpower, but at the end of the day we make the same amount of power.\n\nIf all these companies are filling up your roof space, and your expected usage is more than what fits, then get Sunpower.  And try and get a better deal.  I know of several Sunpower authorized dealers that can beat $4.20 a watt.\n\nTL;DR: the Solar Optimum system looks to be the best buy.",

Likewise, you might not need such a large generator.\n\nI would imagine you need a responsive battery bank that can manage the tug-of-war between the generator, solar array, and load.",

"comment": "&gt; The solar panel industry is already historically carbon negative . \n\nThat's irrelevant to this discussion.  Solar panels can be made here in the US, Canada, Europe, etc., or China.  If they are manufactured in China, they are being manufactured primarily with cheap electricity from coal power plants.  If they were manufactured here in the US, they would be manufactured with much cleaner energy. China has an unfair advantage by manufacturing them with coal electricity.\n\nThe US has essentially put a carbon tax on all our manufacturing, but we let China get away with increasing their use of coal every year.  We should put a carbon tax on everything imported from China.  Maybe then we'd be able to manufacture some of those panels here in the US.",

"comment": "well check out your local [solar association](http://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/oklahoma) in your state, they might have free seminars or classes, or even trade shows. You can check [surrounding states](http://www.arkansasrenewableenergyassoc.org) too. Also see about [funding/grants/incentives](http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/index.cfm?re=0&amp;ee=0&amp;spv=0&amp;st=0&amp;srp=1&amp;state=OK) both statewide and nationwide. Also, there might be [utilities](https://solarpowerrocks.com/oklahoma/) that specifically pay for your solar power through some sort of microgrid program, some even pay premiums on solar but again, you would have to tap into your solar association, or ask local installers who also would be a wealth of information as to what retailers would provide the best payback or incentives. \n\nCheck as well if you require [permits](https://www.okc.gov/business/building-permits) or an engineer to check your structure if required by certain permits. There may also be architectural standards in your community, which the city would also inform you of, which may affect the feasibility. \n\nJust added a few links but you will have to spend a bit more time depending on your location, goals etc. \n\nKeep in mind, installers will size your system to cover whatever needs you specify. So, for instance, if you want your yearly electricity needs met, they will estimate and average your yearly consumption. Some months you may pay extra, and depending on the regulations, some months you may receive a credit. If you're just wanting to add a few panels to cover the consumption of your electric furnace or hot water tank, they can do that too.",

"comment": "To start with, you need to know what the wattage of the lights are in total, and how long they run for each day. \n\n\nFrom there, you can use the [Trojan Battery Sizing Calculator](http://www.batterysizingcalculator.com/) to figure out how much battery capacity you need. From that, you should have a measurement of the total daily consumption. \n\nThis then diverges slightly in the math. The battery calculator should give you a measure of daily usage - if you use a PWM charge controller, you need to use *amp hours* of your daily consumption and the *amp rating* of your solar panels to figure out how much capacity you need, based on how many \"peak sun hours\" per day you get. If you intend to use an MPPT controller, you use the total *watt-hours* that you use per day, and the *wattage* of the solar panels to figure out how much capacity you need.  \n\nSince this will be in the winter, you'll need to use the minimum winter numbers for the calculation. According to [this site](https://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-information/sun-hours-us-map) New York City gets about three \"peak sun hours\" per day in the winter. \n\nBatteryStuff has a [Solar Calculator](https://www.batterystuff.com/kb/tools/solar-calculator.html) that will help with some more of these calculations. Make sure you leave a decent amount of room in your calculations to account for crappy weather and so on. \n\nAdditionally, when you get around to wiring the system up, don't forget to use large enough wires to prevent too much voltage loss. [This calculator](http://www.solar-wind.co.uk/cable-sizing-DC-cables.html) can help with that. \n\nIf you can provide me the wattage of the lights, how long they run for, and your location (if NYC isn't quite close by), I should be able to help you through the math.",

"comment": "What the other guy said.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my personal example at the residential level of why rooftop solar on my roof is not a good financial idea in my case: if I paid $10,000+ (lowest quote was about 13k, ranging all the way to 30k+ for similar sized systems from 5 quotes from local installers) to have a properly sized rooftop system installed on my roof, my electric bill in the winter time with rooftop solar will be HIGHER than what I currently pay WITHOUT solar.  And I live in what is probably the sunniest area in the US.  There are probably some people in this sub who can guess who my local utility is.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not rich enough to justify throwing that kind of money up on my roof, my money is much better off invested somewhere else from a financial standpoint.",

"comment": "Hi r/solar,\n\n  Have long been excited about Solar and really want to go for it. Am reading this sub every day :-) Two things holding us back:\n\n  1. Our roof is only 12 years old and in good shape. How do you consider the downside of adding Solar in the middle of the lifespan of a roof?\n\n  2. Our roof is complex, with many ridges/valleys/etc. The most optimum South-West section,that gets lots of sun, seems to have room for only 3-4 panels in the proposals we got.\n\nOur requirements: Google Sunroof estimates a \\~**7kw** system to offset our usage. A big goal here is being able to run **off the grid for a few days**, so as an example the Tesla 8kw system + 2 powerwalls and gateway look really promising. We're located near Mountain View, CA, if that helps with advice.\n\nFootnote on the 8.16kw proposal - the bottom 4x panels are on a 1st floor hip-roof that seems really sub-optimal in terms of access, conduit runs, etc, so those are most likely out.\n\nHas anyone out there installed solar on complex roofs, or any other advice to share? Thanks!",

It makes zero financial sense to purchase a battery system over a generator in his scenario.  \n\nIf he has natural gas on the side of his house it makes even more sense. If you factor in the oil changes and air filters for 20 years with a generator it still makes more sense. Even if he went with an automatic transfer switch setup that powers his house it still makes more financial sense to go with a generator. \n\nI ran the numbers on this in his same situation a year or two ago. You can get a whole house generator with a transfer switch installed and then replace that generator if it blows up for the same price as one powerwall.\n\nAlso, most powerwalls cannot run an entire house due to the amp output which is 21amps. Most people need two. \n\nYou can try and do the mental gymnastics on saying a battery system makes more sense but it absolutely does not since he has net metering.",

If I could get partial paid with SGIP and federal tax break then maybe a little shorter but I'm not SGIP eligible and I'm pretty sure my 100 amp service would have to be upgraded which I was quoted around 7k from PG&amp;E just to have the wiring upgraded to handle 200A. Trying to be environmentally smart and save money at the same time is not as easy as it sounds. Currently I get a check for about $250 a year when true up comes around and I pay about $30 a month with gas and interconnect fees. I signed up for Silicon Valley Energy's green program which has 100% renewable energy sources which costs a bit more but I get a dollar for dollar return on energy I generate and so far I'm coming out ahead, even with 2 PHEV charging at night.",

I don't think Tesla is worried about competing with their PowerWall -- they're jacking the prices and bundling to drive the demand down because they (and everyone else) can't get their hands on enough batteries. I think they're waiting to see how the V2G models will shake out post-COVID -- using the vehicle power pack for arbitrage is mired in spacial and regulatory hurtles, and it remains to be seen what \"getting back to work\" will look like.",

"comment": "Thanks for your reply!  So I believe I have two options...\n\n1) Remove existing solar panels (costing $2-3K) and cancel NEM 1 agreement, and then install a new larger solar system with 1-2 Powerwalls before NEM 3 takes effect.  I'm starting to be a little hesitant to do this since our intent is to install a new HeatPump HVAC later in 2023.  I'd like to link the HVAC to the Powerwalls in case of power outages.  It might be easier to do this after the HeatPump installation vs afterwards.\n\n2) Keep the exisiting smaller (older) Solar system in place.  Install new HeatPump HVAC system, then install an additional larger Solar system with 1-2 PW's, after NEM 3 takes effect.  If we install a system whereby we are net consumers, does NEM 3 really matter to us then?  In addition, I'd like participate in the Telsa VPP program, so we can sell back extra energy in times of need (such as heat waves).\n\nThanks again in advance!",

"comment": "Charge an EV using the real-time sun: [https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/evse-setup/](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/evse-setup/) \\- You'll need some electrical know-how and to understand the differences between the UK and North American Grid to get it setup right but there's a bunch of links describing it all. Alternatively, an electrician that doesn't mind doing something unusual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver-heat or over-cool your home on a schedule with heat pumps when the sun's shining so you coast into the evening. You'll need something with a somewhat smart thermostat that you can ideally set in a half dozen small increments to avoid large changes in temp causing your equipment to run in lower efficiency high output modes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHot Water Heat Pump - Again on a schedule. Mine is setup in series with my existing oil boiler where it \"pre-heats\" cold water to a 110\\* minimum and during sunlight hours it shoots for the tank max of 140\\*. Bigger tank the better, check for power company rebates to offset cost. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtherwise a lot of it is changing habits without energy storage. Running your cloths dryer during the day helps a ton but means washing cloths in the morning so tough to do if you're not home.",

At first, I just didn't look at her and said not interested to her first three conversation starters.  But then, when she wouldn't just go away, I lost my temper and told her that I didn't do business with liars and she needed to get out of my face.

"comment": "So 886kwh per month. So you'll have about 1.5-2.5 days of energy if you don't conserve anything depending on the battery pack size of a car. During a crisis that's pretty nice to have. But to be honest that's just the icing on the cake. The real benefit is not buying electricity when its expensive. I mean during night here we have negative prices here in Sweden. \n\nThe diy powerwall community is huge and it can be done much cheaper than old car batteries. F.eg buying lots of 100s of old 18650 batteries. Those can be bought each with a few cents and then there's a lot of mostly time, testing each cell with a test bench. A test bench is about 12$ at Aliexpress. I bought 4 to get the process fast (I can test 16 cells per 4 hours). Personally I buy used the more expensive used LG 18650s for 1/8-1/10 of the new cost, but then I get 96-97% of the capacity of new, for my diy project. I pay about 500$ for 4.4kwh, but if I lived in the US I could buy at battery hookup and that's way cheaper. You could build a pretty nice house bank for about $1000 if you live in the US.",

Considering the options presented by Sunrun, adding a second system might seem tempting, but having two different aged systems on your roof could lead to complications down the line, especially with repairs and replacements. \n\nCrunching the numbers is crucial here, and if you're rarely overproducing energy, it might not be worth the investment.",

"comment": "To offer clarification — The main federal solar incentive available to all American property owners is the [Solar Investment Tax Credit](https://enact.solar/what-is-the-solar-investment-tax-credit/) — thanks to  congressional legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This tax credit allows homeowners (or businesses) to earn a tax credit worth up to 30% of qualified solar and battery storage expenses. The 30% number will continue to exist until 2032, before it will decrease to 26% in 2033 and then 22% in 2034.\n\nRebates do exist, but are typically state, local/municipal, utility or nonprofit level incentives.",

A vegan who keeps it to themselves. You'll make more of a difference, over your lifetime, in the suffering you could avoid by convincing others, not in any change to your own diet and lifestyle.

Vegans seek to avoid inflicting unnecessary pain, suffering and death on animals - whether it be in the form of food, clothing, entertainment or other.\n\nWhile avoiding animal products in one's diet for health reasons makes sense, health reasons alone don't justify avoiding animal products elsewhere, say leather or wool.\n\nTo describe a diet devoid of animal products, some use the term *strict vegetarian*, others will say *vegan diet*. I personally prefer strict vegetarian.\n\nI'm not saying that what you are doing isn't good - I think switching to a strict vegetarian diet is awesome. I'm just clarifying a common misconception of the term vegan. Trust me, some people can react very badly to such mislabeling.",

Are you anticipating that the whole world will be vegan in the next 100 years? The lives lost in those 100 years are a fair trade for a more elegant solution? Is it less than 100 years? More?",

And I'm talking about a vegan bakery, not a bakery that has some vegan items. So why bother having a vegan bakery if there aren't any ethics behind it? For the money, I guess.

For instance: a vegan can be one for ethical reasons, yet still choose to buy products made with GMOs from ConAgra, Nestle and other companies that encourage monoculture and heavy reliance on petroleum-derived fossil fuels to ensure product uniformity.  These practices are very detrimental to our environment, and this isn't even including the massive degradation from corporate feed lots.

That's wonderful, and I'm glad you now follow the vegan lifestyle.\n\nI actually was one of the few who did want to change my actions overnight, so it's not quite right to assume everyone else isn't like that, though I can agree for the majority, that wouldn't work out so well.. \n\nAll I recommend is that people consider their audience when approaching others for advocacy, but never forget the animals. It's important to let others know it's healthy, but the moral reasons need to come.  :)\n\nHave a good night. I was part trolling you. like 10% but mostly serious :) Relax a little.",

That said, as a staunch vegan, I think you should stop being so hard on yourself - Giving up an entire food group is extremely difficult and giving up two is almost like giving up part of your identity. If you eat cheese, don't waste time feeling guilty, just try to recognize why youre eating it. If youre actually craving cheese (which is likely as it has addictive properties!) shoot for cashews which can offer the same satiety - if its an emotional craving maybe try to sort some things out at the cause - Ive found that by making my own food I find any type of meal more rewarding, so maybe try cooking for yourself more often, and prepare for the week ahead of time so youre not stuck with only whats in front of you in the moment. The whole process can be fun when you are more involved in your food from preparation to when it gets in your belly :) And if you are not feeling well restricting, remember to take care of yourself! The point is about compassion not making yourself feel unhealthy or guilty! Once your body adjusts though, if done right, youll feel pretty damn amazing.",

One such supplement is a product called [VegeCat](http://www.vegepet.com/vegetarian_cats.html).\n\nIn terms of VegeCat, there is anecdotal evidence of successfully having vegan cats. But I'm not sure of additional evidence beyond that either for or against it. I haven't researched it enough to make a judgement.\n\nThis is what it comes down to; are the animal's nutritional needs met? Meat is not a magical food, and nutrients can be found elsewhere (either in plant foods, or made synthetically in a lab). In fact, many meat-containing cat foods having added lab-made amino acids. This is an insurance in case the meat in cat food is not rich enough in those essential amino acids.\n\nYou'd have to do your own research and talk to people who have had vegan cats to get a more conclusive answer. Also look up scientific papers if you can.",

"comment": "&gt; Neither of us has claimed anything, so we cannot conclude anything out of the growth in veganism.\n\nThis is from your first reply to me:\n\n&gt;...most interest in veganism is/has been driven by celebrities and health nuts. Not people who are chasing morality. Not the acceptance of the idea \"eating animals is bad\" but instead the decision to try to not eat animals for the sake of having more healthy food.\n\nYou did make a claim, and when I asked you to back it up you could not. \n\n&gt;My argument is \"Because a large number of people know about veganism, and the arguments behind it, and because few people are vegans, it shows that the arguments for veganism are not strong enough to change people's minds about if eating meat is moral\".\n\nOkay. With slight modification, all of the points I raised against what I took your argument to be apply to this version as well. Unless you have a reason for why those points are flawed, there's nothing more I have to say. Well, except this: Do you have any evidence to back up your claim that 'a large number of people know about veganism, and the arguments behind it' or are you just speaking from the hip again? It strikes me that the vast majority of people have nothing more than a vague idea of what veganism is and an even vaguer idea of what the arguments for it are. But that's just how it strikes me. So since you seem to be making a claim *about the world*, about what *actual* people *actually* know, I'd like to know what your reason for making it is, if you have one.\n\nNow, unless you plan to (1) directly address the points I raised against your inference in my previous comment, after having charitably interpreted them as applying to its current articulation (or explaining why they can't be), or (2) produce some evidence for the claim of yours that I just doubted, then this is where the conversation will have to stop. It was nice trying to talk with you either way.",

It quickly became second nature and I often don't need to check anymore.

"comment": "I don’t know. I have been vegan over 20 years. I avoid vegan junk food most of the time. I also have a pretty steady exercise regimen which probably helps  my metabolism.\n\nAll of my relatives are very overweight and have all the chronic health problems you’d expect that go with that. None of them have my diet or exercise habits. Maybe I got some recessive trait from way back, but I don’t see anything in any of my relatives that is similar to my condition. \n\nRegarding constipation, weight gain and immune system, it may just be about adjusting diet and lifestyle habits a little more. I eat salad more often than not. I eat a ton of fruit and vegetables and drink a lot of water every day. I think those things help. Getting enough sleep and good hand washing habits also help with not getting sick. \n\nRegular exercise is also helpful. Find a type of exercise you like so you can stick to it and don’t dread doing it. That makes a big difference. I have tried plenty of things I didn’t like. Martial arts and boxing have been my sweet spot though. It’s something I look forward to instead of feeling like a chore.\n\nThere probably are things to tweak to get better results. Maybe a vegan friendly dietician could help you find the right adjustments to make. Everyone is different so it may take some fine tuning to find what works for you.",

Also they offer them on their international flights. \n\nhttps://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/dining/special-meals-and-nut-allergies.jsp\n\nI guess I could simply boycott first class and buy the Main Cabin Extra seats instead, but I doubt that'd solve anything. I wonder if I should write them an e-mail; I think this could help them get lots of business from a lot of vegans traveling within the US who are willing to pay extra for first-class!",

"comment": "Maybe this story will help you, so please read it :).\n\nA couple of days ago i had lunch with my cousin who is 6 years old and his parents. He asked me loads of questions and I was very glad to respond calmly without any mental graphic pictures and details about the meat, dairy and egg industry. Everytime he asked a question his parents would tell him to not to overthink things but he kept asking and I kept answering. After a while his parents started being passive-agressive to me and told me to stop talking about it. I told them something along the lines of:\"He is asking smart questions and I'll keep answering them, let the kid think!\" So me and my cousin just kept going with the conversation and he agreed with most of my points. Moral of the story is there is always seeds to plant, there is always somebody who will listen. Who knows maybe my cousin will continue to research about veganism and influence his parents who were disgusted by the idea of veganism.\n\nKeep doing what you do, you're very brave and are doing animals a service. I'm in a country where I don't have any oppertunities for activism, so use what you got and keep going through it, our Earth will thank you.",

I also think the sentience level of bycatch needs to be considered. Are fish more sentient than insects? How much fish is killed compared to insects? And so on.\n\nIt's probable bivalves could be 'vegan' or OK to consume but I am sceptical.\n\nVeganism is about drawing lines when it comes to animal suffering VS. maintaining society. Bivalves are an edge case it seems where the answer is much less clear than say the question whether should we imprison and gas pigs.",

But there are [whole villages](https://www.halonghub.com/blog/halong-bay-amazing-floating-villages/) that exist solely because of their ability to catch fish. This is how they live. They are as much a natural part of the ecosystem there as the predatory birds that eat fish. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I have nothing against veganism - I think it’s a healthy alternative to heavy western diets and I enjoy seeing some of the dishes people post here and so on. And I agree that overfishing is a serious problem. All I am saying is it’s easy to look down on people who eat fish when you can go to a grocery store and buy tofu and pre-packaged lentils imported from all over the world. But the fact is you’re only a vegan because you were lucky enough to be born where you were.",

Fifty years ago, only one in eight Americans was obese.\n\n- National Center for Health Statistics, “Prevalence of Overweight, Obesity and Extreme Obesity Among Adults: United States, Trends 1976–80 through 2005–2006,”\n\nThis figure moves nearly in lockstep with the rise of factory farming and the decline in price of animal products due to government subsidies and of course the \"efficiency\" of factory farming increasing as they figure out how to cut costs by pumping your food with hormones, antibiotics, etc.\n\nHere's a quote for you:\n\n&gt; For starters, forget about that bucolic American Gothic picture of the gentleman farmer. Industrial farming operations have largely replaced small farms, and the “pasture spring” and “little calf . . . standing by the mother” that Robert Frost saw on his family farm a century ago are lost artifacts—relics of an obsolete way of life. In the decades since 1950, American farming has undergone a major transformation, and mom-and-pop farms are mostly gone—either acquired by large corporate operations or plowed under for new housing subdivisions. For instance, between 1954 and 2007, even as demand for dairy increased by 40 percent, the number of US dairy farms plummeted from 2.9 million to 65,000. We wouldn't know it from the peaceful, pastoral logos of the dairies and meat packers whose products we consume (who doesn't love a smiling cow on a package?), but today, 99 percent of the farm animals raised in the United States live in steel and concrete factories with no resemblance to a traditional farm.\n\n- Quote from \"Meatonomics\"  by David Robinson Simon\n\nTheir sources:\n\n- Joe L. Outlaw et al., “Structure of the U.S. Dairy Farm Sector,” Dairy Markets and Policy: Issues and Options (March 1996), accessed September 19, 2012, http://aede.osu.edu; US Department of Agriculture, “Overview of the United States Dairy Industry” (2010), accessed September 19, 2012, http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu.\n\n- Farm Forward, “Factory Farming,” accessed October 25, 2012, http://www.farmforward.com.\n\nI think you might not realize just how quickly and how drastically our food has changed over the past 50 years.",

I also grew up in a culture that sacrifices animals for \"offerings\" to invite good luck, ward off bad luck, and other such animistic beliefs so I find it extra hard to convince people it's just not right, especially with the older generations. They seem to treat it as an immutable truth instead of something to be challenged.\n\nHow do you do it?",

I would never say we are angels but we are doing the most within our limitations. Vegan is the high goal, but if you have the (extreme example:) choice to buy something vegan (highly processed products) from Nestlé or some organic meat from the farmer around the corner... The struggle is real.\nI would love to live only on owngrown veggies from our Garden... Not gonna happen: garden way to small, but at least we have one. Have some community-garden: sure - than I need a car, because the next one is 25km away and is not reachable with public transportation... Etc, etc. To grow enough veggies I need to go almost every day. \nWe have jobs, a kid. How should this work?\n\nAnyway, I am drifting off. Thank you for your kind and wise words!",

Let's say that 10% of omnivores are mocking, dismissive people and 10% of vegans are preachy.  Only about 3% of the population is/or has been vegan.  That means that in any random sample there will be more than 10x as many toxic omnivores as toxic vegans, so any friend group is likely to have at least 1.  On the other hand there will be many friend groups that only have 1 vegan, nice or otherwise.  So 10% of friend groups likely have 100% of their vegan friends be one of the toxic ones.",

It builds in a minimal acknowledgement that we will prioritize our own well-being first and then extend whatever grace we can to the world around us.
