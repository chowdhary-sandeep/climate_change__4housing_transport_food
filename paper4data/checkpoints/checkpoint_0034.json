I agree that it can. \n\n&gt;we need to careful, nuanced, and flexible policy at different levels - local, national, and international - to effectively deal with the problem.\n\nTo the extent where a problem exists, yes, I agree that your approach is valid.  It actually sounds exactly like my approach. We need a mix of strategies, because no one solution will work by itself.\n\nThe \"Kick the rich guy out\" scenario might not have ever been an approach you've heard to the Tragedy of the Commons, but it seems to be the approach that's being bandied about as a solution to the perceived problem with climate and CO2.  Namely, the BRIC nations want the Western Developed nations to agree to massive reductions in CO2 emissions while they themselves will not agree to any restrictions on growth.\n\nIf CO2 does turn out to be a big threat via the global warming mechanism, then it's not a workable solution to require the western developed countries to reduce emissions without also requiring growth caps on developing nations, right?  Just shifting the source of CO2 from one set of countries to a different set of countries doesn't do the job.\n\nMy problem with the current push to have strigent controls on US emissions isn't based on a love of CO2, it's based on the question of utility.  I don't mind working towards a globally agreed upon per capita goal or cap, whatever that number is, if other nations will also be held to the same restrictions.  Easy for, say, India to meet, since they have a very low per capita emissions rate as it is.  Not so easy for other nations, as they have economic aspirations that will require some pretty hefty energy growth targets.\n\nIf the problem is that CO2 makes the Earth dangerously warm, then allowing any nation to grow beyond \"safe\" limits is stupid, globally speaking.  If the problem that we're trying to solve is not temperature, but economic, then the advocates of carbon taxes and caps on only the western industrialized nations are being dishonest.\n\nI don't accuse you of pursuing an economic agenda.  You seem to be pretty well focused on other things.  Others, I'm not so sure of.\n\nOddly enough, I don't disagree with the outcome they are pursuing: renewable energy, electric vehicles and highly efficient mass transit.  It's utopia, from my point of view.  I'd love to see this version of the future happen.  I just don't agree with the dogma many are using to try to get us there.

Battery size is basically a balancing act. It's range and charge time vs. cost, weight, and interior space.\n\nBattery cost and weight has been steadily dropping, and it looks like that will continue to do so for at least another 15 years. So as time goes on, that balancing equation will tip more in favor of bigger batteries. But the benefit of longer range and faster charging decreases exponentially as battery size increases.\n\nLet me ask you a question: Is range a big selling point for gas cars? Because the balance of range vs cost &amp; weight is tipped heavily in the favor of range. Gasoline has an incredibly high energy density, and making a gas tank costs very little compared to the rest of the car.\n\nSome quick googling seems to indicate that the average sedan holds around 18 gallons of gas and gets around 25 mpg. So that works out to 450 miles of range for the average gas car. That's basically the upper bound for what EV range might approach in the far future.\n\nIf we assume this future EV consumes 350 watt-hours per mile (about the same as a Tesla Model S), then it would need a 160 kWh battery pack to drive 450 miles.

Judge it's merits yourself.  \n\nNovember 19, 2015\n \nDear Chairman Hatch, Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Wyden, and Ranking Member Levin:\n\n \nI am writing to share Sunnova’s perspective on the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a 30% tax credit for solar installations that will be stepping down to 10% in some circumstances and will be eliminated entirely in others in 2017. We do not believe an extension of this credit is necessary for the continued health of the solar industry. In fact, quite the opposite is true. If the credit is allowed to step down as planned, the industry will remain more robust in both the long- and short-term.\n\n \nSunnova is a residential solar energy company that is active in 23 states and territories including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Saipan. We founded Sunnova in 2012 and have since grown the business to tens of thousands of solar customers across the country. We work with local installation partners in the markets in which we operate to install and maintain rooftop systems on homes.\n\n \nThe solar industry has been aware since 2008 that the ITC would be stepping down to 10% starting in 2017. This six-year window has given the industry ample time to prepare for the decrease in the incentive. In fact, all of the largest solar power service companies, including Sunnova, have stated publicly and to investors that they are prepared for the decrease in the ITC and that their pricing and installation projections will be unaffected after 2016.\n\n \nYet, there has been an organized effort by many in the solar industry to convince legislators that the need for a five-year, or even permanent, extension of the ITC is necessary to the continued functioning of the industry. Extreme claims are being made about the number of jobs that will be lost and the number of companies that will go out of business once the ITC steps down or sunsets as planned.\n\n \nAt Sunnova, we respectfully disagree with these claims. We firmly believe the ITC has served its purpose and that it is now time to allow it to step down as planned. The industry made a deal with Congress in 2008 that it needed the ITC’s support until 2016 and then it would be able to operate and, indeed, flourish without it. We, collectively as an industry, should honor that deal.\n\n \nWe also advise against allowing “commence construction” language to be included in any ITC-related legislation. This provision is unnecessary for residential solar projects because residential construction timelines are short enough that such language would have no bearing on a company’s ability to raise tax equity to finance them. Also, under this provision, companies will be able to claim that the project has technically “commenced” although no customers have actually been identified. In reality, such a provision would just provide an additional subsidy to solar firms that have resources to—as they did with the Treasury Grant Program—buy large numbers of panels and store them for future use. This would then allow systems built with those panels in the future to qualify for the ITC because 5% of the project had “commenced” with the purchase of the panels. This loophole would unnecessarily extend the impact of the ITC for years beyond its sunset date.\n\n \nThe solar industry is increasingly an established industry that no longer needs government subsidies to survive. Rather, the solar power industry is now ready to use capital market structures that other, more mature energy sources have access to, such as Master Limited Partnerships. The MLP Parity Act, sponsored by Senators Moran and Coons in the Senate and Representatives Poe and Thompson in the House, has strong bi-partisan support. The bill would level the playing field among various energy sources, not just solar, by allowing them to access the MLP capital structure, thereby giving all energy sources access to lower cost capital. In contrast to the ITC, the MLP Parity Act is supported equally by both parties and applies to multiple technologies. If legislators are interested in supporting the continued growth of the industry, we encourage them to support the MLP parity act rather than an extension of the ITC.\n\n \nAdditionally, if legislators are interested in enabling the continued growth of the solar industry, I encourage them to join the discussion about what the next generation of the electric grid will look like. As more distributed energy resources are employed by individuals, businesses and utilities, we will need to level the playing field and allow all types of energy and technologies access to our shared electrical system. We must push for grid neutrality in order to ensure that no technology is valued or favored over any other. The result will be a more efficient overall system that will provide the most competitive and cost-effective choices for consumers.\n\n \nIn the meantime, I want to make it clear that Sunnova and the rest of the solar industry are well-positioned to respond to a decrease in the ITC starting in 2017. We have had ample time to prepare and are now a mature enough industry to no longer need the government to support 30% of the cost of our projects. While we understand that some fear it could be difficult and even disruptive to transition away from such a significant subsidy, we do not believe this is a crisis for the industry. Rather, it is an opportunity to explore broader, more conventional sources of financing that will allow the industry to continue expanding. \n\n \nAs the solar industry, technology, and the grid evolve, so must policies that encourage and support their growth. A policy such as the ITC that was implemented for a market that existed almost a decade ago is no longer the best option for meeting renewable energy goals in today’s world. Therefore, we encourage you to ensure that no new legislation is passed to create a new or extended ITC subsidy.\n\n \n \nYours Sincerely,\n\n\n\nWilliam J.

Is this doable?\n\nA brand new but totally base Bolt LT can do that, after the $7500 Fed Tax Credit (put $7500 up now, get it back as a refund on your taxes next year if you've got that much tax liability). On the street it'll probably cost you maybe $35,000 (deals to be had) + a 240V plug-in charger + taxes and such (just say \"no\" to the dealership after-sale upsells :p). That will keep your payments to about $600 or less.\n\nThe Model 3 MR w/no extras is way more of a car but with only the $7500 rebate (unless you've got a local/state one) will likely edge just over $650 payments (a lot comes down to the rate you can get).  EDIT: Also, you'll not be able to fit into your budget the best thing about the Model 3 as a commuting vehicle, EAP.\n\nEither of those handle your commute very, very easily. Even in winter. Install the home plug. Well worth it you'll find never having to \"gas up\" is going to be liberating. Also, unless it's a \"free\" charger you'll probably pay well above your residential power rates to do change away from home (not as bad with the Tesla Supercharger but a number of L2 networks and CCS can be highway robbery, depending on your locale :p).\n\nA new Leaf is even easier to fit in your budget, and depending on if you're in a CARB state there's going to be other options. Based on your climate comments though you'll probably want to stay at the 150mi range or above to keep your commute free of stress and outside charging.\n\nEDIT: Also for proper budgeting keep in mind that your power bill will be about 24kWh/per workday higher. Pencil in 500kWh/month if you are 5 days/week. If you have 10c/kWh power this is about $50/month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.30143501130784683,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18634977987572587,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15758597476051256,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2026773964685948,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10753854210940972,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19809099794380494,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2513118386317122,"ev_1":-0.1874335025626049,"ev_2":-0.11931099315031897,"ev_3":-0.2788665197822519,"ev_4":-0.18186592191355702,"ev_5":-0.23109738305088526,"ev_6":-0.16839424400978942},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

It doesn’t really add to the experience by making it motorized.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00015601992587714145,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12693202254922512,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.0703778142730395,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.07047927131255467,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07694946105450695,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.07883299388851128,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.029954580260285486,"ev_1":-0.000704279484731766,"ev_2":-0.0006711824098601937,"ev_3":-0.0002575694306869991,"ev_4":-0.00031507542977730435,"ev_5":-0.00056844745510413,"ev_6":-0.14440792350062331},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (coworkers, family, friends, local community, neighbors, online community, other reddit user, partner/spouse, political tribe) - other (companies/brands, generic 'people', no possessive, hypothetical, general you)\n\nIn this case, the reference","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.","1.3.3_second_order":"none.","ev_1":"NO.","ev_2":"NO.","ev_3":"NO.","ev_4":"NO.","ev_5":"NO.","ev_6":"Based on the provided text, the discussion of reliability/maintenance in relation to EVs (Tesla in particular) and gas cars is present.

There are a lot of nuances to the conversation, and I’ve seen some frankly frustrating perspectives even among the EV community.  \n\nThe reality is EVs are here to stay.  And that means growing pains.  If we are going to replace traditional ICE vehicles with EVs, we better be able to charge them with the same convenience we have with gasoline.  That means having pull-through charging infrastructure where we don’t drop trailers.  It means being understanding and not yelling at early adopters if they pull in to charge for 20 minutes and used two open spots that weren’t occupied initially.  It also means having elected officials with enough emotional intelligence to recognize if they pass a law prohibiting the sale of EVs they can’t also immediately undermine the confidence in the grid by asking people not to charge at certain times.\n\nI LOVE EVs.  I am a convert not BECAUSE of the environmental benefits, but because the EVs are just better cars all around.  I want to see them succeed on a larger level ALSO because of the environmental impact they will have.

Inverters lose 25% or so (maybe less), so a 75 watt AC load can draw 100W from the battery, solar panels with a similar rated vs practical capacity. Batteries have about 2/3 their rated capacity usable capacity.\n\nNow for the real maths, you need to figure the amount of power (in watts) you use at once, use that to get an inverter to power that, ideally around 50% capacity, maybe a bit more, and multiply that for how many hours you use the load.\n\nFrom that you figure what battery capacity you need in Wh (Ah*V*.66=practical Wh), and how much panel capacity you need.\nI would provide storage for 4 days use.\n\nFor panel capacity, you need to figure you get effectively 4-6 hours of sunlight per day (there are insolation calculators or charts). You get enough panel capacity to provide your days usage, plus. I would have panel capacity to for your days use and to charge one day extra, at least.\n\nMy off-grid system is a bit similar to /u/Sluggocide, but I use a 20W panel that cost $125 (on sale from a local vendor), 32 Ah battery (Group U1 AGM), etc. I use mine to power a few CFL barn lights, for around 1/2 hr per day. It works pretty well. You will need a more significant system.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.01209805665227274,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20819478562540117,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.258539027528195,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22923734328325776,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2511564550869838,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16717037138619392,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1180956035386771,"solar_1":-0.1255459521230388,"solar_2":-0.1922384863943769,"solar_3":-0.028619204750915134,"solar_4":-0.19367343155439207,"solar_5":-0.030371987600184575,"solar_6":-0.12320926963972549,"solar_7":-0.01839600309904199,"solar_8":-0.23117818248283584,"solar_9":-0.02442566535476942,"solar_10":-0.19514698884996792},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Navigant Consulting wrote a great report in 2008 on the potential of the US rooftop solar industry. They came up with a number called \"technical potential\" which combined electric pricing, energy production, and population density to predict which markets would be \"best\" for solar. [See Figure 7, page 20](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42306.pdf). \n\nTexas should be #2 and Florida should be #3 in the country for solar. But both states lag far behind their \"technical\" potential because of state policy.\n\nOne personal anecdote: in 2011 or so, Texas was considering an SREC carve-out of its RPS, based on the exact same structure as the original Texas REC marketplace. Texas launched their REC marketplace for the wind industry at the end of the 90s (creating the whole REC concept, as far as I can tell), and within 5 years, the $45/mwh price had shrunk down to $1/mwh and Texas was a national leader in wind power.\n\nSo the same proposal is set to the Texas' 3 public utility commissioners for solar. The first commissioner says he proposed the bill but doesn't have an opinion on it. The second says he's against it. The third says she \"hope this proposal never passes\". Texas also lacks a state net-metering law.\n\nMost states have net-metering policies which revoke net-metering laws once solar reaches 1-2% of the state's power supply. So you get a cold day in early spring, nobody is using electricity and Louisiana's solar capacity hits it's goal, and net-metering is revoked. Or you have a state build a giant solar farm and net-metering is revoked. Or you exempt member-owned utilities, so even if your state has net-metering, you can't access it. There's plenty of ways to curtail net-metering.\n\nOn the other hand, there's plenty of room for net-metering compromise. Where net-metering is provided on a month-to-month basis, customers can only offset ~75% of their electric bill before the utility starts to profit off avoided-cost surplus. \n\nRooftop solar is clearly the best application for solar. Unlike any other renewable technology, solar power can be installed at the point-of-use. Rooftop solar creates more jobs, increases more property value, operates more efficiently, at a higher generation rate. \n\nBefore we uncapped the federal tax credit for solar in 2008, utility-scale solar was &lt;10% of the market. Now it's the majority of installed capacity. Subsidies direct the market, in a similar manner to regulations. I'm not saying the subsidies are \"bad\" or \"good\", but hell, if Trump is going to implement corporate tax reform, the best thing he could do for the solar industry is cap the tax credit at $10k individually and $100k corporately, which would refocus those tax dollars on distributed, point-of-use solar.\n\nWe have a mess of local governments developing their own electric rules and regulations, which traces back to the history of the electric grid and the United States in general. Our energy policy consisted of \"if there's a tree there, you can chop it down and burn it\" pretty much up until the Civil War, when we ironically brought coal-powered lighting to our homes via a steep tax on what might be best categorized as ethanol. \n\nI'm getting off-track here, but I think the best place to go for clarity on energy policy is, once again ironically, Texas. As I stated above, Texas has no net-metering policy, which has caused it to lag far behind the rest of the country in solar capacity. Only recently has it started to move towards its potential, because of utility-scale solar.\n\nBut if you look closely at Houston, TX, you'll find deregulated retail-electric providers offering voluntary net-metering policies to their customer base, in an effort to gain business and collect meter fees. Simply, this would not happen if net-metering customers \"cost the utility money\".\n\nTexas' market shows that net-metering is a profit-center on a deregulated grid, and so regulated grids which do not offer net-metering are not serving their constituents' best health, safety, and welfare.  Solar is particularly oppressed in anti-solar, regulated grids which lack net-metering policy. Whether it be a coop or a public/private energy monopoly (like Mississippi Power), these entities should either provide net-metering or be face deregulation. \n\nAt the end of the day, none of this matters because of the power of distributed consumerism. Batteries will eventually drop in price to the point where solar owners can disconnect their solar arrays from the grid and avoid the associated anti-solar policies and regulations. But that \"end point\" isn't efficient - it's costly process which raises electric prices for non-participants while increasing society's carbon pollution output. \n\nRegulated grids have the power and ability to draft and implement solar friendly policies. Those who fail to should be deregulated.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3135562439748962,"1.1.1_stance":-0.019876801971154885,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17654826870429585,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.05509404900173346,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4675576211768089,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22245460527019048,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.012898564532709619,"solar_1":-0.2894746163917952,"solar_2":-0.18312458736620074,"solar_3":-0.21282627875533983,"solar_4":-0.2477188305395733,"solar_5":-0.19532174422873666,"solar_6":-0.01882357493135108,"solar_7":-0.04214796348484621,"solar_8":-0.036279790036739236,"solar_9":-0.03772691088416735,"solar_10":-0.26074146124889175},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

From a real world stand point it's just semantics. It's still an inverter in a series of components converting a DC signal to an AC signal (doesn't matter what components and a MPPT isn't required for DC/AC).\n\nMy next question was rhetorical. It's obviously a series connection (ie a string). I know you are stuck on marketing speak, I understand.\n\n&gt;No. Why would it? In fact multiple optimizers can fail ( as well as more commonly multiple PV modules) and the inverter continue to work with out the failed components. More so it will report the failures, locations, and give statistics vital to getting a warranty replacement on the failed or partially failed PV modules.\n\nSo either you are lying or grossly misinformed, the solar edge website and setup examples are lying, or solar edge invited a new type of circuitry. Optimizers or not, it's still a series. If any part of the series is **removed** then there is no more connection. It's really that simple. Unless, like I said, the optimizers contain some sort of bypass circuitry. That would be the only way to get around the failed optimizer or panel and relay the relevant information to the supposedly dumb inverter. I'll assume this is the case. And if it is, then the rest of the panels have to increase their voltage output to compensate for the loss of whatever went down. Thus effecting every other panel/optimizer pair in the circuit. In fact, if there for example is too much shade (ie 4 out of 8 panels in a circuit are shaded), and there are not enough panel/optimizer pairs left in the circuit to produce the required ~380V DC for the inverter, then the entire circuit (effected string) goes down. This is also why the strings have a minimum size. For my specific situation of a large blob of sweeping shade, this would be disastrous.\n\nLooking at your other posts I know you'll come back with some marketing nonsense. This is more for people looking for actual information.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007476936079910956,"1.1.1_stance":-0.04075714094196883,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1632762845319801,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30925901867436423,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2170434020544877,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16728207411096202,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.008736726983139912,"solar_1":-0.038726825499907136,"solar_2":-0.021851663244888186,"solar_3":-0.028003064760317404,"solar_4":-0.016969028608097386,"solar_5":-0.012658518739044666,"solar_6":-0.0019569153470608094,"solar_7":-0.0011142984731122851,"solar_8":-0.003704690267719949,"solar_9":-0.014864494577826312,"solar_10":-0.021523203487352777},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

God's honest truth is i cannot remember if you can change ratings on solarreviews the way you can on googles or yelps, so just be sure you're comfortable with drawing whatever line in the sand you want to draw.   come out swinging or save it for the last straw, your choice.\n\n(C) figure out / discuss with the installers:  \n\nwhen/how your battery is coming,   \nhow many are in front of you,   \nwhat's the waiting list been like for the last year,   \nhow reasonable a shot does that company have at getting first dibs on any new supply,   \nwhat's the risk of price changes,   \nwhat're the install costs later, if any?    \nAre you keeping your last 20% till that battery gets delivered? (I certainly would.   that's skin in the game that your installer desperately wants.)  \n\nIf you are truly anxious about whether or not you got the right modules, ask them to send a man up to the roof to take a picture of the panel label on the backside of the panel.    They might offer to show you invoices and PO#'s, and depending on how loud a squeaky wheel you want to be, or how - pardon the french - paranoid you are about getting hosed on this, that might actually suffice,.  \n\nThere we go.   That's what I've got for now.   \n\nGood luck.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.008342641522176564,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13520470168573412,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23437000904232264,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20970678484688202,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07957338927815272,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14613079349124627,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07455417136467683,"solar_1":-0.01458319577795919,"solar_2":-0.004147705740858025,"solar_3":-0.002508202830237375,"solar_4":-0.004013942811070592,"solar_5":-0.0001985106585683146,"solar_6":-0.03900170097282777,"solar_7":-0.013947639827771733,"solar_8":-0.0006069089886295842,"solar_9":-0.06226286657329183,"solar_10":-0.02097701811726438},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

Problems will arise with several sequential cloudy days because there is no extra capacity for less than ideal operation.  I don't think it is necessary to go to 15 KW, but 12 KW might be a wise choice.  This is based on having 20% excess capacity to even out the bumps on days with less sun.  Some of this is from the climate I live in where we have about 250 decent sun days per year with 115 that are cloudy or short winter days with fewer hours to charge batteries.  Use discretion to adjust for your climate.\n\nAs others suggested, there are alternative battery makers and some are significantly cheaper.  Keep in mind that some batteries have other functions built in.  For example, Tesla's powerwall has 4 built in MPPT's and an inverter capable of 9.6 KW of output.  Compare this with a straight battery manufacturer where you must purchase MPPT's and separate inverter.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0013313936651684344,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25169308500063725,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18704271749315543,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26344012403872497,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18051200947775214,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.219185472354789,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06541404640302062,"solar_1":-0.2743810813727291,"solar_2":-0.1213969444515403,"solar_3":-0.37726157721618037,"solar_4":-0.13724895237054197,"solar_5":-0.09860505526546604,"solar_6":-0.02123854232437831,"solar_7":-0.026563281327980803,"solar_8":-0.012251471938119115,"solar_9":-0.2074836353598365,"solar_10":-0.18316590711987604},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

All of my vegan aquaintances talk a lot about food and also know a lot of recipes.\n\nIf you're like me, you'll probably be accustomed to some \"meat component\" in your food.

You can put slices of it on bread or cut it in stripes and fry (or even deep-fry) it.\n\nIf you actually decide to go vegan (and not just vegetarian) you'll probably need some B12 supplements, but that's about it.

Besides it is difficult.\n\nThe best way is cooking AND frying in one step, in one pan.    \n\n* Slices of sweet potato (thick slices, don't be afraid)  \n* Oil (enough to cover the slices on the pan)  \n* 1 cup of water max. (yes, water)  \n  \nWarning. This recipe is only for the braves  \n  \nWhat we are doing here is mixing oil + water BUT that's the secret. The water doesn't let the mixture above 100C, and while the water doesn't evaporate, the potatoes are cooking. Then after +- 10 min. of a lot of bubbling, the mixture stops moving and making noise (the water is fully evaporated) and the temperature of the oil starts to rise, enough to fry the potatoes.\n\n**You have to find a really tall pan**, the mixture makes noise and is bubbling, but it's perfectly safe. You put the potatoes on the pan, the oil (cover them), the cup of water, and **THEN** you light the fire.\n\n10-15 minutes of cooking, 8-10 minutes of frying. All in one step. No hassle.

If you want something very light and sweet, try rice milk.  \n\nOne of the good things of starting with plant milks is that there can sometimes be even more variety and choice with this substitution, compared to animal products (so there's more choice, and often will feel like the opposite of \"a restriction\"); if you live in a major metropolitan area, there might be a dozen different kinds available to you (as opposed to only one or two different kinds of animal milks).  \n\n&gt; get the proper nutrition\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/b974w6/good_resources_for_vegan_recipes/ek2qi1z/) are some extremely simple, possibly familiar, meals to start with, including some guides to nutrition and cheap supplements to use if you're worried about not eating a super well-rounded diet in the beginning.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0009700188432664921,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1824720760729633,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22111901234832562,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20551121359070143,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20719442912454528,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2347383408422628,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.011673126340610906,"diet_1":-0.24514725094195455,"diet_2":-0.006437823455276733,"diet_3":-0.04336322071801154,"diet_4":-0.1527829663051913,"diet_5":-0.0025869133860396687,"diet_6":-0.14713381885794483,"diet_8":-0.000639132678770693,"diet_9":-0.13675581587279806,"diet_10":-0.07840088258186977,"diet_11":-0.0014833877018342416,"diet_13":-0.008995689063641047,"diet_14":-0.027920518012251705,"diet_17":-0.0010485804499088165},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
