They want to change it so the money goes to people making less money that are buying other EV's like the leaf/spark/fiat 500e etc\n\nRich people will buy a tesla because it's a great car and they can afford it. Middle class families may buy an electric because the $2500 the state provides makes the economies work better for them",

"comment": "It would be a fun hobby to build a battery backup system, but a *very* expensive one. A big bank of batteries isn't cheap, and neither is the high-powered inverter and charging electronics you'd need. Plus I hear the batteries need to be replaced somewhat frequently.\n\nAnyway, to answer the rest of your question, if you want to figure out how big of a battery bank you need, you have to ask yourself whether you need it to be enough to fill up the entire EV battery every day, or just half, etc. and how big that EV battery will be.\n\nLet's think small, so say you want to be able to charge half a Leaf battery. That amounts to 11 kwh in the Leaf pack, or about 14 kwh from your solar inverter, so maybe 15 kwh in your solar batteries. If you want to restrict them to a 20% depth of discharge, then that means you'd need a 75 kwh battery bank (that's a lot!)\n\nI think that your 20% DoD figure is unnecessary though. Looking at [this battery](http://www.wholesalesolar.com/products.folder/battery-folder/rolls-s550.html) I see a claimed 1000 cycles @ 70% DoD, which would lead to a much more reasonable 22 kwh system. Of course we're not considering covering your home's usage as well...\n\nAnyway, I'd check out that page I linked to more to learn more about setting up a battery backup system if you're really into it. But I have plenty of fun monitoring my \"regular\" grid-tied solar system and charging up my 2 EVs! It's especially fun since my utility pays me 3-4x as much for my solar production as it costs me to charge my cars overnight!",

"comment": "I've built several vehicles with solar panels on them.  Replaced the constantly failing alternator on a ~2000 ford ranger with a \"solar bed cover\", as well as another bed cover on my electric 52 ford f-1.  Also built an autonomous solar robot, mobile tool trailer with a solar roof, etc, etc.  that being said I don't think solar panels on cars is a great idea.  It's a matter of utilization and cost efficiency, plus a sub-optimal environment for the panels.  Allow me to put my reasons in list format.\n\n1) An electric car is often sitting ready to go with a full battery, nowhere for that solar power to go.  Return on investment requires maximizing the total energy out of that panel\n\n2) When the battery is drained and able to accept charge it's often in need of a huge amount of power, fast.  In order to be useful again you need many Kwh in a relatively short timespan, often at night.\n\n3) Orientation is only going to be optimal a small percent of the time.  When you're in clear sun you'll be pointed east/west/north/south at random, and much of the time will be spent shaded.\n\n4) Road hazards (rocks, sticks), vibration, and other physical damage.\n\n5) Dirt, mud, general road grime.  My car is often filthy.  It accumulates a layer of muck faster than anything else I own.\n\nNow compare that to a panel mounted on a house.  There is always somewhere for that power to go, the orientation is fixed and always optimized, far fewer physical hazards so the panels are cheaper/safer/far more likely to actually make power for their 30 year lifespan.\n\nRight now we need every solar panel to make as much clean power as it can.  When the day comes that most roofs are making power and we're turning to less optimal locations then cars make sense.",

It is being developed because certain places in Europe they make it very painful to export back to the grid. So this is being developed so that the battery are used before using the grid. and Everybody is working on a solution. \n\nAll inverters companies are working on a self consumption product line and are at different stages of development. \n\nIt is probably the worst kept secret at this point, what I hear in through the grape vine is that will be the product that Tesla will be announcing April 30th in conjunction with SolarCity. What I do not know is which inverter company they will choose to connect the dots. That is the only technology Musk doesn't own at this point. None of the inverter company, that I know of, have an elegant solution to perform the task.",

"comment": "First, congrats on being open minded, and considering buying an electric vehicle.  That alone is a big deal!\n\nHere are some important questions you need to ask/answer, as there are so many variables, and we don't want any confusion.\n\n1. What state are you located in?\n1. Which electric vehicle(s) are you considering?\n1. Are you talking about hardwiring a new charging station, or using an existing outlet?\n1. What do you mean by sufficient power, is the circuit dedicated, or did you talk to an electrician?\n1. In feet, how far is the spot from that power source?\n1. What's the budget?\n1. I assume you've secured permission of the parking lot owner and/or building manager?\n\nDon't let these questions overwhelm you, but they are important.  Pedestal charging stations do exist, but they are usually commercial grade (or at least priced that way).\n\nMost electric vehicles come with a portable level 1 EVSE (also referred to as a charging station, since the charger itself is built into the vehicle), which can be upgraded via [EVSEupgrade.com](http://evseupgrade.com/) to a level 2 station (and can be done even when leasing the vehicle). \n\nIn most cases, the portable form factor should do the job, so you can put it away when not using it.  If you do want to leave it in your parking spot, then a [ClipperCreek](http://www.clippercreek.com) with the [pedestal option](http://www.clippercreek.com/store/product-category/accessories/) might be a good idea, although this [Bosch pedestal setup](http://www.evchargesolutions.com/product-p/el-51253p.htm) might be the best bang for the buck, since those pedestals tend to run $700-$900 last time I checked.\n\nDepending on your parking lot layout, you might be able to fabricate a cheaper solution (such as hanging the portable version off a hook mounted on a rod/post).\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, check out [plugshare.com](http://plugshare.com), which is the top app/website showing nearby charging stations, reviews, etc.\n\nOnce you give us some more details, we can provide you with more accurate help.",

No one is willing to let their very expensive machines sit idle for so long just to recharge.  Fuel cells will always have a place in these markets.  It may not make sense for passenger vehicles, but that should not preclude companies like Toyota from pursuing it.\n\nFYI, fuel cells also send electrons down a wire, so you're not exactly making a very valid argument there.  They also have their own lithium ion battery packs.  The only difference between fuel cell EVs and pure battery EVs is a fuel cell vehicle has an onboard battery charger directly inside the vehicle.",

In China none of their cars is even in top-20 of best-selling EV models for 2018. As I said earlier: Chinese EV sales would be basically the same, with or without Tesla, they have a minor market share out there, even if you look purely at the BEVs. To give you an example: you mention BYD, the BYD e5, pure BEV, just 1 of their models, on its own, outsold **all** Teslas in China for the year. \n\nLook into individual markets. It's easy to get lost in extrapolating US sales to them. Noone's denying that bulk of Tesla's sales were in the US. But saying that \"*The EV universe would be nowhere near where it is today without them*\" is true only in USA (and *maybe* Norway), elsewhere it's not the case.",

The problem we had was although we had a petrol car capable of 900km per tank of fuel and the EV can only manage around 140km per charge, we tended to drive the LEAF because it is just so much nicer to drive. The good news is that this means servicing on the ICE becomes much rarer because we're not putting anything like the kms on it that we used to, and the EV needs virtually no servicing. The LEAF was very cheap and hasn't put a foot wrong and is what convinced me to ditch the ICE entirely and go for the model 3 once it was available here.",

There are too many against it or focusing on the wrong thing. Best example is Trump actively going against climate change because he makes a shit ton of money from it. People don't care and let the big oil companies destroy out planet. Yes the way animals are treated is fucked up but in my opinion there are much bigger issues to worry about.",

I'm not sure, but one thing I believe is true is that from the time the first Tesla Network car hits the road in any market to the time 50% of people in that market don't bother owning their own cars anymore will be around five years. At that will simply become too hard for most people to find (or afford) parking, to get insurance for a human operated vehicle, or to afford a garage or on-street parking for their private vehicle.\n\nSure there will be the holdouts who have to drive from Darwin to Nhulunbuy every week so they're not going to get rid of their diesel ute, but for most people whose driving involves at most 100km a day and the occasional interstate trip for holidays or visiting family, robotaxis will be a far cheaper option.",

The [insideEV's hwy@70mph test got 226mi from the dual motor](https://insideevs.com/reviews/443791/ev-range-test-results/) too. I expect most of these to be single-motor variants which means getting 220-240miles realistic highway range unless it's travelling at 85mph in freezing temps.\n\nI don't disagree that this car is an unusual choice for a rental car company (it's small, lacks the charging station reliability&amp;ease of Tesla superchargers, and has less range than many other EVs), but it's still absolutely a premium/luxury car.",

For example, while most US home outlets are 120V/15A (1800 watts), our 120V EVSEs are 1.4kW (80% of the peak rating.)\n\nMost of our high powered plug-in EVSEs are 9.6kW or less, because that's 80% of the 12kW peak rating of a 240V/50A outlet",

"comment": "You're welcome! It's important to remember that EV range ratings in America are pretty optimistic and frankly I don't think that does the industry any favors. People need realistic assessments of range so they can plan accordingly.\n\nMy cousin has a 2020 Chevy Bolt EV. Its advertised range is 259 miles and if you drive it no faster than 35 mph on flat ground in comfortable weather with no one else in the car, you may see that. Hills, highways, extra weight and hot weather (AC) or cold weather (heater) all conspire to reduce range. A trip from Bakersfield California to Ontario airport of about 160 miles pretty much wipes out the battery, requiring a fill-up from 20% or so to 80% to make it home.\n\nThe bright side? Even with California electricity prices, he's still saving some 50% at a charging station and much more than that at home relative to buying gasoline. His next step is to buy solar panels to capture some of that plentiful desert California sunshine and save even more.",

"comment": "The myth of Tesla being worth more than the entire industry put together is going up in flames. Musk is no longer untouchable as CEO, and Teslas margins are going to come back down to razor thin, just like everyone elses.  \n\nTesla had some really nice tech going on for a while. Great batteries, excellent drivetrain, autopilot, great UI. But those advantages are all going away. 800V cars charge faster than Tesla's. Other manufacturers are catching up in efficiency, and BMW is combining that with carbon fiber construction and build quality that is way out of Teslas reach (I find the iX hideous, but it's very impressive technically). Basic autopilot is no longer a differentiator, and full self driving is basically just fraud; Tesla is woefully behind Waymo and Cruise in the autonomous vehicle space. Tesla's infotainment is great, but Android Auto and Carplay are quickly becoming standard on every other car. Meanwhile, it turns out people actually like buttons.\n\nThe proprietary Supercharger network is basically their only remaining advantage. It's definitely worth something, but the wheels are in motion it seems to have a better rollout of standard chargers.",

Tesla service is famously awful, even worse than most dealerships.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you have a car issue at all, you're going to be screwed by Tesla's awful manufacturing chain (months to wait for parts). Low-morale workers too, they're overworked and underpaid relative to other locations.\n&gt;\n&gt;Dealerships may have high-pressure, but its because they own the shop and store. Tesla workers are constantly shit on by the higher ups. Its one of those things that \"if all goes well\", things will be fine. But if you actually need a human on the line (ie: an issue with your car comes up, or you need to set up an appointment, etc. etc.), then Tesla's model seems to fall over.\n\nThe Tesla would be a total desperation move because of dealers. \n\nOriginally I was looking at a Polestar 2 for the wife and an i4 for me, but now she's fallen in love with the Mach E. So I'll tug of War with Ford dealers to see if I can get one close to sticker with the options she desires. \n\nThankfully this is a \"want\" and not a dire need as both our existing vehicles run.",

Plus adding CCS support to their chargers could increase revenue from that part of their business. Win-win.",

Yeah that doesn't make any sense. The entire point of their system is to make it so the network can balance the load of many chargers over a predictable charge duration (the workday).

The Ariya charges better than both of packs on the bZ4X, just the amount of how much better matters on the pack you’re  comparing. \n\nRegardless, it’s still pretty sad that Toyota doesn’t even have charging on the level of the Ariya, which is by far not a charging beast. The Ariya doesn’t charge on the level of the ID.4 or Model Y and don’t even talk about the IONIQ 5 or EV6, but still is a better charger than the bZ4X. \n\nConsidering it’s just generally a nicer car and that having more range and being able to recharge the range that it has faster than the bZ4X means imo the Ariya is the best Japanese BEV offering as of now. Much better than the bZ4X and just leagues better than the MX-30 or Honda e (even if the Honda e is very cute).",

However, I was always looking down for the turn signals. Couldn't get used to it through the whole trip which involved city and highway driving in and around Seattle. If they could try to fit them side by side, that might be better.\n\nI was so happy to get back in my Y after that trip. My R2 reservation is going to be my lifeline for my next car. Gives Rivian a few more years to really dial in route planning, traffic re-routing, and build more service centers. What I'm really excited for are software mods for Rivian. Think S3XY buttons but for Rivian. Not for the buttons specifically, but for things like the Smart Actions that they have tons of (kickdown from chill to standard/sport/plaid mode, continuous autopilot, frunk/charge port unlock using door handles, etc)",

"comment": "Its probably baseless speculation on my part, but front motor frunks like the Air, Mach-e, Tesla, e-GMP, and what not, are RWD first, with a generally a smaller optional front motor to enable AWD. With Equinox EV, the larger motor and inverter up front, and what not, all has to be in the front as well. \n\nI do agree its likely a budget reason, but also combined with limited space/limited effort in packaging. A comparison would be the ID4, which should have room for a frunk, but poor packaging choices, and wasted space, combined with the front end design, limits room for a frunk. It is worth noting the Blazer which is more upmarket and larger, also lacks a frunk so it may be an platform choice for Chevy.",

"comment": "Wow this is a perfect explanation, thanks. One thing I'm confused on is what you mean by 5 hours of charge time.  I think what you are saying is the two solar panels in parallel would supply 10A (10A per hour?), 4.5A would go to the amplifier and 5.5A would go to charge the battery.  Let's assume the sun is out, it's perfect conditions, and the sun is an on/off switch.  If the sun rises at 9am and sets at 7pm, doesn't that give me 10 hours of \"free power\".  As in the battery will remain charged because it has no draw on it as the solar panels are powering the amplifier?  And if that is the case couldn't I get a lower Ah battery to only survive the night?\n\nIf I misunderstood I apologize, but using that thought process would it be more economical to get more solar panels instead of more batteries?\n\nI think based off your suggestion I'm going to stick with 12V.  It seems to be a little too much for me to worry about balancing 24V and it's double the cost in batteries alone.\n\nThank you again for your help.",

"comment": "It depends on the type of lease. There are system leases and PPA leases. \n\n* System leases you pay a flat rate based on the price/size of the system. It isn't based on how much you produce. If you produce 5000kWh or 10,000 kWh in a year, it's the same monthly fee. If you have net metering what happens is that during the day you are running your meter backwards thus building \"kWh credit\" with the utility company. When you are using the power during the night, you eat into the negative credit before you start racking up utility charges. \n\n* PPA leases are a bit different (this seems to be the type of offer they presented based on what you are saying) - These are based on how much you produce. Essentially the solar company becomes another utility company. Generally the rate per kWh for a PPA lease will be less than the utility rate so you will ultimately end up spending less money. So, in this case if you produce 5,000kWh you pay for 5,000 kWh. If you produce 10,000kWh, you pay for 10,000kWh. You still have net metering (if you are in a state that supports it) so you still continue to run your utility's meter backwards... but again you will still be paying for the power produced, just to the solar company instead.\n\nHere's some more [info](http://www.solarpowerrocks.com/los-angeles-solar/solar-ppa-vs-lease-solar/)\n\nThat being said, there really isn't too much difference in cost between the two. They both serve the same purpose of a low to no upfront cost system with reduced overall utility rates. Both generally have slight price increases as the years go on, and with both you don't technically own the system. \n\nThe only thing I can continue to recommend is get a few quotes for a few different leases/financing options. It'll let you decide which is the most cost-effective/beneficial for your specific house.",

Think \"kill your batteries and start fires\" bad.\n\nThe correct charging regime (CC to CV) requires some circuitry with brains to manage. NiMH eneloops are boring enough to get away with this - they have a near-constant-voltage discharge which is a butt to program chargers for, but great with 3.0v and a 0.5v diode.",

"comment": "First, I don't disagree with the 10% factor.  For inductive wireless that's pretty reasonable wall-to-charger.  Except there's more to it than \"10% loss\".  A lot of that loss comes from the power electronics you need to produce the 85 kHz signal in the inductive system (loss is frequency dependent) and in the rectification on the other end (because you can't feed 85 kHz into your OBC).  Then you get to worry about the inductive losses and gap.\n\n\nBut I did downvote you because your analogy isn't good.  Sorry, in advance, but I don't think it's apt.  It assumes an ICE car is 100% efficient in taking that gas and converting it into power.  Which it is not.  How much better is it than batteries in terms of converting that stored power (in the gas) into movement.... I really don't know.  But I would be surprised if the battery storage didn't have a 10% advantage in terms of energy transferred into motion.  So at that point you're still ahead, even when you're throwing power out in the power electronics to make your inductive link. \n\n\nThere's an argument to be made that inductive is not as good as cable charging, but you can't compare it to gas so easily.",

"comment": "&gt; Cheap, clean and readily accessible energy for all.\n\nNo, it's not CHEAP, if it was, we wouldn't have fossil fuels any more.  Right now, none of it works without huge government handouts.\n\n\nNo, it's not CLEAN.  Nobody talks about the huge pits dug for the rare earth magnets we need for wind.  Or the chemicals and components in solar panels, or the exposing of batteries after we are done with our 100,000 dollar car.  \n\n\n&gt;Ok let talk some science.\n\nFirst off, your chart from nasa shows 0.13'' of sea level rise in a year.  Of course you can't count the past two years as we went down in level. But over 20 years you are looking at .13'' of sea level rise that has been on this trend since the 1800's, way before man made co2 was even there.  It didn't speed up, and looks by all accounts to be slowing.  The total reverse of what the IPCC and Al Gore stated.  And now you... \n\n\n\n&gt;If you overlay this on a chart that shows CO2 levels. 2 wavy lines go up.\n\n\n[Ummm.. no they don't](http://joannenova.com.au/2011/07/global-sea-levels-started-rising-before-1800-jevrejeva/)\n\nIt shows that back in the early 1800's something triggered sea level rise, and about 100 years later, we started to produce more co2.  Nothing shows one effecting the other.\n\n\n\n&gt;Does it change the science behind his predictions?  \n\nYes, it does.  The IPCC double dipped in their forecast.  Just like Al Gore. So no, it's not just one person, but a whole hell of alot of people that stands behind the lie.  \n\nwhat they predicted:\n\n&gt;a/ Based on the acceleration in the last 300 years, they expect seas to rise by 34 cm this century anyway (without man-made global warming).\n\n&gt;b/ That the IPCC  reckons it will all get much warmer (frying-hot) on top of that trend, thanks to CO2.\n\nThe IPCC assumes that all the warming since 1780 is man-made and then extrapolates that wildly.  Everyone else with a brain knows this can't be true, as we didn't start our co2 output till the 1940's.  (right after the huge heat wave of the 30's)\n\n\n&gt;I personally think its too late \n\nThat's why you are an alarmist.  You are scared of the unknown, and will try to stop it at any cost.  If we had more people like you in the late 70's, we would of been trying to curb global cooling at all cost.  Thankfully, the far left didn't have that many people in power at the time, and we survived that lie.  \n\n\n&gt;I can see why you guys are fighting so hard to keep the status quo....\n\n\nSee, another alarmist observation.  You think since I don't agree with you, that I must work for big oil.  Or that I have some kind of profit from this.  The funny thing is, it's big green that gets all the money.  Take Elon Musk for instance.  You all point to him as some kind of Green energy GOD or something.  But he is nothing but a scam artist.  He takes Tax payer money to build an $80K car that few can afford, and uses California tax payers money to bail him out when he gets low on cash??  \n\nI'll let you look up how many millions of our tax dollars he has wasted, and still can't get it right.  Goes back to your cheaper lie you posted above, I can buy a 12,000 smart car and get 40mpg or 80K and burn coal and diesel at the power plant... hmmmm...\n\n\n\nThe reason I fight this is for the science and money.\n\nThat's right, to keep science honest.\n\nAnd to keep more money in my pocket instead of funding bankrupt solar plants, or failed electric rich peoples cars.  I'd rather buy my wife and kids something nice instead of making some liberal green tard happy in southern Cali.  \n\nWe can and do burn coal cleanly.  We also have great nuclear tech that you liberals won't let us use.  And gas, natural gas is very clean, but that shit comes out of the ground and it scares you.",

"comment": "No. I don't see how it costs the same for oil/coal/gas as solar panels. Because solar panels require expensive metals that must be machined to spec. That is inherently more expensive than the process currently used for fossil fuels. If it wasn't, then everyone would be building solar panels, not more gas plants.\n\n&gt;There's no point in drilling down on the price aspect.\n\nOK. Then there's no point in having this discussion. Countries like China are moving forward because 1) They have the worst of pollution in terms of population and raw output and 2)They're a communist-ish country. They can do whatever they want. Notice they're also moving forward with nuclear. A lot of it.\n\nAnd I don't buy into your argument that we don't build it because it's cheaper. In an unregulated market, if solar WAS really cheaper, you can bet your ass these companies would be building it. Companies would love cheap solar because it's fixed capital, no fuel cost and limited maintenance for the life of the system. But the fact is that it's not cheaper in the US right now. Which is why the market is building gas plants.",

I would ask the dealer if you pay cash if they can work with you on pricing. If they can, a HELOC is the way to go since you can get cash pricing and deduct the interest from your taxes. If they won't offer you cash pricing then just use whichever financing option they provide that you like best.",

"comment": "France had a program for several year where PV modules (not roof tiles) had to be integrated into the roof of a home. You might try researching that.\n\nSecondly, solar roof tiles have yet to prove themselves, despite all the hype from Tesla. There are MANY more electrical connections with the smaller tiles, more things to go wrong. The efficiency is generally lower, the cost is generally higher, including the mounting. \n\nThe solutions that win big in solar are generally simple, this applies to rooftops as well.",

A little overkill right now but batteries are getting bigger, internal charger getting higher amp capability and higher amp on capable cars will allow faster charging speeds. Get a properly sized main panel that is future proof like spare 60 amps since  upgrading wire/ panel is more expensive once its built and may require cutting walls open. Better to do it correctly once and not have to worry about it again in future.\nAlso plan ahead if you want to install Tesla powerwalls and provision the electrical system to easily install one if you decide to in future.",

It takes 30 years or more to recoup the cost of install, and by then they are trash or require so much maintenance it eats up the cost savings.",

"comment": "We’re two weeks in.  We just signed up for it  — we have the same problem in that our roof and array are not large enough to offset 100% of our usage.  I agree that the prompt for your utility login feels sketchy.  We made the leap based on [this review](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/09/16/first-national-exchange-for-renewable-energy-cuts-cost-of-electricity.html), and once you do, you see why they needed that.  \n\nOnce you sign up, they review your past usage stats (can take a week or more), then enroll you in the Smart Rate program by default.  Smart Rate guarantees 50% of generation from renewable energy (usually wind), plus the purchase of carbon offsets towards renewable generation projects.  They will only switch your provider to another one if there are savings, and you can see and compare your current power provider’s current and forecasted power rate chart vs. the other providers to validate that.\n\nYou also have two other choices:  Wind power (50% by default using the Smart Rate program’s parameters of ‘only at a cheaper rate’,  with an option to switch to 100% at a bit higher rate), and Community Solar, where you buy panels from a local community solar project and can even view production stats.\n\nYou also have the option (not a requirement) to switch payment of your electricity bill to them, which provides credit card billing and detailed usage stats.\n\nSo far, there have been no issues.  We haven’t been slammed into anything shady — it all seems on the up-and-up — and Arcadia tells us we can cancel at any time without fees.",

"comment": "Did you read the article?  The reason I shared it was because I strongly disagree with Bernie's abandonment of carbon taxes, which I believe are essential for getting emissions under control worldwide.  I agree with Bernie that we need a big response to the climate crisis.  I just think his proposed response is dangerously poorly thought out.  I don't think the CLC plan increases as rapidly as it should, but it's the right idea.\n\n&gt;Which brings us back to the plan, put forward this month by the Climate Leadership Council, that would actually work. Supported by energy companies (including Total) and environmental groups alike, it would impose a steadily rising tax on carbon. That would lead to reduced consumption and increased innovation in alternatives, including battery storage for solar and wind power. To get buy-in from industry, the plan would do away with a lot of regulation — but only so long as emissions were, in fact, going down.\n&gt;\n&gt;By imposing a tariff on imports from countries without similar carbon taxes, the plan would pressure those countries to follow suit. And the tax would be politically palatable, because every dollar would be returned in equal shares to taxpayers — with 70 percent of U.S. households ending up better off.\n&gt;\n&gt;“A carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary,” several thousand economists, including virtually every prominent economist to have served in Democratic or Republican administrations, said in a statement.\n&gt;\n&gt;It should be encouraging, then, that when The Post asked the Democratic candidates whether they would support setting a price on carbon, almost all either said yes (Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer) or maybe (Elizabeth Warren). There were two naysayers: ­Tulsi Gabbard and Sanders.\n\nI disagree with the article saying that change will not come from changing the source of supply, but a steeply rising carbon tax will change the equation so fossil fuels are expensive to use and alternatives will be attractive in comparison.",

Having spent tens of billions in subsidies on wind and solar and 20 years carpeting the country and windmills and solar panels, there has been practically no reduction in carbon dioxide gas emissions. Which was, after all, the justification for all the waste and destruction, in the first place.",

"comment": "It took me a while to get my Enphase system reporting reliably.  First, you have to figure out how it actually works (study the front panel and menus until you know how everything works and what the status display means).\n\nThe micro-inverters send a small signal down to your power panel.  Trusting that just plugging the EnPhase Envoy monitor anywhere in your house is a gamble.  You will be tempted to place the Envoy next to your router so you can run a simple ethernet cable.  Don't :-).  I must have tried every outlet in the house looking for a decent signal LOL.  Never got it to work, at least not reliably.\n\nI finally called my electrician, and we worked out powering the Enphase right at the solar power switch.  In my case, I used the power box from the transfer switch (I have a backup generator).\n\nOK, now you have a decent signal getting to the Enphase Envoy.\n\nNext hurdle will be getting the Enphase TALKING to your wireless access point.  I used the recommended USB wireless endpoint device (running an ethernet cable was not an option, although today I might try an WAP extender box).  You have to connect it to a 2.4Ghz WAP.  A 5/2.4Ghz WAP will not do.  Make sure you have a WAP dedicated to 2.4Ghz, and connect the EnPhase to that.\n\nOnce you have the 2.4Ghz WAP connected, and you are getting reliable signals from your micro-inverters, things should settle down.\n\nHope this helps!",

When they offered me 25 year loans with a 0.99% interest my first instinct was like \"hell yeah, 0.99% is nothing\" BUT included in this loan are hidden fees lumped into the loan total, which no one explained except for one super nice salesman. This fee is like a \"dealer cost\" or a \"buy-down\" price in order to receive the 0.99 interest rate.... which as it turns out was a 30% markup of the cash price... so my advice is take your time and crunch numbers from cash price to loan price, you may be able to see more-or-less what kind of hidden fees are included.",

"comment": "I’m a hobbyist. I have never set up a system exactly like this, nor have I directly used any of the products I’ve linked to. I can’t guarantee this setup will even work for you or that you won’t harm yourself in some way. I don't even cover the use of fuses or grounding for safety. I just hope it helps you understand the hardware and the costs involved. You’ll want to follow up and choose different hardware depending on your exact needs. I have not double checked my math, but hopefully it’s close enough.\n\nIt’s tough to address all your concerns without knowing a bit more. What is “cheap”, how often do you want to perform this 15 gallon water transfer, along with how many days do you want to use this without solar power (cloudy days)?\n\nThe pump you’re using is a 120 volt (AC), 2 amp induction motor which uses 240 watts (let’s use 250 watts for easier math) that transfers 5.3 gallons per minute. You’re transferring 15 gallons at once which takes 3 minutes and will use 12.5 watt hours of energy. A sine wave (because it’s driving an induction motor) inverter must be used to deliver AC to the pump, so let’s say it’s only about 80% efficient which means you’re really using 16 watt hours of energy. The solution must be based on this information.\n\nStarting with the battery, if you’re using a traditional battery (such as AGM), you probably don’t want to use more than half the stored energy for decent battery life. Since you’re using 16 watt hours, you’ll want at least a 32 watt hour battery. For a 12 volt battery this is 2.7 amp hours (32 / 12), so at least a 3 amp hour battery. A random 5 amp hour AGM battery on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/INTERSTATE-BATTERY-Lead-Internal-Battery/dp/B000BPCUXO) is $22. This packs 60 watt hours (12 x 5) so you’d be able to squeeze almost 2 of your 15 gallon transfers out of it before it’s at half charge.\n\nYou’ll need that sine wave inverter between the battery and your pump. Since it’s a 250 watt pump, at startup it might use 500 watts or more. A random 300 watt (600 watt) peak inverter runs $85 (https://www.amazon.com/AIMS-Power-PWRI30012S-Inverter-Continuous/dp/B0007911Y8). You may be able to find a more inexpensive one, but be sure it’s a) sine wave, b) 300 watt continuous and c) 600+ watt peak. And even then you must hope the pump doesn’t draw over 600 watts at startup (I don’t know how to determine that). Also notice this inverter is not weather/waterproof so you’ll need to supply some sort of enclosure and hope for the best.\n\nA solar panel will be used to charge this battery and you’ll want to go with a 20+ watt panel which will cost $32 (https://www.amazon.com/Newpowa-Watts-Solar-Module-Marine/dp/B00W813E4I). At 100% efficiency this panel would recharge the 60 watt hour battery in 3 hours, or deliver half the capacity (remember you’re only using half the battery at once so you don’t ruin it) in 1.5 hours. No system operates at 100% efficiency but we can probably say this will charge the battery in 2.5 hours on a sunny day and yield some wiggle room for those partly cloudy days when it might take 5 hours to charge.\n\nA solar charge controller must be placed between the solar panel and the battery, and fit between the battery and the pump. An inexpensive PWM controller should work and the solar panel and charge times above hopefully account for it not being the most efficient. I’d spend a few extra dollars and consider getting this $21 controller because it’s waterproof ([https://www.amazon.com/HUINE-Waterproof-Controller-Intelligent-Regulator/dp/B07CK2PCC7](https://www.amazon.com/HUINE-Waterproof-Controller-Intelligent-Regulator/dp/B07CK2PCC7))\n\nThis makes a solution using your current pump cost $161. (battery ($22), inverter ($85), solar panel ($32), solar charge controller ($21)). And this doesn’t include tools, wiring, connectors, mounts, enclosures, etc. And it’s not weatherproof\n\nSwitching to the DC pump recommended elsewhere in this post will cost $133. However it will eliminate the need for the $85 inverter, so would really only cost $48 more. Eliminating that inverter and using the better pump makes the system more weatherproof so you must consider those gains. Note the DC pump will take 5 minutes to pump the same amount of water (instead of 3), but in using only 8 watt hours, it saves 4.5 watt hours and is more efficient. While you could use this savings and downsize to a 10 watt solar panel, that only saves a few dollars. You could also go with a cheaper solar charge controller, but you’d only have $5 or $6 and it wouldn’t be weatherproof.\n\nAnother option you might consider is a battery generator/tank such as the Jackery 300 (https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-300-portable-power-station) which currently costs $280. It contains a 300 watt sine wave inverter but only delivers 500 watts peak so there’s the chance it may not handle the startup wattage of the pump so you’d be taking your chances as with the inverter I linked to above. The benefit is you can charge it in your home (eliminate the whole solar panel setup) and use it for many other things. The only downside I can see is needing to carry it to the garden and plug the pump into it, then carry it back when you’re done. If it works, it would probably drive that pump for nearly an hour so you wouldn’t have to charge it before every use.\n\nAgain - use this info only as a starting point. Good luck.",

"comment": "Would make sense. And some of that can probably be done. But, in 2020, the power curtailed was just 5% of total solar... It's relatively small and there's no \"harm\"  from producing too much solar than can be consumed. \n\nThe core issue is Late Winter/Spring when there's a lot of solar and little demand. And, solar cannot always be predictable, and for the Grid you need to always match supply with demand. If the system plans for 20mwh of solar, but the system ends up giving you 25mwh then not much can be done on the fly.  For other sources of electricity (nuclear, non-renewable) the power mostly always a known quantity. \n\nThere are three solutions they have for this issue going forward:\n\n1. better real-time market selling of that excess power (some of this already being done)\n2.  Battery storage.  2.5GW is planned for this year. That would mostly take care of current curtailment issues, but need more as Solar production increases. \n3. Other storage options.",

All Bay Solar seems to be pretty good on their own, good reviews online and from my friends.\n\nIf I didn't go with Sunpower, I would have gone with Your Energy Solutions with LG/Panasonic 340w panels ($3.24 per watt). Although I would say Solar Optimum had pretty good pricing with their Panasonic Evervolt 370w panels ($3.15 per watt).",

Then when the cloud goes away, the inverter will come back on, and the laptop will switch modes again.  If you have a windy, cloudy day, you will go nuts.\n\nOr maybe you have consistent clouds, however your laptop load varies greatly, so much so that it drops your panel voltage below the inverter threshold, which allows the panel to come back up and the inverter to power back up, and you once again constantly switch modes.\n\nYou will also get to enjoy finding a spot which is sunny enough for the panel, yet maybe has shade for you, and they need to be close together obviously.\n\nYou really need a pretty specific use case to make something like this work out the way you envision.\n\nOtherwise, get a large LiFePO4 battery instead.",

Each provider is slightly different on the base rate.\n\nI had 120% of 2020 (COVID work from home, newborn so wife was home a few weeks prior to lockdown). New electronics (EV, new gadgets, etc) has likely washed out most of that 20% contingency. \n\nI'd just say don't worry about the rate at the moment.

It may be worth way more in Florida than it is in KY due to a multitude of factors.  My experience in WA state says solar arrays aren't worth a whole lot.  But due to the lack of sun, not as much energy can be netted here.  Also, energy prices here are very low compared to the rest of the country because of all the hydro power.  I would check what the typical energy bill is in the new house.  If it's comparitively high, it might be worth it to bring it.  If not, it might not be worth the hassle.",

(And just counting on the batteries, not factoring in the solar, that's the next question.) Then, if you had your batteries at zero, no grid, but a clear sky, can your batteries be fully recharged just from solar, and how long would it take? Could you keep enough juice in the batteries, from the solar panels, to keep the aforementioned fridge and box fans running? (I lost power for 6 days because of a hurricane and our gas generator was enough to keep the fridge and a few small things running, wondering if solar and batteries could keep a fridge running for a week.)",

"comment": ">as stated it was being produced, as demo units. also as stated it runs off the heat differential via a heat bath. it also also states that these units are .3l in volume, so honestly how much energy do you think will be obtained?.\n\nHow much energy must be added to the system to maintain the heat bath. And if it only produces a very small amount of energy that why not just use the energy for the heat bath to produce electricity?\n\nI want one of these and can't find them anywhere on the internet. Would you provide the information you have on where it is being produced so I can get one.\n\n> It is a task for engineers to upscale these machines to larger applications of as shown in Figure 5 and 6 to be used in private homes or to power plant sizes.\n\nNo engineers are tasked by those they work for, not some idea someone came up with they think will work. There needs to be investors willing to risk their money to develop an idea that has merit. Where are these investors that have been convinced it will work?\n\n>The energy taking out by this large scale Gravity Machines as shown in Figure 6 has to be replenished by a heat bath, for instance a river connected to the upper or lower part of the Gravity Machine through a heat exchanger.\"\n\nIf you are using a heat exchanger which requires energy to maintain heat, why go through the additional process of installing in this device. Just use the energy that would be used to maintain the heat to produce electricity. Where are the calculations that compare how much additional energy must be added for the heat bath to the energy produced by this machine?\n\n> of course to get large amounts of energy, a large unit would need a large heat differential, hence an outside heat bath/sink. The atmospheric lapse rate is what - 6C/km? So to bolt something like this on the side of a 100m skyscraper would provide a heat differential of 0.6C. Shove a peltier into the asphalt and one up on the roof attached to some aluminium fins would create more of a heat differential than the adiabatic difference\n\nThat's using the cooling effect of the wind on the roof and the heat from the sun on asphalt to produce a heat engine. No need for this device. And it has nothing to do with gravity. It would be more efficient to install a wind turbine on the roof and solar panels at the base and produce electricity directly.\n\n>because in 2014 when that was written he was 86\n\nWell that would have made him 76 when he took out the patent. Besides the small unit is pretty simple to build so why not just build and sell them. Or why didn't he just get some investors to build them. Couldn't he find anyone that thought it would work?\n\n>how long should it take new tech to be mass produced? I'm still waiting on Ralph Sarich's orbital engine, and my mum was talking about that in the 1980's\n\nThe orbital engine did not claim to be a perpetual motion machine. The idea was funded by investors and installed in some cars in the 70s and 80s. Turns out it was not as efficient as existing engine technology so it was not a good investment long term. Like a lot of ideas it just didn't work out. But it did show that if someone has an idea that might work out you can find investors to try it. Not the case for this engine. \n\n>i honestly don't care if this unit gets mass produced or not - the fact it works and is being produced as demo units is enough to prove the fact that you cant admit -\n\nI would love to admit it, just show me where I can get one. If you can't then it obvious that you can't admit that it doesn't work and is not being produced. You need to put up or shut up. \n\n>physics sometimes needs updates :\n\nScience in general always needs updates. That's how science works. But the updates need to be based on science, not pie in the sky perpetual motion machines which violate what scientist know about thermodynamics. \n\n> the globe's surface is warmed adiabatically, and we can make gravity machines\n\nWell you have yet to show a gravity machine that makes electricity. Still waiting for it. And if one can't be made then it can't work in the atmosphere.",

Often, they seem more interested in selling themselves and getting donations and they certainly don't seem worried about sending out destructive messages about sizism, misogyny, body-hating, transphobia, elitism, etc. despite the fact that these things are unnecessary in the fight against animal exploitation (and often counter-productive). \n\n&gt;Plus, many (if not most) of the ads featuring nude women are in opposition to animal-based clothing such as fur. You don't have to be vegan or vegetarian to oppose that.\n\nYes, you can definitely still eat meat and wear leather and talk about how awful people are for wearing fur. I hear it all the time. PETA has capitalized on this fact. Rather than stick to their original line that animal aren't ours to use, they make great use of these single-issue campaigns to get donations out of various groups who otherwise would be less likely to donate to a group that pointed out that *the animal exploitation they enjoy* also is wrong and needlessly hurts animals. So, there are cow-eaters donating to end whale-hunting, leather-wearers donating to end fur-wearing, cheese-eaters donating to end meat-eating... around and around it goes and PETA profits. \n\nBut if they actually wanted to stop animal exploitation, they'd be better off showing people how it is all wrong because animal exploitation itself is wrong. Getting people to change themselves instead of donating in the hopes that someone will make someone else change may mean less money for PETA, but it's a whole lot more meaningful.",

I think we (as a community) could do more to let people encounter veganism in situations other than those situations when people are likely to feel \"cornered\" and get defensive.  (Where the omni then walks away thinking that the vegan was a preachy SOB.) \n\nIt can be hard to find the right place and time though. But as an example: I recently posted [this in the TIL-subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10rplz/til_actor_james_cromwel_was_vegetarian_and/) and it went better than expected. It didn't spark much of a discussion, but at least some people got to see the word \"vegan\" associated with a friendly looking old man (celebrity too). I don't know if it actually helps our \"PR-problem\", but I figured it could be worth a shot.",

It's early afternoon here, though.\n\n&gt;Are you under the impression i was running around being like 'oooh look at me i'm vegan'?\n\nNo, but I am under the impression you were using a word to describe yourself and then becoming highly antagonistic when told it was not a correct usage. \"no idea I was not allowed to use that term\" \"exclusive club\" \"fakey vegan\" are phrases you have been using so far. It's not about not being allowed, about veganism being an exclusive club or about you being a \"fake vegan\". It's about the fact that you were not living a vegan lifestyle, as such you weren't a vegan. You can own a surfboard, but if you don't surf and it just hangs on the wall, you're not a surfer.\n\nDid you also abstain from eggs? \nETA: and other dairy products such as whey, casein, milk powder?",

It was mutual and friendly because we just realised we weren't the right people for each other. Ultimately it's up to you what you do. Your ethics don't align with his, and you are passionate about something which he isn't. These things are ok if you're both happy with that. The fact that you're asking this question at all suggests you might not be. But I had the same feeling you're describing: \"can I be with someone who doesn't care about this long term\". Personally I decided no. I wouldn't be against dating a non-vegan, but it's important to me that someone cares about it, because it's something that's so close to my heart. The happiness of animals, the health of our planet, I place them as highly in importance as my own health and happiness. I'm really finished with apathy, it's an unattractive quality. Do what you feel is right.",

"comment": "Wanted to post this as I've seen a few people having a pretty crappy Christmas. I'm incredibly lucky that the vast majority of my family are super supportive! But I'm even more lucky that my sister turned Vegan about 18 months ago. You see, she put together the bulk of this hamper, even though at times me and my mum's husband mocked her at Christmas with our pigs in blankets, or turned our noses up at tasting her Vegan swaps etc, the fact is that she used restraint in not shouting at me or just stabbing me in the face with her fork lol. Her continued quiet determination has helped me so much in coming to the decision myself to stop contributing to the horror that meat and animal products produce. I want this to not be a show of how lucky I am, but to those who are having a crap Christmas with unsupportive family etc to STAY STRONG! You might not be influencing anyone today or tomorrow but eventually someone will ask to taste your meal, try your cashew milk in a cup of coffee or realise lots of their favorite foods were already accidentally Vegan. You might not turn your entire family Vegan, but you could reduce their consumption of animal products. So my message is if you don't have supportive family or friends, please hold on to the hope that you do have the power to influence others no matter how closed minded they my seem. After all a quiet, non confrontational, non pushy and all round awesome sister totally helped me to realise my new vegan life and I was a grade A asshole! Hope everyone has had a super Christmas! Much love to everyone!",

"comment": "---\n\n&gt; Thankyou for your time and reply to my questions which i have so far not had an in-depth answer from anyone.\n\n---\n\nYou bet!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt; Why am i instantly taken as 'strange' because i haven't commited myself to the 'entry level' philosophical position?\n\n---\n\nTo be clear: it's not so much an \"instant judgement\" as it is the product of an \"aggregated consideration of the positions stated\".\n\nBut the \"strange\" bit comes from the notion that you're questioning deeper level nuances of the philosophical position of vegans with an apparently earnest interest in the topic even while you yourself haven't indicated that you agree with the basic premise of the philosophy of veganism (i.e. that other animals are deserving of equal ethical consideration). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt; I agree with positions on factory farming and animal cruelty, however by your standards it is wrong for me to keep my own chickens (which have an acres of land to roam free and a massive pen to call home at night so foxes won't eat them) which naturally lay eggs and aren't forced into anything is labelled using and being cruel towards them as animals instead of nurturing and loving them as animals.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. Let's talk about eggs in particular then.\n\nTo begin with, there's the issue of eggs being so dreadfully _bad_ for human health. Heck, [even the USDA, who has a vested interest in promoting eggs due to its animal agribusiness connections, still explicitly holds to the opinion that they're very explicitly _not_ good for human health](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe/).\n\nThat aside, there's the issue of setting expectations for oneself and for others with regard to their dietary habits; if someone eat eggs at home because they know the chickens are well cared for _and_ because they're planning on keeping them in to their dotage until they die naturally of old age, then they'll be in the habit of eating them when they're _outside_ the home as well, and this will cause them all manner of social awkwardness is they attempt to explain to people why there's a problem between the two contexts. In short, it would have the appearance of being hypocritical, and would likely diminish one's efficacy in either passive or active advocacy efforts, and such mixed messages ultimately hurt more animals.\n\nBut it's really a question of the relationship with the animal itself and what it says that someone is taking her eggs to eat them. We can't look at a cow and reasonably fool ourselves in to thinking that she's creating milk for _our_ use, and we likewise can't reasonably look at a hen and think she's creating eggs for _us_. Imposing our will on her by taking and eating her eggs _even though_ we cannot reasonably assume that she would agree to such a relationship is ethically indefensible (pretending for the moment that she had the cognitive function to grasp the situation and respond to it). As such, eating \"eggs\" is a non starter for _that_ reason as well.\n\nFinally, on a personal note, I just find the idea of eating the menses of another species (or even of my _own_ species for that matter) to be a fairly revolting idea.\n\nWithal, vegans don't take eggs from hens to eat them _even if_ they have hens in their care for some reason. Fair enough?\n\nFor more resources along these lines:\n\n* See the [\"What about eggs?\" link in the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/eggs).\n* A great summary of all the issues can be found at \"[Can Vegans Eat Eggs From Backyard Chickens? VEGGANS?!](http://bitesizevegan.com/ethics-and-morality/can-vegans-eat-eggs-from-backyard-chickens-veggans/)\".\n* Check out \"[Fowl Play](http://www.fowlplaymovie.com/)\", a film about the egg-laying industry.\n* Also \"[Can Vegans Eat Eggs From Backyard Chickens? VEGGANS?!](http://bitesizevegan.com/ethics-and-morality/can-vegans-eat-eggs-from-backyard-chickens-veggans/)\", a summary in brief of all the issues covered here.\n* The resources on the [\"Eggs Are Not Unethical\" fallacy page](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/eggs-are-not-unethical/resources).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt; I respect the practice of veganisim and what it stands for however i can't call myself 'vegan' and i don't think I'll ever subscribe to the practice. I have a great relationship with the food I eat with most of it grown by myself or bought from the farmers market or fish caught by myself while practicing a sustainable fishing practice.\n\n---\n\nThe \"food you eat\" are individuals with their own thoughts, emotions, and desires. Calling a sentient individual by the word \"food\" is a way of removing his or her agency, and protecting yourself from the knowledge that you're needlessly killing a sentient individual. Slave owners did/do the same thing (i.e. a \"slave\" is not a \"human\", so doesn't get the same rights), and rapists do the same thing (i.e. a \"bitch\" isn't a person like their \"mother\" is, and is just a tool for their gratification).\n\nThere is no humane way to kill and individual that doesn't want to die. You perceiving yourself to have a \"great relationship\" with your victims doesn't stand as an ethically consistent justification for killing, objectifying, or commodifying sentient individuals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt; Alot of people just go to the supermarket and mindlessly consume products they have no idea where they come from, education is key and everything in moderation if you don't eat organic or grow your own vegetables without pesticides your still supporting massive amounts of pollution to soil and death to bees, birds and plants. \n\n---\n\nCrop fields do indeed disrupt the habitats of wild animals, and wild animals are also killed when harvesting plants. However, this point makes the case for a plant-based diet and not against it, since many more plants are required to produce a measure of animal flesh for food (often as high as 12:1) than are required to produce an equal measure of plants for food (which is obviously 1:1). Because of this, a plant-based diet causes less suffering and death than one that includes animals.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the idea of perfect veganism is a non-vegan one. Such demands for perfection are imposed by critics of veganism, often as a precursor to lambasting vegans for not measuring up to an externally-imposed standard. That said, the actual and applied ethics of veganism are focused on causing the least possible harm to the fewest number of others. It is also noteworthy that the accidental deaths caused by growing and harvesting plants for food are ethically distinct from the intentional deaths caused by breeding and slaughtering animals for food. This is not to say that vegans are not responsible for the deaths they cause, but rather to point out that these deaths do not violate the vegan ethics stated above.\n\nFor more on this, [check out the resources on the ***\"Vegans Kill Animals Too\"*** fallacy page](http://yvfi.ca/veganskill/r).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt;I don't see any vegans posting study's on soil and water pollution from the run off from vegetable farming causing massive damage to the environment.... \n\n---\n\nRespectfully, you haven't seen it because you haven't looked. Take a gander at \"veganic\" gardening practices, the studies done on it, etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt;the list goes on.\n\n---\n\nNotably, so do the answers. Please ask away!",

As the whey powder was sourced from cheese made with calf rennet, UK Oreos were also not suitable for vegetarians. However since Spring 2013, the whey powder has been removed and UK Oreos are now suitable for vegetarians and vegans. In 2014 Oreos also became vegan in the US.\n\n&gt;According to the FAQ on Oreo UK site They are not vegan as they have the cross contact of Milk.

And yes there might never be true ending of animal exploitation but we are going to get very close one day. As you mentioned slavery still exists as well as oppressive governments that exists as opposed to democracy. But as the world becomes more connected things will change. \n\nLab-grown meat is going to be a widespread reality within two decades. There already is ice cream made from lab-grown dairy. Animal rights laws are in their infancy but they will only increase. For example in 2018, Trump sign an act banning the consumption of dog and cat meat in America. It will take time but the sustainability/economic inefficiencies of animal agriculture will be disrupted by new technologies.",

But only once you process it, you’d gag trying to eat raw meat same as me. \n\nI think when vegans say they dislike meat/dairy it’s a genuine distaste/disgust. But that is partly psychological, but then again enjoying eating meat and dairy is partly psychological too, because you aren’t comprehending the suffering on your plate.\n\nYeah stuff tastes good, just try to eat the stuff that tastes good AND isn’t horrible. Human meat probably “tastes good” too",

I can understand someone being vegetarian a bit better, but veganism is a bit much. Why are you vegan?”, and so I try to say, while still trying to work on my breathing “well for the animals and the environment”, and she says “but what about dairy animals, they’re fine, the farmers take care of them”, and I say “well they get slaughtered too, so of course I chose to be vegan instead of vegetarian”, and she’s like “but that’s not true though, that’s so not true!” And walked away. I must tell you that she said this in a firm and angry manner, like she was literally pissed off at someone who needed to go to the hospital to get assistance for their breathing, and while that person was trying to calm down and get their breathing in order, they have a nurse borderline yell at them, thanks to them being ignorant.",

Technically I think they fall more into a Libertarian category, because I haven't yet met a vegan who supports the human rights abuses the Republi-cons have come to stand for... but I do know that some vegans believe in a radical free market and some vegans are anarchists who want to abolish the government.\n\nI think the whole left/right idea doesn't adequately capture some of these people though. Lots of anti-vaxxers I know hate Trump. They just don't trust big Pharma either.",

"comment": "Well for one thing, because the article has problems even if we do just focus on the meat side of things. As I mentioned, emissions aren’t always the biggest issue. For instance, I’m more concerned about all the local waterway pollution in my area from the large numbers of chicken farms and several processing facilities than I am about their emissions. But still, what if I had backyard chickens? What would the emissions/pollution from that look like? Not much. Back when I was growing up and had to hunt and fish in order to have enough food to eat, how did that contribute to environmentally unsound practices? We only took whatever animal we could get and only as many as we needed. Local meat production/consumption can look very different than what the article presents. \n\nNow granted, when it comes to non-vegans arguing about these things I don’t really care or grant them much grace. Because we all know they “only eat local/sustainable” while cheating with weekly fast food burgers, steak house trips and other non-environmentally friendly options. But none of that is relevant to whether or not local (even non-vegan) options are better for the planet. Which is a conversation I don’t think the article does a good job of providing a comprehensive picture of.",

People could climb up coconut trees to harvest coconuts, not monkeys. I know machines increase productivity, but they're also not that careful. The subsidies would also allow plant farmers to spend some time scaring off animals or catching and releasing them, instead of outright shooting them. More humane methods. They could move bird nests that are in the way. In the case of the olive fields, the machines could operate during the day so they don't have to use their night lights to dazzle birds.",

He said her genetic ancestors were the ones who would have survived famine.\n\nThere’s a vegan guy on YouTube “plant based dads” channel who is like this too.

The article makes a point at saying that they could not have survived without this hunting\n\n> Despite the diverse array of plants collected at Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, it’s very unlikely the people who lived there could have remained healthy as strict vegetarians, says Henry.\n\nThis isn’t to counter veganism just that humans have been eating meat for a varying long time",
