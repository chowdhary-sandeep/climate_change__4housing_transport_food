"comment": "It's hard to give you a favorite when there are so many good ones! It might help to know what category of EV you're looking at, since there are a large selection of EVs on the market right now with radically different sizes and limitations.\n\nAre you looking for a small, inexpensive BEV with less than or equal to 100 miles of range? You'll want to look at the Focus EV, the I-MiEV, the Leaf, the Spark EV, the 500i. \n\nAre you looking for a no-compromise but pricy luxury BEV with hundreds of miles of range and incredible performance? There's the Tesla Model S.\n\nOr are you looking for a standard-size vehicle with limited electrical range and a gas-burning range extender? There's the C-Max, the Fusion Energi, the i3, the MKZ, the Plug-in Prius, the Volt.\n\nMy personal favorite is the soon-to-end-production RAV4 EV, which is the only \"mid-range\" BEV on the market today - a standard-size RAV4 crossover with a speedy Tesla drivetrain and over 100 miles of range.",

"comment": "I am in Chicago area, and know many of the PV installers here - I have even trained a few.  I and an installer put a 2.6 kW system in on my own house last year for .$7,800, and collected 55% in rebate and tax credit.  Wow!  I put in a similar system on a neighbor's house 5 years ago, and the completed price was $27,500!  So take the advice posted by kludgefactory, and get in while the getting is good.  \n\nIt is very unlikely you will zero out your ANNUAL sum for electric bill.  Of course, for some particular day or month, you may.  \n\nNet metering in Illinois is like it is in most states:  If you do by golly generate more than you use by the end of your billing year, the surplus will apply to the following billing period or year.  But after another year, any surplus from that then previous year disappears.  \n\nYou should also look at signing on for RRTP (residential real time pricing) with ComEd.  I did so 5 years ago, and have saved about 20% on my costs without making much of any adjustment to my energy use.  ComEd would not allow combining both the Net Metering agreement and RRTP for several years, but they do now.  \n\nAlso, the Illinois rebate for PV (25%), though it is open for new applicants at the moment, is fickle.  It may close soon, and will stay closed until more money accrues in time.  Your contractor should be able to coach you on timing, etc., in this regard.  \n\nLastly, there is no selling of your REC available to individual homeowners in Illinois at this time, but keep an eye on the ISEA program for aggregating REC's.  In the past, they were the only authorized agent in Illinois to pay you for your RECs, and they may be able to start doing so again, or direct you on how to do it.  Last time they were able to payout, they paid about $200 per Megawatt-hour.  Your 2.2 mW system is likely to be able to produce between 3 and 4 mWh/per year, which once had value of $600 to $800 free income/year.",

One, there's not that many of them on the road, comparatively, and two, passenger automotive is not the only source of \"pollutant emissions.\"  We are talking a fraction of a fraction, here.  \n\nStill, in terms of energy efficiency, electric cars (and electric rail) use much less energy to get the same job done as fuel powered vehicles, because of the higher efficiency of electric motors.  There's less waste, and that's a good thing.\n\nAre electric vehicles \"good enough\" to replace fossil fuel vehicles in every situation?  Hell no.  But they are good enough to replace *some* of the gas burning cars, and this is a good thing.",

Look up game theory. This is not about a conspiracy, it's about the interest of each player involved. The government wants to sustain itself, it's just the nature of government. Governments always grow bigger and more expensive, never smaller and more efficient. So if climate change helps towards that goal (more regulation, higher taxes, more control), the government will do it. Everyone has skin in the game. Corporations get cheap loand and tax credits (wind mills, solar panel companies, Tesla, etc), scientists get research grants, regulators get job security, etc. It's a very complex game and every player tries to maximize their own profit, whatever that means for them. The government doesn't **want** climate change to be real, the only thing that the government **wants** is to strengthen its power, but it's not because of some dark room secret meetings, it's because every person involved wants to keep her/his job and please her/his boss.",

"comment": "Parity in this case is the minimum threshold where the loan cost meets and begins to be less than the $ saved.  Lets use your example:\n\n$25K over 15 years @ 7% is a monthly payment of $225.\n\nIf you saved $1500 in your first year, you saved an average of $125 a month leaving you $100/mo below parity as I've defined it.\n\nOh wait! you say, you got a tax credit.  Lets assume your tax credit was 33%  (which it won't be that high, but it's a nice even number).\n\n$16,750 over 15 years @ 7% is a monthly payment of $150.  Again, your electricity savings of $125/mo is less than $150.  Even at an annual electricity increase rate of 5% (which again, is wishful thinking for solar owners), you won't hit parity until quite a few years in leaving you a few years to make up the difference.\n\nAgain, my point all along here (and getting downvoted for it) is that getting a loan will not reach a financial parity (aka, your payment is &lt;= savings) until you get a loan that's roughly 15+ years (which appears to be the case for you -- it's pretty close at 15 years, but still not quite there).\n\nAgain, it's not a \"bad\" deal to overpay for 15 years only to save (significantly) for the next 15, but it's not parity with the loan cost while you have the loan.  Additionally, states that have other benefits could throw this equation out the window.  I mean, if XX state wants to give you another $5K back, then sure - these numbers change, but I can't foresee all of those circumstances.  I qualify my statement with \"in an area where you're only dealing with the federal tax credit.\"",

"comment": "You have some good points about fanboysm, but the truth is that the acceleration is, by far, most interesting in the real life than the track capability. We have legal speed limits not to bother us but because physics is very cruel as speed goes up. So the acceleration is very useful to pass more safely slow cars or trucks, specially in countries like mine where there is a lot of hills and medium mountains where passing cars and trucks are a very dangerous challenge. For the track capability, I only see it being useful for German drivers in their Autobahns without speed limit, elsewhere it would be dangerous and only fast consuming power.\nUnless you have ICE cars with a propulsive engines with more than one century of heavy investment from car-makers or Rimac which will cost you more than 1 million...\nSo, we should let Tesla, or others, perfect this infant technology (as the last Tesla 90D cars seems to show, and then the 100D even more) to be able to do high speed during more and more time without overheating. Be patient because, first (10 years ago) they were only \"golf carts\" with no acceleration (so very dangerous in the middle of real life traffic), now the acceleration beat all other cars, inclusive most of million dollars supercars. But for now, they overheat in tracks and have less range...YET. Let pass less than other 10 years, and then some will complain that EVs are good in acceleration, are good in tracks and have fairly good range but...they don't fly yet! Naysayers will stay naysayers until the end.",

Also, EVs aren't notoriously inefficient at highway speeds, it is just a natural effect of drag where as you try to go faster it takes more energy to move the air out of the way. An EV is typically more efficient at highway speeds than an ICEV with lower drag coefficients. ICEVs are less efficient at lower speeds because they have to keep their engine running while moving slowly so their MPG is worse around town than on the highway where they're moving along with long gearing and the engine is typically running in the most efficient part of their power band. Even so, they still only use around 25% of the energy in the fuel they burn to move the car forward. An EV is more like 90% efficient at all speeds.",

Before this we had never driven Chevy or Chrysler vehicles, but they’ve both been very reliable so far. We liked the Volt for its range and the way it drives. It felt more like a car than the Prius and was sportier. The Pacifica has the most seating and the largest storage space, and to be honest the interior trim is fantastic. We like the EV only feature on the Volt and wish the Pacifica had it. Other than that, I’d say don’t listen to people telling you the technology is changing.... it is but these are solid cars.",

An 11% increase. Read a book, get a laptop out and do some work, that time will go by in no time and your rest break will be a bit longer meaning you hit the road fresher.",

"comment": "Interestingly, that makes the case that natural gas derived hydrogen is better. The efficiency of natural gas to hydrogen to FCV is very comparable to natural gas to electricity to BEV. It is especially true in context of gas peakers and not CCGT. If you use a battery to replace the gas turbine that also lowers the overall efficiency of the BEV cycle to be much closer than a overly simplistic analysis shows. \n\nThe core article here is *VERY* simplistic, and has a lot of pretty out of date and/or pessimistic assumptions to get the well-to-wheels energy ratios they put up. I can show 10 year old anti-hydrogen papers that aren't even close to as pessimistic as this paper.",

"comment": "&gt; Is it too much to ask for multiple charge ports? \n\nI think it is. \n\nCopper is expensive and adding 2 of everything required for safely running DC charging probably isn’t cheap. A lot of EV conversions don’t even bother with DC charging and just stick with AC citing the cost of a DC system. Some early EVs actually had DC charging capability itself as an optional extra to help lower the cost which was sort of palatable given the smaller batteries. \n\nTaycan and e-tron do have an optional second AC charge port on the driver side. The cabling for this much thinner and would not be as expensive so they could probably justify that without worrying too much about cost. Thinner cables are more flexible as well, so it doesn’t need as much additional space for routing it around.",

Every single person I know who has a wallbox installed has a 11kw one, lower is really not common.\n\n\nEven then how often do you think you come home with literally 0% and need the full 100% the next day. The idea is that you are always charging when you are parked at home so 0-100% should be super rare anyway. You will leave your home with the full 420miles range every single day. How often do you get into your hybrid and are low on gas? That should not be a thing with a BEV. \n\n\nYou can also charge on a fast charger for 30min and get 80% full.",

Tesla does not \"have a motor that inverses the charge within\". Almost all EVs, except from very cheap golf carts, as well as does Bolt, and Tesla, do come with proper regen mod of operation. Regen means that the controler of the motor reconfigures so it starts operating like a generator, uses the inertia of the vehicle, which results in slowing down of the vehicle, this is used to replace breaking to certain degree. It is not only acceleration that uses energy, driving at constant speed also requiers additional energy consumption due to frictions. Activating any kind of mechanisim for constant speed run can only harm.",

I think a lot of people put a little too much emphasis on range when charging speed is just as if not more important. 450 miles of range doesn't do you much good if the charging speed is super slow. Certainly depends on your type of driving of course but when a Tesla can charge fast enough right now to go 1,000 km an average speed of 60 miles an hour including charging stops, That's pretty darn good and it's only getting better. I would take that over longer single time range and slower charging for sure.",

"comment": "We totally are. Most of my friends are drooling over the capabilities of the Rivian. But most of us want the infrastructure in place and bigger batteries before we fully ditch IC engines all together. \n\nTowing cuts range in 1/2 on a Rivian. That means I'd be charging for about an hour every hundred miles or so. Two practical problems with that.\n\n1. 1. On an 18 hour trip from SF to Glacier, you're adding 12 hours of stops. That adds an extra day to your trip each way. \n2. Once you're off the interstates, you're not going to find super chargers every 100 miles. Charging at L2 stations or camp grounds adds a LOT more time. \n\nI'm hoping this changes in 5 years, because that's when I'll really be in the market for a EV Pickup. But if I needed a new truck today, I'd have a really hard decision to make.",

On top of that I don’t want my car to be associated with Elon. \n\nOther companies go out of their way to keep out of the news for any issue that isn’t about the cars. Not Tesla, they have worked to make the brand an extension of the CEO. \n\nThe model y lr was once $47k. It’s now $58k. Also the X has 11 month wait times, the lr model 3 is also backordered until sometime next year. So Tesla prices go up just like other brands and the wait times are similar. Just Tesla pockets the price increase not the dealer. So I don’t think people who want a Tesla will get them off the lot at sticker any time soon. Though, Tesla does have a better dealer experience as there are no markups or other shenanigans. \n\nI think every ev made will be sold quickly for a while. The ones that don’t qualify for the credit will sit on lots a bit longer and get less of a markup. \n\nThe best bet for a full tax credit is likely the bolt and it probably won’t get it right away. Several teslas are over the price caps for the credit, M3P. Others won’t qualify as the buyers make too much money. \n\nI think the politics only hurt Tesla. The tax credit is good for them and equally good for other North American made cars brands. The income limit will hurt Tesla in particular.",

"comment": "Wow a lot to digest here. The fraud alert is a one time thing that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nNo, range shouldn't be that bad with most EVs. You likely had the basest of the base model 3s, which only gets about 220mi of real world range on the highway in optimal conditions, and more like 150 in the dead of the winter. Turning off the HVAC heater can go a long way to extending EV range.\n\nEVs are only a good choice if you can 95+% live off charging at home.\n\nI always chuckle a bit when I hear how loud Teslas are at freeway speeds. Our Bolt EV is pretty much dead silent up until 70mph then the wind starts to pick up. Anything under that and an EV should be pretty much the quietest thing you've ever driven outside of a high end Merc. If it's not, that company is just doing a very bad job with sound insulation.\n\nSeems like an EV is for you imo, but you need to get one with a better base range. Look into the steady 70mph freeway range tests to get a good gauge of what vehicles are actually meeting or exceeding their advertised range. If you want to stick with Tesla, best to open your wallet and get an AWD long range. Used Bolt EV with a factory replaced (under warranty) battery can be had for under $15K used... That would def get you comfortably through a 50mi round trip with home charging. \n\nAlso remember that it's ok to drop to 40%. You just don't want to regularly go below 20%.",

The road trips I've done, the car was always ready to continue before I was. I have the EV6 which is a cousin of the Ioniq 5. If you're the type of person who doesn't mind longer breaks on a road trip like me, you might be happy with slower fast charging. If you're the type to pee in bottles and drive nonstop for 15 hours, go for the fastest charging you can get your hands on.",

Yes Tesla makes it easy and even in Europe EV rental is easy. But in USA and for the most part Canada EVs are seen as the devil… \n\nThen there is the stress factor. If ur renting a car you are likely on holiday and just want to get to where you need to go…. \n\nThen again! There is hertz with charge return requirements that change as the wind blows. Mind you the 25-30$ recharge fee lately is great. I bring the car back empty and don’t need to worry about. I get charged one price",

"comment": "I can certainly understand the appeal of trying to save money by doing a solar installation yourself. I was tempted to go the DIY route myself when I first started looking into solar. But after doing a lot of research and talking to both professional installers and DIYers, I ultimately decided that for my situation, hiring a reputable installer was the way to go. Here's why:  \n  \n1. Safety concerns: Working on a roof with high voltage electrical equipment is inherently dangerous if you don't have the proper training and safety gear. One misstep could lead to serious injury or worse. I'm fairly handy, but I recognized that this was beyond my skill level.  \n  \n2. Permitting and inspections: Getting all the necessary permits and passing the required inspections was a daunting prospect. My installer handled all of that paperwork and liaison with the city and utility. It was a big load off my mind.  \n  \n3. Warranty and support: My system came with a 25-year warranty on the panels and a 10-year warranty on the workmanship. If I had done it myself and something went wrong, I'd be on the hook for repairs. With my installer, I have someone to call if there's ever an issue.  \n  \n4. Optimizing the design: A professional designer was able to look at my unique roof layout, shading profile, and energy needs to come up with a system that maximized my production. I would have been guessing at the best configuration.  \n  \n5. Financing and incentives: My installer helped me secure a low-interest loan and guided me through claiming the federal tax credit and local incentives. That savings helped offset the cost of professional installation.  \n  \nNow, I'll admit I probably could have saved some money upfront by doing it myself. But for me, the long-term peace of mind that comes with a professionally installed and warranted system was worth the extra cost. I didn't want my roof to be a guinea pig for my first attempt at electrical work.  \n  \nThat said, I know there are people out there who have the skills and risk tolerance to tackle a solar install. If that's you, then more power (pun intended) to you. But I would still advise doing a ton of research, getting very comfortable with the electrical aspects, having a solid plan for permitting and inspections, and being realistic about the time and effort involved. It's not a small undertaking.  \n  \nIn the end, I was happy to pay a bit more to have experts handle it. My system has been cranking out the kilowatt hours trouble-free for five years now, and I've got someone to call if anything goes wrong. For me, that was worth a premium. But everyone has to weigh the tradeoffs for themselves.",

This will let you limit charging to only what you’re generating from solar.\nIt’s quite clever, you can also set a certain offset into it to account for energy used by your household during the daylight hours.\nNot sure if it works with non Tesla cars yet.\n\nIn any case, I love my Zappi, but regret the purchase slightly as Charge HQ does the same thing without the $2k outlay required to install the Zappi.",

Then I started applying to jobs at solar companies; SunRun, SolarCity, SunEdison, First Solar are all large companies that are constantly hiring. Go look at some jobs on their websites and try to network with people in the industry. \n\nIt's a very demanding industry with a constantly changing technological and political landscape..

"comment": "Definitely not a clear line. Some integrators will work to break off the largest % of roofing costs to be designated solar construction. \nBut of course they would, it is not their risk. Is all on owner who makes ITC/IRS filing. And, only whether is flagged for review among millions of applications - but during the elongated ~7 year clawback period. \nReplacing age-worn shingles to support solar array for example would not be allowable. But, adding structural elements to support increased lb/ft load for solar likely would be. \nI have not heard of a lot of bad outcomes/IRS audits happening on residential/small commercial system applications. But, understand IRS reviewers are trained to flag roof costs. \nIn my business we have very serious accounting and legal consulting review services who parse every line item (as fun as it sounds)... There are definitely similar services/consultants for smaller projects - likely in the NJ-NY-CT axis (vs RI direct). \nOr start with your local SEIA - probably mid-Atlantic/NJ; but may be a NE chapter too. They could direct or ID supporting documentation. National SEIA has some good research materials. \n\nWithout a doubt some portion of roof costs are included in many ITC applications - just want to ensure you are not outside the norm. Hope helpful. \nOn the roof itself, ideal to somewhat integrate projects - roofer can install and seal needed penetrations at install time and then maintain warranty. Otherwise, if ballast, roof manufacturer may require slip sheet material to prevent abrasion of roofing surface (and require warranty inspection before/after to certify). From +7 years ago recall rubber/membrane roof manufacturers to be tougher of manufacturers to appease/maintain warranty - but that may have changed w increased installs etc. \n\nIf you are seeking PPA the provider will deal will all these elements/risks. \n\nLove RI and (once) the RI market (I am in mid Atlantic) so hope you are able to build without incident and that my notes provide right level of caution/diligence needed on roofing - big tempting capex element. \n\nPing as/if needed and good luck.

"comment": "Not better, just different.\n\nScientists can make organic polymers or organic compounds that are strongly colored.  When something is colored, that means it is absorbing the incoming light.  Upon absorption of a photon (light) these organic materials (polymers, compounds) produce an electron that, with the help of the rest of the stuff in the device, can move easily to an electrode resulting in usable amounts of electricity.  For more info look at the wikipedia pages for organic photovoltaics or bulk heterojunction.\n\nOPV has a broad application space due to its many unique characteristics.  OPV is thin, light weight, flexible, rollable, can be made in any shape, can conform to any surface, they are durable (not brittle), come in many colors, can be transparent to various degrees, are inexpensive to produce, environmentally friendly, recyclable, can be sewn into things, can be small or enormous in size, have a very low investment payback time, a very low carbon footprint to produce, they have a positive thermal coefficient (the hotter the better, to a point, whereas silicon does better in the cold), and OPV retains its efficiency at lower incident light levels (whereas silicon does not).  I'm probrably missing some stuff.\n\nThe point is, we need both silicon solar panels and OPV, and probrably many other solar technologies to have a complete solution.  For example, putting silicon solar panels on the side of a building is not economically viable, but OPV is perfect for that application space.  You'd never make a solar window out of a silicon panel because silicon is completely opaque, but OPV is semitransparent, making it perfect for certain window applications.  The list goes on and on.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions I can.",

Sunpower does this a lot and you can get great “b” panels that didn’t flash at standard test conditions, but are the same quality, maybe 3-5 Watts off.",

I normally love technological advances but when a random middle class person that might be a future solar owner sees this and thinks \"god solar is expensive, this Tesla solar roof costs so much and everything I read says its cheaper than traditional solar\" they're no longer even considering getting solar and the industry stagnates- all for the sake of market share.",

Still, even so, that's a 20K+ investment and even with the ridiculous electricity rates charged by SDGE, which cost me something like $3-4K/yr (hard to say, I have gas heat but the AC costs a lot but I just put in energy saver windows), it could be an issue.

"comment": "1  This article completely misrepresents what the INES is used for.  Already off to a bad start if that's their first assumption.  \n\nIt is using existing reactor designs which are mostly supposed to come offline in the next 20 years.  This would be ok for current risks, but to scale it out 60 years is totally dishonest.  most reactors being built now have passive safety systems.  The authors have no mention of new reactor designs or a detailed model of what happened at Fukushima.  They are working off \"standard operating\" assumptions rather than identifying the problems of those plants being below code, 1/10000 year tsunami, basement generators, outdated/non functioning conduit filters, insufficient auxiliary heat exchangers, ect. \n\nAll of their data is based off plotting trends along the models they came up with.  They even mention at the bottom that multiple specialists have pointed out flaws in their methods but they insist on keeping their conclusions.  \n\nIt also does some statistical deception for example, counting multiple inconsequential immediately dealt with accidents over long periods of time (a container falling off a fork lift as a reportable accident) \"accumulates\" into a full scale melt down.  This is just pure dishonesty.  \n\nThe answer to meltdown fears will come in the form of building new reactors.  Otherwise more people will die from gas and coal pollution.\n\n2 Its a centrifugal processing system, not a reactor that can get uranium ore into weapons grade materials.  Any country that wants to do this can do this without a nuclear reactor.  There is no causal mechanism between nuclear reactors for energy and nuclear weapons.  Stop assuming I agree with your flawed ideas.\n\n3 Its the default consequence, I used Germany as an example.  You think you will be getting solar and wind but you end up with gas.  You will also need to bulldoze hundreds of thousands of acres of land to make solar farms or wind farms to match the output of one nuclear plant that sits on a few hundred.  Every time you see solar or wind farms, just remember the majority of that name plate is burning carbon.  This is common knowledge in the energy sector.\nEducate yourself.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor\n\nThe waste issue?  I already answered that. If you had your entire life powered by nuclear, the entirety of that spent fuel would fit inside a soda can.  scale that up to entire populations.  If it costs 50 billion for long term storage of all nuclear waste of an entire US, then its totally worth it.  I wouldn't want to waste it though because its fuel for gen 4 reactors.\n\nAnswer my question about the solar/wind waste.  \n\nIf you honestly think transmuting the materials will still be an issue in 100 years, you have no idea what you are talking about in terms of nuclear technology.  No one in the industry sees this as a major problem.  It is safe in the ground but more valuable in gen 4 reactors.  I would much rather take a large warehouse worth of nuclear spent fuel from an entire clean energy grid.  The alternative is dealing with mountains of toxic waste produced by wind and solar from a grid that is still mostly burning carbon in a world suffering from climate change with less wildlife and ecosystems due to the renewistan land footprint.   \n\n\"In other words, the land area dedicated to renewable energy (\"Renewistan\") would occupy a space about the size of Australia to keep the carbon dioxide level at 450 ppm.\"\nhttps://www.wired.com/2009/01/renewistan/\nThis is taken from a much more in depth research book on the subjects.  It basically concludes advanced nuclear is our only option and we need to implement it fast.  \n\nThe nuclear example has already been achieved by 3 nations and others came close on a per capita basis.  Every other scenario is pretty much catastrophe.\n\nYour dose of radiation from all nuclear energy activities averages out at fractions of a percent.  You are bathed in natural radiation from everything else.  \n\n4 No source of energy is \"viable\" without government subsidies.  I explained this already and provided sources.  If you want to complain about government subsidies, look no further than wind or solar, they cost more and give less while keeping the carbon burning.  \n\nIn the US the nuclear industry comes out at a tax after all the regulatory hoops it needs to jump through, yet still remains competitive.  IT comes out to -27 billion after all the compliance measures are paid out.  BTW a huge chunk of those R&amp;D subsidies were dedicated towards navy projects.  Others that were civ got blocked by fossil fuel backed politicians like the IFR in the 90s.  We had working walkaway reactors in the 90s ready to be built and the gov stepped in and shut everything down after spending billions.  \nExhibit 1:\nhttp://www.misi-net.com/publications/EnergyIncentives-0517.pdf\n\nYou have that model backwards, Wind and solar are more expensive with externalities and buffering factored in.  You can cherry pick an article saying solar was \"this cheap!\" at high noon on a sunny day, but at night you are still burning carbon.  Renewables get feed in tariffs too, I already provided the model of Germany's spending on $300 billion + on renewables and how they get more expensive energy, higher emissions and could have carbonized their entire grid by now if they spent that money on nuclear.  \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/07/02/germanys-energy-transition-breaks-the-energiewende-paradox/#5e5593a63c2c\n\n\"Ambitious plans\" don't prevent carbon from getting into the atmosphere.  I already provided links showing how their emissions went up despite spending 300+Billion on renewables and opened up coal plants.    Here is a direct link showing how those \"ambitious plans\" aren't even above a third of their planned track and new coal plants are opening up to compensate for these failures.  Using the \"since 1990\" example is a joke because France already mostly decarbonized by then.  The rest of the industrialized world could have done the same if people like you would stop fighting it.  Thanks for confirming that Germany did open up new coal stations after shutting down nuclear plants, here is an article explaining the hypocrisy of that situation.\nhttp://www.dw.com/en/german-co2-emissions-targets-at-risk/a-18862708\n\nThe NASA article understands fundamental truths about energy systems.  Solar and wind are not reliable and always need carbon fuel backups as the majority of their name plate.  Hydro is already maxed out, geothermal is only safely feasible in shallow heat regions, mostly maxed out.  Nuclear is proven, reliable and safe.  Just 100 more nuclear plants in the U.S and we could have displaced carbon entirely.  If nuclear development was allowed to continue in the US, we could have been off grid carbon by the mid 90s. \n\nMy sources are biased?  \nThat data came from the congressional budget office.  The source was listed right at the bottom of the graph.  \n\nYour \"baseload fallacy\" is popularized by Mark Jacobson who had his models torn apart in the scientific community and now he wants to sue them because he was that humiliated.  He and his entire GCEP department is funded by exxonmobil and other fossil fuel giants.  Its funny how you accuse me of being \"biased\" when NASA and the CBO are my sources and you are parroting Jacobson's work who is backed by fossil fuels trying to sell this dangerous and unrealistic fantasy of 100% renewables.  This false narrative keeps their carbon burning while nuclear (their biggest competitor) gets shut down.\n\nBTW here is the review he is suing for 10 mil over.  \nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722.full\n\nMark's rebuttals demonstrates he doesn't understand or care to acknowledge basic fluid dynamics with the hydro example.  There are plenty of other blatant flaws in his models.  \n\nI have spent many hours going over risk assessments and safety of all energy systems and I agree with the scientific consensus that advanced nuclear is the best way forward.  I support keeping hydro and geo systems in place, but they are location specific.  I don't support building new solar and wind because they keep the carbon burning and are environmentally catastrophic compared to nuclear.  When they are installed they are functionally decorations for carbon plants.  They don't scale and they require way more resources, money and land to operate while producing more waste.  Their EROI's are awful compared to nuclear which also outperforms fossil fuels by that metric.  \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/02/11/eroi-a-tool-to-predict-the-best-energy-mix/#460f5ed4a027",

There are many factors. I'll list a few:  \n\n\nthe amount of travel by airplane  \nhaving a gas-powered car instead of using a bike or mass public transportation  \nnot buying local produce (and pretending ten pounds of imported produce a week is not affecting anything)  \nhaving multiple children instead of no children  \nusing hundreds of plastic diapers on said children  \nbuying new clothes for yourself, contributing to the second largest  pollution emitter on the planet, instead of second hand garments  \nbuying new clothes for the children instead of second-hand garments  \nbuying new technology instead of waiting 7 years to upgrade  \nbuying new cars, appliances, houses, etc  \nliving in a house instead of an apartment complex  \nhaving a giant lawn instead of no lawn  \nhaving a pool  \nusing pesticides in your lawn or community  \nbuying dozens of items on Amazon and having them shipped by freight, truck and car to your house each year  \nhaving multiple pets that consume meat, grain etc instead of no pets  \nbeing a smoker  \nconstantly dining out at fast-casual restaurants and using hundreds of plastic to-go containers each year  \nnot installing solar panels  \nliving in a state or country that requires daily heating of a home for 4 months of the year (such as UK or East Coast US)  \nliving in a state or country with insanely high heat that requires air conditioning 4 months of the year (Arizona, Nevada, etc)  \netc  \n\n\nIf your environmentalist friend is actively doing 30 actions to improve the world while you only are a vegan, then yes, their carbon footprint is probably half of yours. Being a vegan takes one car off the road, that's it. It's not hugely different than the other things listed above. Although all actions we do are better for humankind. Putting people down for not doing every single action just creates derision, depression, and giving up. Celebrate the victories your friend is doing and maybe that friend will teach you to improve as an environmentalist yourself.",

"comment": "Personally, it's been the opposite. \n\nPropane tankless water heater is planned for the house, as well as a gas cooktop and gas oven. The reason is because: \n\na) The solar capacity necessary to supply the water heater, cooktop, and oven would be quite beefy. It'd be real damn pricey, even though those things don't use that much power in the grand scheme of things (in terms of KWh per day). Since we can't sell back to the grid, anything I generate over what I'm using at any given moment either goes into batteries or just... doesn't get generated (technically) so it 'goes to waste'. So upsizing my solar array, batteries, and inverters to account for the 50 Amp draw of a cooktop and oven just doesn't make any sense at all financially.\n\nb) The tankless water heaters are so much more efficient because they don't keep the large volume of water hot all day when I'm not using it, I'll use so little propane for it that the cost will be negligible... plus I can have as long a shower on a cloudy day as I want, without worrying about power usage.\n\nI am considering a small induction cooktop, mostly for redundancy's sake, and because if (when) I have a lot of extra power on some days, cooking a meal on an induction cooktop could save me some propane (I guess, although a pretty small amount). Plus if something goes wrong with the propane system, I still have the other, and vice versa.",

Do they have smart circuitry inside that restarts charging after a disconnect? Why can't I get a charge controller like they use? They're tiny, it can't cost more than a few bucks. But they're not available anywhere.",

You can’t distill your own hydrogen at home so your 100% at the whim of hydrogen suppliers, who are extremely happy to keep producing brown/blue hydrogen. \n\nGiven the head start EVs have (because you can plug them in overnight) the infrastructures already been built so it’s clear in the passenger market evs are the winner, focussing on hydrogen (especially with grants/funding) is just slowing down the transition from ice, which is too slow already.",

I am not sure about Florida’s net metering rules, but there may be some small charge for pullling a kWh from the grid that they would not credit you for when you push a kWh into the grid.\n\nAlso, your return on investment may be a little longer than calculated since there may be downtime from panel failure (unlikely) or from inverter failure (likely if you use a string inverter).\n\nIn the end though, if you get a loan and you are paying monthly similar to your current bill, who wouldn’t want to pay a loan off in 7-8 years (you would have to calculate this of course) and then NOT pay anything for electricity for the remaining life of your system?

Germany has 9x the CO2 footprint as France, since France runs on Nuclear, despite them spending $580 billion. They've barely changed their carbon footprint since 2008, quite the waste of time and resources.[https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/germany-co2-emissions/#:\\~:text=Fossil%20CO2%20emissions%20in%20Germany,CO2%20emissions%20were%20765%2C922%2C900%20tons](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/germany-co2-emissions/#:~:text=Fossil%20CO2%20emissions%20in%20Germany,CO2%20emissions%20were%20765%2C922%2C900%20tons)\n\nHere is a source for Cali, it has decreased roughly by 10% and that 10% is largely attributed to use of Gas (instead of Coal), which is a good part of the reason for Germany's modest decrease too:  \n[https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/are-californias-global-carbon-emissions-declining/](https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/are-californias-global-carbon-emissions-declining/)\n\n[https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/2000\\_2016/ghg\\_inventory\\_trends\\_00-16.pdf](https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/2000_2016/ghg_inventory_trends_00-16.pdf)\n\nThe issue is storage.... and without storage you have to burn fossil fuels or use Hydro for peak load (and there isn't nearly enough hyrdo -- which also comes with its own set of environmental concerns).

There's a little peace of mind around knowing we'll have power through an outage but they also aren't frequent here. I do allow it to discharge to 75% to provide a bit more of my stored solar power during the times when the house is pulling more than the array can provide. Net metering here pays us less for the energy we put back in the grid than what we pay to pull it out so being able to store and reuse excess solar is nice, but it'll never make up for the cost of the Powerwall.",

Or do you think you're going to make a bundle selling it to the utility? Because yeah, if you use this much electricity you will SAVE money. \n\nBut utilities aren't in the business of buying solar power. Most net metering situations require that your installation closely match your usage. So most utilities would frown on some giant solar farm that uses little to no electricity themselves. \n\nNet metering is a gimmick to help people use solar.

Would you let me sign you up for a $30,000 risk to save $15/month maximum on your power bill?  When net metering changes in your area and it will, you are most likely going to pay $0.05 extra for your solar power on at least 20 to 60% of it.  The balance you will save will be $0.02 for the other 40 to 80%.  I  can almost guarantee you will not be saving a cent with solar in ten years.  For you that will not be much of an issue cause you will be in year 18 or 19 of this contract.  Some of these PPAs will be paying 0.02/kWh on 40 tp 80%you will be saving.  They will be losing 8 to 10c per kWh on the 20 to 60%.  Take a look at the proposals of duke energy in SC.  Take a look at what got approved in SC by Dominion.

"comment": "totally agree. one thing that’s good about mandatory solar on new builds and rooftop solar in general is that there is a huge amount of space immediately available for a build-out of an enormous amount of solar capacity with a number of benefits like existing grid interconnections but without all the negatives that come with large solar farms like destruction of habitat and land use. plus, this could benefit from economies of scale, as well as create better financing mechanisms like rolling the cost of panels into a low-interest home mortgage (well, if mortgage rates ever go back to what they were a couple of years ago)\n\nyou’re right in a sense that utilities don’t like small-scale solar too much, but i don’t think it’s because they want to maintain control, since they can easily get ahead of the trend by, for example, setting up and managing local microgrids with neighborhood- or city-scale battery storage that individual homeowners can’t really swing very easily. their problem is that for the last 150 years, the electric grid has been forced into a pattern of very large generating facilities and very-long-distance, very-high-throughput, and *very expensive* transmission networks, which is directly threatened by distributed generation.",

"comment": "That would be an ideal solution as a whole. However getting rid of gas would also require getting a new range and hot water heater (if not part of the heat pump system). \n\nThis would most likely require a main electrical panel upgrade which is also not trivial (or cheap) as we would not be able to handle the additional load. \n\nThen our solar array would be undersized and I will not about to sacrifice my NEM2 status for an upgrade.  \n\nWe opted to get a couple heated blankets for the evenings on the couch and not run the gas heat as much. The blankets do a much better job at keeping us warm. Morni gs might still be cold but it never makes sense to heat the hpuse before leaving for work. \n\nThis should get us by with minimal usage of the furnace. We'll see. So far it hasn't been too cold this year.",

"comment": "Absolutely builders take advantage of it when people buy \"because they just want it\". That leads to all kinds of ways that builders cut costs that are not in the home owners best interest but that are legal. \n\nPeople who buy \"because they want it\" are fundementally not being smart buyers of what is likely to be about the most expensive thing they every buy. Ultimately the government can't fully protect people from doing that. Ultimately there is always some amount of personal reliability that comes into play with something like this. This is why I can't imagine ever buying a spec (mass built) new home. \n\nI am all for California making these rules clearer and stricter, but I don't think it's a failure of state government that they haven't. While they are at it, I would be in favor of banning HOAs.\n\nOne other thing to keep it mind is that every time we mandate what may be good for the longer term, another group of people complain that everything is so expensive. New houses would be a lot cheaper if they didn't need to have solar panels, insulation, or earthquake/structural safety. That's all really important stuff, so I don't mean to suggest it shouldn't be required, but you can't require everything either... At some point you need to decide that the requirement is good enough (not saying it is currently) because there will always be a better way to do things out there.",

"comment": ">So on the surface, at least, this is a technical dispute over battery safety and workforce training requirements. But just below the surface lurks a long-simmering conflict between the rooftop solar industry and organized labor.\n>\nIf that sounds familiar, well, you probably read my latest story (which I still hope you’ll subscribe to The Times to access, if you haven’t already), or last week’s edition of Boiling Point. In both pieces, I noted that most rooftop solar jobs are nonunion, unlike most jobs building large-scale solar farms. It’s a reality that has created constant tension in California, with politically powerful electrical and building trades unions pushing lawmakers to support big solar farms at the expense of rooftop installations.\n>\nThe ongoing dispute over contracting standards is a revealing example of that tension.\n>\n>The idea of barring most rooftop solar companies from installing batteries — unless they also obtain an electrical contractor’s license, which requires employees performing electrical work to be certified electricians — was first proposed by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the National Electrical Contractors Assn., whose member companies hire IBEW workers.\n>\n“We can’t comply with this. People will go out of business,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Assn. “Prices will go up, and we’ll lose the ability to meet customer demand for clean energy.”\n>\nThe CSLB’s 11-3 vote reversed the board’s earlier judgment that firms with C-46 solar contractor’s licenses could install batteries paired with solar panels. Del Chiaro said the about-face is especially damaging because homes and businesses that want solar increasingly want energy storage, too, to protect against wildfire-driven power outages and the threat of rolling blackouts.\n>\nWhen I called up folks on the other side of the debate to ask about all this, I got an entirely different version of events.\n>\nEddie Bernacchi, a lobbyist for the National Electrical Contractors Assn., told me this is “a dispute between electrical contractors and solar contractors over jurisdiction,” not a union vs. nonunion issue. Requiring solar-plus-storage projects to be installed by contractors with certified electricians, he said, would not only improve safety, it would lead to higher wages in the solar industry.\n>\n“The electrical contractors offer a path to higher wages and a real career,” Bernacchi said.\n>\nTom Enslow, an attorney representing the contractors association and IBEW, made a similar case. He said that while the new rule would allow union shops to better compete in the solar market, CSLB’s decision was “more about safety and precedent.”\n>\n“What’s happened is that the solar industry started pushing a theory that, hey, as long as we install an energy storage system at the same time, we should be allowed to do that work,” Enslow said. “It’s pretty clear they are separate systems.”\n>\nThose arguments seemingly convinced the state board. Nancy Springer, the chief building official for Sacramento County, said she and her fellow board members “have to be aware of protecting the consumers and making sure that they’re installed properly, and that people have the proper training.” Board member Johnny Simpson, who previously led an IBEW local and was appointed by the Senate Rules Committee, responded to calls for more debate by saying, “It’s time to put this issue to bed.”\n>\nI also spoke with Carol Zabin, who leads the UC Berkeley Labor Center’s Green Economy Program and co-authored a report that helped prompt CSLB’s decision. She said she and her team — which included a chemical safety expert — found little difference between the cost of a solar system installed by a firm using certified electricians and a firm not using certified electricians.\n>\n“It’s about whether you want a certified workforce or not,” Zabin said. “They have no certifications in that industry.”\n>\nSuffice to say the solar industry pushed back against those claims, hard.\n>\nBarry Cinnamon, CEO of Bay Area solar and battery installer Cinnamon Energy Systems, said the idea that companies like his don’t train their workers to handle energy storage systems is absurd. The companies that manufacture lithium-ion batteries — such as Enphase, LG and Tesla — also require workers who install their products to sit for several hours of training, Cinnamon said.\n>\n“You have to be trained, or they won’t sell you the battery,” he said.\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-11-11/why-are-are-unions-clashing-with-solar-industry-on-clean-energy-batteries-boiling-point",

In 5 years everyone who can afford solar will be able to afford pretty beefy batteries and just be able to charge them off own solar and so be \"1:1\" by means of their own batteries. and also be able to arbitrage of their own usage (charge on super-off peak, discharge later)\n\nbut NEM3 is a crime, and is 100% made ot punish people who dare not be dependent on california's investor owned utilities as much as those crooks want them to be.",

I feel like I have too much going on right now - I know that's certainly no choice regarding morality, but I currently live in a household where veganism is recognised as Hindu and therefore punished.\n\nSo I think before I consider experimenting with veganism, I'll work towards getting my own freedom. Then, I can do as I please.\n\nI've gone through my situation before so I'll summarise it, if you're confused: I'm still in education, 17, my father is a Muslim and an Imaam from Pakistan and apostates like me are killed if they come out with it.",

Working full time with an animal rights organisation, I do not focus on vivisection issues. It is not that I don't give \"a shit\" about them it is that it is not something I have campaigned on, in a professional capacity or as one of the numerous volunteer projects I run. \n\nThe phrase could also refer to the extent I have analysed the subject. I'll admit that I have never considered the animal testing supply chain beyond the airline industry (which is the reason why I found the posted article so interesting). Again, it is not that I don't care, just that it is not a subject I have thoroughly studied.\n\nFrom one sentence you have claimed I am not a good vegan, you have also assumed that diet or issues with farm animals is my primary motivation in animal rights. Both of which I would not say about myself.\n\nYou have judged and belittled me, and made me feel unwelcome in this subreddit, without even knowing me or the work I do for animals.",

Without the chicken, egg, cheese and the bacon dressing.\" (Typical waiter response to someone claiming to be Vegan.. the salad!)\n\nThen you're left with an entire plate of lettuce leaves and a few pieces of tomato. And the rest of your group looking at your meal and reassuring themselves that Vegan food is crap.\n\nThe purpose of my message is to push all restaurants into actually providing a decent edit: and creative! Veg/Vegan option, which really isn't that hard for restaurants to do. If we have enough people leaving these cards eventually I think it will stick.",

I dunno, you're kind of wearing me out with all that text.  But I think you may be trying to blur the distinction between feeding a cat some meat, and feeding a cat no meat.  Does not compute.

Since then they have changed management. So yes, in the beginning they WERE, and they have gotten successful based on that, with new management they started flirting more with the allergec people and decided that poor, delicate omni's may feel left out if they didn't post a bunch of meat recipies all over the place, conveniently forgetting that their products were created by vegans, for vegans and vegans are their core market. So they would rather promote animal products and alienate the people who made them than make poor people who eat meat but not regular cheese feel left out.",

"comment": "&gt; can you tell me why you aren't?\n\nIt has to do with me experience with organic farming and my quest for knowledge, I actually got interested where my food came from and from my days of veganism to now I will admit I despise the *city vegans*, which are 99% of them.\n\nMan, I remember, *The China Study* was my bible, people with heart disease in my opinion *had it coming* for consuming animal products and I thought my choice was the best thing for my health, the enviroment and the future of humanity. Smug. Little. Shit.\n\nI was wrong in every single instance, I was so wrong I look back in disbelief, I see myself in every single vegan I encounter here on reddit, I see a more ignorant self who can only be described as a naive teenager.\n\nThe first thing I came to realize is that modern agriculture is the single greatest disaster the world has ever seen, Norman Borlaug and Fritz Haber have done more damage to this earth than anything else in the past 70,000 years, the green revolution was a mistake.\n\nWe are pumping fossil fiels into our food, then we transport and package said food with more fossil fuels, the whole process uses so much energy and creates so much greenhouse gas I came into another realization: The world could go vegan and 200 species would still continue to be driven into extinction every. single. day.\n\nIs was with that realization that I understood that going vegan by itself would not save anybody from anything.\n\nSo I got myself to try, I said to myself, *you can prove that wrong, I can be vegan and be green!*, I failed miserably, green manure is almost worthless, I create a pathetic version of a maize plant... So I had to do it the right way.\n\nThe mission: Start by growing a 1 year supply of maize with cow manure.\n\nI understood then that this animals were necessary for me to survive, their shit was gold, so I collected 1 m3 of cow manure and composted it with some hay, 2 weeks later, the manure was ready, I was happy, no animals died and I had enough compost for the maize.\n\nI planted the maize and the ranch's cowboy did the rest of the work so he could get part of my maize harvest. It would take around 4 months until harvest time so I came back time to time just to see it grow, and in one of those day I came into another realization, a cow was terribly sick because of a virus that it got from bats, it had to be put down, I realized, not only were that cow necessary for the maize, but as a vegan, it's natural death would serve no purpose, I could not eat a single bite of that cow, between my almost-religious veganism and the stupid-ass idea that saturated fat is bad for human consumption, I remained vegan.\n\n2 months later, another realization, I accidentally found a deer that had starved to death, because of the drug war (mexico), hunters no longer came this season and without predators, the deer population exploded, there where so many deer tons of them just starved to death and some others got sick and just wandered around until they dropped, it was horrible, I quickly saw what happened to prey when not predated, which was the following and most powerfull revelation to me, hunting was necessary and it was not only necessary, but humane, a deer population kept in check is a much better alternative to the disgusting mess that results from lack a predation, and what better predator than a 30-06? Nature will never provide such a quick and clean death than the human hunter, this realization, slowly but surely, started breaking down my view on veganism.\n\nThe final blow to my veganism: 2 week before harvest the rancher told me the neighbors maize (over 4 tons) was completely destroyed by badgers in just 1 night. It was war against the badgers, the following night, with flashlights and bait, the cowboy shot 13 badgers with an air rifle.\n\nI was done with veganism! 13 animals died in my quest for vegan self-reliance, if those 13 animals would have been cows, I would have enough meat for years!\n\nAfter that I remember how wrong I was, I felt like a pathetic idiot who derserved a slap, veganism became truly naive in my eyes and I developed resentment agains vegans, all vegans deserve to experience what I did, and we'll which ones are smart enough to change their mind.\n\nThe corn I harvested then was sold because of my realization, but it keeps me thinking, I'm sure there some vegan out there that ate some of it, maize that took 13 animal lives to create and now that some smug vegan proudly munches one, truly disgusting!\n\nI then found something beatiful and that truly has potential to save mankind, permaculture or in other words organic polyculture, aquaculture and sustainable developement.\n\nI was not vegan not even a single part of it, permaculture design needs animals to function.\n\nI came into the realization that semi-vegetarianism was the only acceptable form of vegetarianism, chickens produce a super-food almost every single day and cows too, animal products are extremely superior in almost every regard to plants and grains.\n\nThere is literally no reason why I would ever go back to veganism, I find it naive and most of the time just repugnantly ignorant.\n\nVeganism is a fad, that's my final realization, good night.",

If I eat something that a family member offers me, that I know is not vegan, then this is not okay. Because it not only shows them that I am not fully commited to what I preach, but it's also self defeating because I am going against my own morals in order to not upset someone.\n\nEdut: fixed wording",

"comment": "Completely agree that  BLM should not be forced to include veganism. This is related to why I’m not pro-intersectionalism with animal rights (veganism) regarding the inclusion of human animals into veganism, at least not the way that I’ve seen it in practice. While it is good to have some intersectional considerations in BLM (women, disabilities, LGBT), to go off and start talking about LGBT rights is an utter distraction that brings the focus away from black lives. With animal rights, shifting the attention to human animals not only takes up space that was created to rescue non-human animals from humans but detracts from the unique reasons that non-human animals need help with which humans have nothing in common:  being eaten and being used for fashionable clothing. We do have a tenuous shared struggle with unjust experimentation and entertainment, but again, most cases are radically different. Humans and animals do share some other forms of exploitation like forced labor, but again, human issues take up less of the *very* limited space that veganism takes up takes up in public and online discourse. \n\nAnimals cannot create websites or spread awareness of their abuse to others like humans can, so the only advocacy for animal rights occurs during the time that humans are speaking or doing other activism on their behalf. Since humans are not only able to share their stories of oppression and even speak up in public discourse for themselves (not mention participate in advocacy), it seems just to allow discussions of animal rights to focus on those who don’t have the ability to speak for themselves and experiences horror on a massive scale. It may be worth it to incorporate discussions of humans if it serves to protect animals from the various forms of exploration they face. And yes, it’s completely fair to mention human issues as an aside without out detracting from the issues that non-human animals face, for example mentioning the abysmal conditions for slaughterhouse workers and pressure for migrant workers to work there.",

"comment": "Ok I don't want to take the wind out of our sails but I do want to give you some information. \n\nOut fast food restaurants have all increased their prices drastically and lowered quality. Pretty recently! Taco Bell was my go-to not long ago and it's getting bad. Employees give zero shits and the cost of doing business has skyrocketed (I'm in the industry just not fast food) and Carl's Jr discontinued their Beyond Famous Star. \n\nIf you don't eat meat, fast food is less an attraction and more a necessity when you can't get anything else. \n\nThat being said if you go to Taco Bell the Black Bean Chalupa is pretty bomb and you tell them \"Fresco Style\" they'll make it vegan with some diced tomatoes. \n\nWe have so many great all-vegan restaurants!  I think Utah is slightly less vegan friendly but if you stay near the national parks or SLC and use HappyCow you should be good!",

If you are looking for more “cleaner” “whole foodsie” kind of proteins that still have that satiating flavor and bite here is my list:\n\n\n* Soy curls: Cooks like chicken or beef strips. Seasoned well these are so good. I just received a 12 lb box of them. \n\n* Tempeh: Marinate and season well. Cooks like chicken or beef strips. Crumble it into a chili, get creative. \n\n* Seitan: My favorite is Field Roast, they do it right. Great bite and flavor - only contain ingredients that you can understand.  \n\n* Homemade bean burgers: Make them with a bit of flour or vital wheat gluten to make them hold together better and have a better bite.\n\nEdit: how could I forgot **tofu**. Buy firm tofu and cut into small chunks and marinate. Coat with a little bit of oil and corn starch and bake, or preferably, air fry.",
