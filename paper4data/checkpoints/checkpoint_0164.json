For instance, you can look at horsepower, but when you get down to it, you really want to look at horsepower per pound.  That will give you a much better answer as to what car has more pickup.  Battery pack should also be read with context.  How much is usable space in that battery pack and what is reserve?  How quickly will the car allow that to charge and how many miles are you getting per KWH?\n\nWhile stats are great to look at on cars, especially EVs, remember there's much more than just those numbers.",

"comment": "&gt; The S60 actually pulls a max of 90-100kW\n\nRight, exactly my point. SAE Combo can support up to 100 kW, so with anything smaller than a 60kWh pack, SAE combo won't be the limiting factor on a car this size.  If they ultimately come out with a Caddy with a bigger pack, then yes the charger would be the limiting factor.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not arguing that Tesla's standard isn't better (it clearly is), but rather that on packs below 60kWh, SAE Combo can charge just as fast and doesn't put the Bolt at a disadvantage.",

Specifically meaning that they made it very clear that the far more profitable 85kwh cars would get production priority, then some time after that the 60 kWH, and then at some undetermined time they'd get around to the 40s. Then, magically, they discontinued the lowest margin offering due to \"low demand\". It's not like it cost them anything extra to keep making them. With the number of people around here clamoring for a reasonably priced Tesla ($50k if fairly attainable), how could offering that be a bad thing?\n\nIf Musk offers a $35k model 3, delivers a handful and then discontinues it, would you still say he met his goal of providing a $35,000 car?",

Once cars reach a certain threshold - probably about 200 miles - of range, and there is adequate fast-charging infrastructure, most drivers won't care too much about the \"time\" it takes to fuel, because they'll fuel when they sleep or visit the mall or go to the grocery store.  For those few times a year when they drive over the single-charge range of their vehicle, there will be fast-chargers along the interstates at convenient locations with coffee shops or restaurants to pass the time, much like truck stops exist now.  For those few times a year, I'm sure most EV drivers won't be inconvenienced to add an hour or two to their six hour drive, especially since the rest of the year they're saving lots of money not buying gasoline.",

(Full electric cars may have slightly less maintenance in terms of things like oil changes {a minimal cost} -- but they have a far higher cost when that battery dies {which again, it eventually WILL} and that really needs to be amortized).\n\nErgo with any of these \"used\" vehicles, well if they have 60,000 to 80,000+ miles on them (a high, but not unusual amount for a 3 to 4 year old model), then the **potential buyers are entirely correct** in wanting a risk-adjusted even LOWER price tag (versus say a normal ICE model) to compensate.",

"comment": "So, 84% of the fine particulates generated by automobiles come from parts of the car such as tires, brakes, and other parts. Only a sixth or so comes from the exhaust, and therefore we should not ban internal combustion engine cars just based on the particulates coming out of the tailpipe.  I'm good with that logic. I don't want to ban gas or diesel burning cars and trucks at all. \n\nI want fast, quiet, smooth running cars with instant torque and cheap operation. There are a lot of ways to achieve this, and it turns out that the electric drivetrain is one of those ways. Of course, I also have a motorcycle with an engine bigger than in a few full sized cars, with all the rumble and heat and shaking that I don't want in a small commuter car.  I have more than one tool in my toolbox.",

Consider that the one step of refining gasoline uses something like 12% of the total energy in the crude (there have been exaggerated numbers which ignore other usable products); it cuts both ways. \n\n* Applying lifecycle emergy to solar has had some really, really bad math done. People using 1998 numbers for solar cells, people including the \"energy value of money\" (I once [calculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/4l6xac/eroi_energy_invested_in_the_labor_of_ceos/) that a CEO, apparently, is a 4 MW thermal power source), all kinds of bad math. \n\n* \"adding more storage per unit of renewable energy generating capacity by definition requires more lifetime energy expenditure (or emergy) per that unit of generation. We should at least be accounting for it and keeping the tally visible so we are rightfully setting the appropriate goals.\" This is fair and reasonable, but there's a lot of unknowns involved in that; the lifetime of a Li-Ion battery is HIGHLY variable depending on who makes it and how it's used.",

Also, his solar chip will be revolutionary to the residential solar industry. \n\nAnd, I think fossil fuels will actually be very beneficial Long term. Just look at Titan. If we could use the methane and ethane for rocket ships and stop there to fuel up and get fuel, that would be extremely great. It’s all very possibly. So, one day, everyone will love fossils fuels for that.",

The overall weight of the vehicle has a tremendous impact on the vehicles energy consumption.\n\nAlso, I would look at your PHEV's use case. The PHEVs are mainly designed to be hybrids, that you can drive on the congested city with no additional taxes. So ideally 50-70 km commute with around 20-40 km in the city. I believe, that the PHEVs will not change in the future that much range wise, and more emphasis is put to make the BEV's range larger (but this is all just assumptions).\n\nI think, in your described use case, you'll need to stick to petrol/diesel cars for some more time or pay the price for a long range BEV.",

Some fueling station locations are a great fit for EV charging but some others are the worst. A large travel stop on a highway makes sense but small neighborhood gas stations may be an endangered species, especially if they're in neighborhoods where most of their customers have garages. And over time as more workplaces have L2 charging and more options for apartment dwellers to charge at home get built out that neighborhood fueling station starts to lose almost all relevance.",

"comment": "Because it’s not clear at this point that batteries will be the right solution for your use case. With current battery and charging tech, and the incentives in various markets, it makes more sense/is less risky to target the smaller end vehicles that either do city routes or serve the shorter end of long haul routes. \n\nYou’d need really huge batteries to haul heavier loads and larger still to cover the distances you do in Australia. Given Australia isn’t incentivising manufacturers or buyers to switch to EVs, and global battery manufacturing still growing to meet demand, it’s much smarter for manufacturers to allocate what little supply of batteries they can secure, to meet emissions targets in markets like Europe and China. \n\nIn terms of improving air quality, I also think this is the right approach. Let’s start cleaning up the air in our cities first, where the most people live and are affected by respiratory illnesses due to pollution. Highways don’t have a lot of people and also is the scenario where IC engines are least polluting because of the constant speed.",

"comment": "This has always, always been the plan. Tesla has always produced as many vehicles as they can and matched the price to the market, even when they sold them at a loss. They're still at industry leading margins despite competitors losing their shirts on every vehicle.\n\nThe $35k Model 3 didn't exist because people bought it at $55k. The Model Y production was tripled because people bought 3x more than they expected.\n\nImportant to note this is the seasonally weak quarter, high interest rate and impending recession environment, and before where the IRA credits were known to fall.\n\nThey haven't updated the Model 3 for years (but are presently) and haven't even sold the most compelling spec for a year. They haven't entered the truck, semi truck, van, or compact space yet.\n\nThey're going to do more than 2 M units next year, before their dedicated 2 M factory is even done construction.\n\nBYD, VW, and Hyundai are all doing great, but the rest are worrisome. Ford is losing a mountain of money on an actual volume BEV (something like a -40% margin) that is now more expensive. GM cannot build and scale a BEV or do it profitably. Toyota is fooling around with some weird engine and hydrogen.",

"comment": ">So I'm not sure why folks are so confused/surprised that the Ramcharger would have a fairly large V6 rather than a turbocharged inline 4\n\nBecause no one is making that assertion.  We're asserting that an Atkinson 4-banger is the appropriate solution here.\n\nOP's entire post is dependent on this false assertion: \"That big V6 can produce the required power at low RPM but needs to work hard. That's very efficient. Smaller engine would need to run very fast which decreases efficiency.\"\n\nThat assertion is dependent on the assumption that 130 kW is required.  The assertion fails if 130 kW is not required - which it is NOT.\n\nEven if you are towing up the infamous Ike Gauntlet,  that's 21 kWh for an F150L with 10k pound load, so with 14k, let's say 30 kWh.\n\nIn addition, we know from the cross-country Rivian boat tow someone did a year or two ago that the average power requirement when towing 11k pounds is only about 57 kW.\n\nYou do NOT need double the power to go up to 14k pounds.\n\nSo as long as it is lit off early enough (and it's not hard these days for a vehicle to automatically figure out that it's towing a load and change settings appropriately), a 60 kW REX can meet all of the needs of this vehicle, even going up the Ike Gauntlet which is one of the most notorious towing torture tests on the continent.\n\nThe argument people are making against the huge V6 is not that a smaller engine is better suited to deliver 130 kW - it is that 130 kW is oversized to the point of carrying a massive efficiency penalty.  A 130 kW generator is guaranteed to overcharge the battery significantly under ANY scenario unless it is:\n\n* Throttled to less than 130 kW which will have a significant negative effect on efficiency due to pumping losses\n* Cycling at very low duty cycle and hence paying cold-engine penalties on a regular basis.",

You can buy a Tesla and still feel that you are making a choice that is at worst ethically neutral. It's not like buying bedding from the pillow guy for example.",

"comment": "Yeah no shit, I couldn’t believe it. First shop was an ebike specialist shop in Sacramento. I requested a new stem, due to Klima rear tire deflating, they just reused the same failing valve and used pliers on it to pull it through, then aired up the tire which depressurized as soon as I got home 1 week and $50 later. They did the same to my friends Kaboo Wolf Warrior GT. Both scooters were flat by the time we tried to go out mobbing that weekend.\n\nBut what was worse - The other shop in town (where I bought the Burn-E) has gone on to specialize in e-bikes and seems like they can’t give two fucks about a scooter problem. They won’t even schedule an appointment or respond to texts unless you’re a brand new customer buying a SurRon.\n\nThey sold me a valve stem that they said would fit, but it was completely incorrect for the\nKlima. They charged like $16 for it too.\n\nMost Bicycle shops usually won’t even touch scooter tires if you need help, neither do auto shops for that matter.\n\nThe closest and best scooter shop to my location is Fluid Free Ride in SF and they’ve been great for helping with the bigger problems, but it’s hard to find time to go there within their hours of operation, as they’re closed on the weekend. I only have good things to say about FFR. Especially if you buy a scooter from them they will work on it for you and support you.\n\nSo DIY is where I ended up after a bunch of back and forth with the shops here in town.",

"comment": "Just some thoughts. \n\n1. Net-metering rules typically only apply to 1/2% - 2% market saturation at peak.  It makes sense for a utility to try and ramrod enough solar to market to hit that bar and negate future net-metered arrays. It's depressing, but we're seeing it happen in Mississippi (whom recently hatched a 5 year old net-metering proposal in exchange for announcing \"not net-metering\" and 100MW of utility-scale projects). A federal net-metering policy is needed, but opens a huge can of worms that the DoE doesn't want to touch. The DoE likes being a carrot, not a stick.\n\n2. Is a policy that encourages utility-scale solar really a bad thing? Wouldn't rapid, short-term adoption of solar be a better environmental policy than an optimal policy which encourages more sustainable and less subsidized growth? Additionally, in the long-term, shouldn't the solar consumer benefit from bad utility policy, indirectly through electric rate increases? \n\n3. In a hurricane-prone state like Florida, back-up emergency power is at a premium. With price decreases in batteries on the horizon, might this cause Florida to be a front-runner in massive grid defection? \n\n4. If solar owners start defecting from the grid, even with the grid is already connected up to their property, would that be a good indicator for questioning the sanity of our public utility commissions (whose policies have thereby failed to embrace the private investment opportunity of rooftop solar, ultimately providing a disservice to the general public)? Might glaringly poor energy policy result in a nationalization of the electric grid?",

They come as small chips, and you use either mirrors or lenses to concentrate the sun hundreds of times and focus it on the chip. This requires a very good solar tracking set-up, and is really probably not sensible for residential use - in general, residential applications will use flat-panel whereas concentrated systems are more suited for utility-scale.\n\nSo yeah, SunPower cells are your best best for high-efficiency residential panels.",

"comment": "Personally, I hope the ITC tax credit drops to 10%, because I'm a survivor. Here are some silver linings to a reduction in the ITC for your care, comfort, and consideration:\n\n1) True solar distruption is stimied by the 30% ITC. The 30% ITC pushes more tax dollars into utility-scale + corporate owned solar arrays. Utility-scale solar is a majority of installed solar capacity in the USA. It was less than 10% of the USA market pre-tax credit. Residential solar financing has languished, when it could otherwise be creating a sustainable, unsubsidized solar market. Solar power is something that could power 100% of the USA, but we'll only get their through demand from the consumer market. A less subsidized solar market is one that is even harder for the utilitieis to stop. \n\n2) The 30% ITC argues against cap-and-trade. Our current policy of penalty-free, unlimited, \"safe emissions\" dumping creates an uneven playing field between for emissionless vs. emissions-heavy technologies; excessive subsidies counter-balance the playing field. Whereas a 10% ITC is on par with what other large energy projects get (such as multi-billion dollar oil refinery expansion projects). Leveling out the ITC will re-emphasize the uneven playing field that exists due to lack of carbon regulation.\n\n3) The ITC != the Residential Energy and Efficiency Tax Credit. While it is unlikely, the ITC could be reduced while the REETC remains at 30%. This would be a very smart policy which the tax payer could support. Residential projects are more valuable to the tax payer, because they increase property value, create more jobs, and invite more local investment than commercial projects. Essentially, we get more collective bang for our buck.\n\nResidential systems are removed from the above-market value tax manipulation schemes that are risked with large-scale solar and solar leasing. Depreciation is not claimed. The tax credits cannot be off-loaded via inverted lease structures. SolarCity claims the ITC; a residential solar lease is still owned by a corporate structure. Plus, residential systems are less likely to participate in cap-and-trade infrastructure. So keeping the REETC &gt; ITC could be viewed as balancing the residential vs. corporate ownership structures.\n\n4) Selfishly, solar experts who specialize in reducing project costs will do better financially in a less competitive market. Sure, the solar market will contract when the ITC steps down. But poor business models + amateurs will be shaken out. Business practices will get closer to mainstream design/construction.",

A small grid tied system, lets say 2kw, will cost more to have connected than to take off the roof, let alone make sense to build.\n\nWith a $38 per month interconnection service charge and $.028 per kwh fed into the grid it will be really hard to make residential solar pencil out.  I know in winter with the snow and less sun it will be really hard to save money on a residential array.\n\nI always mention this in my comments, but I feel the biggest slap in the face is the PUC's decision to change the rates of NEM1 customers to this new rate class.  This means that people (me included) are out thousands of dollars for our solar arrays.  A black eye for the entire solar industry.\n\nLink to the new rates\nhttp://pucweb1.state.nv.us/PDF/AxImages/DOCKETS_2015_THRU_PRESENT/2015-7/8544.pdf",

Community solar typically requires an anchor tenant, larger offtakers that are willing to purchase a good portion of the energy in order to reduce the risk associated with numerous residential offtakers. I haven't personally dealt with the logistics of community solar but I have heard that the billing cycles, as well as customer turnover can be a headache. Typical PPA length is only about 5 years for community solar participants, compared to 20-25 for a typical PPA. \n\nI think there is a market for software to manage community solar assets, I'd be interested in VeritasAbAequitas product.",

In particular, the Design Your Solar Roof program takes a close look at solar design software, which I think its particularly useful in today's industry.",

"comment": "&gt; Elon musk learned about the threat of climate change and decided to do something about it. His solution was bringing forward the electric car and solar panels. At this moment, Tesla is the best hope humanity has to prevent catastrophic climate change. If they fail, independent households who have panels/batteries will be in a better position to survive.\n\nIsn't it fucking pathetic to put our hopes for humanity on a single private corporation?",

"comment": "First, up to 2 acres for a solar farm is on the small side. So a couple of first reaction thoughts:\n\n* I would reach out to Canadian Solar (panel manufacturer) and ask them about ideas, partners, and the like. The opportunity to sell around 100 kW of panel capacity would probably motivate them to get you connected to a Canadian Solar friendly channel.\n\n* Is there much community solar activity in Canada? Many smaller projects in the U.S. are around the size (acreage) you mention.\n\n* Which makes me wonder how remote you are. Is there enough local grid demand to make the build and interconnection expense worthwhile? The 100 acre site is on the scale of a utility project, and was probably located to make the interconnection costs work.",

"comment": "Solar is great and all but without battery storage (or some kind of storage) it won't work. Check out the duck curve (seriously that's what it's called). Current solutions are still underwhelming. Cali is already having issues with it, and in AZ, my state, it causes the power companies to need to produced a lot of power quickly when demand peaks (in the morning before solar starts producing, and in the afternoon as solar begins to stop). There are work arounds on a small scale (Tesla power banks, which are 16 power walls in a box, each power wall containing around 3k 3.7v batteries IIRC, which are modeled off phone batteries), but not quite what can cover power demand at night. There's some cool research that can help bend the duck curve down, but until we get storage options...\n\nAlso, if you mean building one giant plant (which I don't believe you did), then there's transmission loses to account for as well.\n\nEdit: added the bit about turbines",

"comment": "Off the grid could still include solar, and even those solar roofs for cars that people complain aren't efficient (only adding ~10-15 miles per day) still would eventually charge a car enough to get outta there if you're not in full shade or terrible weather. But really, most people in the USA at least can find electricity within some reasonable distance from VERY remote feeling places. If you can drive somewhere, you can find surely electricity within 50-miles. If your EV has a some reasonable range, you're fine for that. Just charge up before you drive \"off grid\".\n\nPS - I own an old air cooled Westfalia van, and am very excited about the potential to take it camping some day as an EV, even if it's some sort of plugin hybrid in the future. I can appreciate what you're asking for here :)",

"comment": "The real downside to going with a large company like Tesla/Vivint is that their install quality varies dramatically and customer service post-install is generally much poorer, since their focus is on new customer acquisition, not taking care of existing customers. This is borne out in the data - go look up SolarCity/Vivint/etc. reviews on BBB, Google, etc. They also treat their workers poorly, paying less, make them work longer hours, force them to install faster, use high-pressure sales tactics, etc. There's a reason installer and sales rep turnover is so high in these large companies.\n\nIf you look at the reviews, successful local solar companies have higher ratings than the big names because their entire business model depends on word of mouth/reputation/quality. They also tend to be more flexible and transparent in the sales process.\n\nI've worked for both a Top 3 corporate residential solar installer and a smaller, local company, and I would never consider getting an install done from Vivint/Tesla. I'd go with my company or one of our local competitors a thousand times before recommending a big brand, based on my experience. Also, going local is cheaper.",

Unless there is a foreseeable point when the panels stop producing electricity, simple integration of the power output over infinite time would produce infinite energy, which is infinite money. You need to use a cut off to reason about it.\n\nThe same goes for putting money into a bank account. Until you take the money out, it grows indefinitely, although too slowly to be worthwhile.\n\nAnyway, the solar installer claimed that I would get more than twice what I put into it from savings over 30 years. I don’t actually believe that give inflation, but c’est la vie.",

"comment": "When you are planing to build PV plant , you must consider the placement of the Plant. Because it is not the same if you have a PV plant in Norway or in Greece, because of the solar hours.  You need more solar hours to produce more energy. You can go to PVGis an online website to simulate for yourself these differences.   \nThe next thing to consider are the PV-panels, they are many types like: Monocrystalline , Polycrystalline , Thin film solar panels  and many other. The type that you will use is up to you. The difference between mono and thin film is that the mono has  a more efficency  coefficient  about 18% butt it cost more material and energy to produce a mono panel than a thin film panel. The thin film panel cost lest but it is less efficent . To make it easy you need more thin film panel than the mono panel to achive the same power output. Because of that about 80% of todays used panels are Mono and Poly.  \nThe next thing to chose is a Solar inverter. For a PV plant you can use a Sting inverter or a Central inverter. The difference is that the String inverter is used up to 100kW i the other hand the Central inverter is comonly used in big PV plants.   \nI have left many thing unwriten like:solar iradiaton, climate, the effect of temperature. The many variants of the Panel to Inverter connections(Series, paralel, mixed )   \nIf you want, send me your Email and a i will send you some literature that you can study.  \nSorry for bad english",

"comment": "I'm a credentialed actuary by day with a small, but growing, solar installation company.  We understand the financial math quite well and if you are a customer of the largest utility in our area (that has an additional incentive beyond net metering), then getting solar is usually a no brainer from a financial perspective.  We started doing some sub-contracting for another company and found out what they were charging the customers (in some cases over $4/W)...it'd take some pretty aggressive assumptions about rising energy costs to make those systems have a payoff period less than 15 years for a cash purchase.  Once we wrap up our obligations with that company we aren't going to be doing anymore installs for them.  It sucks that there are companies taking advantage of people.",

Maybe as large as a 20kw system with a couple of powerwalls or something similar whatever is available in 2023 time frame. Wanting to be able to offset my entire house use and charge a couple of electric vehicles.\n\nMy question is this, with panels prices as low as they are right now, and on top of that the 30% tax credit that will probably be gone completely by 2023 does it make any sense to buy all the panels now while they are cheap and so I can get the tax credit.\n\nAlso I live in Kansas. My zip gets about 4.87 hours per day average sunlight.\n\nThanks,\n\nKevin C.",

"comment": "Thanks for the detailed reply, u/Rocksteady2R. I'll try to address a few things.\n\nFirstly, it wasn't just the installer lopping 12k off the top.   It had been a month or 2 since the quote and now that we're closer to actually needing a panel I wanted to clarify some things with him.  I called firstly asking if the job had to be STARTED in 2019 to get the 30% tax credit or gad to be completed. He noted most people interpret as completed and on grid which obviously wouldn't hapoen for us but he did state the company would absorb the 4% loss to us (26% likely next yr vs. 30%) bc frankly they are behind and obviously also competing for our business.\n\nSecondly he stated SunPower currently is doing a rebate for their 327 panels of just over 1k.\n\nThe other ~4k would come as a 7% discount for an all cash trandaction (which we can and would be willing to do to save the 4k)\n\nAlso, we unfortunately (but really fortunately, I know) will have a tax burden out of which we'll be able to take full advantage of credits.\n\nI do like the look of black on black better bit have read these panels heat up more (my understanding is the white dots purpose is to dissipate heat) and hot panela don't actually perform as well? Is that a big deal? Our roof we will intentionally be doing darker to help mask the panels...I will post a picture of the proposed panel placement",

They will even cover the labor cost of taking a broken panel off your roof, shipping it to the manufacturer for warranty replacement, and putting the new one back on.\n\nMany other companies, and especially do-it-yourself, the warranty covers the panel replacement but not the labor or shipping.  Also, many/most solar companies only offer a 10-year warranty on roof leaks from the solar installation, which yeah if they do a bad install a leak is gonna show up way sooner than that anyway, but SunPower offers 25 year warranty on that too.\n\nOf course, you have to pay a premium for having the best.  No way you're getting below $3/kW from sunpower.",

Labor costs are quite high. You can see in the link above that one of the jobs took 11 crew members 11 days. I'd estimate that same install would have taken a standard 4 man install crew 1 day with regular solar panels, 2 days if there were PowerWalls.\n\nTesla Solar Roof on the OP's house would likely have cost at least $200,000-250,000 and taken 6+ weeks to install, if Tesla even accepted doing that job.

Since you mentioned 10-20 Powerwalls, I'm going to say $85,000.\n\nNext, figure out the savings. Let's says that the savings are 70 cents per day.\n\nSo, the [payback period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paybackperiod.asp) is $85,000 / $0.70 per day = 121,428.57 days = **332 years.** LOL!!\n\nIt will take 332 years for the batteries to pay for themselves. \n\nYou may be able to reduce the payback period with grid connection price increases and other considerations, but I can't see how the payback period will get down to any time period worth considering.",

Balancing supply and demand across the nation necessitates long-distance transmission lines even in the absence of perverse utility incentives. I also still think there's a place for baseload power generation sources like nuclear.\n\nI definitely understand the argument that new investments in nuclear aren't cost-effective, even if I have more faith in the viability of SMR's and Microreactors, especially for decentralized grids like [Puerto Rico.](https://www.nuclearalternativeproject.org/work) But reasonable people can disagree on that. I hope we can all agree that shutting down nuclear plants ahead of schedule due to amorphous environmental concerns is ludicrous considering their high capital costs and low maintenance costs.",

"comment": "I'm not quite sure what you're getting at or if it's just how it's written but it's extremely hard to figure out what you want...\n\n&gt;SP at 30k and string inverter/jinko at 28.8K. The costs of degradation using the values over 25 years is roughly the difference\n\nSP - solar panels? The difference in what - cost, production? Please provide more information. $/W and $/kWh are the two metrics that are important IMO\n\n&gt;I keep hearing stories of issues with expandability off of SP down the road\n\nAgain, what is SP. Solar Panel? Single Phase? There will always be issues with expandability with solar. It is a complex system and people are often extremely cost conscious. To expand your system, you would need to ensure all of the wiring, breakers etc are sized correctly. This would mean upsizing everything - but what do you upsize for? How much expandability do you need? What are you waiting to expand for? You also need to remember you will need to enter into a new agreement with your utility, which if you have been grandfathered in may be a shittier net-metering agreement. Then you mention tech is always changing - someone I worked with installed their system in April and is talking about expanding it now. They used 400W Q Cells panels. Well, as of June, you were unable to get the same 400W Q cells so an addition would mean that you are putting different sized/looking panels on your roof. Are you comfortable with that? Also, inverters (string and micro), are usually designed for specific panel voltages in mind. If you look to expand in 10 years time, there's no guarantee that the 1000W panels will be compatible with your inverters. \n\n&gt;I am interested in the SPAN smart panel since subbing the load isn't required etc.\n\nWhat do you mean \"subbing the load\"? Panels can only take a certain amount of solar backfeed. Your expansion would need to account for this, and if you intend to get more than you are able to backfeed then you would need to tap into your meter and it's about another $2000 upgrade. \n\n&gt;I am also assuming that I could hook up whatever battery system down the road since micro inverters are well microinverters\n\nNo, you cannot hook up \"whatever\" battery system. Micro inverters will require an AC tethered battery, whereas string systems can hook in before the inverter for a DC tethered system. DC systems are more efficient because you are only completing the conversion once.  \n&gt;With regards to single panel monitoring, I used to work in IT and will just setup a personal node-red instance.\n\nI don't know what that is, whether it works for solar or why. If you want panel level monitoring, you need either optimizers or micro inverters. \n \n&gt;I tried energy sage to knock down the quote some and I got zero quotes.\n\nI don't know what you mean \"knock down\" - additional pricing? More quotes? More details?\n\nTL:DR - personally, I wouldn't try play cute and plan for expansion. Do it once and do it properly. If that means waiting, so be it.",

First we installed solar, but we were still getting raped.  Before our batteries the sun would set and the utility would freely rape and pillage.  \n\nNow that we have batteries, our usage 3-8 PM is ZERO.  So we now have a utility plan that charges a demand fee of $12 times the highest average kw hour of usage, but is 5 cents a kw all other times, and pays us 11 cents a kw hour for feeding the grid.  \n\nWe’ll never have a demand fee because $12 times zero is zero.  And we’re getting more than twice back what we now pay for feeding the grid.  And we have the grid as the backup to our batteries, for those cloudy days.\n\nWe’re really happy with our Powerwalls because we’re essentially net-neutral now.    Basically we are 100% energy independent, including charging a Model 3 and a Model Y daily drivers, a split-system air conditioner, a pool pump, two refrigerators, an electric on-demand water heater, three TVs, a couple Xboxes, and all kinds of electronics.  \n\nWe are loving our Powerwalls.\nIt is pretty awesome!!!

Whirling wonders lovingly caressing breezes to capture ‘free energy’; energy-rich sunbeams falling gently onto sheets of shimmering glass-covered fields of silicon – what could be cleaner or greener than that.\n\nPlug an EV into a notionally wind and solar power grid and the Planet must surely avoid our rapacious appetite for destruction, and last for eons to come.\n\nWell, that’s the marketing myth, anyway.",

In order to meet this requirement they install additional wind and solar.\n\nThe real world is messier, and proving additionality is hard, which is why you see time-matched power purchase agreements starting to be used.",

"comment": "&gt; Wealthy countries mandating green electricity encourage humanity atrocities in developing countries!\n\nThe ruling class, powerful elite, and the media lack some energy literacy which may be the reasons they avoid conversations about the ugly side of “green” mandates and subsidies. \n\nBefore anyone in Washington decides to procure wind turbines, solar panels, or an EV, they should read the Pulitzer Prize nominated book **“Clean Energy Exploitations”**,  and decide for themselves if they wish to financially support the humanity atrocities and environmental degradation among folks in developing countries with yellow, brown, and black skin, so that the wealthy countries can go green.\n\nWealth, with no ethical or moral standards for those of lesser means, can be dangerous and fatal to the cheap labor of disposable workforces. We have seen the effects on the disposable workforce when Qatar “needed” to build seven new stadiums in a decade to be ready for the 2022 World Cup. \n\nThe World Cup in Qatar kicked off on Sunday November 20 at the Al Bayt Stadium, but **the “acceptable” toll of more than 6,500 migrant laborers who died between 2011 and 2020,  helping to build World Cup infrastructure with cheap disposable workforce** will provide viewers and participants with many lingering questions about our ethical and moral beliefs resulting from the grim toll.\n\nThe transition to electricity generation from breezes and sunshine has proven to be ultra-expensive for the wealthy countries of Germany, Australia, Great Britain, and the USA representing 6 percent of the world’s population (508 million vs 8 billion).  Those wealthy countries now have among the highest cost for their electricity, while the poorer developing countries, currently without the usage of the 20th century products manufactured from crude oil, are experiencing about **11,000,000 child deaths  every year**due to the unavailability of the fossil fuel products used in wealthy countries.",

"comment": "I know your utility limits additional panels. If you could add additional panels you could reduce the amount of storage needed. It would still be expensive but x percentage more panels with less battery storage would probably more sense. Either way it’s profitably expensive for almost anyone with todays solar panel and battery prices. By 2030 when battery and solar panel prices are likely lower it might be feasible? Time will tell.",

They came back with a quote, well it wasn't a quote at all just a number, and everything they wanted to talk about was the federal and state credits. I had no idea if the price was fair so I went along with it. I asked for a breakdown - how many panels, what brand, inverter size, what racking system they were gonna use, etc and the guy deadpans \"we can't give you that information\" like WHAT!?!?! I challenged him 3 times while he was sitting at my kitchen table to give me a breakdown and all 3 times he kept saying \"just look at all the credits and rebates you will get.\" The next day I called a local installer with maybe 15 jobs under their belt. They came, did a site analysis, and gave me a printout with 23 pages of information. The materials list estimated all the way down to the different lengths/types of fasteners they were gonna use for the install. They were 1/3 the cost of SunRun and did a fantastic job. They are now the largest installer in the region with many happy customers. Grab another quote from a reputable company and make sure you let them know the bad experience you had with the last one.",

That part of the equation is driven by things like the structure of your utility's net metering program and whether you pay upfront or go with a loan or lease, etc. Once you understand how your net metering would work, you can do a lot of your own financial analysis before you start talking with sales reps.",

I had vague mental images of someone picking a drumstick off of a living turkey and another person trying to pick cheese off of a tree.\n\nTo me, the ultimate goal of veganism is to create less demand for animal products. In situations where someone unknowingly or mistakenly gives me cheese/eggs/what.have.you, I generally just eat it. In fact, I'm more of what you would call a freegan so I might be the wrong person to answer. I don't mind taking non-vegan foods out of a grocery store dumpster, for example. Occasionally, I will finish my girlfriend's cheese pizza if it would otherwise be headed for the trash. I draw the line at meat, however. I've been vegetarian/vegan for more than a third of my life and meat really holds no sway over me and actually mildly disgusts me.",

Cats don't have that choice. \n\n&gt;Also, there is a 5th option of carefully attempting to feed the cat the vegan food, monitoring for any issues, addressing them if possible and if not possible returning to the meat-based food.\n\nIf a cat doesn't get enough taurine it will slowly lose its vision. By the time you notice a problem you've already irreversibly handicapped the animal. It simply isn't ethical to feed an obligate carnivore a diet which its body never adapted to consume.",

The benefits of doing something and the purpose for doing something aren't necessarily the same thing.\n\nIf you're plant-based, that's great! I appreciate anyone who reduces animal suffering for any reason at all, and so do the animals. But the word vegan has a specific meaning, and it doesn't help anyone to allow it to be misused.",

Teacher To Vegan Fit Model Champion]\n(http://veganbodyrevolution.com/?p=731)\n\n&gt;[Derek Tresize 1 of 3 | How He Built Insane Muscle Mass On A Vegan Diet](http://veganbodyrevolution.com/?p=672)\n\nPlants have lots of fiber, nutrients, minerals, antioxidants. They are low in cholesterol. They are low in calories.\n\nNow the low calorie part is the tricky part. Since plants are lower in calories you need to eat more. This is good tho because then you can eat more food, which I like. When you try to make brutal weight gains, you need to eat a lot more. This is good in the long run though, because as we know plants are loaded in all the good shit anyways. \n\nThe more you do it the more sense it'll make.\n\nLots of smoothies. My monster smoothie is 10 bananas, 4 dates, ice, unsweetened cocoa powder, and a little almond milk/hazelnut/hemp/soy milk (or a little water if I'm lazy) and bam. Chocolate smoothie pure power ready to go.\n\nI don't think you need the whey powder at all.",

The reason I'm vegan is that I hate what humans are doing to animals, to vulnerable ecosystems, to the world. Look what meddling has got us so far: desertification, deforestation, global warming, cruelty, exploitation. All as a result of human meddling. The last thing the world needs is more interference from humans, unless that interference is to tidy up after ourselves (i.e. re-planting native vegetation, reintroducing eradicated species etc etc). Humans are special because we get to choose, other animals don't, but that doesn't mean we get to make choices for them - surely that's the central tenet of veganism...?",

Vegans and non-vegans would be the most technically correct terminology but like so many other words for whatever reason terms take off within groups. Omni is quicker and cleaner than non-vegan which probably has a lot to do with it. \n\nThe point is it isn't meant offensively and it is used pretty exclusively as shorthand for vegans talking to other vegans.",

"comment": "Hello everyone. Might as well introduce myself now. Long time listener and this sub is what made me realize vegan was just as easy as vegetarian multiple months ago. You guys truly are my solace when the worlds darkness seems overwhelming.  Here goes:\n\nFirst experience with non-meat eating was a childhood best friend who was raised vegetarian. Every time I was over at his house it was a new experience. The mom came from Trinidad and Tobago. Learned allot of cool new things but the ones that stuck in my mind is sorrel drink made from hibiscus, and plant based milks. I don't remember what else she made but I know it was delicious. This was elementary school back when beyblades and AIM was popular.  Since plain cheese pizza was of course the best food in the universe we ate it a decent amount. \n\nSeveral years later I went full vegetarian for over a year on a dare and just to see if I could. Kinda a personal challenge. This was somewhere around 5th grade. I remember talking to my dad who mentioned back in his hippie years he was a vegetarian for a long time. Made me realize it was not a new thing and not really weird. I kept it going until I accidentally ate meat as part of a lasagna from the school lunch. Since at that time I technically broke my streak it didn't matter much for me to stop. I didn't have the ethical reasoning at the time. \n\nFast forward several uncomfortable years of IBS which the doctors could not attribute a cause. I kinda ignored it cause I didn't know what to do. Best they could tell me was that lactose may be a problem and gave me those pills to eat with pizza. Huh who would have thought that maybe actually removing it from a diet would be a thing?? It's actually sad looking back on those years Not realizing how simple the solution was if only someone would have told me or I could have found out sooner. \n\nSometime when I was 21 I watched the Netflix documentary Vegucated. Not really sure what made me do it. Possibly looking for meaning in life or just curious. It was a dark time for me, far to much drinking and poor life decisions. College and construction / carpentry was my life. My girlfriend of 2 years was there too having moved out of her parents place due to less than safe conditions. I think the idea of making a decision that was actually the right one for a change is what attracted me the most. Right then and there we both swore off meat and became full time vegetarians. It helped having each other. Couple years later and my sister joined but was only pescetarian. My girlfriend slipped and became pesc as well. Sometime before moving away I asked my boss for a raise (same construction job, small family company and I was the longest employed worker). He argued that since I don't eat meat I don't deserve a raise even though he always was impressed by my work and gave me lots of solo projects. First time experiencing first hand discrimination. Funny thing was he didn't want me to leave since I was one of his best workers. Oh well, I moved on and have my own place and much better job now (Automation technician for a worldwide semiconductor foundry)\n\nNow that I was in my own house with the same girlfriend I realized I have more decisions and made the next step to Veganism. Several attempts later (seriously it was like quitting smoking, not sure why I failed but kept trying until it stuck) and I'm full time vegan. Since Early April of this year. Thank you all for showing me how I could stick with it! 25 now so that was about 4 years veg and now 1/2 year vegan (+ previous attempts). I've never felt better in my life. The doctors never figured it out but I sure did. I don't have any of those problems that I used to. Funny how they just disappeared and I stopped worrying about it every day. \n\nOh update, I'm engaged to that wonderful girl and on that same day I talked to her about how she should try vegan as well since it means so much to me. Two weeks for her going strong! Honestly though I hear allot about couples with differences in diet and I'm not sure I could do it so I was so glad that we are on the same page now.",

People who actually do not have the potential to feel good on a plant-based diet are rare, for instance because of multiple food allergies. But for 95% of them it's just hypocrisy (and I believe they're deluding themselves too).\n\nI've seen people go vegetarian, eat tons of cheese pizza and pretty much no real food, then go back to meat because they \"didn't feel good\". Well duh.\n\nI'm not saying these people don't exist, I'm just saying that people who have an actual reason not to feel good on a proper plant-based diet are a vanishingly small subset of people who claim this. \n\nOf course there is no one size fits all diet, but plant-based diets can also be varied!

That's the same amount of \"force\" you are talking about, and I don't think anyone would consider that \"forcing people to eat meat.\" My work sometimes provides lunch on Fridays and there is often only a meat option (sometimes there's a salad on the side). While this sucks, it's still the company's choice and there's plenty of other food I can get/bring on my own.\n\nIf you do consider that forcing people to eat meat, then I imagine people around here would be bummed and would sympathize with the employee, but they would still say the company has a right to choose what it's willing to pay for when it comes to providing free food.",

"comment": "*Info from somebody i forgot to write down on cats and plant-based diets:*\n\nThe reason why cats historically couldn't be vegan is related to the fact that they lack the genes necessary to synthesize vitamin D, B12, vitamin A, taurine, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid.\n\nAs long as any vegan food is supplemented with those things and has a high protein/fat content and a low carbohydrate content, there's no other physical reason they can't be vegan.\n\nThe term obligate carnivore is only relevant when talking about wild animals because it's related to their nutrient requirements in a diet they could naturally acquire in the wild, but because we can give cats supplemented and appropriately designed food, it's not an issue in domesticated animals. (I've linked to a vegan cat food that does just this at the bottom).\n\nFinally, I'd like to cite several studies that support supplemented vegan cat and dog food.\n\n1. \"[A] significant and growing body of population studies and case reports have indicated that cats and dogs maintained on vegetarian diets may be healthy—including those exercising at the highest levels—and, indeed, may experience a range of health benefits. Such diets must be nutritionally complete and reasonably balanced\".\n\n2. \"Wakefield and colleagues (2006) compared the health of 34 cats maintained on vegetarian diets for at least a year, with that of 52 cats maintained on meat-based diets for at least a year. There were no significant differences in age, sex, body condition, housing, or perceived health status, with most cats described as healthy or generally healthy. These results are hardly surprising, when we consider that animals need specific nutrients, not ingredients. There is no scientific reason why a diet comprised only of plant, mineral and synthetically-based ingredients cannot be formulated to meet all of the palatability, nutritional and bioavailability needs of the species for which it is intended. \"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035952/\n\nhttps://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/vegan-animal-diets-facts-and-myths\n\nhttps://www.amipetfood.com/en/products/products-for-cats/amicat\n\n\n*Also, OP did not mention home-cooking at all (PS 3 vets (2 of which had been in the trade 10+ years) recommended s home cooked diet for one of my past dogs who has diabetes. It was not vegan but there was no supplementation. It was brown rice, turkey/ground cow, carrots, peas, and other assorted veggies like zucchini. Both diabetic dog and young, healthy dog thrived. This was only to pin the \"supplements are necessary\" thing), and there are plenty of commercial diets that are well-known for their merit and Nutritional benefits.*\n\n*This is not to negate your experiences or your knowledge as a vet tech, this is to give a full, well-rounded idea of the issue to OP and others reading this thread. I am in no way attacking you as a person and I am sure you do well by every animal in your care. Your concerns are genuine.*",

If you aren’t going 100% vegan, you’re a demon, the devils advocate, a meat munchin adolf hitler. Sigh...guys here really need to learn to appreciate the small steps other people are taking on their own journey towards the goal. \nAnother thing is that it IS POSSIBLE to consume meat from a better source than the mass industry and that it’s more than good to support people who turn towards better keeping conditions in the industry. It’s not the 100% way but it’s a good step away from mass industry.",

"comment": "My holiday centerpiece is almost always a whole roasted cauliflower with a thick bready lemon-tahini peanut-butter crust. Something along these lines: [https://www.nutriplanet.org/2015/12/whole-roasted-cauliflower/](https://www.nutriplanet.org/2015/12/whole-roasted-cauliflower/)\n\nCauliflower may sound boring, but this dish is extremely hearty. The crust is fantastic, almost like stuffing. [https://imgur.com/KT8vSfW](https://imgur.com/KT8vSfW) If you can get ahold of Romanesco broccoli, it's a hybrid between cauliflower &amp; broccoli and has a bit more of a savory flavor, while retaining the firmer texture of cauliflower. It's really delicous.\n\nI'm also going to suggest a simple roasted sweet potato, or done up fancy however you like. Roasted brussel sprouts are another all-time favorite. Many cranberry sauces are vegan right out of the can, and they pair very well with these savory dishes.\n\nA few more that can be easily made vegan, just by switching out the dairy for vegan dairy equivalents:\n\nGarlic mashed potatoes  \nOven-roasted carrots  \nGreen bean casserole  \nCornbread  \nStuffing (choose your poison)",

I would imagine that for some people, they may have had an event that happened that motivated them to go vegan (maybe they watched some upsetting farm video, or maybe they had a scary health issue like cancer they survived that made them go whole food plant-based vegan, or something.  And so maybe their motivation started out strong, but then over time the motivation fades and they go back to their normal lives, maybe the motivation for them tends to fade.  Just guessing.\n\nPersonally, I had heard a lot of people report having tried going vegan and they don't manage to keep it up for more than a few years because of social pressure, but I don't remember where I heard it or any specific stats.",

I also try to buy “for life” shoes and jeans etc. \n\nDo you have infrastructure where you live to transit instead of drive? I know in North America, we aren’t built for walking or biking, but if you can cut down driving to essentials like food shopping, but catch the bus to school or work, it cuts emissions. \n\nDo you flat share? Heating is harder, the more people have a say. I leave my thermostat at 19°C all year, so my heating doesn’t kick in except on cold days and my AC doesn’t run often in summer. It kicks in about three times a day. \n\nFollow your food to its source. Sure, açai is vegan, but do you know how the farmers are treated/how much they’re paid for their produce? (This isn’t a slam on vegan food, just an example.) \n\nLove your pet. Give them company. Another friend to keep them engaged. If you come to a crossroad where they don’t match your ethical view, don’t have a pet. Hamsters have a short life, don’t get another one when it passes. \n\nDon’t buy a new phone, laptop, tv or whatever just because you’re due for an upgrade. Buy refurbished when the time comes.",

"comment": "It goes on…you very conveniently left that out as well as many other findings. The conclusion goes on to say “There is an urgent need for large scale population based studies to further investigate this question, (if vegan diets are bad for animals) with a particular focus on assessing the dietary aspects cited to be of particular concern e.g., taurine and folate. For guardians wishing to feed their pets vegan diets at the current time, based on the available evidence it is recommended that commercially produced vegan diets are used since they are less likely to lead to nutrient imbalances.” \n\nLESS likely to lead to a nutrient imbalance is satisfactory to you? That’s the best you can do for your pet is less likely? \n\nYou ignored the vast majority in this article and found sentence that suited your agenda and tried to use it to your benefit. You ignored the documented cats that exhibited hypokalemia or those with increased creatinine kinase (which potassium supplements helped, sure, but do you really think a cats diet should be medication also?). “3.2.3. Clinical Findings In cats fed vegetarian diets that were supplemented with potassium, a myopathy was seen within 2 weeks of the dietary change [29]. This was characterized by ventroflexion of the head and the neck. The cats also showed lateral head resting, a stiff gait, muscular weakness, unsteadiness, and the occasional tremor of the head and pinnae. Erythrocyte transketolase activity was assessed to determine whether thiamine deficiency was contributing to the clinical myopathy, independent of potassium status. Differences in this enzyme across the time-course of the study were non-significant, suggesting thiamine deficiency was not a causative factor in the development of the clinical signs. Thiamine was also found to be within the reference range in Fantinati et al., 2021 [30]. No abnormalities were detected on auscultation or ophthalmoscopic examination [29]. Weight loss and poor coat condition have also been observed in cats fed vegetarian diets [29,30]. However, most cats in another study had a normal coat condition and no obviously diet-related clinical abnormalities picked up by clinical examination [27]. Clinical signs of lethargy with altered mentation, dysorexia, and muscle wasting, along with gut signs of bloating and increased borborygmi have also been observed [30]. Yet, the defecation of cats on vegan diets has been shown to be unremarkable [27].” \n\nIf this is ok with you, if this evidence leaves you unaffected then you; conversely, cannot be mad at people like me who are not affected by Dominion and need to find something else to debate with. I once again ask you to find me a study that straight up says that a vegan diet works for dogs and cats with NO caveats.",
