Which sounds fine until you realize that most people don't stay in one spot for very long. \n\nPortland's city street parking rate is $1.60 an hour (more at the campus?). If an EV driver was going to park for four hours anyway, then he could scoop up 12 or so kW of juice (more if he's got a 30 kW LEAF inverter or a Tesla that can take Level 3 input). This would run his car for 50 to 200 or so miles, depending. But if that person stayed any longer than necessary just for the electricity before moving the car to a free spot, he'd be paying *much* more than he would at home unless he's the Tesla owner, in which case he might be breaking even.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0016445497070283939,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09262950848196852,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19140099121232693,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11797327175736427,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3096449183094113,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3162511965128523,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13532597478479147,"ev_1":-0.11225864508499701,"ev_2":-0.14629799057729542,"ev_3":-0.019888066686235106,"ev_4":-0.00345286059503754,"ev_5":-0.0018599901037911575,"ev_6":-0.002025636301063116},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

It's a mechanism for encouraging people (or companies) to seek an alternative.  For companies who generate electricity, it's a decent mechanism.  I would go so far as to say that we might even impose both a tax on emissions and a subsidy for renewables, paid for by the tax.  It's a good way to push those big companies into switching.\n\nIt would certainly make the switch from coal to NG more attractive, and since NG is half the carbon, that's a good thing.  NG generation plants would pay half as much in tax as the coal powered plants, and since NG is currently cheaper anyway….\n\nOther than electrical generation, however, I don't see many alternatives out there.  I've mentioned diesel a bunch of times, and you've ignored all of them.  So, we tax diesel because of the carbon dioxide emissions.  What's the alternative that people are supposed to shift to?  We're going to run our OTR trucks on sunshine?  It's not a viable option. \n\nNow, we might be able to create electric rail for freight.  That's not something that someone can just switch to, because it's magically cheaper than diesel powered trains, it would take a massive change in our infrastructure.  Huge up front costs, albeit with long term benefits.  That's a different economic case than the small carbon tax is designed to address.\n\nWe should be building massive numbers of light electric rail systems in the US for transporting people.  We should be building thermally efficient housing, using the sun's energy for daytime activities, storing energy for nighttime use, etc. We should ~~develop~~ implement these things because they are cheaper and more efficient, not because they emit CO2.\n\nWe know how to do these things. We don't really need a lot of R&amp;D, what we need is clever marketing to make people WANT them.  Not out of fear, but out of envy.  \n\nThe most successful companies in the world didn't get that way because they relied upon a government regulation to make sure they had a market.  They got that way by making people desire to use their products.  The Tesla Model S electric car is not marketed as \"cheap.\"  It's marketed as \"amazing and sporty and luxurious.\"  It makes people want one.\n\nIf we made high speed electric rail competitive with airlines, but without the fear of flying, the cramped little seats, the pain in children's ears from the pressure change, etc. we could save all of that jet fuel from being burned.  We need to make clean efficiency *desirable* on it's own merits.\n\nBut, I support your idea of adding a tiny tax to carbon so that big corporations will think about switching to low carbon fuels.

They have various charging infrastructure that is generally free to use.\n\nWhere I currently work there is about 5 EVs that share 2 designated EV parking spots, serviced by 1 240v and 2 120v plugs on the same (I'm guessing ~50 amp) circuit. Usually we get there early enough in the morning to turn the 2 designated EV spots into 4 spots by parking on either side of it. There are plenty of spots in the lot so this isn't really a problem.\n\nOther buildings have Blink, Chargepoint, and most recently NRG stations. The blink ones usually require your blink card and still charge. The chargepoint is a tossup. It used to be free, but last I saw there was a fee being tacked on because the building is in a location where non-employees can easily park there. The newest buildings being completed have added a new parking structure with 8 NRG plugs servicing ~24 parking spots. They are all free. There's also 120v plugs in locations around some of the garages, sometimes marked with EV reserved, sometimes not. \n\nThis is in San Diego where energy is fairly expensive.\n\nIf workplace solar becomes a standard, and the business isn't getting what they expect from selling the energy back to the power company, I can see charging at work becoming the norm. If not free, then comparable cost to charging at home. If money is an issue, I can see stations for a business using employee RFID cards in order to start charging.\n\nI'd also say single stations with multiple cords will also become the norm, to prevent less courteous employees from trying to skip the line or insisting they get topped up first.

You could build a pack for $560, and that would be cheaper than the other options you were considering.\n\nIf you have the choice between traditional Li-ion and LiFePo4 cells, go with LiFePo4; they will last longer, charge faster, and are nearly impossible to catch on fire. They are slightly bigger and heavier than Li-ions, but they will pull their weight.\n\nAlso, yes, having individual cells is always preferable to having an enclosed pack.

I like the optimism here, but the article gives little insight to how this is going to happen. Module pricing is starting to bottom out, it might drop another 15 to 20 cents per Watt in the next few years but I don't see how it'll be viable in the US once the investment tax credits expire next year. I know the article talks about China being an even bigger player too but there's got to be a point when China starts reeling back subsidies as well. We see it all over in this industry: projects flourish in subsidy, and flounder as soon as subsidies disappear. \n\nAlso the article mentions the problem of storage being addressed by innovations like Tesla batteries but lithium ion batteries will still be expensive because unlike silicon, which is found everywhere and the primary element in PV, lithium is a rare earth metal. There will have to be other breakthroughs in storage before this matter is truly addressed. \n\nLastly, don't think the utilities will just stand by idly waiting for distributed generation and residential solar to come along and snatch up their customers. Net metering still requires the use of utility lines and someone's got to pay for that. The Edison Institute predicted this in a report 2 years ago, I'm sure utilities have developed some plan should the market really change drastically. \n\nI spent the prime years of my life so far working in solar, so I hope for my sake this article is correct but I just wish this article gave more assurance for its conclusion.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003582040917535778,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08530641044398521,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1861398580826436,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26077405673172854,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.019960943734076864,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1205844195646885,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09302633030650516,"ev_1":-0.03783061339587827,"ev_2":-0.08030639451317256,"ev_3":-0.005342842637522456,"ev_4":-0.002748516545883225,"ev_5":-0.0012814731562684756,"ev_6":-0.006799219156770657},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It was a tiny, odd-looking two-seater that cost somewhere in the neighborhood of six figures to build. Every control system, every voltage regulator, every safety system, had to be custom built from the ground up, at great expense, because semiconductor technology was what it was in the 1990s as opposed to today. The car was basically a rolling science experiment. It was prone to frequent breakdowns and GM had to staff a dedicated group of service vans for when this happened, because what were you going to do, take it to the local Chevy dealer?\n\nElectronics technology simply wasn't there at the time to achieve something people would have bought at a reasonable price. GM alone would not have been able to move the lithium battery market THAT quickly. It took the global advent of laptop computers to do that and even then, to get completely away from NiMh took well over a decade. Hell, the Prius used NiMh up until last year!  Tesla is building the largest battery factory on the planet, and even then they're only expecting a 30% price reduction in five years.  Yet you're suggesting GM would have been able to single handedly make LiIon batteries affordable within a decade when multiple orders of magnitude of cost reduction were needed.\n\nWho Killed The Electric Car needed a boogyman and it picked GM. In reality, the car was not good, the technology simply wasn't there, and GM was completely in the right to say that people couldn't keep the government mandated science experiments. How many billions would you have had them pour into a technology that (as every other automaker recognized) simply wasn't ready for prime time? As of today however, GM has sold over 100,000 Volts, invested in a huge battery lab, a greatly improved second generation Volt, plus the Bolt, and hasn't set out any notices asking for those cars back.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00026792740512367647,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19290941881017573,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26755279477692556,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18889446703547505,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1737657685803858,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2147491124977972,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006900706755307813,"ev_1":-0.09375796205131337,"ev_2":-0.08797703811433166,"ev_3":-0.005544238573444697,"ev_4":-0.0035486942761053797,"ev_5":-0.01371843324159272,"ev_6":-0.1793311584296427},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It'll reach homeowners with above-average incomes that are willing to spend extra for some green cred. There's no value proposition in fuel savings to counter the cost premium the battery adds to the vehicle today, especially compared to spending $6000 on a used Leaf instead. \n\nKeep in mind the Leaf's market was the same: the average buyer of a new one had an income in excess of $125K or more than twice the median household and 40% higher than the median new car buyer.\n\nThe small size of the addressable market is not a fault of GM and does not tell you anything about \"compliance car status\". It's just reality. The Bolt is neither a compliance car nor expected to sell a million units: it's a halo car. It's showing GM is a serious participant in the market, and ensuring a foothold to build on with consumers and suppliers as component prices drop and EVs get closer to ICEs in terms of cost in the future.\n\nThe first test of whether EVs can break into the mainstream is more likely to be the 2018/2019 Nissan Leaf. It'll be built on a shared platform with Renault and Mitsubishi, allowing a significantly lower price point than the current Leaf while still sporting a significantly longer range. That'll start to hit the spot where potential buyers can actually make a legitimate case for buying it in terms of maintenance and fuel savings.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001289639246048561,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16526889349524937,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1846848831822475,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08068938242892425,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1891218561468122,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.08414267313977082,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19473186686324576,"ev_1":-0.12625672207920352,"ev_2":-0.16161332395582279,"ev_3":-0.12595356323678666,"ev_4":-0.007814567509437135,"ev_5":-0.004687403978702302,"ev_6":-0.20165206156282997},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers or other (the author is discussing the market and potential buyers in general, not referring to a specific group of people they have a personal relationship with)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against.","1.3.3_second_order":"weak.","ev_1":"NO.

People *choose* those cars to feel cool, feel comfortable, feel powerful while they commute to and from work and soccer practice. Cars are still a status/power symbol, and if you think the reason there are so many giant high performance/low efficiency vehicles still around is simply due to lack of availability of good eco-friendlier options, I think you’re just making excuses.

Unless you have solar panels on your roof or live in a liberal wealthy town that only sources green energy, the carbon footprint of using gasoline is about the same as using electricity. This can be easily seen by comparing a plug-in hybrid electric to gas driving. In this case all other factors are the same.  I did this for a Prius prime which gets about 3.2miles per kWh and 52 miles per gallon of gasoline.  Gasoline produces about 9000g of CO2 per gallon and in the US every kWh of electricity produces about 400g of CO2. This comes out to about 125g CO2/mile when on electricity and 175g per mile on gasoline.  with such a small difference, something like a Tesla with its large battery will never be carbon positive, because it takes a huge amount of energy to make Li-ion batteries. And by the way, that energy comes with a 600g/kWh CO2 footprint, because batteries are mostly made in China and China is using mostly coal for generating electricity.  This dirty grid results in my Prius prime generating 185g of CO2 per mile when driven in China in electric mode. So in China EVs are actually hurting the environment.  There are, of course, many more details to consider, such as the energy it costs to mine and refine and transport gasoline. But this is more than offset in the US by the largescale use of natural gas to generate electricity. The mining, processing and transportation of natural gas releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas (about 30x as bad as CO2). The real impact one can have on the environment is to not drive a huge SUV or truck, it hardly matters what fuel is used.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0017162663716590032,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24007314966572152,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19330692397638427,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25765277229421385,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34469529727643283,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26251235393457095,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16445619449451954,"ev_1":-0.1077003194961921,"ev_2":-0.03181417518620341,"ev_3":-0.1489685601529625,"ev_4":-0.012342575759248575,"ev_5":-0.0055888236238388345,"ev_6":-0.010926109889017729},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXesBhYwdRo) is another video where he discusses it. I believe he does a sufficient work in explaining why climategate is not a big deal.  He does not discuss all the quotes you mentioned, but he does include the most important emails that, out of context, look like they are direct proof of fraud or data manipulation. Potholer also discusses some of the skeptic scientists that you have mentioned, who supposedly have had their careers damaged simply because of their non-mainstream views. I continue to claim that if their careers have been damaged or their abilities to get funding are diminished, it is more about them being wrong and less about people wanting to stop them from doing research that is not in agreement with the mainstream views, and if they truly get less funding, there are people who will fund contarian science out of their own interests. \n\n&gt; It is my considered opinion that the vast majority of climate scientists are better people than Jones, Briffa, Mann, etc.\n\nGlad to hear that. But then, I don't find anything convincing that would show that these scientists are in any way any worse than the others. \n\nWe are in agreement that CO2 can increase yields in some cases and that the report on Africa's yields is almost certainly wrong. However, we are not in agreement on what effects the change in climate will have on yields. Obviously there will be a lot of \"may\"s and \"possibly\"s when we are talking about the future. This does not mean that it is not likely. That being said, I think I have to agree with you that the study that I linked discusses the effect in far too specific conditions. My main point is that the statement \"CO2 is plant food and more of it is good\" is a simplistic statement that does not take in account the numerous factors that affect the effect of CO2 on plants, and it generally completely ignores any potential effects that CO2 will have on climate, which will likely have a significant negative effect on growth of plants and thus yields.\n\n&gt;One thing you don't mention is that CO2 fertilization actually decreases water requirements for plants, so less freshwater will be needed for irrigation in dry areas.\n\nThis was mentioned in the article in Nature.\n\n\n&gt;an outdated 1,000 year reconstruction\n\nThe \"hockey stick\" is not outdated, discredited or debunked. I am aware of the criticism it has recieved, but I am also aware of the responses to that criticism. What the hockey stick shows is that the current rate of warming is faster than anything experienced in a long time, at the very least a thousand years. Even at the meagerly rates that you claim, a lot of species would find it very hard to adapt.\n\nHas there been a slow-down? Temperatures have not gone up as fast as thought, perhaps. But the warming certainly continues, as shown by various other indicatiors of warming. Even the atmoshperic warming is hardly breaking the trend, as explained [ȟere.](http://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/global-temperature-the-post-1998-surprise/) What is missing, perhaps, is the acceleration of the warming, but as you have yourself explained, the warming process may take decades.  As for the models not picking up on this, several explanations have been offered, including the record not correctly including [all temperatures](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/gaps-in-data-on-arctic-temperatures-account-for-the-pause-in-global-warming-8945597.html), [volcaones](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/23/us-climate-volcanoes-idUSBREA1M0W920140223), [other factors](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/feb/12/global-warming-fake-pause-hiatus-climate-change). Ultimately, only time will tell who is right, of course, but I do not find your figure of less than 0.75C of more warming by 2100 to be even plausible without significant cuts to emissions. \n\n&gt; Solar and wind have major drawbacks that no amount of subsidy will overcome, the foremost being they are intermittent. Because they are intermittent, they require fossil fueled backup systems. The intermittency of the resource won't change with subsidy dollars. We can discuss the merits of subsidizing storage sytems, if you like, but that isn't what you are supporting.\n\nEven when dependent on fossil fuel backup, renewable energy can provide substantial cuts to fossil fuel use and emissions. I did not mention storage subsidies, but obviously much research and investments into better grids and energy storage are needed, and subsidies will likely play a substantial role at least at first in increasing the amount of energy storage. It deeply annoys me that so many people consider the almost negligible risk of nuclear accidents or the ultimately rather small problem of waste to be more significant than the risk of climate change, and on top of that there are new promising technologies which may solve many of the problems of nuclear energy. If renewables truly are as hopeless as you say, (which I don't agree on, though I recognize the remaining challenges) then it is an absolute imperative to invest greatly into nuclear energy and research into solving the remaining problems of nuclear energy. \n\nWorld government is indeed sometimes suggested as a necessity for solving global problems, including climate change, and as a goal for humanity. World govenrment is not necessarily totalitarianism, however, in the same way that any reasonable action taken by national governments that does not infringe on human rights is generally not seen as totalitarianism. \n\n&gt;You suggested that the vested interest on the renewables side of politics are little companies.\n\nIn most cases they are significantly less influential than large fossil fuel companies.\n\nSpain's subsidies program for solar was a failure due to insufficient reviewing (taking in account the price drop) which led to inaccurate estimates for the rate of installation, leading to inaccurate and horribly overblown costs for the program. In Germany, the program was well-managed and though the price drop seems to have surprised them too, they took sufficient action in time, and coupled with their relatively healthy economy, the cost of the program is not overblown. The remaining subsidies are being phased out, but solar installations continue at impressive rates. Arguably subsidies, be it in Spain or Germany or elsewhere, were a significant enabler for the price drop of over 80% from 2008 to 2012 in solar panels.\n\nThe Australian government vows to repeal the carbon tax, but from what I know, they do not seem to have sufficient influence to pass the repeal.\n\n&gt;There are values of ECS, for example, that fall quite nicely in the range AR5 identifies that mean there is very little cause for concern. It is absolutely fallacious to claim there is a unified consensus among climate scientists that drastic energy policy measures are required.\n\nIf the ECS is indeed in the lower side of the band, then the concerns are smaller but still significant. Several scientists have called for significant cuts into carbon emissions. Whether the majority of scientists agree with these scientists is not known to me, and therefore it could be important to conduct surveys on not only whether climate change is happening and is majorly manmade, but also on what extent it is manmade, whether they think action should be taken, what they think the consequences of climate change will be, what are their estimates for ECS and so on. \n\nHowever, the IPCC bases its reports on the published scientific research, reviewed by thousands of relevant scientists, and IPCC reports have generally called for significant emission cuts and warned about the effects of climate change, and in many cases it has been suggested that IPCC is being conservative due to the review process generally allowing only for statements that most reviewers find agreeable. The fact is, IPCC itself represents the consensus of scientists.\n\nIf the ECS is indeed around or even below 2C, then we are indeed fortunate, and the fact that climate action is continiously getting delayed will be less punishing. But even in such case, action is rather urgent and there are several other worries calling for lessening dependence on fossil fuels and in general increasing sustainability, such as the mentioned externalities, worries about scarce reserves making their extraction costly and causing significant damage to the economy (which, I believe, is or at least was one of the worries that you share with me), and worries about ocean acidification (which is a related topic that would probably generate a rather interesting discussion).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.11560624837875366,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24705060956709524,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1576788858735708,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3323313674595146,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.35950431766972185,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2496939074729611,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10069622337202115,"solar_1":-0.11274922486494383,"solar_2":-0.12798698766656336,"solar_3":-0.2637172539034509,"solar_4":-0.05293356356681519,"solar_5":-0.05548552611435298,"solar_6":-0.003187004039015543,"solar_7":-0.02388127863741829,"solar_8":-0.023615367580835784,"solar_9":-0.0985951312953451,"solar_10":-0.19587564427759693},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I think they got about half of their total energy from the sun = 375 km or 230 miles per day.\nhttp://www.solarteameindhoven.nl/en/pages/","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.009043379997213682,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20660493112204475,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.37013228978264173,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21913108458631672,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16946839845979866,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20810269692494412,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.012860125862061977,"solar_1":-0.2060371702912904,"solar_2":-0.1990006427036093,"solar_3":-0.16082069485299746,"solar_4":-0.09882032861367286,"solar_5":-0.31172765878000064,"solar_6":-0.0010725010894627,"solar_7":-0.02283820916394082,"solar_8":-0.030690015701111406,"solar_9":-0.18129343529739445,"solar_10":-0.18213800582631892},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

If \"the people\" decide that they want to allow their representatives to vote to drastically reduce the amount of carbon dioxide we emit, then we should do that and deal with whatever consequences that decision brings.  If the consequences are that the economy takes a huge hit, and we become a nation of poor people for a while, then that's what we get.\n\nI've pointed out the dangers of making drastic changes to our energy sources for years.

I'm not responsible for causing the change, I'm merely stating that I won't fight them on it.  If a person decides that he wants to be towed behind a car on an inch of snow, I might well point out that he could very well get hurt doing that.

No thanks to that. \n\nBut as for the question --sure. Anything is possible. The question is not what is possible, the question is what is cheapest. \n\nThe attractive thing about roads is that they seem to be freely available space which is already disturbed. The problem is that the driving surface already has a purpose. The paved driving surface needs to be able to provide a rough, cheap, durable surface for tires to grip. That's not a great mix with solar panels. But there is always the guard rails and center dividers. They're not doing anything most of the time. \n\nBut rooftops are clearly the low hanging fruit. \n\nIt's not like there is a real limitation of space though. The ultimate location for solar is in space. It always has been. Once you get in to space based power, it's no longer even necessary to use photovoltaic. Thermal energy can be harnessed in space to produce effectively unlimited amounts of energy from the perspective of our planet. That doesn't even require PV. Simple mylar films could power terawatt class turbines. You know why a gigawatt is the limit on terrestrial steam turbogenerators? It's because above a gigawatt the turbine rotors are too large to be transported over land. In space you can skip all those limitations we have down here. We couls simply scale the same 19th century technology we've used to get this far to a thousand times larger. Spinning satellites ALA the space station in 2001 A Space Odyssey could act as flywheels storing more energy than the entire planet uses in a thousand years. Free access to a vacuum and zero gravity along with intense radiation and freezing cold on demand? That is an abundance of power resources that we can never begin to approach on earth. That changes the entire dynamics of energy economics. \n\nThere's an unlimted supply of solar energy and space to capture it. We don't need to cover the planet in solar panels. Terrestrial PV is just an interim step to get beyond the rut of the fossil fuel economy and its ties to conventional capitalism. It's not the end game. There is no end game. We have access to unlimited resources. We just need the political will to make it happen.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001553399755115,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3201012499337336,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19596790062165312,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13902948853411146,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.35812287675413673,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1927868199343142,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05466082404988507,"solar_1":-0.04089513847187239,"solar_2":-0.10593096283325816,"solar_3":-0.01564375550454618,"solar_4":-0.0069689936226495774,"solar_5":-0.0056377615765086375,"solar_6":-0.001148288096980347,"solar_7":-0.0009743232464340205,"solar_8":-0.0030073177701221234,"solar_9":-0.04129228702007026,"solar_10":-0.03273349976613341},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for terrestrial solar)\n\n(Note: The author expresses a positive view of solar energy but also emphasizes the need to explore space-based solar as a more promising long-term solution.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

However, I do see some pretty impressive economies of scale on large ground mount projects that push install costs below that of rooftop solar, despite the increased racking + interconnection costs.\n\nBefore the 30% tax credit was uncapped in late 2008, utility scale solar was less than 10% of the market. Now it comprises the majority market share. While one might conclude that utilities prefer large solar project development to avoid industry distruption, it will be interesting to see what happens to the market after the tax credit expires in 2016. \n\nIn my opinion, residential + commercial rooftop solar have explosive growth opportunity, but are being hampered by the following items:\n* lack of mortage financing\n* lack of time-of-day metering\n\nEvery bank refinancing a home with a 30 year mortgage should strongly encourage the home owner to add a solar array into the mix. It increases the home value while leaving the home owner better off financially. But until comparables resale values have been established within a local market, most banks are not allowed to include the cost into a mortgage. As such, this trend is delayed behind market economics by 5-10 years. As an example, we're now starting to see acceptable \"comparables\" emerge in California.\n\nTime-of-day metering should be the primary driver of solar growth in the future. As it stands, most commercial customers are on demand-based metering, which destroys the peak-production value of solar. It seems logical that \"demand based billing structures\" should transition towards time-of-day metering, but utilities might be relunctant to do so if it means they'll see a decline in their revenue (due to solar becoming more valuable). \n\nLikewise, time-of-day metering should be mandatory on grids where smart metering has been installed. But smart grid implementation has been slow and grid deregulation has thrown a wrench into uniform electricity rate structures. Again, I see this transition as inevitable, but it certainly could be moving along faster. The tragedy is that if we had aggressive time-of-day metering, solar would fly off the shelves and we'd likely be able to avoid the necessity for \"cap-and-trade\" type systems to drive solar development.\n\nThat said, there are some advantages to MW-level solar distribution. Utility control is often demonizes in the solar industry, but it's most likely that when a breakthrough comes in energy storage, it will be in a low-energy density solution. Retro-fitting shipping container sized battery banks to MW-level distributed solar arrays, plus intelligent distribution station controls, could provide emergency power to entire communities during power outages - rather than a limited number of wealthy individuals. \n\nThat said, at the 100MW+ level, you're starting to see solar power projects hit grid-parity, due to economies of scale. So perhaps it's best for the environment if we encourage utility-scale development.\n\nThe nice thing about an emerging market is that the whole frontier is wide open for new market applications. I've personally found that \"solar guy\" knowledge offers the most value on larger projects. Billing $100+/hr on a 200kW project design work can actually offer cost savings compared to a turnkey install. It's harder to make those numbers work on a 4kW install.  So there is more professional support at large project levels.\n\nFurthermore, on large projects, you can get into 1000V systems and take advantage of module-level power optimizers + frameless modules in ways that don't make as much economic sense @ the residential level. We're getting into string sizes of 42 modules per string going back to the inverter, vs 13-14 on a typical residential 600V system. \n\nThe #1 way to drop residential sollar install costs is to get architects, buikding engineers, and mainstream residential electrical contractors into the game, allowing solar to be installed just like any other electrical device in the home. This removes speciality labor rates + profit/overhead costs.  I personally focus on helping this transition occur by teaching solar design to these audiences (vs. \"NABCEP\"-style training), and it's been my bread and butter for the past number of years.\n\nWe don't do residential solar in Mississippi because we don't do residential anything else. We're a commercial contractor. However, other companies don't do residential work in MS because we lack net-metering, and can really only connect a solar array if we participate in the local rebate program, which has annual funding shortages. \n\nThe over-arching theme to all of this is that energy policy is the #1 item holding back the growth of the solar market. We're too focused on rebates, specialty contractors, and American-made modules when we should be focused on how to make solar more mainstream. That's in the best interest of everyone! \n\nWhile the lack of policy progress can be frustrating, and I was hoping Obama's DoE would be savvier this regard, keep in mind we're not 4th dimensional creatures. It does take time for policy change to occur. We're in the most rapidly expanding market in the USA. I believe solar will power at least 50% of the USA in the long term, and physical realities prevent us from expanding to that point overnight. Our market could grow 30% per year for the next 15 years, and we'd still only be at 10% solar. The point is that we're getting there, so don't get too frustrated with year-to-year trends or \"set backs\".","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13101798575371504,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09797964988268047,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2090148686298534,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1628888752311468,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15711299283108132,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2428970131563588,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01523583564752092,"solar_1":-0.2518607118455374,"solar_2":-0.2710634159689065,"solar_3":-0.2085170424951565,"solar_4":-0.0419298644634727,"solar_5":-0.033704386728156045,"solar_6":-0.1481433334023071,"solar_7":-0.04328176174021792,"solar_8":-0.22873397627821154,"solar_9":-0.014875349257991388,"solar_10":-0.17132535525091347},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Again I am very appreciative of the effort that Greentech Media puts towards the goals of promoting green alternatives. The world we live in today is very much focused on for-profit approaches towards change and I understand that Greentech Media is trying to work within that framework towards a more sustainable future and that is admirable. \n\nHaving said that, there are those who believe that it is also hopelessly misguided to allow such vital decisions about this transition to be held hostage to the profit motive because ultimately there is a conflict between a society with plenty to go around and one which is dependent upon greed.  Much the way that the notion that buying a fair-trade latte at Starbucks is going to solve the problems of global economic disparity, the belief that for-profit ventures can lead to an abundant and shared future seem misguided.  I believe you may find some sympathy with the notion that there are many diverse approaches to a transition towards a green renweable future and not all of them depend on placing the profit motive at the center. \n\nMuch as Bernie Sanders stepped up with an agenda that was right out of nowhere for many people promising free college, free healthcare for all and giant increases in social security payments which most initially simply dismissed as \"unrealistic\", I am glad to be a voice that calls for nationalizing power distribution systems and placing severe penalties and restrictions on corporate abuses of intellectual property laws which many in the corporate world imagine are their fundamental rights owed to them by their endless efforts at regulatory capture rather than criminal acts of theft from the commons. \n\nThe fact that we have trade tariffs on solar panels from China is an outrageous act of corporate regulatory capture from my perspective but no worse than the prohibition on plug-in grid tie inverters. While I'm happy to cheer for the successes in green renewables that the corporate world is able to achieve I don't buy into the notion that they're acting for the public good because they're not. \n\nI seem to be getting long-winded as usual so I'll cut this short. I was really just trying to say thanks for all the info once again and I may have diluted that message with my inability to avoid taking a few cheap shots at the business community but what I really wanted to emphasize was the \"thank you\" part of the message.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-9.595391020411626e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10994071840632387,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15303526052493663,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2659230650263612,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2935753695307767,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19454227354482023,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2182422520951756,"solar_1":-0.008779965850408189,"solar_2":-0.029155020327986374,"solar_3":-0.013466914253513096,"solar_4":-0.017351521618062787,"solar_5":-0.001904416260610257,"solar_6":-0.0029696659330511466,"solar_7":-0.0006817585963290185,"solar_8":-0.006605274238002797,"solar_9":-0.024152826294690993,"solar_10":-0.15174664618098177},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

If you have Net-Metering/do not have net metering it will affect this. Net-Metering will make it so energy produced in the day is the same as at night. If you do not have net metering then energy used when it is consumed would be favored. Net Metering favors north/south, non-net metering favors east west.\n\n2. Time of use billing. This is similar to the net metering situation. If your utility has higher rates at night, it would be best to offset this with more generation. Time of use billing = favors east/west, non-timeofuse= favors north south.\n\n3. The shading argument they made in the article. I can not personally verify this, but their point was essentially similar to the two above. Apparently in some situations panels oriented east west have less losses due to shadows. Keep in mind this only favors situations LATER in the day. So if you already had time of use or non-net metering this would be an added side benefit to the orientation. (allegedly)\n\n4.  Space constraints. If you have less space, the article argues, #3 could additionally be a benefit because of orientation benefits in regards to shading.\n\nOverall: I do not think ANYONE in their right mind would argue that panels facing north/south would ever generate less than a panel facing east/west. BUT what the article seems to argue is that there is more to value than simply the # of kWh generated by a system but rather the VALUE of those kWh's to the end user","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3722563909832388,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09005437419359623,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20162600662432534,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26408002315328866,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18522944487680584,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22035145447912385,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13213141749535376,"solar_1":-0.1534116260955837,"solar_2":-0.20340714055009282,"solar_3":-0.14267468964479085,"solar_4":-0.039869018914001984,"solar_5":-0.09206572308438478,"solar_6":-0.06846151726252477,"solar_7":-0.13900403090762362,"solar_8":-0.18707124371333825,"solar_9":-0.06527121072372921,"solar_10":-0.1094774942113064},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

At the beginning the powerwall app was showing my production clipping at 3.9kw throughout the day while the enphase app would show peak throughout the day above 6kw.  The installers came back out and added a CT to the gateway for tesla.  Now the production values match almost identically but im noticing my consumption (even when im not home) now seems to increase as production increases.  For instance my pool pump kicks on at 8am tesla will show the house hold consumption at about 2.8kw. And as the sun creeps up and I move to solar only it will show as high as 4kw when I hit peaks of 6kw.  If a cloud moves across the sun and say my production drops to 1.7kw the consumption also drops back to 2.8kw.\n\nAnd this only started after the new ct was put in.

I’ve worked for a few different reputable companies and one that is a pop up company(lasted 3 months there). It all comes down to a few key factors really...\n1. Guarantees . More importantly, manufacturers guarantees. Will they stand behind their products if the install company dissolved before their guarantees? For that, you’ll want to buy panels from the bigger companies that install for known brands. Tesla, LG, Panasonic, Sunpower etc. They cost more, but the product is worth it. \n2. The install company. How long have they been in business? What’s the ranking on the “Top Solar Contractors List”? Google reviews say a lot, but the company will usually have someone dedicated to removing the negative ones. Pick a company that is high on the list and is backed by the manufacturer with a “Platinum Partnership” or something like that. \n3. The price. You get what you pay for. But don’t pay too much. You can install a DIY system for dirt cheap up front, but the long term costs will catch up eventually. You can also pay a premium for a local pop up company that’s just trying to take in the cash before they sell out. A reputable company operating in multiple states that’s high on the contractors list and is offering premium efficiency panels will usually be around $3/watt. If you need an electrical panel or service upgrade, this will add to the cost.  \n\nThe right salesperson will be proud of their company, up front about their profits, and knowledgeable about their products and competition. Or at least have a coworker on hand with years of experience to double check the numbers and sizing. Ask for references, call others that have purchased from them. And if it’s a new and inexperienced salesperson, go with your gut. There are good people in this industry that truly want to help and we all have to get started somewhere. There are also greedy businessmen who don’t know the first thing about solar and are buying in to the industry for the dollar signs. \n\nThis is the only thing I can sell, that I know of, where I can help the planet, help homeowners invest their energy dollars more wisely, and make a decent income to support my family.

This is better than battery storage.\n\nFor example, those of us still on E6 rate plan try to use AC, pool pump, appliances etc. in the early morning and late evening hours, when the sun isn't out. During the mid afternoon, we try to send as much of or solar power back to the grid as possible. This maximizes our rate of return, but is very bad for the grid. Once they move us from E6 to one of the new plans, we will shift our usage to mid afternoons, which will result in less electricity going into the grid during mid afternoon.\n\nThey will also start to transition everyone (including non-solar customers) to time of use rate plans.  This will cause non solar customers to shift their usage to mid day.\n\nEventually Time of Use will be replaced with real time rates based on supply/demand.  If there is too much solar, electricity will $0.05/kwh.  If there is too much demand, price will be $0.80/kwh.

The payback period for a lot of people seems to be nearly a decade, which is near the end of their warranty and useful life. \n\nMy thoughts are that it's really useful for back country and rural people that may have intermittent power during the fire season. That's certainly the case in rural CA in fire prone areas. However, if you want it for utility rate arbitrage then the payback period may be exceptionally long depending on your utility's rate structure and your usage patterns. \n\nI'm a huge nerd, have a Tesla car, and love my Panasonic solar panels. So I'd jump at a PW setup if it made $$ sense, but in my situation it would just be an expensive toy and I'd rather spend that money on something I'd use more, or invest it. \n\nI've heard horror stories about Tesla solar customer service (and some about their car service too), so that was one big deterrent for getting Tesla solar.

They charged accordingly more money, which was fair. Their dealers installed themselves, no subs. Then, over time, the competition crept up on them, and those Silfabs and Hanwha's are just a tad behind SP in efficiency (depending on exactly which panel and which series, say the 20-21% range). Their prices did not go up significantly, but more important, SP's did not come down. \n\nKind of the same story with warranties, 25 years being the magic number. SP was there first, but over time the comp got better, and bumped theirs to 25 years as well. Warranties have 2 components - basically hardware manufacturing defects and \"performance\" (ie, ouput). Manufacturing defects show up rather quickly and are replaced, theyre few and far between for the most part. Performance depends on the \"degradation rate\" - panels lose their efficiency over time, just like your cell phone battery. Solar companies will typically say, \"in year 10, we will still be a minimum X%, or after 25 years, we'll be at a minimum of Y%\". Usually measured annually, or every 2 years. If there's a small deficit they'll make it up in cash. I guess if it gets too large, the panel could be declared defective, and replaced.\n\nPanel manufacturers have to make a big deal about efficiency and degradation, because there's not many other ways to differentiate them, they can't exactly claim to have the shiniest panels lol!\n\nTop panels for degradation fall into ranges; around .3%, then it goes to .5%, then to the .7%. Don't go any higher than that, like to 1%, they're typically polycrystallines and lower quality. SP's are in the .3% group, LG too, and REC. Hanwha's and Silfabs in the .5%. (Remember these are PERCENTAGES, so .5% = .005. So if you make 10,000kwh year 1, next year you'll make 10000 x .005 = 50kwh less (9,950). If you pay .20 kwh from the utility, that's 50 x .20 = $10 lost to degradation.\n\nThe difference between a .3% and .5% panel is going to be about $4, in degradation losses. About half the price of a quarter pounder w bacon and cheese meal.\n\nDoes it make sense to pay thousands of dollars more for a few dollars of benefit per year? \n\nSP now has different sales channels allowing non-installation dealers (sales only, a subcontractor installs). \n\nI myself left to work for a reliable local dealer/installer who offers multiple panel brands at different price points. I don't dislike SP, it's just a very high end competitor. Like if you're buying a car - some people have to have a Mercedes, others are fine driving a Lexus.\n\nSorry I got long there...in short, if your utility charges by the amount of electricity you use (tiered), as opposed to time of day, you're better off with a generator now. Half to 3/4 of the price of a 10kw battery and can handle bigger loads (your whole house) for basically forever, if you have a natural gas feed. Batteries cannot do that today. Tomorrow, maybe. \n\nSolar installers are not accountants. Check with an accountant or CPA who knows a little about solar for the tax credits. Its supposed to be items required for the solar system to work (\"site prep\") - cutting down trees, upgrading the panel box, etc. Roofs are usually claimed if they need replacement. Other stuff...ask a qualified person. What if you try to claim and the IRS says no? You can't exactly say, \"but my solar guy said it was ok....\". The IRS will smile and say, that's nice, but they're wrong. End of story.\n\nIdk about insurance in Florida, sorry.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-5.7495179741332926e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.0559967356892912,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21716952634354433,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.044681161642074585,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3737775354958204,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1805564298639375,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08203392250773807,"solar_1":-0.2132110606252488,"solar_2":-0.027818843453133013,"solar_3":-0.2657182242883559,"solar_4":-0.18088098349350426,"solar_5":-0.0013082426485198084,"solar_6":-0.152811960108617,"solar_7":-0.1061317412313656,"solar_8":-0.026916913549333305,"solar_9":-0.05270117834962207,"solar_10":-0.17954430919053266},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (The reference group is not explicitly stated as a personal group in the text.)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

It wasn't that they were dead - generally - it's that the power density wasn't great for a car and in part due to the conditions a car was under while using them. Pull them out, removing the actually bad parts/cells (if possible?) and use the remaining bits for their powerwall-like offerings.\n\nExcept that although there were swapouts, it wasn't enough to make happen. Like any recycling &amp; reuse you need to hit a certain quantity for economies of scale to kick in and I don't think it did.\n\nSo yeah, it sucks if it's your car that dies, just as anything you own failing when the overall reliability is high.

No controller, battery or anything special.  Just 2 solar panels in series to get the voltage up above 24 volts and direct connected to the pump wires.  It's a portable set up to provide garden hose amounts of water at a distance from the water source.  It works fantastic.  It is not an engineered solution though and there could be frailties with the system such as burning up the pump motor during times when the solar production voltage is lower than what the pump needs to function correctly.  There is also a potential to burn out the pump with over voltage when the panels produce higher voltage than the pump operating voltage range.  So far with occasional use it has performed quite well.  I think the most important thing when building a non standard setup is to monitor it or control it in a way that it can't go in to a failure mode without someone noticing immediately.

Smoked paprika is amazing - it gives food a wonderful smoky, meaty, savory flavor. Meanwhile, throw some baking potatoes in the oven. You can top them with chives, vegan butter (Earth Balance is a good brand), vegan sour cream (Tofutti makes a nice version), salt, and pepper. Or, do mashed potatoes. Start diced potatoes (peeled, or not) in cold, salted water, boil until they're fork-tender. Mash them up with Earth Balance, soymilk, salt, pepper, and vegan cheese (if you want). Keep the potatoes warm. Grill your mushrooms, or broil or pan-roast them if you don't have a grill. Prepare a simple green vegetable, like steamed broccoli, top it with lemon juice and vegan butter. Vegan dinner rolls are not too hard to find, pre-made. You can mix some softened Earth Balance with a little agave nectar for a \"honey butter\", or with maple syrup, for a maple-flavored butter.

Even the [UN reports](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20772&amp;Cr=global&amp;Cr1=environment) how it takes up too much land and resources, fueling global warming more than transportation, and recommends everyone make a switch to a plant-based diet.  \n\nLet the real hunters who don't need the technological help of weapons do the hunting.  Give the whole boar hunt gig a try with just your massive canines and sharp claws.  And, let the lions, tigers, and bears do the population control, our role in which is only necessary because humans have royally fucked up the delicate balance of life.  Hunting is immoral because we don't need the meat to survive so we therefore take the lives of others unnecessarily.  Taking the life of another being is always immoral, but if it is absolutely necessary then it may become morally excusable.  Yet, most humans are a far cry from living in a morally excusable situation that would justify killing another human or nonhuman for food.\n\nAnd, who says a human's life is worth far more than a non-human animal's life?

So I get there, and the working chef prepares me... *a fruit bowl.* Granted, it was a nice fruit bowl, and very well plated, and since I wasn't paying for it anyway I just sort of shrugged off the lack of pancakes, thanked the waitstaff and didn't mention further (ain't their fault, they just deliver it) and dug in.

And I couldn't. I found tons of (frankly bullshit) projections of how bee's would think, feel and such but they don't. Just like bacteria does not, or plants do. So that is my first concern.*\n\nTo be honest, I mostly avoid honey in the name of being consistent. It's certainly the thing that would worry me least if I ate some accidentally. And I think emotive language like 'enslavement' is really unhelpful, and disrespectful. But I do think that bees (or rather, hives - because a hive is almost a living thing in its own right) are fascinatingly complex, and certainly come closer to 'feeling' than do bacteria and plants.\n\n*My second question is why arguments like \"some bees die during the process\" is a factor... How many insects do you not think die from the harvesting of vegetables? To me this is a fallacy argument.*\n\nThat's irrelevant. In harvesting honey, we're killing bees in the process of taking what was intended for their own use. In the death of insects, small field creatures etc, during harvesting, they are truly incidental to the purpose of what's happening. (It's also worth noting that the death of small mammals during harvest is greatly overstated - they basically run away)\n\n*\"Bacteria is not animals!\", well that depends on the view, if you go down to basics of plant-cells, animal-cells and fungus-cells a lot of them are. Are amaobas considered animals? What about colonies of bacteria?*\n\nBacteria are not animals. Plants are not animals. Single-celled organisms are not animals. They cannot suffer. They cannot experience happiness. They cannot form family bonds. And even if they *could*, by eating as low down the food chain as possible, I'm still minimising suffering. I have to eat. I don't want to starve to death. If plants can suffer and I eat only plants, that's still better than an animal eating a plant (which suffered) and then me eating the animal (which suffered).\n\n*If it is the moral aspect of using a species for ones own gain, well as I said above if that relationship benifits both species why is this wrong?*\n\nThis is too simplistic. There is no mutual benefit. Chillis being cultivated for their heat over centuries is not the same as an individual cow being bred for slaughter over a period of weeks. I do not subscribe for one moment to the 'but at least it lived!' argument, I'm afraid. You could argue that domesticated pets like cats and dogs fulfil mutual benefit, but we don't kill and eat those. (And boy howdy, do people get upset when you do!)\n\n*Fifth question. Who is the moral judge to define where feelings are measured, or pain?*\n\nIt's not about pain, it's about suffering. Pain is a response to stimulus. People like to point to, say, ferns that curl up when touched and say 'they can feel pain, therefore I can eat bacon'. But a plant can't *suffer*. A plant can't remember pain. A plant doesn't scream when you take away a cutting from it to put it another pot. Animals can *remember* what caused them pain. They will shy away in fear. An instantaneous response to stimulus is not the same as the ability to experience *ongoing* pain and form mental connections about what caused it.\n\n*But, back to the question at hand; In these cases of vegan-ism and the blurry edges of what is \"animal\", \"abuse\" or \"mutually beneficial\" who gets to say which side is right? I mean there's no vegan supreme court is there?*\n\nYou have to be the judge of your own actions. Of course there's no moral oracle in the sky telling us what's right or wrong. You're clearly really hung up on the idea of honey (idk, maybe you just love it that much), and it's perhaps more of an edge case than say, milk. I avoid honey, as I said, to be consistent, and because I'd rather err on the side of caution. Other people don't. That's ok.\n\n\n*I still fully agree that no animal should ever be brought up in any environment other than one that will give it a full opportunity to express it's full animistic-behavior.*\n\nI know that this wasn't a question, but I still have to comment. No farmed animal can express its full behaviour for the simple reason that they're all killed way earlier than their natural life span. Obviously free range (actual, genuine, in a field and daylight free range) is better than battery farms and gigantic feedlots. But it's not good *enough*. Free range dairy cows are still forcibly impregnated and have their calves taken and killed. Free range egg-laying chickens still get slaughtered once they stop laying (and any male chicks are still thrown in a chipper as soon as they hatch). A free range happy pig that had straw and a barn still gets taken to the same slaughterhouse with the same inadequate stunning and is still killed for the simple pleasure of people who want to eat it.\n\n*So in a sense it'd be okay to let all the billion livestock die out? I'm not saying it isn't... I'm just curious. *\n\nOf course it is. I mean, they wouldn't. Even if the entire planet were vegan, I'm sure there'd still be a few cows and pigs kept as companion animals. Maybe some would 'go wild' and adapt. But as I said before, I don't believe that life is automatically better than 'not-life', and I don't think that farm animals existing is a good in and of itself.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.011501981178298593,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3545519990252746,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1947282888308087,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.029726130266984303,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32746979611138594,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2840572545596587,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07622338976458802,"diet_1":-0.2594381556264125,"diet_2":-0.2166495148305856,"diet_3":-0.07728235054800431,"diet_4":-0.06601757794608905,"diet_5":-0.0384576095718027,"diet_6":-0.017721500181626954,"diet_8":-0.03936127568340453,"diet_9":-0.11069115944458947,"diet_10":-0.32387383704432676,"diet_11":-0.20186806685453007,"diet_13":-0.038494335974367765,"diet_14":-0.23408996126310236,"diet_17":-0.034676877079012534},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

This means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. So it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior.\nThe argument for modeling human behavior on non-human behavior is unclear to begin with, but if we're going to make it, why shouldn't we choose to follow the example of the hippopotamus, ox or giraffe rather than the shark, cheetah or bear? Why not compare ourselves to crows and eat raw carrion by the side of the road? Why not compare ourselves to dung beetles and eat little balls of dried feces? Because it turns out humans really are a special case in the animal kingdom, that's why. So are vultures, goats, elephants and crickets. Each is an individual species with individual needs and capacities for choice. Of course, humans are capable of higher reasoning, but this should only make us more sensitive to the morality of our behavior toward non-human animals. And while we are capable of killing and eating them, it isn't necessary for our survival. We aren't lions, and we know that we cannot justify taking the life of a sentient being for no better reason than our personal dietary preferences)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.011140854524758955,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22407186583100014,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24489883227313036,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.038978003586332,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.25491192118879635,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3559890299738686,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006167143056093967,"diet_1":-0.0070368702193566906,"diet_2":-0.010443933463342603,"diet_3":-0.017471346771342173,"diet_4":-0.003975996123093258,"diet_5":-0.005429521935487476,"diet_6":-0.005348111350031104,"diet_8":-0.003368124733242439,"diet_9":-0.0018834944178986273,"diet_10":-0.0031411713183212933,"diet_11":-0.005395924408124604,"diet_13":-0.0017927664060432373,"diet_14":-0.02580673430444828,"diet_17":-0.003000635437880798},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I’m sorry. I went to a barbecue place once with work people.  (Think chipotle with barbecue). It had a vegan option that was really good.

Still I want my girlfriend to try it so I ordered take out the next day.  I made a point to say vegan a number of times (you know a little extra with it - not crazy extra thought) I got it and took a bit and immediately knew it wasn’t vegan.  I didn’t eat it but it messed me up. I felt a bit violated or something - which was weird because I don’t think of myself that way - and I realize I live in a meat eating world.  I never went back. \n\nI prefer vegan restaurants but it’s not always reasonable.  Today for example I ate at a TGI Fridays in an airport.  I figured they’d screw my modifications up or something but they didn’t (or at least I don’t think they did). \n\nAnother time I ordered Uber eats from a place called “Vegan Indian”.  It ended up being really expensive.  Like $80-$90. It was my fault because they had a number of Indian dishes I don’t usually see as vegan.  Naan for example.   Something came with cream sauce that I didn’t see online and I became suspicious.  I googled the address and called an Indian restaurant at the location of “Vegan Indian”. The guy on the phone was honest.  Basically nothing he sent was vegan and he didn’t know why it was on Uber Eats as a place called “Vegan Indian”.  That one irritated me too and was kind of recent. \n\nI’m sorry this happened to you.  It’s regrettably the way it is.

Like anything in a relationship, it's about making sacrifices for each other and finding compromise. When I first went vegan, our deal was that I wouldn't purchase or cook meat (we had separate bank accounts and weren't married back then), and that I didn't want it cooked in the pots/pans I cooked the rest of our food in. So for a while we had a \"meat pan,\" which was a small skillet he used to cook chicken occasionally. But I do all the shopping and 90% of the cooking (I love to cook), so naturally, there wasn't much meat around unless he went out of his way to get it, which he did in the beginning, but stopped entirely. \n\nOver the years his animal consumption has pretty much just naturally plummeted. When one person eats differently, you kind of just adapt. I also have celiac disease, so it was a similar transition. \n\nWhen we moved into our new house last year we agreed on a meatless kitchen except for takeout in its own container. Now he barely even gets it in his takeout. I've noticed he orders non-dairy milk in his coffee now, too, and if he runs to the store for odds and ends, he buys vegan feta for his bagels. I've never insisted upon that - he just started doing it. Over time, he agreed he just feels better without it. If we go out to eat or if he orders pizza, he'll order something with meat. And I'm genuinely okay with that knowing that his consumption is a fraction of what it used to be. It's a big stride, in my eyes, and it's enough for me. \n\nIn short, it's all about acceptance. He needs to learn to accept your new lifestyle, but you also have to accept his in turn. Find a compromise that works for both of you - like no meat in the house but he can order it at a restaurant, for example. Nobody's ever going to flip a dramatic switch like that just because their partner tells them they should. That decision comes with time and experience for a lot of people.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.012126232807834944,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2903048462129537,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1591039333548799,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2747569792179975,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1494052872061033,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15743568567134109,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11884413131823142,"diet_1":-0.12019379571324862,"diet_2":-0.2029186689275472,"diet_3":-0.19776457594909402,"diet_4":-0.18442415372495588,"diet_5":-0.27318662976761565,"diet_6":-0.09071567028805777,"diet_8":-0.008997081379372199,"diet_9":-0.02546969338679143,"diet_10":-0.10392578010794296,"diet_11":-0.017757354202331044,"diet_13":-0.28156691195908934,"diet_14":-0.21194710186682642,"diet_17":-0.13109382584799598},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

It is also possible that it is caused by addiction to the feel-good hormones released by the body when meat and dairy is ingested as the body \"knows\" that these substances are harmful and tries to deal with this by flooding the body with feel-good hormones.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.009043984968836108,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15990215122073864,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17698264580739853,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33382904340095615,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15596111510727914,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2777649225654699,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3183343935913096,"diet_1":-0.019246008164676216,"diet_2":-0.009709923147359708,"diet_3":-0.0073407825887746485,"diet_4":-0.011002754070432275,"diet_5":-0.01278190341690788,"diet_6":-0.018935638552648015,"diet_8":-0.0005061421664625717,"diet_9":-0.0004692488982982468,"diet_10":-0.001132211367803393,"diet_11":-0.00012177280162480504,"diet_13":-0.0009545115814641273,"diet_14":-0.11952645497998067,"diet_17":-0.0001778540960610068},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
