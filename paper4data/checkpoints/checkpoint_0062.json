We need 200+ miles in real world. Not 200 miles in ‘AC off, driving on flat road’ mode.”\n\nSo Tesla will certainly use optimal numbers (until the EPA gives their rating, as you're essentially forbidden from advertising otherwise), but I don't think it's apples to apples when comparing the Bolt's 200 mile range to the Model 3, at least not until we hear otherwise.",

Yes gas is currently cheap, but has electricity gone up in price? I remember reading an article that said the electric companies really need electric cars to take off. The reasoning was that demand for electricity is dropping due to more efficient consumer electronics, while the cost to maintain transmission lines continues to rise with inflation. My Google-fu isn't that strong so if anybody can find that article I would appreciate it. \n\nBack to the Financial Post, it only cites one source for the drop in EV sales. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-06/plug-in-electric-vehicles-left-behind-in-u-s-autos-record-year\nBloomberg looked at the past three years. ~95k in 2013, ~120k in 2014, ~105k in 2015. They just compared the last two years. That's not a trend, that's not nearly enough data. Both articles are based off of two data points.",

The 60 KWh tesla has the same container as the 70/85/90, so there is empty space in it. I doubt that the 60 KWh bolt has empty space for more cells. \n\nSecond of all, the 70D weighs 11 lbs more than the 60D which means you should be comparing the bolts: 16 pounds per KWh (960/60) to tesla's 70: 16.22 pounds per KWh or to be fair with the packaging overhead the 85 KWh battery has 14.1 pounds per KWh, and guessing at the weight of the 90 KWh as being a little more than the 85 it comes to 13.5 Pounds per KWh (assuming a 1215 lb battery, the 70 kwh is 11 pounds more than the 60 so the 15 is a conservative guess).",

The credits have improved in my state, a new leaf is $12k after taxes and credits. So now the car that is 4 years old is worth maybe $5k because the new leaf is so cheap. And if your going to spend more, the bolt has twice the range for a little more.\n\nSimilarly, I got my gen2 volt specifically because I can commute all electric and can't with the gen1.

It's a compliance car. \n\n&gt; In 2015, Chevrolet sold just under 220,000 vehicles in California. To avoid penalties imposed by CARB, Chevy needs about 31,000 zero emissions vehicle credits or 14% of total sales. Being a battery electric car, each Chevy Bolt sold counts as 4 credits. The Chevy Volt with its range extender combustion engine earns 2 credits for every sale. To satisfy CARB, Bloomberg says Chevrolet must sell 10,082 Bolts or 7,698 Volts.\n\nhttp://gas2.org/2016/12/01/gm-lose-chevy-bolt-other-models/",

Whether they can make it work in practice with mass market stress shall be seen.\n\nOnce one starts to get to large enough numbers stuff like finding enough space to put chargers in, finding enough electrical grid or other electricity source capacity, suitable locations etc.\n\nWhen this goes from early adopters to mass market, scale is so freaking different.\n\nActually it might be benefit not to run the exclusive standard. The generic standard will in mass market have multiple overlapping network and due to multitude of operators can adapt and optimize way faster than single organization.\n\nThere want be a single unified network, but if there is agreement on open charging standard then one has multitude of operator networks to take advantage.\n\nTesla was best in early adopting, since there wasn't mass market scale to support multitude of independent charging operators. So having a single minded specialist like Tesla was optimal. The charger network was enabler for Tesla.\n\nWhen situation goes to mass market, multitude of operators combined will quickly catch up to Tesla to provide similar overall coverage. Just not in single unified payment account network. As long as car makers can in practice agree to a non exclusive open standard.",

They’re not going to say it’s aiming for the high-end Civic/Accord, even if that’s probably closer to reality from a “premium” standpoint.\n\nAs far as the Bolt, I’m not sure what you’re getting at. It’s not premium like the Jag or Model X and it’s not even trying to be a crossover, despite being basically an electric Trax and the extremely low bar for what qualifies as a crossover these days (Nero, Kona, Soul, GLA).",

Also that Nissan outsells them, Germany is going to start trying and will steamroll them, and that the Chinese are so furious about a recent price cut that the brand is suffering in the largest market. Recent price cuts meant that they were struggling to find a market and the recent price rise means that their CEO is unfit.\n\nI learned that SpaceX whines about competitive contracts, that the satellite launch market is slowing down, and that their Starship might struggle to find a place in the evolution of space progress that NASA plans with their lunar orbiting space station. \n\nThe Boring company had to make various concessions on their initial design such that the current method of use is questionable and they also have lost permission to bore through their next location. \n\nSolar City seems to be stagnating and may struggle to be cost competitive. \n\nThe Hyperloop is impossible. \n\n.....\nBut from the outside when I was just checking in for the rocket launches and Tesla models everything looked a lot cozier because they are pushing things forward.",

"comment": "Yes... We know.  You're clearly Tesla's most active promoter in this subreddit.\n\nNo, Tesla is not the class leader in all respects, and their technology and spec advantages have continuously shrunk over the past couple of years.  For example, the model Y isn't even the class leader in real world range.  That honor goes to the Mach-e at a lower price point.\n\nYou think there's no difference between $15k? 😂. That's about $266 per month for 60 months at 2.5% interest.  Not to mention about $900 more in taxes. In the US, a base ID.4 is $20k cheaper than a base Y, so it's even more savings per month.   It isn't like owning a Y is saving much money by being more efficient.  A few bucks a month at best.  Literally.  Probably less than $5 a month versus other EVs.\n\nAh yes, model Y can seat 7.  What's that option cost?  $3k?  Something like the Pacifica hybrid likely does it more comfortably for a much lower price.\n\nWant a color other than white on that Tesla?  That'll be $1k-$2k.  White interior? \nAnother $1k.  Tow hitch.  $1k.   Don't forget to include the cost of the paint protection film that's basically a requirement on the Tesla's front end.\n\nSpeed?  Cool.  A lot of EV owners cruise at the speed limit to maximize efficiency.  Most EVs are snappy 0-30, so feel properly fast. I don't think the majority of people expect their daily car ride to feel like a rollercoaster ride.  Turning radius and cabin noise are often more valuable day to day driving commodities than 0-60 time, but you'll rarely see those specs make the headlines.  \n \nCharging... you mean Tesla's selfish closed fueling network that does nothing to promote the future of electrification from all companies... even though much of that network is subsidized with public dollars.  Heaven forbid it be a public network.",

But we can't make them fast enough.\n\nWe have decades to build the infrastructure. \n\nWe can do this cheaply, too. Cost of solar and wind and batteries is dropping. We can make electricity cheaply and conveniently pretty much everywhere. We don't need tankers and pipelines and trucks carrying fuel across the nation.\n\nAt the macro level it matters not if you buy an EV now or later when your house is ready, someone else will buy it.\n\nAt the micro level, do the math on how many amps you really need for charging. If 110V is enough 99% of the time, and you have three days a year where you need to charge elsewhere that's still a lot better than driving to the gas stations station every other week.\n\n(110V charging: 8h/day x 4 miles per hour x 7 days = 200 miles a week. If you drive that much, you need to get gas every other week. If you drive more, you spend s lot of money on gas...)\n\nThere may be options to make it work safely and code compliant that doesn't require a panel upgrade.

The more EVs they sell that raise the average, the more average-lowering high-profit SUVs and trucks they can sell without penalty. I suspect the heavy Leaf discounts at the end of last year was just the way to justify the high sales of their Rogue SUVs! :)\n\nIn addition, in the USA, car manufacturers can buy and sell mileage credits from each other to avoid these fines.

They were beaten by factory workers working together into submission.\n\nAs far as an affordable EV hey I feel you- unfortunately you are right for the time being. Not many choices.  But I would personally choose to pay a little more to support other companies.  GM received millions from tax payers to fund the development of EV vehicles - before 2008!!  Then they let the technology just rot while they developed gas guzzlers.  Then they took a huge bailout because their cars didn’t sell.\n\nNow VW and Tesla and Ford  ( probably even others like Canoo ) have all announced EVs coming under 30k.\n\nLike I said - to each their own though.  I’m in the US and GM pisses me off because we paid to rescue a company that can’t make ends meet.  Any other company that couldn’t was left at the way side.  Mom and pop businesses go under every single day here-  but GM was “too big to fail”.  Everyone that bought GM stock lost everything.  They even dumped their ticker on the stock exchanges and Relisted!!  The stock holders got nothing- but GM got a huge bailout.",

The real advantages ecologically is disruption of the highly inefficient oil/gas refiney and distribution system.\n\nI did my own causal averaging - take it or leave it, but roughly every 4000ish BEVs sold is the equivalent of removing one tanker truck delivering fuel to the gas station.  It's probably fewer EVs actually, lots of different sized tankers and I averaged the two most common sizes, and there are multiple truck/ship rides for oil/gas throughout the process.",

It really should not be a question at this point as to whether or not it exists… it does and scientists know what’s going to happen if we do not (attempt to) slow it down. And let me tell you, as an environmental scientist who’s job is planning how to adapt to climate change, it’s scary af. Now, can we stop climate change? Absolutely not, there’s no stopping it, the only solution is adaptation. \n\nThe other part is, and it’s kind of funny, is that most people who do not believe in climate change will likely not experience the effects of it. Yes, it will still snow (even in Texas) because weather and climate, are related but they are not the same. With climate change, we will see a few things a) more forest fires b) less storm events but at a higher magnitude (flash flooding type storms), c) rainforests along the equator will turn into desert and then progress north and south with time. \n\nAnd finally, all this bullshit about electric vehicles and zero emissions is a scam and zero emissions just doesn’t exist. And just because the vehicle has no emissions does not mean that emissions were not emitted during the creation of the vehicle or the electric that fueled it. My advice is to listen to the ACTUAL environmental scientists, not activists and politicians, on how to be ‘environmentally friendly’. There are more imminent dangers than climate change.",

The 2023 version of that car has almost twice as big a battery and twice the electric range, so should easily beat the 2019 utilization value. \n\n&gt;The 60% is the volt which was discontinued 4 years ago. The Volt and the I3 are by far the best examples of PHEVs. \n\nIt's a shame the Volt was discontinued, but today's best PHEVs have similar or larger batteries and comparable electric range. The BMW i3 was ugly and probably didn't meet customer expectations for performance, so no big surprise that got discontinued. \n\n&gt;No one is building large battery PHEVs anymore.\n\nThe new Mercedes GLC has a larger battery than the original Nissan Leaf, and PHEV battery sizes are generally increasing across the board. Studies (including the one referenced here) show that EV utilization tends to increase with larger battery sizes. \n\n&gt;Gas prices are low now. It's $2.70/gallon where I am right now.\n\nTrue for now, but that's still more expensive per mile than electricity depending on where you live and what PHEVs are involved. \n\n&gt;There should be no tax credits for batteries below say 150 miles of EPA range but not stuck on that number. \n\nThat's excessive because ~90% of all car trips are less than 20 miles, and 95% less than 30 miles:\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1042-august-13-2018-2017-nearly-60-all-vehicle-trips-were-less-six-miles\n\nSo building more PHEVs with 20+ miles of electric range could put a big dent in emissions, using significantly less batteries than trying to build the same number of BEVs. Plus if someone buys a PHEV who would otherwise have bought a regular ICE vehicle, and uses it as intended, that's definitely a win. \n\n&gt;[Higher gas taxes] Never going to happen. It's also very regressive.\n\nTax breaks on car purchases are also regressive, because people with lower incomes can't take full advantage of them (except by leasing). But it's also silly to put an income cap on EV tax credits if we want people to buy EVs instead of ICE - people with money are the ones who can afford $50-100+k for a new EV. \n\nLong run PHEVs will mostly get phased out for several reasons, so this whole discussion will be moot soon enough.",

Even just imagine the same output but split into dual 108hp motors or simply powering the rear with the same 215hp unit. That's would bring me back to MINI.\n\nHaving owned and F56BEV I could never go back to essentially the same configuration. Having moved on to AWD and RWD EVs I can feel how much FWD left on the table. We also see conservative safety focused brand like Volvo making the switch. There is no reason a more daring brand like MINI can't consider it too.",

"comment": "Alright cool!\n\nIt looks like Durango has great summer generation.  To begin with you'll be wanting to implement a summer orientation for you panels.  This means having your panels more flat than angled.  (The sun is higher in the summer and lower in the winter).  Generally, when we want to maximize for summer we do Latitude - 15 degrees.  (Latitude +15 degrees for winter optimization)\n\nThe Latitude for Durango is about 37 degrees.  So you will want to orientate your panels at about 22 degrees to get the most out of your summer months.\n\nDurango is a Zone 3 solar area.  This means you get 5 good hours of sunlight (per day) on average throughout the year.\n\nLet's estimate your usage at 1000 kwhr/month, you can always add more later!  So we have ~30 days in a month which gives us 1000kwhr/30 days to get our daily required generation.\n\nTo just about meet your usage you would need to generate 33.33 kwhr per day.\n\nGiven 5 good hours of sunlight each day, we get 33.33 kwhr/5hr = 6.66 kW.  This is the size of the solar system you should be implementing.\n\nI say round up to 7kW.  \n\nAre you looking to do this system yourself, or will you be contacting a local installer?\n\nI can find you some battery packs and inverters.  Keep in you can get your own panels @ about 80 cents per watt if you buy in bulk from a site like wholesalesolar or similar sites.\n\nSolar panels are now one of the cheapest parts.  Inverters and batteries will you run up your bill significantly.  If you do it yourself I recommend unirac racks, they have a nice tool to match any panel type you find and will help you order the correct rack for about 1500 dollars.\n\nI'd estimate an installation like this will run you close to 27000.  Batteries are extremely expensive.  Are blackouts common in your area?\n\nI'm not a solar expert so my numbers may be somewhat skewed.  Feel free to ask me any questions, and I will answer you to the best of my ability.",

It's much easier for energy planners to oversize baseload generation, store the excess, and offload during the day than it is to install tens of thousands windmills, millions of solar panels, and the storage needed to make them viable.\n\n&gt;People are already using these on personal levels on yachts.\n\nSure.  Is it best for society for solar power to be affordable only to the ultra-rich?\n\n&gt;If it's the only possible solution then yeah.\n\nI noted funding fusion right after that.  We need breeders first, then fusion.  Lest you think this is a pipe dream, Russia is building their third commercial breeder reactor as we speak and the Chinese Academy of Sciences has 400 PhDs working on breeders.  They expect to have their first test reactor online in six years and commercial reactors being built by 2030.",

"comment": "Let us consider only solar panel price. It may be possible that you are slightly mislead by reports of panel prices as low as $0.70 per W. In reality this would be sell price from the lowest cost manufacturer who is more than willing to sell panels to buyers interested in multiple container loads. So if you have a home and would like to install a system you need to buy solar panels from your local supplier of panels who bought a container load of panels, maybe around $150,000 worth. They need to cover their costs which include space to store them and financing until you decide to buy them. A properly run business will mark up 30% to 50% and would bring your cost to $1.16. Well your local installer of solar panels, probably does not have a couple $100k kicking around and enough space to store that many panels in the hopes you will decide to buy, so he will go to a company that deals directly in buying and selling solar panels. They have a big warehouse with millions of $ in solar panels. So now you are 3rd buyer, your local supplier is now buying at $1.10 - $1.20 from them and putting their mark up of 40% bringing your cost to $1.94. This is just for the lowest cost panels possible, but you want the better ones and they will have a sell price of $2.50 - $4.50 for you. What sort of quotes are you receiving for a full system installed that seems unreasonable?",

"comment": "What is your background?\n\nYou're going to need an electrical license to install and maintain solar equipment. You can't just take a course, you'll need actual licensing, and that'll require apprenticeship under a licensed electrician most likely. You're also going to need a GC for permit pulling, drawings, etc when dealing with residential and an engineer when designing systems on large (commercial) rooftops. Or if you're doing ground mounted systems, there will likely be environmental assessments and/or studies needed.\n\nThe short version is - solar's awesome. But there's more to it than taking a class to learn wiring and climbing up on someone's roof to put on Panels. But if you're that enthusiastic, go talk to a solar installer, maybe they have a job for you so you can learn hands on?",

"comment": "What state/electric company (you might want to PM me this info as there are privacy requirements in this sub)? I ask because I want to verify your ROI relative to state incentives, net metering laws, etc. 10 years with no incentive means pretty decent sunlight based upon your system size (which guides pricing).\n\nIt looks like you don't believe there are many efficiency gains to be had per the conversations on this page. Like /u/mtgkoby said, knock off the cheap stuff first - like efficiency, then move onto the high capital solar electricity.\n\nDo you have a 365 day - 15 minute - energy usage spreadsheet? They're going to show you the amount of demand you have during the whole of the year so we can better understand how to size a system to maximize benefit.\n\nYou're not going to get 500kW/acre because you'll want to angle you panels to 30 degrees to gain a greater efficiency level as land is cheap. On rooftops, where space is expensive, you take whatever angle they give you. On the ground, where hardware costs a little more but space is plentiful, you go 30 degrees. You said land is large - I'm going to ask for 12 acres to get you the best ROI I can. Don't forget - I'll need to connect this land to the electrical equipment, so please pick the space strategically as 'land development' costs can bite (unless you've got a lot of equipment/operators for free).\n\nedit - this post needs editing...later\n\nIt seems as though you need about 1.3-1.8MW of PV (depends on location) to bring your kWh to zero. Properly sized batteries could what at the demand charge. You'd probably not want to go off grid - specifically because the odds are low that your electric company will pay you for a long list of energy storage services. However, depending on your needs - off grid can happen, but your 10 year ROI will be different.",

I can't see it replacing our current vehicle fleet due to the total amount of energy. \n\nWithout knowing the answer I wonder what area of solar panels or wind mills would be needed.

Electric cars will place huge demands on our grids of the future, which will hopefully be powered by intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar. Dosent it make sense to use stationary EVs to power the demands of the grid? \n\nThe cars could be programmed not to discharge below 50-60% and not to over charge past 80% or so this would minimise battery degredation while still allowing spontaneous use of the vehicle. This could be manually controled in an app when one wished to have a fully charged battery for a long trip.",

That the industry has grown 800% in 5 years thanks to the state's programs, etc., etc.\n\nIf you drill down into the details, distributed solar has benefited a lot from local incentives and the statewide program, NY-Sun. Until the program adjusted it in the last year, the course the state was on created an environment where high income homes were taking advantage of it at a much higher rate than anywhere else in the country. A lot of that has to do with the number of high income households in the downstate NY area, for starters. Now there are specific incentives for lower income and for community solar, although community solar has been very, very slow to catch on.",

"comment": "Yeah, I have a friend that had some huge insulation problems, (easily solved) that pushed his electric bill up so high that his system was going to cost $23,000 before credits. He insulated and got it down to a $15,000 system and his house is more comfortable.\n\nAttic insulation is cheap. Windows can be expensive. If your's are double pane and you replace with double pane you won't save much. If you have a 35 year old AC system it's probably ready to be replaced. $5000. Always go from cheapest to more expensive.\n\nBut then you have to think that the federal solar tax credit will start to be phased out soon (just when we need it the most) so those numbers have to be added to the mix. I would say spend the money but allocate how all that money will be used most efficiently. The world needs more solar production. It takes some math. and Vote!",

"comment": "I cannot disagree with the interior styling. I was looking at the Outlander OHEV which arrived in my city yesterday (as a tide over SUV until the Audi ETron Quattro is released) and I just looked at how it doesn’t offer the full benefits of a BEV when it comes to the minimal maintenance side of things. \n\nAs for Chevy’s MyLink: fuck it. Just use android auto (or CarPlay in my case). No need to really mess with it. Although they have provided a really great page on power consumption. \n\nI think if you look at it on paper, it feels like they had to cut some corners (interior materials) to keep it at that price. At the end of the day, I would rather have the option to start at a lower price for all the features I need, than be forced to pay a premium for plus interior features I like but don’t need. \n\nExample: the Audi eTron Quattro is estimated to cost $85k. \n\nI love/want/need:\n• Aerodynamic features like the extending spoiler &amp; Diffuser\n• OLED display &amp; CarPlay (speculation)\n• 95kw battery\n• 3 electric motors\n• variable all wheel turning (opposite for slow speeds, equal for high speed lane changes)\n• solar roof\n• the fact that it’s an SUV, AWD, and has ground clearance #snow\n\nThings I could probably survive without:\n• Super plush interior\n• premium sound system\n• anything autonomous driving related (not sure if it has that)\n\nThose last features could easily shave $10k-$15k off the sticker price.",

Our Radiant Power  Panels do not generate heat or get very hot at all yet manage to provide  a considerably larger amount of power.\n\nThe majority of the heat that PV panels are exposed to is from the sun, and not generated by the panels themselves.

"comment": "According to the projections that Climate Scientists have put together, the Northern Hemisphere is warming the fastest, and the poles will warm faster than the tropics or equatorial regions.  \n\nI'm not worried, for myself, because I plan on being mobile, and I will be dead of old age long before I have to worry about climate change bothering me personally.  If you are young and worried, however, you should look at the science of how the world is supposed to change.\n\nThe basic idea is that CO2 will cause warming, warming will cause more evaporation, which will cause a lot more water vapor in the air, which will triple the effects of CO2, which will cause more warming and that will cause more evaporation, which will cause more warming and plants will begin to die off, lands will become arid, and with the lack of plants, CO2 fixing will become reduced.\n\nTemperatures are expected to rise by between 3 and 5 degrees.  Now, it is well known that the [lapse rate](https://www.britannica.com/science/lapse-rate) is about 6.5 °C per kilometre, so moving uphill is the go-to answer.  Let's assume that the temperature rises 3.25 °C.  You can live 500 meters above sea level and in 50 years, that land will have the same \"climate\" that is now experienced at sea level today.  Want to be cooler than today? Move up 600 or 700 meters.  Done.\n\nNow, about food.  CO2 enriched air produces more food than CO2 depleted air, so gardens in the future will be more effective.  You don't need a lot of land, either, since [it's very possible to grow food, even without sunlight or soil](https://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/18226-crops-antarctica-sunlight-astronauts).  \n\nBut, if you have solar panels, a greenhouse, maybe some wind turbines and other decent sources of energy, you can grow food year-round. Use sunlight when it's there, use stored energy, wind energy or whatever when solar isn't available.  \n\nMaybe you should start looking now and buy some mountainside land today, start building your homestead and post-civilization farm.  In 20 years, you can have it paid-off completely and live there for free, eating your own vegan, cruelty free food, generating your own fossil-fuel free energy, and be well positioned for the zombie apocalypse, or whatever disaster is coming next.",

We need scientists and engineers who can pilot our way through these changes and who have the mental tools to come up with effective tools to tackle the problems.\n\nIf you are more practically inclined then learn hands on skills likely to be useful in the industries which arise to combat climate change. Right now that would be in things like solar power and wind power, in the next few years it might be infrastructure for electric cars and replacing fossil fuel domestic heating etc. People putting up wind turbines and solar panels have done more to actually turn around climate change than people protesting. If like most of us you live in a country that could revive its habitats to help the environment maybe you could go into land management or forestry.\n\nIn the meantime establish good lifestyle habits which will help you avoid being part of the problem. That probably means reducing or eliminating meat from your diet, looking to walk or cycle rather than drive etc.",

"comment": "I would consult a roofer or home inspector about the condition of your roof. Some asphalt shingle roofs are rated for 40+ years. And, if you live in an area with mild weather, and everything is in good condition, you might be able to expect another 20+ years out of your roof.\n\nSo, I would not pre-suppose that you HAVE to get a brand new roof to get solar. A good quality home inspector can estimate the remaining life on your roof. If it is 20 years or more, then I would just get the solar and put it on your current roof.  Your other option is not to replace your whole roof, but just the section which will hold the solar panels.\n\nA Tesla solar roof could potentially make sense for someone who would otherwise purchase a very expensive roof (e.g. slate tile). But, if you are an asphalt-shingle kind of homeowner, then just get regular solar panels. SunPower is great, but expensive. Tesla is actually a great choice right now for their regular solar panels. $1.50/Watt after the federal tax credit is an unbeatable price.",

I see a lot of solar installers here giving you their opinion and I respect that, but until you talk to your installer, you don't have enough facts to make a decision.  \n\nMy 10kW inverter died this weekend while under warranty.  So I asked my installer to replace it with the 11.4kW version and charge me the difference.  Turns out it's only around $200 difference.  \n\nI don't know what these people are talking about telling you that a larger inverter works worse in the morning.  I've seen no evidence of that.  In fact, I studied both the 10 kW and 11.4 kW systems side-by-side and they looked nearly identical.  Same components and everything.  \n\nMaybe you should upgrade, maybe you shouldn't.  But until you talk to your installer, there is no way you can make this decision.  There is absolutely no harm in you talking to the installer.\n\nShould you ask for a larger inverter?  No, but you should discuss this with your installer and get the facts.",

"comment": "I only have a layperson's understanding of how the grid works, but I think that excess energy is indeed sent back through the grid. When the power generated by your panels exceeds the draw from your home/batteries, the load from the grid created by other people consuming power draws upon that excess.\n\nIt's why solar panels shut off and Powerwalls disconnect in the event of a power outage. Your neighbors' homes represent a significant load, and if your equipment wasn't disconnected your excess power would be drawn into the grid and could pose a shock hazard to linemen working to repair things.",

"comment": "Had I just gotten solar my ROI would have been 12 years.   With my Powerwalls it's going to take 19 years, which is basically the full 20 year loan if I chose to go that route.   I knew my ROI would be almost non-existant if I got Powerwalls.    I was perfectly fine with that because we'd always have power and my daughters can grow up not knowing what a black out is for the most part.   I also was perfectly fine with it because I'm in it for the long run.  I do plan to pay the panels off MUCH faster, but I'm only 37 (35 when I got them), and plan to live at my house for the rest of my life.   The panels guarantees minimum power output of 90.76% after 25 years.  So if I went the whole 20 years I'm only 55 years old and pretty much have free electricity the rest of my life.  Heck, after I'm gone it still may benefit one of my daughters.  \n\n\nAgain, I'm in it for the long run.  I want to stay off the grid as much as possible and this year our electric company is asking up to 18% of a price hike.  that would make the ROI even lower.   Being in FL I had no real incentive to get batteries, but I did it for my kids.   In a few years I might even add on 2 more Powerwalls just to ensure we never lose power.  \n\n\nIf you want to save money with solar, then only get panels if you live in a state with net metering. Powerwalls can save you money if you have time of usage rates, but for me it was for my daughters, even if I'm not saving much money having them.",

If you install a conventional solar system, you can reduce roof penetrations and the probability of leaks by asking to get mounted on rails. I didn’t want to take a chance, so I learned how to install panels and installed them myself. No one is as careful as a homeowner on his or her own house :-).

They probably won't remove the panels - are they really gonna spend good money ripping off worthless 20 year old solar panels and making good?  Doubt it.  Will the company even be around in 14 more years time?  Possibly not.",

"comment": "The Watts in that chart are DC Watts which would be under perfect conditions.  For sizing you would use to lower value then find the number of solar hours for your location.   The UK is quite diverse as to Solar Hours so I won't guess here.  Is there a nearby town that I could take as a point of reference?\n\nAfter you know your solar hours you can try 240W times Solar Hours to get an average daily kWh number.  Since there will be days with little output you need to decide if you must have batteries for off grid designs, if you are grid tied then you accept you'll use the grid power as well as research if your power company supports net metering.\n\nAs to your top question, the power output is only at peak perfect conditions and is not a constant during the day.  For most of us it's a bell curve so beyond the 5kW question we need to know how long do you need 5kW output.",

We have actual *laws* that limit our abilities, such as the laws of thermodynamics.\n\nIf you have some solar panels, perhaps a small windmill and - very important - a power bank with a ~73% efficiency, you can indeed make it work for yourself. Bitluni has an interesting YouTube video on this. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/grCqUBDBAX0\n\nNote that Germany limits his setup to 900 W, meaning that it is not likely going to work by itself without external power. But the concept is interesting.\n\nHowever, translating this approach to a 21st century’s economy for millions of people is madness. Factories, boats, cars, trains, and airplanes use humongous amounts of energy, and they consume on demand.\n\nWithout an efficient and economic way to store millions of kWh of electricity, solar and wind are doomed. \n\nThere are some hopeful developments in battery technology, but hopeful developments are not sufficient if politicians without understanding of electrical engineering retool our economies. That, my friend, is economic suicide and I’m afraid it is by design. They know they will wreck the economy.",

The biggest things that would help right now though would be having chargers located where there are attendants who can keep the sidewalks salted and safe, and hopefully some canopies (ideally with solar panels on top for some passive energy).\n\nI recently charged in Idaho Falls, and the station was a 3 minute walk from the doors to a Wal-Mart, with that part of the parking lot being pitch black and completely covered with black ice. If I had fallen and needed help, literally no one would see me or hear me. And we expect elderly people to charge at these also.",

"comment": "It's interesting because \"portable\" systems are getting bigger and bigger. There are lots of ways to install a couple of solar panels without putting them on your roof. SOme of the systems have meters that detect demand and only produce AC if there is equal or greater demand. And what about hybrid mini splits now? You can install a mini split that is DC coupled to solar but also connected to your service and it will use as much solar as possible before drawing from the grid - it's technically connected to the 'grid' but incapable of export. The portable systems only produce 1200 watts so less than what a 15A circuit is designed for - you could pretty much plug it in anywhere. I think most US jurisdictions would still say 'no' if you tried to permit it. Utilities would just look at you with that 1000 yard stare.",

"comment": "The thing is, until we have sufficient battery or other grid-level storage capacity, having so much solar everything is turned off doesn’t save as much money as you think. Power plants still need to be maintained and staffed even if they aren’t used, so that they are available when solar power goes away. And solar power, even if you consider it to be free (it’s not), still costs money to maintain the grid to transport it to your house. Here in the Midwest, about half my electricity cost is the grid cost, and half is generation cost. So even if generation was free, I’d still pay half what I do now in grid maintenance costs to get that electricity. Of course what I pay now is $0.16/kWh…\n\nAll that said, from everything I’ve read PG&E is a terrible utility on so many levels.",

The answer, obviously, is \"Yes.\" \n\nWould the resulting situation, namely a world with wars only less wars than before, be an acceptable situation? I would be surprised to learn that pacifists are asking for a mere reduction in the number of wars. How many wars would be acceptable? Should we congratulate a country that wages a little less wars over a fixed period of time?\n\n&gt; Why? Because it is common sense.\n\nCommon sense also dictate that it's okay to use animals for food and other purposes. \n\n&gt; And because while absolutists tinker with theories, actual change occurs at an individual level.\n\nAbolitionists have a clear individual level change proposal for everyone : go vegan.",

The land we use is largely deforested, and the cow run-off is not nothing.  The methane impact is reduced in grass-fed cows, but it's still significant.\n\n\"Grain monoculture\" is a problem, but given that you need far less land it's not more destructive than grazing land.

I would venture to say that the majority of vegans are \"ethical\" vegans, but there's been a lot of vegan fad diets recently so I've seen a large influx of fad dieters gravitating toward veganism. I think this is a good thing, but some vegans don't.",

Would you be thinking, oh great, I really want to read an alternate opinion, or would you be thinking, I've made up my mind regarding what I want to eat and I feel really insulted by the fact that this person can't respect the decision that I made. If you would feel insulted that people can't respect the decision that you made, then other people are going to be feeling equally insulted.\n\nPurposely sharing horrific images of the meat/dairy industry just to gain a reaction is like purposely sharing anti-gay links and information to a teenager who just came out as gay. A teenager who is gay has made a decision for himself as to how he sees himself. If he seeks out the anti-gay movement that's one thing. But if someone purposely disrespects an out teenager just because he wants to force his opinion on the teenager, that's wrong. It's just as wrong as a vegan forcing an opinion on someone who isn't interested in discussing his/her dietary choices.",

That stuff is kinda bad for you, but ok on occasion.\n\nI usually start my day with a big bowl of oatmeal with peanut butter, or a tofu scrabble burrito.  Peanut butter is a life saver!  I usually keep a couple of kinds of nuts around for snacking, fruit, and dried fruit as well.  I usually keep at least 2 kinds of beans in the fridge for random eating.  Black or pinto beans are great for refrying or eating whole/as a side, and lentils and chickpeas can make good spreads/hummus.  \n\nI usually advice people to find a couple of things they enjoy eating, and learn to do them well.  Once you have the basics of vegan cooking down, things come along easy, all it takes is practice!  \n\nSome of my favorite recipe sites include [vegweb](http://vegweb.com/), [vegandad](http://vegandad.blogspot.com/), or [finding vegan](http://www.findingvegan.com/) if I want to click through pictures.  There are tons of blogs out there, find one you like!",

Glad someone noticed because I was too tired when I noticed to do anything special. \n\nWell, environmental reasons are a good side effect of veganism, but veganism is about animal exploitation and not necessarily about always making the most environmentally sound choice (though, thankfully, they often line up).\n\nBut to those who are environmentalists, again, you got to take into account hidden resources used.",

It does hurt to feed him things I know are a) bad for him and b) products of suffering, but it's my (outdated) stance that I don't want to make my husband uncomfortable and I don't want to force my son to follow my diet.\n\nI would love it if my husband would become vegan, obviously, but I know he doesn't want to. Also, it is my absolute worst fear that after showing him documentaries and giving him the information that he still won't change. And then I'l be left with the knowledge that he is willing to condemn and participate in torture and agony for a couple seconds of taste. I'm not sure what I would do with that knowledge. \n\nI think I've had to accept that he's omni for life. My question is, how do I deal? How does anyone deal?",

Now, that conclusion is a mistake, but the reason we don't want to answer the question is because it isn't a genuine question. It's a poorly laid trap build on a faulty understanding of morality and universality, but it's a disingenuous question nonetheless. I'm not interested in playing the game that people who are asking this question want to play.",

"comment": "&gt;“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt's pretty annoying that a statement the researcher made in an interview (with the qualifier \"probably\") makes the headline over anything actually in the research paper. Especially so when that statement is about something the research didn't actually answer (the research didn't look at other ways to reduce your impact on the Earth, such as not having children).",

"comment": "Potatoes, pasta, and rice are mild, can be made into a base for many frozen dishes that reheat well.  \n\n* [mashed potatoes](https://minimalistbaker.com/the-best-damn-vegan-mashed-potatoes/) goes well with vegetables, mushroom [gravy](http://www.brandnewvegan.com/recipes/dips-sauces-and-gravy/vegan-mushroom-gravy) or fried mushrooms on the side (which you can store separately so her husband can leave them off).  \n* Pasta dishes with tomato sauce, [pumpkin sauce](https://detoxinista.com/vegan-tuscan-pumpkin-pasta-sauce/) (you can substitute sugar for maple syrup), [red pepper](https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-roasted-red-pepper-pasta-gf/) sauce, [lemon](https://www.veggiessavetheday.com/lemon-cream-pasta-sauce/) sauce, or other sauce\n* Rice with roasted vegetables is a pretty hands-off meal if she has a rice cooker.  It isn't super quick but the oven and rice cooker don't need to be watched while cooking.  \n\n&gt; She likes hummus, but generally dislikes beans.\n\nYou can hide beans in many things: [brownies](https://www.liveeatlearn.com/black-bean-fudge-brownies/), \"[Alfredo](https://theveglife.com/white-bean-fettuccine-alfredo-vegan/)\" sauces, [\"tuna\" salad](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+chickpea+tuna+salad) (very versatile. you can make a big batch and customize it with dried cranberries or raisins or walnuts or celery and bell peppers.  Can be eaten by itself or in sandwiches or wraps she makes).  \n\nIf you're having trouble getting her to eat savory things, try some sweet dishes, and vice versa (with a Midwestern palate, don't try extremely spicy or sour things). \n\n&gt; so if it can be pre-prepped and frozen, I'll do it. But dump-recipes have a higher chance of success.\n\nYou can cook a lot of things that can be frozen as an entire dish, or you can cook parts of the dish that take the most work, leaving only a bit for her to do the day of eating.  For example, you could prepare more pasta sauces, freeze them in individual portion sizes, and let her take care of cooking pasta to add to it.  This can allow you to pack more things into valuable freezer or fridge space.  \n\n&gt; stock the freezer/fridge/cabinets\n\nConsider canned beans, and even some fruits and vegetables, if she's going to have difficulty buying them regularly.  \n\nThere are some vegan canned soups, like some of the ones from [Amy's Kitchen](https://www.amys.com/our-foods?onthemenu[0]=soups).  \n\n&gt; She is badly depressed and not functioning.\n\nIf she has a blender, one of the simplest recipes you can use to try to get her to start cooking again with fresh ingredients is smoothies.  \n\nThey can be very cheap, require very few ingredients (sometimes only 2 or 3, like bananas and orange juice, or bananas, strawberries and a plant milk), and clean up is easy (wash out the blender).  \n\nThey also scale up or down well for different levels of hunger, and they scale up in complexity well (you can, but don't have to, add many more kinds of ingredients), if she reaches a place where she isn't suffering from such deep depression, or wants to try a very small thing or project that she can see immediate improvement in.",

No fur is best, however i strongly advocate the purchase and use of seal skin and fur sold by the Inuit. If the inuit are unable to sell skins, then they will die (no money from skins, no fuel for travel and hunting, no food for the community). As a Canadian and a human being I cannot allow the lives of well-populated animals take priority over the lives of people who we've been culturally killing for centuries.\n\nOther than the fur of course, i totally support this encouragement for people are not yet vegan!",

Not eating vitamin B12 (or not absorbing it properly) can cause a host of issues. \n\nGiven that a plant-based diet only has few sources of B12, then supplements/fortified foods are necessary.\n\nI would even argue that only supplements are necessary because vitamin B12 is poorly absorbed. Meaning even though your nutritional yeast might say it has 100% DV of B12, only a fraction of that will be absorbed.\n\nI might not be understanding the question properly but thats pretty much the best I can explain it. B12 is essential to our bodies, so given that it is hard to get on a plant-bases diet, supplements are really recommended.",

Presenting everything as \"all or nothing\" is suggesting that the baby steps they \\*ARE\\* taking towards a cruelty-free lifestyle are meaningless until they reach 100%.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I was a meat-eater, in my 20s I was vegetarian, and in my 30s I am now vegan. It took me some time to figure out what aspects of my life were causing the most harm and I cut them out one-by-one. If I saw this post in my 20s, I might think there was no point in even trying.\n\nBecoming vegan is not just a simple choice for many, the act itself of not consuming animal products might be easy, but in the real world most people need to adjust their personal beliefs before changing a behavior they've grown up with, and personal beliefs are HARD for many to change.",

Your body needs fats and these are plant based unsaturated fats that come with all the nutrients that cashews have. It’s not the equivalent of potato chips. \n\n\nThat said of course eating anything in excess or while neglecting other food groups is a bad idea regardless of how “healthy” they are. And at the same time it’s equally as important to eat what you want regardless of nutrition on occasion so that you can enjoy the wonder that is vegan ice cream and fast food. It’s all a matter of big picture overall balance to get a nutrient dense diet",

Many vegans choose not to consume palm oil and carnauba wax due to the huge ecological impact farming palm has on rain forests. you can do your own research about palm farming and deforestation and decide for yourself whether you'll avoid it. Malic acid technically can be derived from animal sources but 99% of the time it's plant-sourced, so it's vegan. but other than those there's nothing to worry about in this ingredient list :)",

"comment": "Like others have said: beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, nut butters, tahini, quinoa, TVP, and seitan are all high in protein, and so are whole grains and cereals like brown rice, buckwheat, whole wheat products... Hard to not reach your protein requirements as long as you are eating enough and you include these things in your diet. Also: there is really nothing wrong with eating tofu everyday! It's super healthy for you and has basically no downsides as long as you are eating veggies and other fiber rich foods with your meals :)\n\nIf you don't want to eat legumes in like soup all the time, you can also eat them in other forms: hummus, refried beans (homemade are healthier ofc), bean burgers or veggieballs, mashed as filling for fajitas/enchiladas, mashed to make fake tuna salad, as a base to make other dips... Edamame and lupin beans also count! There's a lot of ways to eat legumes and there's tons of different types of beans, lentils, chickpeas, etc. I'm sure you'll find some you enjoy!",

Because that's literally the only thing I've done in my comment.\n\n&gt;and does nothing to help the cause. As a vegan you should want to help animals not only by not exploiting them yourself but effectively advocating for their rights. I would not consider your original comment effective advocacy. In fact, I would say it hinders people's willingness to consider veganism.\n\nAnd you can demonstrate to me that making analogies between humans and animals isn't effective advocacy, of course, you're not just claiming that your way is the best way.. are you ?\n\nAlso, I'm on a vegan subreddit, I'm not trying to convince carnists about animal rights, I'm trying to convince vegans to not praise animal abusers.",

"comment": "I’ve lived with a vegetarian for almost 6 years, at one point it was 2, I’ve known the one way longer and they have always been veg since they were a teenager. I’ve learned a lot of food/meals/dishes are vegetarian that I’ve already enjoyed/loved, I just add meat, like pizza for a very broad example, I can have it vegetarian and still really love it. I know the harm mass production of dairy/other meats can cause the animal, I won’t go into that rabbit hole of conversation, but one thing that stuck was the intelligence of pigs. Personally I could kill a chicken for food no problem, a cow I might not kill but I will use for milk… and maybe meat later down the line of my made up scenario. A pig… knowing what I know now, I couldn’t kill unless absolutely necessary. Knowing that I’m not a farming and I shop at a store, I do not go near pig as it’s not necessary. I’ll avoid red meat as much as possible cuz I still eat dairy. Chickens are hardest for me as I can make so many dishes with chicken and not get tired of the meal. If im out and beacon is already prepared for the meal I will eat it, putting it to the side or throwing it away means the death was for nothing, I will eat it for that reason. I will never order it myself. I don’t hate vegetarians or vegans for being so, I will push back on those who push, I just hope there can be a better understanding that a lot of food meat eaters love are already vegetarian, we just add meat when it’s not necessary. Pizza is great! Just hold of on the pepperoni, you don’t need it.",

"comment": "I’d also like to say, in roughly 1,000 conversations with non-vegans over many years, all\nI have personally met has been genuine and open curiosity, and respectful discourse. no alienation at all. but where there is “alienation” what does that point to? \n\nI have to assume you are not vegan, so what is it that makes this reflex in you? where is that obnoxiousness in a statement that can apply very broadly that positions which question our moral decency bring about egoic or cognitive dissonance? This is a very basic psychological reaction that we see everywhere, including within veganism when there may be talk of further environmental responsibilities, the ethics of procreation etc.\nand regardless of whether of jot there IS obnoxiousness or attack, the person on the other side IS dismissive of veganism exactly because of that dissonance. We respond to what is in front of us based either on reason or an egoic/emotional bias or block - if we are reasonable, then we are able to take the position as separate from the delivery. if we dislike veganism/vegans (most of whom are extremely mild and non-confrontational) because of the delivery of some fraction, that therefor means we are experiencing…\n\nyou see?\n\nthere is right, and there is wrong. there are truths and falsehoods.\nthat’s all that matters. \n\nNo one is a zealot, not even the most aggressive vegan. they are standing up for vulnerable beings who are exploited, abused, and mutilated. and that is what veganism means, so that is the only point. \nwhat is right? what is wrong? \nthat is all that mind in reason will look at.\n\nand by the way, just because there’s this thing where people forever take issue and defence against anything which touches the term “ego” (and I’m sorry if I don’t need to explain this, but I suppose in colloquial use the word has lost most dimensions of meaning). the ego is simply the mental faculty of identification, thus “egoic dissonance” would be where there is a conflict with how we identify self and world. IE, we are wired to generally identify ourselves as good people and therefore our actions and interactions in the world as being good. I use the term “egoic dissonance” more than “cognitive dissonance” because ego is prior to cognition and often obscures it; I think the latter term is more suitable where we are a little closer to consideration of the matter, actually somewhat cognisant of the fact that, in this example, it is wrong to needlessly barm animals, while also holding some kind of belief which tries to support that harm. and egoic dissonance is more common and comes simply from that psychic perception that our position of good is in question, it is somewhat more primal and primary, and it does not necessarily have anything to do with egoTISM or actual self-centric belief, it’s just an unconscious reflex that seeks to protect identity of position. and vegans do it plenty :) (I’ve met far greater lack of reason in discussions of wider ethical matters with vegans than I have with non-vegans).",

Everyone had told me meat/dairy was good for me all my life, turns out they were wrong on so many levels. The more I looked into everything and eventually watched Dominion, it truly dawned on my how massive the lies are and how deep the damage goes.\n\nIt is also amazing how all of this has changed my perspective on Vegans as people, previously I saw them as weird almost cult like individuals, now all I see is love.",

The first few ingredients seem bland to eat in volume and for example, peanut butter, close to the bottom, I'd have to eat way too much off. I know these are just examples, and by no means is one limited to this list. This list is just to point out how easy it is to get all the nutrition you need from a vegan diet. This was the message, and it's actually a great chart. For me though, it doesn't mean it's appealing. When you aren't vegan, you need to be shown something enticing towards your taste buds. I feel like this is useful for only those that are very close to converting or need to convert asap for health reasons.\n\nSomething that would work for me would be pictures of highly reviewed fake meats. I know it's gaining popularity. I say in maybe 10 years, it will be super easy to convert. Still don't know how much the fake meats cost. Will look next time I go to a Trader Joe's or Fresh Thyme. Whole Foods is hella expensive from what I've seen.",

It tasted good, but everything was super low protein and very light.  No beans and barely any grains involved and I was still hungry afterwards.\n\nFor some reason, most Americans don't seem to consider beans as food, because when I respond to the age-old \"Where do you get protein\" question with \"I eat a lot of beans\", many people stare at me blankly like they don't understand.\n\nJust look at most American cooking and most American recipes and beans are - at best - an occasional side (eg- baked beans), they're almost never an integral part of the recipe.",

We go to Jumbo, Lidl and Albert Heijn but we have quite a tight budget since my mom doesn't have the best job and both my brother and sister go to university, which my parents have to pay. So because they don't have that much money they've always told me everything is expensive, because now when I look at the prices and I calculate what I would have to pay for just me, it really isn't that much at all!\n\nWhen I talked to my parents about it they didn't understand why i wanted to be vegetarian but they were fine with it, but they will not leave out meat from the meals unfortunately. So I'm glad I have a job now so I have to eat alone 2 or 3 times a week and of course with breakfast and lunch I eat vegan most of the time (occasional milk products)\n\nI do have the benefit that I love cooking and would gladly spend an hour preparing lovely meals. As for recipes, I'm planning on spending the next 2 months making a recipe book for myself so I can start trying out new things.\n\nAnd a quick side note, I'll be moving ou after this school year since I'm in my final year and then I'm off to college :D So then I will have the freedom to eat whatever I want.",
