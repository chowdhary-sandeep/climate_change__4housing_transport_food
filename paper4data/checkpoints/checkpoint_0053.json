"comment": "Since this is a shameless plug, I'll throw in my two cents. \n\nPurchasing is always better than leasing. The industry is so competitive at the moment that prices are lower than ever and payback is in most cases under 6 years. \n\nLeasing and PPAs create 3 big incentives for leasing companies: A cash influx that increases every year (3-4% escalators on leases), a 30% tax credit on ALL expenses that the leasing company deems is fair (and some companies took advantage of *heavily* when the tax credit was a tax grant)  -I will not say who is being investigated or who is not- and finally, state and federal depreciation since the leasing/financing company OWNS the system and therefore can do so with their assets.\n\nFinancing has become widely available that leasing/PPAs do not make much sense anymore. Why would you sign a 20 *year* agreement? With most purchases your average cost per kWh can be as low as 6 cents per kWh. \n\nThere is a big reason why there are canvasing teams and hard close techniques being used by some companies. If presented with a sale option, most customers would opt for buying the system instead of putting a lien in their home on a system that can be paid in less than 6 years.\n\nSolar is a fantastic way to save money, payback is relatively short and you can pay yourself instead of paying the utility company. However, please look into buying before making a decision on leasing/PPA. You are leaving possibly tens of thousands of dollars on the table by passing the main benefits of solar to corporations instead of yourself.",

"comment": "I've thought about this a lot.  Larger rvs are 40' long and 8' wide.  You could put 10 400-watt panels on the roof if it was completely flat.  You could also put panels on awnings or on the ground.  Now of course, rvs have complicated roofs with a/c, skylights and vents, but what could you do if they were designed from scratch for it?\n\nAt 5 hours sunshine, say 3kw of panels, 15kwh in one day.  1 kwh will move a tesla 3.5 miles, what if an RV moved 1-2 miles?  15kwh would move it 15-30 miles.\n\nAlso, there's another possibility.  Lots of RV parks have 50-amp (12,000w) hookups.  They could charge a large battery pack in a short period of time.  Even smaller parks have 30-amp (3600w) hookups, which still isn't too bad.\n\nI think we'll eventually see this, as battery prices drop and especially with the benefits of high torque motors and regenerative braking.\n\nEDIT: [here](http://www.technomadia.com/solar/) is a group of articles by some folks who added solar to their RV, including all the details of their panels, lithium-ion battery setup and more.  This isn't for driving the RV, it's only for powering their onboard stuff.  It kind of shows you what wattage they got and how they managed it.  They also put panels out on the ground, which in some places is easily possible.",

I thought you had to have enough taxable income to apply the credit towards, or was I thinking in the wrong direction?\n\nEDIT: \"Up to\" is the critical modifier. The federal incentive is usually referred to as a flat $7,500 credit, but it's only worth $7,500 to someone whose tax bill at the end of the year is $7,500 or more. If the buyer of a Volt, a Nissan Leaf or other eligible vehicle owes, for example, only $5,000 in income tax for a particular year, that's all the tax credit will be. Uncle Sam's not writing a refund check for the other $2,500. And an unused portion of the credit can't be applied against the following year's taxes.

I know the distribution isn't normal, but cars will stay on the road a very long time.  20-25 more years for pure EVs is pretty likely unless something drastic happens to force those cars off the roads.

It would do people well to buy their out of season veggies in cans.\n\nIt's sad that the Bolivian framers now have to eat soy, but on the other hand it's probably going to create jobs, and enable farmers to educate themselves, and industrialize leading to less land being needed to produce the crops, and higher yields.\n\nThe real messy part comes in when the people farming the stuff aren't rewarded for their labor. Then again they weren't before. It's usually this thing where: \"Hey look how shit action A has made it.\"\n\nWhen in reality it was bad before, it's just that nobody gave a damn, because no one ever cared about Bolivian farmers before.",

(32 MPG or 1.9375 gallons per 100 kilometer)\n* One Gallon gasoline produces 8.909 Kilogram C02\n* One Gallon diesel produces 10.151 Kilogramm C02\n* A 84 miles electric car produces 1 ton more C02 at production than a comperable fossil fuel one.\n\n**Calculations**\n\n*How much C02 does (does he?) the Hyundai ioniq safe per kilometer?*\n\nThe Hyundai ioniq produces 135.177  gramm (13.517 Kg per 100 km) CO2 per kilometer if the electricity comes completely from coal power plants.\n\nThe Most efficient non hybrid car produces 172.611 gramm (17.261 Kg per 100 km) CO2 per kilometer.\n\nA 40 MPG car produces 13.920 Kg per 100 kilometer\n\nThe Hyundai ioniq produces 37.434 gramm CO2 less than the Mazda 6.\n\nThis are 3.7434 Kg CO2 less per 100 kilometer than a Madzda 6.\n\nThis are 0,403 Kg CO2 less per 100 kilometer than a 40 MPG car.\n\n*How much kilometer do you have to drive the Hyundai ioniq to produce overall the same amount of CO2?*\n\nThe Hyundai ioniq has 125 miles of range. This means that the Hyundai ioniq produced 1,5 tons more CO2 at production than a comperable fossil fuel car.\n\n1,500 / 3.7434 * 100 = 40,070 kilometer.\n\n1,500 / 0,403 * 100 = 372,208 kilometer.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIf you drive an electric car, which gets the electricity exclusivly from a coal power plant, for 40,070 kilometers (25,043 miles) than the electric car is as efficient as the most efficient non-HEV fossil fuel sedan. Than the electric car is as efficient as a 32 MPG car.\n\nIf you drive an electric car, which gets the electricity exclusivly from a coal power plant, for 372,208 kilometers (232,630 miles) than the electric car is as efficient as a 40 MPG car.\n\n*Note that a 40 MPG car would be a HEV car which also needs additionally an electric motor and a 1-2 kwh Battery.*\n\n*Note that CO2 production of getting the oil -&gt; gasoline to the the \nGas station was not accounted for while the 820 CO2e gramm per kWh did account for everything.*\n\n**Sources**\n\n* http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf (page 21) (1 ton more co2 - electric car)\n* http://www.fueleconomy.gov/\n* https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=38431 (Hyundai ioniq efficiency and range)\n* http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=35982 (Mazda 6 efficiecny)\n* https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=307&amp;t=11 (CO2 per gallon)\n* https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&amp;t=3 (grid loss)\n* https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf (Coal plant 820 gram/kwh)\n* https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf  (Coal plant 820 gram/kwh)",

For ex. they gave a better score to a Yaris. https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/toyota/yaris/29484 anyone that honestly believes a Yaris, a 2,300lb econobox, is going to fare better in an accident than a 5,000lb luxury sedan with extremely low center of gravity etc needs to get their head examined. It’s no wonder then that other groups have found more consistent results.\n\nSo we do have the facts, and the facts are that euro NCAP is a pretty bad test. NHTSA is far more reputable (and consistent). \n\nUnless you think actually believe a Yaris is safer than a model S, in which case I’m wasting my time.\n\nFwiw I don’t think that Teslas are obviously the safest cars ever, but I euro NCAP is a joke. IIHS does arguably the best job of the 3, with NCAP ideally left off the list entirely. IIHS gives the model S very good (but not the best) results.\n\n**If you wanted to prove the point that model S isn’t the safest car out there, I would suggest linking IIHS test results for say an E-class vs the model S**: \n\nhttps://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/mercedes-benz/e-class-4-door-sedan/2018\n\nVS.\n\nhttps://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/tesla/model-s-4-door-hatchback/2017\n\n**Would be a better approach, ideally without personally attacking OP for referencing one of the 3 main crash testing groups, and a group that’s more reputable than NCAP at that.**",

The credit phases out once a manufacturer has sold 200,000 vehicles.  The full credit is available for the two quarters after the 200,000 number is hit. It is then reduced in half for two quarters then in half again for 2 quarters.  Since Telsa hit 200,000 sales in 2Q2018, all Tesla's were eligible for the full $7500 credit through the end of 2018.  For sales from January- June, 2019, Tesla's are eligible for a $3750 credit.  For July-December, 2019 Tesla's are eligible for a $1750 credit.  Tax payers need to have paid at least as much in federal tax to claim the credit.  If someone only paid $6K in taxes they would only be able to claim a credit of $6K.   GM hit the 200,000 level of sales in 3Q2018 so their vehicles are eligible for the full $7500 until the end of 1Q2019.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

"comment": "That’s not true in every state (see: Tesla), but yes there would have to be some attrition involved and more that a couple week’s planning.\n\nThere are other avenues as well of course, like Volvo Care. And just like Tesla will be taking a write-down, other manufacturers are of course free to negotiate buy-outs with dealerships if they think that will benefit them.\n\nTesla paid for the commercial property, construction, build-out, training, etc. Saying that Toyota couldn’t unilaterally shut down a franchised dealership because of a contract is true, but Toyota didn’t invest the millions it took to build that dealership so that’s not really comparing apples to oranges. In hindsight, building their own stores was clearly a misstep for Tesla. If they had gone with a dealership model we wouldn’t be having this conversation right now.\n\nIf they had planned this better maybe they could have offered to franchise some or most of the stores, taken some cash out, and not burned a whole lot of people. The way they incentivized employees to purchase their own product, absolving them of vacation payouts while knowing that these employees would be terminated within days has to be one of the most unethical ways I’ve ever seen a corporation behave towards it’s own people. Makes me wonder if State labor boards have any power to do anything about it.",

"comment": "&gt; Conclusion: A tunnel ventilation system that is state-of-the-art can cope not only with burning gasoline/diesel cars, but also with electric cars. Increased corrosion damage to the ventilation system or the tunnel equipment is also unlikely based on the results now available.\n\n&gt; A problem, however, is the extinguishing and cooling water that is produced when fighting such a fire and storing a burnt-out battery in a water basin. The analyses showed that the chemical contamination of the extinguishing water exceeds the Swiss threshold values for industrial wastewater by a factor of 70; the cooling water is even up to 100-times above threshold values. It is important that this highly contaminated water does not enter the sewage system without proper treatment.\n\n&gt; After the trials, the tunnel was decontaminated by a professional fire clean-up team. Samples taken subsequently confirmed that the methods and time required were sufficient for the clean-up after an electric car fire. But Mellert warns especially private owners of underground garages: \"Do not try to clean up the soot and dirt yourself. The soot contains large amounts of cobalt oxide, nickel oxide and manganese oxide. These heavy metals cause severe allergic reactions on unprotected skin.\" So clean-up after an electric car fire is definitely a job for professionals in protective suits.\n\nI'm glad this research is being conducted in a scientific manner. It's important to conduct these safety tests for worst-case scenarios, and now firefighters will know how to respond appropriately.",

In the latest version of the bill they reduced the \"made in america\" portion to $500 and expanded the \"made in america by unions\" portion to $4500, and then through on an extra discount if the car was sold by an american based dealership, again fucking over Tesla.\n\nThey are deliberately trying to fuck over Tesla here. Did you know that Senators are exempt from insider trading laws, and did you know there are records of them speculating millions of shares on Tesla stock.\n\nThey will lie in bed with the Unions, short the stock, and make a fortune, then in 6 months amid public backlash they'll buy shares, remove the union stipulation, and make bank again. Why do you think they are all multi-millionaires and live to 95 with the world's most advanced and best private healthcare system?",

The real difference for people is that used cars are obviously ICE at the moment. More EVs have to enter the used car market for anyone to be able to afford an EV. \nAnd the used car market is out of whack right now, so that’s not even affordable.\nReally, we need to talk about housing costs. That’s what’s killing people’s monthly budget. A $10 or $20 extra at the pump isn’t going to be what breaks the bank. $2000+ rent and mortgages do. \nI’ve never been obsessed with gas prices because when I do the math, that’s not the issue in my budget. I’ve also had a relatively efficient car my entire life, so that’s helpful. It’s the housing, food, streaming services, etc.",

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker was one of only three auto brands to post positive annual sales growth during the quarter. The others were MINI (9% growth) and BMW (3% growth). Meanwhile, 27 auto brands saw their sales decline year-over-year. The biggest dips were reported by Acura (down 65%), Fiat (58%), Buick (58%), Infiniti (41%), Dodge (36%) and Audi (35%).\n\n2) Misleading to compare BMW EVs. Tesla was already the leading EV seller in 2019. BMW 2019 US BEV sales were very low, so easy to increase by huge %. Much harder for market leader to do the same.",

"comment": "Generally, \"cheap\" and \"EV\" just don't go together right now, except for those ones you've seen and not liked. Because many people agree with you about the look of those cheap EVs.\n\nAs for sedans, as far as I know your only full electric options in Canada right now are the Tesla Model 3, and then things that are even more expensive, like the Porsche Taycan. The North American market is super hot on Crossover SUVs right now, so all the traditional car-markers are focusing exclusively on that market for their first EVs, since they know they'll sell like hotcakes.\n\nThat said, it seems like your use case would actually fit a Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV) quite well. With your commute, you'd be driving on pure-electric pretty much all the time, since you can plug in at home overnight which will fully restore the juice you used to get to and from work that day. And since it's a hybrid, those few times that you need to go a long trip, you can just treat it like a gas car and fill up on the way. \n\nGood sedan options in the lower-cost PHEV space include:\n\n* Honda Clarity PHEV (my buddy from Ottawa loves his)\n* Toyota Prius Prime (looks a bit weird, so may not be to your liking) \n* Hyundai Ioniq Plug-in (I know very little about this one, but like the Clarity it looks like a \"normal car\")\n* A used Chevy Volt (not the Bolt, that's a BEV. Though the Bolt might be a good choice for you, too, once Chevy starts making them again)\n\nNote that your all-electric range will take a pretty decent hit when it gets really cold, due to the physics of how batteries work. So keep that in mind when choosing a PHEV, since their electric ranges can vary quite a lot.",

The base trims that offer less range and power are a bit cheaper, but the revealed pricing for the RS and SS makes it a joke.  Why pay 65k plus for a blazer you can’t even get yet when there’s a $57k model Y performance available today?",

As 8 said before, they even went as far as to showcase a Model 3 interior with no steering wheel or pedals.\n\nTurns out the biggest hurdle is technological, and the only way we know they know that is because they've been quietly removing things like what was linked by OP.  They know what they did was wrong, but refuse to own up to it.\n\nTo avoid a class action, they will eventually need to do something to appease those who purchased their FSD package with the promise of, well, \"full self driving\". It still drives itself effectively about 80% of the time, which has likely sated many, but imo that's not enough to fulfill their promise.",

The Boxster ran like shit, it was loud as a tractor and was obviously in an accident and not fully fixed. They told me it was a clean title and only in two minor bumps.

"comment": "I avoid Tesla's superchargers because I do not fit in this weird car/charger location/charger version combo one needs to fulfil in some EU places; there's plenty of faster and more convinient chargers out there. Just as it is in the States, it's a business decision rather than a technical limitation of supporting other car vendors.\n\nPeople in States keep requesting car vendors to provide access to Tesla network, but that has nothing to do with car vendors. The only reason why one CCS car can go to Tesla network and the other cannot is Tesla itself. Even if you change the port, Tesla needs to allow access to their network. And that's fundamental flaw with the whole NACS thing. In EU all chargepoints (with the exception of Tesla) work with all CCS cars; authentication is abstracted from the car model.",

"comment": "Basically when looking at battery systems I look at it as two separate systems. Firstly, you need to design a battery system that will power the house. Do all of the calculations for building a capable battery bank. Then design a solar system that will power/recharge the batteries for a given amount of time. \n\nFirst on the battery side. \n\nAverage daily usage: 12000Wh\n\nStorage days: 4\n\nLongest necessary usage: 48000Wh\n\nAssuming the batteries are indoors a temperature factor of: 1.11 (48000*1.11)=53280\n\nMax discharge: 50% \n\nGives us nominal capacity of: 107000Wh (53280 / 0.50)\n\nWith a 48 volt system that gives us 2220Ah (107000wh/48v)\n\nSay we use a bank of an 8V 820aH batteries (Surrette 8-Cs-25Ps 8V, 820Ah) that will require 3 strings of 6 batteries each. (3x820 = 2460 &gt; 2200 OK) (48v / 8v = 6).\n\nRoughly $25,000 in just batteries. \n\nNow onto the panel side. \n\nOver 30 days the system needs to generate 350kWh on average but lets call that 450kWh just to keep the batteries nice and fresh and to quickly recover from any drain scenarios. \n\nThats 450kWh / (30days * 2.5hours / day) = 6.66kW system. Using 250w panels, that's 24 panels. \n\nRoughly $5000 in panels. \n\n\nOnto inverter:\n\nRealistically you want your inverter to take advantage of the size of the solar array. But at the same time there is no need for it to be larger than your peak output. As your max output is 2.5 kW that's all that's realistically necessary from the inverter, but your system can support up to 6kW while being recharged with the solar system. So let's go with a SMA 4548 inverter, this is max rated for 4.5kW of output more than enough that the 2.5 necessary.",

"comment": "Note: I am not a tax expert, but I play one on TV\n\nThe 30% federal tax credit takes the gross cost of your Solar Installation (Equipment + Labor + Permitting + Tax + Change Orders) and gives 30% of that to you as a Tax Refund. At the end of the year you (your installer will help) file a form with the IRS and they will credit you back that amount in taxes. If your tax liability is less than the tax credit, you can carry over the remainder for (I believe) 5 years.\n\nTax credit as a 'down payment' is really a trick of accounting. Essentially, you would need to have the Solar Installer buy the system, install it on your house, take the tax credit for themselves, and charge you the remainder. I have never seen this type of transaction outside of a Solar PPA (think Solar City) type of deal, where the Installer owns the system and sells you the electricity.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Solar Incentives, the Dsire website is a great resource: http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/",

My categorization was based on place of manufacture, not corporate ownership.  Your data is all spot on for sales and corporate ownership.  \n\nPersonally, I find the Solarworld, REC and Canadian Solar panels notable because they are manufactured outside China.

It would partially depend on the size/population of your city.  \n\nRooftop solar for your government buildings could generate more revenues in the long run for more solar projects. \n\nIf you could make a difference in a neighborhood where maybe you could get 100% of the houses with rooftop solar to show how it can make a difference to all the budgets of the homes in that neighborhood.   And the beauty is the money goes right back to the taxpayers who paid it.\n\nAn example would be my 3kwh system cost 12k.  if you would work with a provider that might be able to lower the cost on a mass project to do 100 3kwh systems for 100 homes in the same neighborhood  for 1mil.  since they would be able assembly line install that neighborhood it would be more cost effective for the installer. \n\nyou could do that in 4 100 home neighborhoods.

So if your system produces a lot of energy, the value of your house will go up regardless of what you originally paid. I don't know the hard facts for solar PV, but I know that some solar thermal systems produce a serious amount of energy and would effectively grant an instant return on investment. \n\nHonestly though, even if we say that you are right for the sake of argument, if everybody knew that the cost of installing solar was instantly offset by the resale value added to their home, I think solar would be more popular.",

"comment": "As a solar installer I feel I can help you out a bit here.\n\nSunframe certainly has it's benefits: fewer penetrations, no gaps in between panels, less rail. For what it's worth though, much more ground wire needs to be used in a Sunframe installation to ground the system as well as wires being much harder to manage. With Invisimount it is very plausible to complete the array without seeing the rails aside from the ends of the array. Furthermore, wires can be hidden entirely, so as to display a much cleaner finish. Finally, the flashing system used in Invisimount is entirely different to other racking systems. Often, a wider flashing is used, with a cap over the lag bolt in the rafter. Provided your installer does credible work, roof leaks should be no concern and rather you should simply ask yourself, what would you rather see on your roof.",

"comment": "&gt;This is an interesting idea. What I really wonder is this: under what circumstances would the pack degredation caused by excess charging and discharging be justified by the benefits? It seems to me like it would almost always make more sense to use a stationary battery pack rather than cycle a car's pack.\n\nThis actually came up in a question to a Tesla employee (can't remember which one) at the Tesla Motors Club Connect conference a month ago. In summary, they found the current battery chemistry would likely not handle this use case well (which I speculate is backed up by the fact their Powerwalls use a different chemistry). Further, it was noted that the Model S uses a one-way inverter, so at the very least it's a hardware upgrade for the current fleet.\n\nSo an interesting idea for the future, but perhaps no so useful on a Model S in the near term. Vehicle designers have to take degradation seriously if this is going to be an option, and may come to different battery solutions than if the car will just be a vehicle.",

Only mfgr I have notfound a problem with is SunPower - their rated power is consistently minimum power, but their's is a premium priced module.",

"comment": "Hey, thanks very much for that input. I'm sure this is an issue that I'm going to be bringing up over and over and this kind of information is precious. I actually have been bringing this up for years now. I try not be overly obsessed about it but it's not going away until it gets addressed in an honest manner. \n\nJust in my own family I can think of at least a half dozen households that are very eager to install solar but have held off because of the outrageous installation costs. If we had a more reasonable approach to using plug-in grid tie I'd expect a huge surge in adoption of rooftop solar. I suspect that's precisely why there's so much FUD on this topic --it fits the agenda of the incumbent utilities and then ironically also works out financially for installers as well as financing groups like Solar City. This kind of cozy regulatory capture is a cancer on American society from my perspective. We see similar issues with Tiny Houses for instance. All kinds of alternative solutions to real problems people with lower incomes face are possible that are being held back by regulations that work for well financed players. I personally find it disturbing that a nation like the US which once genuinely held claim to being a land of opportunity has shifted into something more akin to a brutal rat trap for those with the lowest incomes.",

Musk saw that move and realized there's A LOT more places that might consider the same thing.  NV Energy took a huge PR hit for that.  By announcing the Powerwall at a relatively affordable price point, it really makes energy companies think twice about such a drastic change to net metering.\nEven if electric utilities do cut net metering, Musk still has compelling product offering.  \n\n2.  Musk/Panasonic really needs to get the Gigafactory up to full production as fast as possible in order to get the economy of scale needed.  Even a modest product line like Powerwall will help with that because the car production is likely going to be a bottleneck for a while.",

"comment": "Good question :)\n\nThere are a few things different other than price:\n\n* Our pack is 98% recyclable, and recyclers will actually pay you for it. If you recycled our pack today you'd get about $400 from a recycling center. Li-ion batteries (in Powerwall) are generally only 3 - 7% recycled because it's extremely costly to do so. \n* Our pack is non-flammable - you can shoot it with a gun and nothing will happen. Insurance companies and building codes are already comfortable with it. Li-ion batteries used in the Powerwall are flammable (though Tesla has engineered in protective measures).\n* Self learning. Our pack is like Nest, but an entire home power source. Eva will automatically minimize your bill based on your utility rate structure, solar panel usage, etc and allow you to track diagnostics via an app. Currently not too many details exist about the Powerwall, so we're not sure if it will have this feature.\n\nElectricians don't need to be trained specifically by our company. The installation process is pretty straightforward, and any solar installer can handle the process.",

SunPower themselves said it about 9 months ago when they announced shit results.\n\nBut its a lot more than just LG that is going to kick SunPower's ass. PERC/BiIfacial/Mono will be the standard solar power product, I believe, by middle-2018/early 2019. I'm putting my money where my mouth is by buying stock in companies like [Amtech](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASYS?ltr=1) - they produce the machines that make the PERC cells. They're selling like hotcakes. Some people have predicted that this product will be 50% of all solar in 2018. Some GTM people have suggested it won't happen till 2019.\n\nEither way - we're going to have 20% solar panels at $.40/W instead of SunPower's $1/W.",

Battery storage is helping to make this viable again. \n\nMaybe my point should have been more specific; it's tough seeing large green fields being covered in panels. As I understand to meet the uk PV target only 1% of arable land would need to be covered and a lot of ground mounts have gone into unused non arable land. It's also great that countries with swathes of land are able to install huge systems and massively reduce their carbon footprint too.",

"comment": "Since the majority of EV vehicles charge off a grid that is still dirty, especially in the united states \"those who feel they would have an economic advantage\" wouldn't be having an advantage at ALL when it comes to \"renewables\" until we get to the point that consumers CAN choose where the energy comes from. There are electricity providers that provide \"green energy plans\" but they are extremely negligible in impact and questionable at best especially with states that don't have good Renewable Portfolio Standards. Air quality? For sure EV would allow cleaner air in cities. But you pointing out \"muh city air quality\"  tells me you are looking at the problem at a micro level not macro. We would need to fix our energy production here first before we can reap the benefits. The United States total energy generation coming from renewables was 11.1% percent last year. Germany's was 85%. The big oil zealots should really take a page from European countries leading green energy. Until we quit burning coal here I'll continue driving our TSI PZEV Passat that operates at near zero emissions. Thanks.",

The only cities that would care at all would be ones with municipal power companies which are fairly few in CA.   They are excepted from most incentives.   The vast majority of the cities in the state do not have any say in the matter.\n\nIt is of little concern as a homeowner with a powerwall and no solar could buy from the grid at night and sell during peak times, it would never pay for itself this way and the utility still gets the advantage with zero capital outlay.  \nMD  battery incentive could care less.    Other states have no incentive for batteries and thus no reason to discourage them.    HI would be happy for users to do as you state.",

Before you buy anything, be sure you design the system first. The most expensive way is to buy things here and there, and then find out they don't wok well together. Check out this video we made that helps you get started. It links to calculators and other videos, so it should give you a lot of what you need to know about designing it right. https://youtu.be/CHYVhNdlYM4",

If every vehicle is an EV, we wont have petrol stations every mile along the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso the mileage figures are wrong, very wrong, I get 4.4 MILES (7.2 kilometres) per kilowatt hour from the leaf, and about the same or slightly better from the e-golf, unless I'm driving like a dick. So for me to travel 15000 kilometres - is nearer 2000 kilowatt hours, not the 2805 quoted. Then he is multiplying his \"error\" by 2.6 million.... so 2.6 million x 2000 kwh = 5.2 billion kilowatt hours in total. Assuming all on grid charging... so about 10% of what they currently produce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand his maths are wrong - 2805 x 2,600,000 = is 7.2 billion, not 7 trillion, he is out by a factor of 1000 times. 3 decimal places wrong!!! journalist should have checked his sums, because he now looks stupid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMY 2 EV's charge from my home 20 kilowatt solar array (which has 2 tesla powerwalls), and only use grid when the weather is awful, like today. So not every one of those miles will come from grid power, clearly not everyone has \"free\" charging like I do.

Just wondering who was bidding. \n\nFor me personally, I don’t see a huge advantage in Sunpower over the competitors. Some people just like the piece of mind that their warranty provides. \n\nWhoever installs needs to provide a workmanship warranty and the modules/inverters are covered by a manufacturer’s warranty. So, you’re basically betting on the installer not going bankrupt. The solar industry is volatile, so any of the major players could be gone in the next few years.\n\nI did my own install, but would have gone with the cheapest price otherwise.",

"comment": "Which is similar to the alleged radiative forcing of 2.0 W/m^2 caused by the increase of CO2 over the Industrial Age. Total solar power density is 1,368 W / m^2 , so 2.0  / 1,368 = 0.0015 -&gt; 0.15 % . So if we assume that a 0.15 % increase can cause catastrophic global warming I don't see how a 0.1 % decrease wouldn't cause catastrophic global cooling.\n\nAnyhow, the theories linking the solar minima to global temperature drops look instead to effects far more dramatic - in the Sun's magnetic field. Which would explain drops of one degree in global temperature not over a century, but over a mere couple of decades, like was observed in the Dalton Minimum.",

The Enpower Switch is definitely needed for to get any power without the grid.  \nEven on the FAQ they now state that the battery is required :\n\n&gt; The Encharge battery becomes your source of electricity and enables PV microinverters to continue to operate and provide electricity.\n\n&gt; When you power goes out Enpower switch will isolate your system into an independent micro-grid. At this point, the Encharge battery becomes your source of electricity. If the outage is during the day the Enpower switch enables PV microinverters to continue to operate, provide electricity and charge the battery.\n\n&gt; Encharge is Enphase’s new modular AC-coupled battery storage with backup capability.\n\n\n\nhttps://enphase.com/en-us/stories/ensemble-frequently-asked-questions",

"comment": "&gt;then with your tiny battery EVs\n\nWhich is a good thing. Smaller batteries mean cheaper and lighter EV. This dynamic charging rail, if installed everywhere will completely remove the need to large battery. The EVs can travel practically infinitely far. As far as these dynamic charging rail take them. You won't ever need to stop to charge or refuel your vehicle ever again.\n\n&gt;we can never drive on a road that doesn’t have them.\n\nPeople used to say the same thing with EV charging infrastructure. That \"there isn't enough EV chargers around\" for EV to be feasible.\n\nIf it isn't there. Build it.\n\n&gt;Up there with solar roadways stupid\n\nExcept for the fact that it actually pay for itself. If you charge people money for using the dynamic charging rail. You will eventually make enough money to pay for it. Solar roadway didn't work because it's the solar panels are placed in the worst place possible.",

Sending power to the grid is near 100% efficiency, and is not storage, it gets used immediately. You lose a significant amount of power (generally about 20%) converting it to DC in a battery and back to AC to use it later.\n\n&gt;Before then, all solar had batteries so why draw the line at the past decade?\n\nGrid-tie is far older than a decade, so again you are completely wrong, \"all solar had batteries\" was NOT true before 2010.  I picked a decade because it's a time period where it's so *blatantly, obviously* true if you know *anything* about the solar industry, products, and markets. It's likely still true if you extend my statement back 2-3 decades, maybe even to the beginning of PV panels.  But the bottom line is we live in 2020, and the Hawaii legislation the OP references was done in 2010, and basically every single thing you have said is completely false throughout the relevant time frame, and longer.",

You could probably just Google: \"[State] avoided cost calculation\" to find out.\n\nNet metering is generally set at the retail rates (or close to it) while avoided cost is more like the wholesale power rate.\n\nPURPA was put into place during the energy crisis in the 70's and allows small electricity generators to sell electricity to a utility for at least the the cost that the utility would have needed to pay in order to generate that electricity themselves (a.k.a. the avoided cost). \n\nSo avoided cost will always be less than the net metered rate.",

Not sure if we should try to go heat pump for most of year with gas furnace back up, that may help. \n\nI’m also fairly conservative with my estimates on how much electricity will go up over time, perhaps too much so. \n\nMy comparison is for paying out of pocket for install vs continuing to pay energy bill and instead leaving the money invested.\n\nOur middle quote was 14.4kW system for $41k (before fed incentive), we have net metering at $.13 delivered, $.06 buyback for surplus.",

I know of one business that does have solar panels installed because they made it obvious: my neighborhood Aldi. When they opened, they didn't have solar. About a month later, their installation was started and once their system was up and running, they put a TV right at the entrance/exit that showed just how much electricity they were producing, and how much they had saved in various metrics except dollars. Hopefully, more landlords work with businesses to install solar. The appeal of not having an otherwise large utility bill attracts everyone.",

I also oversized for a future EV. \n\nThe benefit is receiving the better tax rebates, and getting grandfathered into net metering. If you increase the size later, you will have to move to your utilities new net metering program, and there may not be any tax credits. Generally speaking, increasing you system by more than 10% of the original size could trigger the need for a new net metering agreement. \n\nI would confirm with the installer on how much your utility will let you oversize. Some do, and some don’t.  It’s better to find out up front before you commit to the larger install.",

"comment": "Just a tech detail, make no mistake, the vehicle batteries charge on DC. An AC charger CONVERTS AC to DC before it gets sent to the vehicle.\n\nWe call DC to AC converters INVERTERS, those units have to Invert DC supply, to 'Flip' polarity (invert), to produce AC.\n\nThere is no viable reason you can't use the vehicle to power the home other than the losses charging the battery (resistance is the biggest) and the inverter losses converting that battery DC back into AC.\n\nConverting both directions, double (or more) of conversion losses. That wouldn't be a consideration in the event of an emergency to me, I'd gladly take the second round of conversion losses to power my home appliances.\n\nAc to DC converters are simple, and they are EVERYWHERE, every rechargeable appliance has one, see you 'Wall Wort' chargers for cell phones, computers, printers, anything with a battery. \n\nAll complicated electronics has a converter, every TV, Radio, etc since all that is DC powered. \n\nConverting the other way is more complicated, from DC to AC since the INVERTER has to flip polarity 50-60 times a second, AND it has to control current, both voltage &amp; amperage. This makes DC to AC more complicated, higher conversion losses, etc.\n\nWhat you can't get people to understand is an AC Inverter will suck upwards of 150 Watts every second its connected to batteries (power supply). The bigger the inverter, the more parasitic losses it will have most times, and this is with nothing plugged into it, just operating in 'Stand By' mode.\n\nWall Worts (transformer chargers) and complicated electronics are the biggest parasitic loads in homes. Since I'm off grid and every watt counted, my chargers and complicated electronics were on supply switches so I could shut them down entirely and they weren't sucking power on 'Stand By'. \n\nWhen I assemble an emergency power unit, it has a big battery disconnect switch to the inverter. If you need to charge something with USB power, or run little LED lights, its MUCH more efficient to do that directly from the battery, DC to DC without firing up the AC inverter with its big parasitic loads for small jobs.\n\nWhen you want the furnace motor or fridge to run, by all means fire up the inverter. Its MUCH more efficient running with heavy load than next to nothing.\n\nThe deal with vehicle to home is the inverter situation. The vehicle inverter is running on 300 to 500 volts to the motors, or using DC motor with no inverter. A 100 Amp, 240 Volt inverter to run a home is a BIG inverter, will have big losses...\n\nThats why you see 1,500 watt, 120 Volt inverters in vehicles, enough for a single high Amp home appliance, like a fridge... it takes 12-15 Amps @120 Volts to kick a fridge compressor on. Thats the upper limit of a 1,500 watt, 120 volt inverter.\n\nThe car designers aren't willing to sacrifice the space or weight to power YOUR house... They build CARS, not emergency home power units...\n\nNow, I needed batteries 30 years ago, got some used golf cart batteries cheap... One hitch, I had to haul the non-functioning golf cart away.\n\nIt turned out to be a relay ($10) and my new battery bank was mobile! I REALLY didn't want a golf cart thinking it was a 'Toy'... But I was broke and you make due with what you have.\n\nBesides basic short range transportation, it was light enough it didn't tear up yards or pastures, it took nearly zero maintenance, with an inverter it supplied power for common (cheaper) corded power tools, with a little wiring it would do the most beautiful DC welds right off the batteries, with a DC air compressor and tank I had air on my job sites...\n\nA couple of odd ball solar panels on top to keep the sun/rain off my head it could (over time) recharge itself...\n\nWith jumper cables and Anderson connector it connected En Banc with the stationary house batteries... One plug and done. The same cable charged the batteries off the home solar field, so always charged.\n\nPowering both ways was a gift, that much power to do work was a gift, the only maintenance was checking water levels, the only repairs were tires, wheel bearings and an occasional ('Solenoid') relay. No oil changes, no transmission problems, no 'Hard Starts', no lugging gas cans back and forth like a tractor would have done... \n\nA mile up to the local bait shop/diner and back on weekends, no problem!\n\nIt got a set of LiFePo4 batteries so the battery water wasn't an issue anymore and the range/work it could do, battery back up for the house increased 3X. \n\nIt was so handy, and so cost efficient, for 30 years! \n\nI'm going to replace it with something dead simple like it was. It was so handy it inspired me to try and build an electric tractor, which I haven't *quite*  got the kinks worked out yet, but its WAY more useful than the little garden tractors already...\n\n**IF** you want to power your home (fully), you are looking at an inverter that is around 200 Amps @ 240 Volts unless your home is super electrically efficient, then you are still looking at 100 Amps @ 240 volts... \n\nAll this while the input to inverter MUST match the vehicle battery voltage... \n\nEvery manufacturer has their own battery voltage, so universal inverters save the little ones already installed in vehicles when you buy them...\n\nIts not impossible, and the vehicle companies or third party companies might fill the niche in the market, but right now you are on your own for that whole house inverter which is the stumbling block...",

Pursuant to D.16-01-044, Customers who are receiving service on the NEM-2 schedules, or who have submitted all documentation necessary to receive service on a NEM-2 Schedule, are eligible to continue receiving service on that NEM-2 Schedule for a period of 20 years from the original year in which their Generating Facility was interconnected to PG&amp;E’s grid, indicated by and measured from the date on which the Customer originally received permission to operate (PTO) the Generating Facility from PG&amp;E and ending at the conclusion of the Customer’s applicable Relevant Period that ends immediately on or after the 20th anniversary of the original PTO date. For example, if a Customer initially received PTO on April 1, 2018, the Customer is eligible to continue receiving service on this Schedule through the conclusion of the Relevant Period ending immediately on or after March 31, 2038.\n\nCustomers served on Schedule NEM, NEMV, or NEMVMASH who elect to make a one-time switch to the corresponding NEM-2 Schedule prior to the conclusion of their Schedule NEM, NEMV or NEMVMASH 20-year transition period can continue service under the corresponding NEM-2 Schedule from the date of their original Schedule NEM, NEMV or NEMVMASH PTO date; these Customers may not restart their 20-year transition period by electing to move to this Schedule. Customers electing to switch to the corresponding NEM-2 Schedule prior to the conclusion of their Schedule NEM, NEMV or NEMVMASH 20-year transition period permanently forfeit any of their Generating Facility’s remaining transition period eligibility on Schedule NEM, NEMV or NEMVMASH and may not later change back to receiving service under Schedule NEM, NEMV or NEMVMASH.\n\nEdit: I see you state removing an original system and replacing it will do it but pg&amp;e doesn't have any mechanism for canceling a NEM agreement,  how would this work? Just have a solar installer say they took it down and put a new one up?",

I believe that the true-up is currently annual - so if you use less one month but more the next, it can even out. And you'd be charged for any excess usage on an annual basis.\n\nFrom a panel ownership perspective, generating more power than what you use on PG&amp;E's NEM 2.0 plan is always a bad idea financially (unless you expect to grow into it and fully utilize it within less than 5 years).",

"comment": "A grid-tied solar system connects your solar panels to your home's electrical panel and to the utility grid, allowing you to use solar energy when it's available and pull from the grid when it's not. Here's the simple version: the solar panels generate DC electricity, which is converted to AC by an inverter. This AC electricity then flows into your home's electrical panel, where it powers your home. If there's more solar power than you need, the excess is sent back to the utility grid, typically spinning your electricity meter backward, giving you credit for later use. When your solar panels aren't generating enough power, your home automatically pulls electricity from the grid. It might seem like wizardry, but it's mostly about ensuring the flow of electricity goes where it's needed, safely and efficiently. Let me know your area please",

The power supply is one suitable source, but the PV panel is not, without some conversion in between it and the device.\n\nYou need at a minimum a voltage regulator to change the varying PV panel voltage to say 12V for the DC powered device. You also *want* but do not *need* an MPPT controller so the panel is being used effectively.",

Its just not possible.\n\nThat aside, animals have other interests in addition to avoiding pain. They have an interest in continuing to live, an interest in not being forcibly milked, and an interest in not being caged in. If we are to treat them \"like living things\" (which they are, of course) then we should respect those interests. And if those interests were respected, I can't see how we could produce meat/dairy/eggs.\n\nThe easiest and best solution is not to come up with some way to farm animals products 'humanely', its to go vegan! Its not that hard!",

A lot of people just dont understand how easy it is and how there is more than just rice and beans every day.\n\nIf you are reducing yourself to only looking at other people based on diets you're going to have a very lonely life.

It works for things like salads etc where you'd use Feta crumbles cold, but it does not really melt. Maybe Daiya will come to the rescue in the future. \n\nThey do have a [recipe for a Artichoke Feta spread/dip](http://www.sunergiasoyfoods.com/html/jon_s_hot_artichoke_dip.html) though that may help your craving. The flavor wasn't too bad, not quite as tangy as I remember feta to be though.",

Being vegan means I avoid it as much as possible.  Taking medication means I'm connected to animal testing.  Eating vegetables means I've indirectly killed field mice.  Doesn't mean I pretend like it's a-ok to ahead and eat every animal ever because they're just as alive as plants and they were going to die anyway or whatever.  The point is that they do not exist for my consumption to begin with. \n\nedit: typo",

"comment": "I would imagine it depends where you lived and what you ate- I guess I don't know what you were eating as a vegetarian that wouldn't work as a vegan. Did you end up cooking at all or were you just eating at a Mensa?\n\nVegan was quite easy for us as I was cooking everything- partially because it was easier and partially because we are just that cheap ;) Certain vegan staples were pretty darn easy to find- non-dairy milk and vegan margarine, for example. Yogurt was accessible, but not at the stores I tended to go to and thus was a little more expensive than I wanted to spend. \"Typical\" breakfasts were pretty easy with Müsli or toast. It was relatively easy to find vegan snacks (pretzels, chips, those wonderful Erdnussflips)- you just had to read the labels or I often just typed in \"x vegan\" and read through German threads. If all else failed there was Marzipan Ritter Sport :P Eating out there was usually Asian places and Falafel at Döner stands or there was italian stuff without cheese. We were within traveling distance to a good amount of ethnic markets (namely \"generic\" Asian and Turkish) which allowed us cheap fruits, vegetables (oh, how I miss 3 avocados for a Euro and ridiculously cheap tomatoes), legumes, tofu (fresh!), and rice. Randomly, Penny Markt also had good prices for lentils :P\n\nSo was it possible? Yes. Possible without cooking your own stuff? Mostly if you were willing to live on a few different staple items for the month. I imagine eating a lot of salads and canned legumes (mmm... lentil soup....) would have been an easy way to handle it and/or being willing to put out a good bit of money. Possible with cooking your own stuff? Definitely.\n\nI never did a university study abroad (I've lived in Germany twice first as an exchange student in high school when I lived with a family and the second time around I had a job and my own apartment), so I don't necessarily know the ins and outs of what a study abroad student would be confronted with. I will say while living in Berlin, my access to ethnic stores was much better than in smaller areas around the country which made eating frugally and fresh a whole lot easier.",

Bring to a boil and then simmer 5 minutes. While oatmeal is simmering, add all other\ningredients. \nBut I add more raisins and also add a chopped banana and peach(or apple). \n\nAnother easy staple is a can of beans that I mash up and mix with a tablespoon of flax. I bake a sweet potato(usually in the microwave) and mash it up. Then I heat up a tortilla. I add the mashed beans, add nutritional yeast. Then I add the mashed up sweet potato or you could use rice instead, but I recommend to try sweet potato. Then I add salsa ontop and finally guacamole. It is a very simple, quick burrito. \n\nHere is a recipe I love, but don't eat as often because it is more work:\n\nhttp://engine2diet.com/recipe/lynns-meatloaf/\n\nYou can also find lots of free, cheap and quick to make recipes here:\n\nhttps://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/recipes/",

"comment": "I'm sure that's what I've heard. If the point is that the meat they grow is the same as 'real' meat, the cells they grow should be the same, and just as good for starting new batches. \n\nWhere have you heard otherwise? Googling it now, I the only thing I can find suggesting otherwise is [this](https://sentientist.org/2013/08/05/will-in-vitro-meat-become-cruelty-free/) article saying one biopsy provides 20,000 tonnes of cultured meat, but the article also has out-of-date information about the need for animal ingredients in the growth medium so current estimates might be better.\n\nEven so, at 20,000 tonnes per biopsy, it would be economically viable to let them live out their full lives in sanctuary-like conditions  something that can never be true of conventional farming. I know it sounds like welfarist whitewashing, but it's fundamentally different. \n\nWe keep half a billion chickens for eggs and every last one killed at a young age. At least to some degree they all have their natural behaviours suppressed, and a vast majority are horrifically mistreated. \n\n60 cows with one biopsy per month would be enough to meet America's beef demand. They would be few enough that it would be viable to have the oversight to truly verify the conditions unlike any welfare-labels we have today. If you've got a decent memory, you could literally remember each cow's name. The cost of providing such conditions for the company wouldn't even register as a rounding error in comparison to the size of the business, so it wont take much consumer pressure to make it so. \n\nI do agree that no matter the care they're given, there's a problem with animals as property and being used for profit. But come on, get a grip. If that's a problem, then surely reducing the number of animals kept as property to 0.0001% of current numbers, and the numbers killed reduced to 0%, it's worth supporting.",

"comment": "Try not to look at it as a huge uphill battle. \n\nI started small. I looked at all my favorite foods and figured out how to replace them one by one. For example, I love bagels and cream cheese. I tried a couple different vegan cream cheese options until I settled on one I like (tofutti, which also makes good sour cream). Some things there's no substitute for, like boiled eggs, so I just let it go. But there's vegan mayo, salad dressing, etc. I stopped eating cereal though because even though I love it I cannot stand any of the milk replacements. \n\nWhen out and you need something quick, Taco Bell, chipotle, and subway all have vegan options. Or you could stop in a grocery store and grab some fruit, hummus, pita/crackers, precut vegetables, tofurkey (or other) lunch meat slices, ramen or soup, frozen meal or burrito (Annie's, sweet earth, tofurkey, etc), oatmeal packets, and...the list goes on. \n\nIf dining at restaurants, check the menu beforehand and see what you can veganize. Call if you think it will be an issue. I haven't had an issue regardless of location or type of restaurant. That may be because I'm willing to eat plain pasta or baked potato or steamed vegetables. \n\nAnyway, Google is your best friend. You can find a recipe for vegan versions of everything. And if you like to see what other people are doing look at \"what I ate today\" videos in YouTube or check the vegan hashtag on Instagram. \n\nIt's easy. You can do it.",

Check out this 20-year-old article from Cornell, http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat, which states we could feed 800 million people with the grain that livestock were consuming at that time. Calorie yield on meat is way to low vs resources it consumes.\n\nThis post was just re: 'the feels', but I actually know a few vegans who are in it for themselves, rather than for the benifit of animals. I even begun this path because of that, I have a hereditary predisposition to diabitias and cardiac disease.

The carcinogenic (cancer causing) ingredient found in RoundUp pesticides. \n\n[Impossible Food's scientifically, properly skeptical, response to that claim was well thought out to that respect](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hhv516v5f7sj/77NQsg1qDb6d9Hi4PBQA6y/93b2af7c3f12ce2e4050e03a6e0345e7/Unofficial_Correction_Moms_Across_America_05202019.pdf) [pdf!]:\n\n&gt; Glyphosate is commonly detected at these low levels in both organic and non-organic foods. In fact, the minuscule levels of these chemicals that were detected in both the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger were less than 1/1000 the limit set by EPA for glyphosate residue in dried pea (8,000 ppb) and soybeans (20,000 ppb), respectively. They were even almost 100-fold lower than the glyphosate limits set by USDA for ORGANIC certification of pea protein (400 ppb) and soy protein (1,000 ppb) - ie, the glyphosate levels measured in both products would easily pass the glyphosate-residue requirements for organic certification of soybeans or peas, respectively. What does 11.3 ppb [=11.3 ug/kg] mean in terms of howmuch glyphosate plus AMPA would be present in one4-oz.(113g) serving of Impossible Burger? The answer is1.3 micrograms [11.3 ug/1000g x 113g].This is almost 1000 times lower than the no significant risk level for glyphosate ingestion (1100 micrograms per day) set by California Prop 65. The safe daily limits for glyphosate exposure set by FAO/WHO and the EPA are much higher.\n\n... but yeah, let's all give in to juicy punchy naturopath headlines. 🤷",

A very common reaction after people shift over is how easy it is and why didn't I do this sooner. \n\nI care quite a lot about the human exploitation involved in my life, personally I do probably 10 times as much research into that area. Can I eliminate it all, no, just like the perfect vegan doesn't exist. The horrid thing about animal agriculture is the sheer inefficiency of it all, feeding food to food... So the human suffering from plant farming is compounded (migrant workers) and slaughter house workers end up traumatized. If you care about people you should go vegan just for those reasons. \n\nThe key word is actively, and you clearly left that out of your \"quote\". While there are non vegans who do good work, they support the exploitation somehow... Because, wait for it.... They aren't vegan. \n\nIf I work like mad and get legislation passed to ban puppy mills in my country but then open up puppy mills in a neighboring country to import, can I say I'm actively opposed to puppy mills?",

That's as absurd as saying you should boycot a grocery store because they too sell meat ?!? \nThe beef and chicken market is controlled by fast food companies because of the sheer volume of meat. The animals are bread, kept, and killed based on what McD's or KFC or whoever require. You think they care that chickens legs break because their breasts are to big for their bodies to support them? Why there were mass killings of pigs last year? No they control the farms, they do what is profitable.\n\nEat what you want to eat, but know that you're supporting that company and their practices. It's a buy off, all they see is that high demand you talk of, a new market they can make money off of.",

"comment": "Edit: I should clarify that I don't mean to criticize your work in any way. I think the artwork looks really great and I really appreciate that you are doing something to try to encourage more people to go vegan. Also just because I personally don't believe the quote is accurate doesn't mean it won't have a positive impact on people.\n\nI wish this quote were true, but unfortunately I no longer believe it is. I know too many people who have watched footage of slaughterhouses or even spend a significant amount of time inside them who still eat meat. For example, I know a vet who was required to work as a slaughterhouse inspector in order to get her veterinary license in the country she lives in. She found the experience very traumatic and went vegetarian for about 6 months afterwards, but then went back to eating meat. She's not a particularly callous or cold-hearted person by any means-- if anything I'd say she's probably more compassionate than the average person. But the sad truth is that most people will NEVER care about animals as much as we (ethical vegans) do, and cognitive dissonance will win out for them in the end. I believe that the only way animal liberation will ever have a chance of happening is if lab-grown meat becomes way more affordable than slaughtered meat and tastes exactly the same or better. Once nobody is slaughtering animals anymore anyway because it isn't economically viable, then and only then might people start to accept the idea that slaughtering animals for food is wrong.\n\nThink about how legal slavery ended in the US. Abraham Lincoln was personally opposed to slavery, but he never set out to end it at first. He only signed the Emancipation Proclamation because the South decided to secede, and freeing Confederate-owned slaves during the war was an effective way to harm the Confederacy economically and help the Union win. Only ***after*** slavery was already over did it eventually become universally accepted among White Americans that slavery was evil.",

Jimmy John’s, Domino’s, Taco Bell, and Chipotle are a few that come to mind. It’s also usually pretty easy to find vegan Chinese food (e.g. tofu based dish with steamed rice, just ask about the sauce). The easiest way to find out is by typing “vegan options at _______” in Google. Non-chain restaurants you will have to email or call, but most places will have something, it just might involve modifications or substitutions. Hope that helps!",

Works well if me and the co worker are cool with eachother. It de-stigmatizes that collective hateful energy people have towards vegans. I’m allowed to say no thank you, and say that I’m vegan, while having zero shame and embarrassment so they’re aware of what I eat/don’t eat considering they’re trying to give me food lol.

How much daily protein are you aiming for?\n\nDaiya pretty much has the non-dairy cheese market by the balls these days but I still see it as a utility rather than an addition to make food better (it does a better job at keeping toppings from sliding off my pizza than it does at tasting awesome, not gonna lie). In most cases I do without and avoid the additional processed stuff.",
