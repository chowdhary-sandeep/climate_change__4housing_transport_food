They won't likely put them in unless there is demand for them, but that's the beauty of the Combo; manufacturers can sell vehicles with Combo chargers, relying on the compatibility with the extant supply of J1772 to help their sales, which will then generate demand for J1772-Combo chargers.  That eliminates the Chicken and Egg problem that both CHAdeMO and Tesla have.",

I would expect similar numbers for the upcoming Tesla home battery (although I'd be more than a little disappointed if they don't come in at an even lower price point).  \n\nStill not convinced this is the best battery chemistry choice for this type of use, though.  The whole deal with lithium is you pay more for the juice overall in order to get it in a smaller, more lightweight form-- very helpful for mobile applications, not really necessary at all for stationary ones.  Either that's about to change, or batteries which are larger, heavier and cheaper will ultimately win out.\n\nAlso, from what I understand, there are still some pretty huge problems with efficiently recycling lithium batteries.",

"comment": "You can definitely do this for $10k or less. So there's the opportunity cost: you can buy into the grid for the same price as a solid solar setup. With solar you'll never have to pay a monthly bill, and avoid inevitable outages, and take the system with you if you move -- but you'll be taking on the responsibility of managing your own equipment, which can get tiresome and expensive if you're not a DIY sort of person. And it may make you a vulnerable target if you're in an area without strong rule of law. \n\nBig costs are going to be getting the equipment to your location in Colombia, and getting someone to set it up for you. Shipping panels and batteries is really expensive across the US, it's probably worse in Colombia, unless you find the right connection at a port that accepts shipments from China.\n\nForget AC, get a chest fridge, and use gas or wood for the stove. You'll be able to afford enough panels to power those things, but having enough batteries for those things... not so much. You should be able to find \"thin film\" (CdTe or similar chemistry) panels for under $1/watt. I found mine for $0.50/watt.\n\nSadly there is no cost effective \"kit\" of panels, charge control, batteries, inverter, and all the interstitial wiring, that you can just buy at a good price and rely on it working well. Tesla / Solar City is approaching that point, but not quite there. This is still the realm of DIY folks on the one hand, and lots of little local contractors that do things their own closed-source way.\n\nSurf around these two websites to get a handle on what things should cost. The \"packages\" on Wholesale Solar are not really good for the money, but they'll give you an idea:\n\n- https://realgoods.com/\n\n- http://sunelec.com/solar-panels\n\n- http://www.wholesalesolar.com/\n\n- http://www.wholesalesolar.com/off-grid-packages\n\nIn Colombia, if you speak Spanish or German you should be able to find a good local solar outfitter. Gaviotas is an appropriate technology collective in eastern Colombia that has some associated operations and former employees in Bogota and elsewhere who have done a lot of work with solar thermal water heaters, and they probably have local expertise on off grid PV.\n\n- http://www.friendsofgaviotas.org/\n\n- http://www.centrolasgaviotas.org/Inicio.html\n\nIf I had a $10k budget, I'd probably spend $2k-$3k on thin film panels, $5k+ on LFP batteries, get Dacian Todea's BMS, and I'd have to shop around for an inverter, I don't know which one I'd buy. The Powerwall is the cheapest battery on the market right now, considering all lifetime costs, but it's on backorder and the other hardware necessary to use it (high voltage transformers / inverter / charge control / specific solar array specs) are still unknown. Once it's out in the wild someone will do a good writeup on it and give us the easy answers, but that won't be for another year or so.\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/electrodacus/120a-solar-bms-charger-lifepo4li-ion-offgridrv-wit\n\nBatteries are a whole world unto themselves, it's hard for a beginner to make the right choices. Each chemistry has it's own quirks and I can't really explain it all quickly. Dacian does some of the math regarding LFP versus lead acid: http://electrodacus.com/\n\nA Calb or Winston LFP prismatic battery of 100AH at 3.2V will have a nameplate capacity of 320 watt-hours, and you'll be able to use ~70% of that capacity. That battery should cost ~$120 right now. If you want 10kWh of capacity, you'll want: \n\n    10000 / (320 x .7) = ~45 batteries (probably round up to 48)\n\n    45 x $120 = ~$5400\n\nTo charge a 10kWh battery bank with ~5 hours of sun each day, you'll want at least 2000 watts of solar panels, which at $1/watt will be... $2000! Spend more, get more panels, produce more power than you can use, dump that power into your icemaker when the batteries are full and it's still sunny outside.\n\nhttp://www.evsource.com/tls_lithium_calb.php",

I believe it's one of the best community solar offers out there, one of the only ones comparable to rooftop investment.\n\nMake sure you check the tax status of your purchase. Do you pay the income tax in the revenue - if so, then what about depreciation? Are you claiming the tax credit directly? The residential renewable energy tax credit or the Commercial investment tax credit?\n\nMajor difference between community solar and rooftop PV is that you gain a contract and lose ability to go off-grid during power utages or more permanently.\n\nEdit: Oh, this is CPS energy! No, if you have a good rooftop, you should put solar on your roof. CPS has some good incentive money available. There's plenty of talent in your area. Let me know if you want a referral.",

They are in F1 and LeMans.  \n\nI was thinking the  KERS would discharge in the initial 0.5 second when the current draw is a maximum and hand over to the battery after the car is in motion.   \n\nI do not think Tesla is wedded to a technology;  they want to make the best car possible. But I am just speculating, they completely might have figured out another way of doing 1.9s   just with battery tech.",

Carbon tax.\n\nI disagree with the thesis that it takes a radical avant guard to make change.  Many EU countries have already taken action to move to renewable energy sources and 100% electric vehicles within a decade or so.  This was accomplished by thoughtful policy makers supported by educated and responsible voters and does not appear to have been led by a vanguard of revolutionaries foregoing the status quo.\n\nYou're too extreme.   Being so radical as telling people they need to do things such as give up AC (which is impossible for old people in hot areas) is sending the message that the problem is not addressable.  Actually, AC is fine if the electricity is from renewable sources, and in hot climates where AC is required, that electricity can be efficiently generated today from solar.  Large buildings are more efficient than individual dwellings, and large buildings require A.C.  They require very little heating, which is one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions.\n\nIt is too late.  It seems to clear to me that we are going into ecological and economic crisis due to climate change.  (The coming die-off will probably result in dramatic reductions in global carbon emissions, but at that point the damage to ecosystems will be done.)  But we still need to try to transform our society.",

"comment": "So, I live with a 68-mile rated car. I have for 2 years and something like 28k miles now. We don't see the winters of Canada, but that's what made me buy the car. I was worried about range loss in winter, and watched a lot of videos on the Smart electric in Canada. Running 100km/h they could still get close to 80km range -- the most I typically do in a day in 40 miles (64km), and I have lots of available charging if I need it away from home. It's never been a worry, but it's been a slight inconvenience (always ways during the coldest months of the year). We had two 90+F days before Summer started where I live. Cold for us is single digits for a night during a week where the high will get to 55F. We don't really have winter, so the range loss is less a worry. Also, a properly thermal managed battery (not VW or Nissan) will live a very long time before you'd see noticeable degradation. Based on my math, the Smart will be close to 300k miles before it reaches the charge cycle count that would dictate a 20% loss of capacity (68 miles down to 54 miles), and even then the vehicle is sufficient for my every day needs. It's when it gets to a max of 40 miles that it would be a concern for me, especially in our winter. Oh, and as an aside...I got a heated jacket long before I got the EVs. I stopped using the heater in my car because of it. Something to consider if you've got a shorter range EV? Also, preconditioning = love.",

But to actually be a meaningful breakpoint, the $100/kWh needs to be at the pack level. This would explain why VW appears to be years ahead of predictions of when this breakpoint would be reached.\n\nSo expect the battery pack as a whole still cost well above $100/kWh. Maybe around $120 to $130. Which, to be fair, would still be an amazingly low number when compared to most other EVs on the market. Progress is definitely being made.",

"comment": "&gt; The average generation from my local solar farm gives about 3 hours a day of sunlight average throughout the year.\n\nYour personal experience isn't universal.  I have looked into this. US average is 5 hours, but that's assuming \"average.\"  In my personal opinion, not ever place on earth is ideal for solar, and not every place is ideal or wind.  But, those places that are good for solar, solar + wind, or just wind have advantages in the generation of renewable energy.  I don't know why you choose to limit the entire planet based on your particular circumstance.\n\n&gt;Grid prices fluctuate. During the sun up, prices would be insanely cheap, during non-generation hours, the prices are more expensive. \n\nOddly enough, I'm highly aware of this. I used to live in Georgia, where we had a \"typical\" consumer rate of 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, or a variable rate, depending on when one drew the power.  During peak hours, the rate was 26 cents per kilowatt-hour, but during super-off-peak, between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am, I could get energy for under 3 cents per kWh.  Guess when I chose to charge my EV?  Yep, we set the charger to turn on at 11:00 PM.  \n\nWith the rise of solar energy, there is a new phenomenon that's being called the [Duck Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve), where demand vs supply looks like a duck.  Demand rises from very low at night to high early in the morning, then drops as the sun rises high, and then climbs back again towards late afternoon.  \n\nSo, if my local Grid (since I don't live in California) begins to look like this, and it's not profitable to sell to the grid during peak sun hours, a house battery makes a lot more sense.  I just adjust the needs of my house to the times when I buy from the grid and/or sell to the grid.  Computer systems make that easy.  It could even get to the point where I don't bother to interact with the grid at all - just gather all of my own energy from my personally owned renewable sources.  Odds of that happening are smaller, though.  It's more financially effective to buy most of my energy from the grid, and just use my own collections to supplement when prices peak.\n\n&gt;Congratz, you tripled the installation price of solar capacity for a total of 2-3 hours of battery power during a grid outage.\n\nI have a 7 year old EV, with batteries that are still able to store 15 kWh of electricity.  I'm thinking seriously of getting a newer, longer range EV and re-purposing the batteries as a \"whole house UPS.\"   Other, older, and/or crashed EVs will be able to supply batteries for \"second life\" applications for quite a few years to come.\n\nAlso, I have been reading about, and intrigued with, the idea of gravity batteries, that use the force of gravity to store energy.  We used to run clocks on gravity stored energy.  Even today, there are large energy companies that use pumped water storage to store excess energy produced during off-peak hours to reuse during peak hours.  \n\nI live in an area that doesn't have the most reliable grid.  We moved in a couple of years ago, and have lost power at my house for extended periods about 4 times; often enough that it's a real concern.  So, a way to run the essential systems of the house for a couple of days, without running a gasoline generator, is a big goal of mine.  So, yeah, batteries are a good thing.\n\n&gt; This subreddit seems to think there's a single path forward.\n\nOne might get that idea, if one thinks of the subreddit as having one monolithic hivemind.  Instead, this is one of those subreddits that's made up of individuals, who each have an opinion.  Sometimes, they even have different opinions.",

Although this does not necessarily mean a Sienna Prime is a given, it does bode well for such a model finding its way to market.\n\nhttps://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-sienna-prime-phev-rumor-details-photos/\n\nHere’s the thing. For the current Sienna, they went hybrid-only, with no pure ICE option. This has resulted in it being slightly less powerful than its V6 rivals. I feel it’s quite likely that they will want to have an offering for people that want more power, and it could come in the form of a Sienna Prime. \n\nBear in mind, this is all just speculation, though. The most concrete thing that’s out there is that the platform is designed with PHEV in mind. Make of that what you will.",

The right to repair will remediate the increased cost of long term ownership.  \n\n\nI said \"we need modular, repairability\", I should have said \"Some of us need modularity and repairability\".  \n\n\n&gt;You may not realize the million mile car with no repairs to the drive line is close if not here.  \n\n\nI'm looking forward to it, but I'm looking at the current financial risk.

More precisely, you'd have to pay any IRS penalty for illegally claiming tax credits that a company said you could claim. \n\nBut, the good news is that a taxpayer probably won't trigger an audit by claiming a few thousand dollars extra for the tax credit. Five or ten thousand dollars more may trigger an audit, especially if the photovoltaic system was overpriced, but $1000 to $3000 more *miiiiiight* be under the audit radar.",

For instance, my daily driver only has a 65mi range and no fast charging (3.3kw is its max) and I drove to the airport planning to leave my car on the charger in the long term economy lot. \n\nThere are about 40 chargers there, but at least 10 were occupied by PHEVs, which objectively don’t *need* to charge to get home, whereas it could be the difference between making it or not for my little car. I ended up having to drive home in the right lane of the highway with hazards on to make it home, which the Volts, Clarities, and Ford C-Maxs, and Pacificas definitely didn’t have to do. \n\nNow I only go to the airport on a totally full charge(the time I described I had to run a bunch of errands before my trip), because I know PHEVs are going to eat up a bunch of chargers.",

If you know your tax liability will be $20k (or whatever) less than what your employer's payroll company thinks (they have no knowledge of the tax credit), then it's reasonable to under-withhold to \"cancel out\" the tax credit, so that you still owe $0 at the end of the year.\n\nThis enables you to realize the credit during the course of the year instead of waiting for a fat refund next April.\n\nIt *does not* save you from having to defer the credit to future years if your *tax liability* is less than the amount of the credit. But to your point, the credit still \"uses up\" as much tax liability as it can, bringing it to $0 if needed, so in that scenario you shouldn't withhold anything from your paychecks.",

Offsetting current usage is one thing, but net metering will eventually have to either buy the power at a sufficient discount to account for storage/alternate generation costs, or simply charge a set fee based on the average.  Now it shouldn't take that much of a charge/price difference between buying and purchasing, for the panels themselves to have little effect on the utility; since they're usually shaving the peak, rather than generating when power isn't needed.",

If not, I think their estimates may be a little optimistic - probably averaging 8-10 watts over the course of a day. Depending on the location this could generate anywhere from 15-20 watt-hours in the winter (~1 mile) to 80+ watt-hours in the summer (4-5 miles), assuming moderate pedal assistance.\n\nIt's a cool concept, and the removable battery pack would in fact be great for camping and charging little devices.",

Pretty sure we could repurpose strip mined coal fields into nice solar power arrays without sacrificing any land not already lost. \n\nNo.  Just no.  I tire of informing people of this, but it seems I must.  Solar panels produce power for about six hours per day.  They are great to help with peak load in some locations, but they do **nothing** for baseload production.  Baseload comes from hydro (which has been built out), geothermal in a few select locations, nuclear, coal, and/or combined cycle natural gas.",

"comment": "&gt; However, a switch of energy systems accomplishes far more in the long run, even if veganism could do more in the short. And global warming is all about the long term.\n\nI can partly agree with this, I imagine that we mostly agree on the environmental front. Animal agriculture is only one of many problems, and if not for the ethical argument there would be no reason to put more focus on it than something which contributes equally to climate change.\n\n&gt; Replacing meat with plants isn't a \"replacement\".\n\nA replacement is something which is equivalent in the most important ways. So a paper isn't a replacement for the internet, but plant foods can replace animal products. When you make a vegan dinner you don't just remove the meat, that would be extremely boring. The fact that we do without meat is just part of what replacement means, it means stopping with something (which we then go without) and starting with something else.\n\n&gt; It would be like saying \"replacing cars with trains\" or similar.\n\nRight, that's partly a replacement (though cars can do a bunch of things trains can't). The fact that plants and trains already exist doesn't mean we can't replace things with them.\n\n&gt; Which can be replaced by solar power just as cars and coal can be.\n\nRight, in the long term. The situation at the moment is that a reduction in energy usage will be a reduction in fossil fuel usage. Though I guess we can agree to disagree on the long term/short term discussion. It's not a discussion I have too much knowledge about, though there's seems to be some consensus \n\n&gt; Ethical actions are good for you because they are good for society\n\nSo if hurting you is good for society it's good for you? I might misunderstand, but that seems to be one implication.\n\nAnd why is society important? My answer would obviously be because it consists of people. Why are people important? Because they're important to themselves, which is an axiom. Are there other beings which are important to themselves? Yes, animals.\n\nAlso, this raises questions about people who aren't part of society. Is it okay to do bad things to them?\n\n&gt; Again, I'd like to remind you that if we start using the \"most people agree!\" argument, veganism can be just as discredited.\n\nOf course the consensus view is that eating animal products is okay. The point is that to justify such a view you need a coherent argument from principles that most people agree with.\n\nIf we cannot come up with an argument that is both coherent and supported by the majority we are justified in believing that the consensus view is wrong. As they've often been in the past. This is the main reason I find your ethical arguments (not your views) unncompelling because they aren't build upon principles most people agree with.\n\nI really believe that this is a good principle to use when judging views the majority holds. And when it comes to veganism, my personal experience is that most people I interact with tends to agree with me when discussion the arguments and principles I hold.\n\n&gt; The good book is the good book because the good book says it's good.\n\nNo, a good book is good because someone enjoys it. Which seems, not surprisingly, to be what you're saying too. If there's no one to enjoy it, give it value, then the book doesn't matter.\n\nThe point is that something is valuable only in so much it's valuable to _someone_. We can't pick and choose whom we should respect.\n\n&gt; So you have to ask \"why\", and come up with a cohesive answer, otherwise, all you are doing is saying \"it's good because I have been told so\". \n\nAbsolutely. And I happen to have come to think that selfish ethics are pretty horrible. I don't act the way I do merely because I care about myself, I act the way I do because I also care about others like me, because I understand that they have their own subjective inner life, which in principle is just as much worth as mine. Everything else flows from this (which is basically a golden rule principle).\n\nYour ethics seem to allow for things which are locally horrible, but globally good or neutral. I mean, if you treat someone badly you won't necessarily suffer for it yourself, and neither will society.\n\nLong ass text, yet again, but hey it's good to discuss something even though we disagree about something.",

For want of money, they're less likely to keep them maintained, and they're less likely to carry the proper insurance. There is nothing at all wrong with wealth transfers to the poor, but there is no good reason to mix solar up in it, except for political optics.",

"comment": "By and far, Solar systems are a safe and long term investment.\n\nI tend to think the biggest hazard is faulty installation by inexperienced, rushed, or haphazard companies.  I've seen wires pinched and shorted, poor wire management.  I think those would be the two biggest concerns.\n\nThe biggest thing you want in your solar array, in order to detect failures and production losses is a monitoring system.  Most inverter companies have a proprietary system, and there are definitely 3rd party options out there too. Some system types allow for panel-level-monitoring, but those are, obviously, going to be your more expensive types.  Most allow for what is called \"string level monitoring\" - a string beign a series of ~8-12 modules.  With these, your numbers are aggregated and you have to be fairly familiar with your numbers to detect sudden losses, or losses not due to inevitable degradation. \n\npretty much EVERY inverter is going to fail at about year 15.  Your installation company better have that plotted into your finanical outlook.  Micro inverters have a *listed* 25 year expected lifespan, but I distrust that - we've had scores of micro's fail out of the box such that we just don't do micro inverter systems anymore.\n\nSo, to recap - Aside from some sort of force of nature, your panels will be fine.  Your inverter is ~15 year lifespan, but that is an anticipated loss.  Just make sure to higher qualified (NABCEP certified, with card-carrying electrical journeyman *on the installation crew* - not just doing QC or project management.)  Grill your potential installers on problems they've had, failure rates, pass/fail rates, and raise your Bullshit meter standards pretty high - no one likes to talk about the last time they failed an inspection.  But they did fail it.  Never heard of a company more than 6 months old that never failed an inspection.\n\nHope this helps some.\n\n**EDIT:** and just to answer your question directly - Barring a catostraphic failure, there is no real \"failure\" of the system.  It just gradually produces less and less (generally speaking 80% of label at 25years, which isn't actually horrible).  the kicker is that you're likely adding more and more loads as we become an ever gadget-dependent world.  so the impact on your bill becomes less and less.",

In Europe, the wholesale price of electricity is getting cheaper and cheaper (even negative sometimes) because there's so much solar power.\n\nIn the US, should we expect that eventually the power companies will have to keep their retail price down to compete with rooftop PV?",

"comment": "&gt; I actually heard the exact opposite. I read that we are heading for fixed minimum rates. \n\nIt will be both.\n\nWe already have a fixed minimum rate of about $10/month and that will increase in the future. I would also expect to see 1-way pass-through charges if net metering is allowed to continue.  For example, maybe the utilities charge solar owners $0.30/kwh for a kwh purchased from the grid but only pay $0.20/kwh when solar owner sells back to the grid. The difference is kept for grid maintenance.\n\nEventually the cost of electricity will change in real time for both solar and non-solar homes to reflect the needs of the grid. The infrastructure for this is already in place in California.  We'll all have a an app on our phone or device on the wall in our house to display the current cost of electricity along with graphs which show the projected cost of electricity throughout the day based on historical average. Electricity will end up being very close to free during peak solar hours, and very expensive from sunset to 9 PM. We'll be able to adjust our usage accordingly. \n\nExisting solar owners will need to install more panels and/or batteries to stay ahead of the cost curve.",

A super inefficient way of farming meat would be hunting it in the wild.\n\n&gt; Yes, animals ARE going extinct because of animal agriculture\n\nCausation =/= Correlation. there are plenty of other factors left out that could and would indicate me not being the center of the problem.\n\n&gt; You are literally killing animals for fun when you eat them\n\nNov I'm not. I'm 'killing' them because they provide the food I desire. Killing for fun would be to kill them and then leave them there to rot.\n\n&gt; A vegan diet is completely healthy, and by choosing to eat meat you are deliberately killing animals just so you can enjoy the taste of their flesh\n\nA vegan diet is also disgusting and without taste.\n\nAlso, if that there is the center of your logic, you must be using solar panels, have no car, eat only once a day, and spend all of your income on homeless shelters, huh?\n\n&gt; I also know for a fact that you do not get all your meat from these mythical happy farms, and you are perfectly willing to eat fast food meat even though it apparently goes against your ethics. \n\nI don't eat fast food.\n\n&gt; Lol, the number of times I've had to endure this absolutely moronic argument. Guess what pal, we're not fucking wolves, we are intelligent beings capable of moral reasoning.\n\nMoral reasoning.. We decided.. By ourselves... For ourselves.... Moral reasoning changes. Its not set in stone what we think is moral. You think its immoral to eat meat, I dont (under specific circumstances)\n\n&gt; By your logic I am free to murder human beings since a wolf would do it\n\nA wolf doesnt kill its own kind... (unless threatened by unfamiliar clans..... World war esque shit)",

Take for example many industry analysts have said there isn't enough silver for all the solar panels were going to need. Then there is all that methane being released by the melting permafrost. Even if human disappeared today the planet would still warm for decades to come. We need to remove massive amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere and that isn't being done. Our best hope is slowing down the rate of change but its still coming no matter what we do.",

There are indeed major pollution problems as well, especially in China and India were the smog seems surreal. But these things have nothing to do with co2 and only a conflation injected into problems we would still have even without co2.  Nothing wrong with protecting our planet and increasing our energy efficiency but this is where you need to read between the lines.  Wind turbines and solar panels are not the overall solution.  Ramping up hydro electric and Thorium salt reactors is. The cure proposed is worse than the disease, and this is how I know the leaders are lying. \n\nAll of the green solutions are socialist ones. Ask yourself why?  Nothing they propose will stop, halt, persuade, postpone, change, modify, or \"stabilize\" the climate because the climate is not controlled by co2 or people. And we were once extremely close to low co2. Plant starvation at 125ppm. Without plants, plankton, etc, no oxygen and no life. That should terrify you.  Your lungs contain 40,000 ppm and submarines are around 10,000 ppm. Greenhouses use 12- 1,5,00 ppm. Our atmos is only 400 ppm.",

"comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your reply Will\\_Power. Below is my reply. \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nyeah pretty much. Because with increasing population means that we need to have larger reduction of carbon intensity for individual of us.\n\nTo explain, lets imagine we have 100 chicken nuggets for 100 people everyday but now we need to reduce that to 70 chicken nuggets per day but people increases from 100 to 120 people. So reach the target everyone needs to cut their nuggets consumption from 1 nugget per day to 70 chicken nuggets divided by 120 people = 0.583 chicken nugget.\n\nin the case of climate change, the chicken nuggets become carbon emission. To save ourselves from eliminating ourselves we need to cut certain % of our total absolute carbon dioxide emission. I forgot about the exact cut but lets say 30 %. Unfortunate population is increasing mainly due to new economic bodies like countries in Asia. Therefore, individually we need to cut our carbon emission for more than 30 %.\n\n30% is a huge percentage. Lets assume population does not increase overtime so each of us just need to cut 30 % of our emission. Its still hard to achieve without compromises.\n\nYou see everything in life is carbon dioxide emitting. Every dollar you spent can be associated to additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nLike buying food. Carbon Dioxide. New phone? Carbon Dioxide. Electricity? Carbon Dioxide. Even drinking water cause carbon dioxide emission, unless you drink from the sea of natural source of water. Because energy is used to treat the water and energy generation is carbon dioxide intensive. Your country is 100 % renewable energy supplied? Cool but are the solar panels, wind turbines produced with 100$ renewable energy as well? Also there is embodied carbon for material use, as you need energy to extract resources/ materials.",

"comment": "Okay. As an FYI, panels that aren't positioned orthogonally to the sun's rays perform very poorly, so the panels on the sides of the car wouldn't produce much power at all. Depending on construction, the air drag and weight that those panels add might load the motor down such that the motor consumes more additional energy than those panels produce in order to push those panels around through the air.\n\nSome back of the envelope math: every square inch of a 4 door sedan covered in solar panels might produce up to 4kWh on a sunny summer day in southern California or Arizona. An aerodynamic EV needs 15kWh to cover 100kilometers or 60 miles, so if you cover a car in panels (adding weight and drag) then it's likely this same car would need 18 to 20kWh to cover the same distance, which equates to 0.3kWh per mile. The average American drives 29.2 miles per day, which equates to 8.76kWh per day of driving. So, every 2.19 days of optimal solar charging would allow you to do 1 day of driving.",

"comment": "Hi everyone, I'm enjoying reading the solar topics, and I'm a new Reddit user! I have a question hopefully someone can answer.\n\nWe are getting a solar system installed with Sunpower x22-370w panels, just under 5kw, with 11 panels on our roof that has modest shading in 3 seasons. (Winter has more, with low sun angle). We are in the east Bay Area (northern CA) with hot summers. \n\nOur installer tells us they will now have to switch from sunpower x22-370 panels to x22-360 panels. They say that Sunpower is consolidating production of it's x22 line to the 360w panels and the 370s aren't available. (They offered a $500 discount to go to the 360s). Efficiency drops from 22.7% to 22.1% with the switch. Probably minor, but we don't have a lot of good roof space, so we liked the 370s.\n\nDoes anyone else know whether Sunpower is eliminating or reducing it's production of the x22-370w panels? Should we hold out for the 370s, or are the 360s fine? Is the $500 discount reasonable for the switch?\n\nThanks!",

"comment": "You calculate the cents per mile cost each way, using real prevailing prices for electricity and gasoline. For example, my Bolt gets about 4 miles per kWh and electricity in high cost Massachusetts is 24 c/kWh. That's 6 cents per mile. Gas here is running around $3.40/ gal, so if your gascar averages 34 mpg, that's 10 c/mile. ( I charge my car at home, where my electricity use is covered by solar panels that have paid for themselves, but that's another story.) Gas in this scenario would have to drop to $2.04/ gal to break even. The national average price of electricity in 2020 was 10.66 c/kWh. At that rate the Bolt would cost 2.67 c/mile. The break even gas price at 34 mpg works out to $0.9078/gal. That's the price gas would have to be for a 34mpg gascar to break even with the average US electricity price in an EV that gets 4 miles/kWh.",

"comment": "I'd go for it. It will increase the value of your home, and in my long experience, if you say \"5 years\", that's probably going to be a little longer (no disrespect, life just gets in the way). Zillow has studied the markets twice - one report is dated, the other is from this year - you're looking at around 4% increase in value for a home that's the median of a neighborhood. If you're a little above, it'll still work - buyers will look at your higher price and presumably nicer embellishments, and say, wow, they even have solar, so my electric bill is non-existent, even with all this stuff. Start transitioning to more and more electric, since you have a nice 130% over usage - stove, water heater, clothes dryer.....the world is going electric, away from fossil fuels. Be two steps ahead. Fossil fuels are going to get more and more expensive, and public opinion will continue to go against burning coal and oil that pollutes our environment. Here's the Zillow comment. The last study was done in February of 2022, you can find it easily enough. Good luck!\n\n*\"Installing solar panels in a home not only helps to reduce current monthly utility bills; it can potentially increase the home’s value by up to 4.1% more than comparable homes with no solar panels, according to recent solar research done by Zillow — or an additional $9,274 for the median-valued home in the U.S.\"*\n\nSource: realtor and mortgage loan officer for 20+ years, electrical engineer, now sales manager for a solar firm in NY/NJ.",

We need your bill simply to get your usage so we can design a system that can take care of your total needs.\n\n3. There are 3 ways to go solar. Buy (loan) and get a 26% tax credit. Lease and Illinois Shines will pay for your system and you only pay the solar power bill. Way lower, one of my lower power needs covered client is saving $1800 this year alone. Then there is Solar For All. Another state program for lower income. It exactly like Illinois Shines so I don't get that. Surely it's bureaucratic.\n\nIs residential solar worth it? Absolutely 💯.  ComEd prices are escalating over their .056 average. 41% this year alone. They are asking the state permission to raise the delivery cost by $1.5 BILLION. Oh and you have been paying to fund these programs for 13 years. It's on your bill. By 2045 all power in the state needs to be green. Comed will have green programs but can you imagine the cost? \n\nYou're home will sell for 17.8% more than a home without solar. Besides having them on your roof makes you people think your cool. Lol  \n\nSo as someone who has solar by lease I def think they are a positive. My bill went from almost $300 to $103. This is information I give to clients.",

The monthly payment is calculated based on the assumption that you pay the full federal solar tax credit towards your loan balance by month 18 (the reamortization date), otherwise your monthly payment goes up by roughly about $85-90 a month for the remainder of the loan.  They only consider the federal solar tax credit, so if your state offers a solar tax credit as well, you can keep that (not sure if you get a lower monthly payment for the remainder of the loan if you pay more than the federal solar credit amount).  They also gave us a 1 percent discount on the interest rate if we authorized them to directly deduct the monthly payment from our bank account.",

"comment": "> try it out.\n\nFine, here we go:\n\n[First hit](https://ratedpower.com/blog/rare-metals-photovoltaic/):\n\n>Unlike the wind power and EV sectors, the solar PV industry isn’t reliant on rare earth materials. Instead, solar cells use a range of minor metals including silicon, indium, gallium, selenium, cadmium, and tellurium. Minor metals, which are sometimes referred to as rare metals, are by-products from the refining of base metals such as copper, nickel, and zinc. As such, they are produced in smaller quantities.\n\n[Second hit](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2019/11/28/are-rare-earths-used-in-solar-panels/):\n\n>commercially available PV technologies do not use rare earths.\n\nFor completeness sake, [here is a scientific look](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05843-2_11) at the material requirements of different technologies, including PV.\n\nSo neither googeling, nor the scientific articles I read on the topic so far have given me any clue which specific rare-earth minerals in PV panels you are talking about. Rather than vaguely pointing at the internet and letting me guess, what the hell you are talking about, you could just straightly point them out.\n\n>where are we planning to dump the 100s of millions of rare earth mineral filled electric batteries\n\nNow you are changing topics, I thought you were talking about solar PV panels? Nevertheless, to answer your question: the plan seems to be to [reuse them first](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/heres-how-ev-batteries-can-be-given-a-second-life.html) in less demanding application areas, and finally [recycle](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1682-5) them. Also again: which rare-earths do you think are used in batteries?\n\nFrom the second link above:\n\n>In the battery sector, Ademe said that rare earths are not used, or if they are, they are utilized in very small quantities, and sometimes possibly as an additive. Only nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries include a rare earth alloy in the cathode. However, compared to lithium-ion batteries, they are expensive and “their use will remain very marginal in the energy transition,”\n\nLet me do [some more googling for you](https://www.batterypowertips.com/rare-earths-and-evs-its-not-about-batteries-faq/):\n\n>Rare earths play an important part in the sustainability of electric vehicles (EVs). While there are sustainability challenges related to EV batteries, rare earths are not used in lithium-ion batteries. They are necessary for the magnets that form the main propulsion motors. The batteries mostly rely on lithium and cobalt (not rare earths). At the same time, the magnets in the motors need neodymium or samarium and can also require terbium and dysprosium; all are rare earth elements. The most common rare-earth magnets are the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) and samarium cobalt (SmCo).",

"comment": "That interest rate probably makes break even impossible. You spend a lot on power, so solar plus a battery likely makes sense, and the prices for the equipment are a little high but not crazy, but at 11%, there’s no way this is a savings within the term of the loan. They should be able to finance at nearly half that rate, at which point the numbers probably make sense.\n\nAlso, do you have net metering? Meaning you can push power into the grid and get it back later at no incremental cost? If so, you don’t need a battery, you can use the grid as the battery. At least, until they cancel net metering, which more and more power companies are doing.\n\nThe value of batteries is (1) it gives more reliable power than the grid, and (2) as power companies stop doing net metering, the higher value it is to keep power within your house and not pushed out to the grid, and solar systems lose power unless it can be stored or used realtime. For my house, for example, without a battery or pushing to the grid we’d lose probably 75% of the solar generation capacity, we don’t use that much power mid-day, unless we do things like schedule EV charging and washing machines to coincide with the solar generation peak.",

"comment": "But beyond the program, you can still set your Powerwalls to discharge to the grid when you want, which is why Eversource won't allow a hookup that exceeds the capacity of the transformer.  I got $770 per Powerwall last year at the $225 (I actually got more because I have National Grid which is $275).  The majority of events last year were 2 hr, if there were more three hour, I would have gotten less.  \n\nIn my opinion, the program will go on beyond the 5 years.  We are headed for grid disaster in New England.  The ISO 2050 report is very grim.  Heat pump and EV adoption without adding Natural Gas generation to the grid is impossible in our New England climate.  Even if they build all the storage and all the wind they can imagine, they still plan to be short 26% of the needed energy. So, they will continue to need demand response programs.",

"comment": "You should be happy that NY even allows people who lease solar or sign up for a PPA to claim a tax credit for it, let alone offer a state tax credit for solar.  The only other states that I am aware of that gives a tax credit against your state income tax for having solar is AZ and MA, and those two states caps their total credit at $1,000.  MD just instituted a 30 percent tax credit, up to $5,000, but it only applies towards battery storage.  And I believe those states only allows the credit for purchased solar, not for leases or PPA's.\n\nA few years ago, my wife (she's a home care nurse) had a client who purchased a solar system on their house and they had a question about the tax return their accountant prepared for them in claiming the credit.  She asked me to look at their return.  When I reviewed the return that had been filed, the accountant did the federal solar credit correctly, but screwed up the NY state solar credit.  Rather than entering the actual purchase price of the solar system, the accountant entered $5,000, which is the credit cap.  So their NY solar credit computed to be $1,250.  I explained the error to them, and helped them prepared an amended NY tax return.  The amended return claimed the full $5,000 tax credit, so they got back an additional refund of $3,750.",

A good thing to start out with would be to research exactly what nutrients are in animal products and find their plant based counter parts. Iron, for example, is found in high concentrations in meat but can also be found in leafy green veggies like spinach. another one is B-12 which has no plant sources but it does have a yeast source- nutritional yeast- make it your best friend. sprinkle it on pizza, pasta, salads, tofu, baked beans- anything you can. Also omega's are important in brain health- my soy milk is fortified with DHA and omega's and another common (great) sources is seaweeds- you can find it dried at your local health food store and use it in place of salt (not for baking, but for seasoning- in baking you can use flax seeds). Remember always that you're not likely to get your nutrition to be perfect (and omnivore's can't claim perfection- or even close to it- either) so a good multi vitamin can be helpful. \n\nedit: i did all of my research online when i went vegan so i don't have any books to recommend.",

It could be this way for decades, maybe even for longer; maybe forever. This is tough to deal with, but it is the way it is. The correct response is not anger, which I see a lot of from vegans, but instead is firmness and confidence; educate those around you, and let them make up their own mind.

"comment": "I still maintain one of the best low cost vegan diets can consist of hummus (make it yourself using chickpeas) broccoli or other vegetables and fried tofu.  Don't buy the tofu from the store (it's like $4) but if you can find an Asian supermarket, you can get it there for 99 cents.  \n\nYou could also attempt to talk to or make friends with someone in the mess hall who cooks.  Just because they work in the army doesn't mean they wouldn't be willing to make something different.  Alternatively, you could make a fuss about the food since you have to pay for it anyway, maybe claim you're religious or something -- but considering it's the army you and I both know that probably wouldn't go over well.\n\nSo, though I have no experience in the army whatsoever, it seems your best chance at getting that kind of food is either to make friends with those who make it, or perhaps quietly bring up the issue with your CO.  Perhaps you can get that money in pocket or in grocery cards so you can feed yourself.  \n\nYou know your situation better than I, so good luck!",

Thus far no one has told me to, but I like to keep the option a possibility as I wouldn't want my hosts to think of having me over as being a burden.\n\nAnother alternative would be to eat before and then just take sidedishes. My rule of thumb is just to keep it simple, if I don't need to bring anything I won't. If my family has prepared something with quorn in it (which contains eggs) I will still eat it because I appreciate the effort and wouldn't want to see it wasted. I'll just email them next time and make sure to remind them that most meat substitutes are not vegan and that if they want to use them they should be careful to look at the contents.",

"comment": "I would never quote this essay at them. My intention here was to show the attitudes of the departments in charge of wildlife management, namely that they do not promote hunting purely for population control, but rather to increase the amount of hunting/fishing going on.\n\nMaybe this is common knowledge, but I wasn't aware of this. \n\nAdditionally, it made me think about the fact that hunters target male bucks, leaving plenty of females alive. If their consideration was to control the population, shooting females would be more ideal.\n\nObviously this won't change anyone's mind in and of itself, but I think it's good to know the whole picture of hunting, because it seems like something many vegans have a hard time refuting.",

She would cut a hole in a piece of bread and put it in a pan with butter and then crack the egg into the middle of the hole and fry the whole thing.  She called it a \"one-eyed sandwich.\"  It tasted good but what I really loved about it was that family tradition.  She's quite old now and she doesn't really understand veganism at all so when I visit her she gets sad sometimes because she tries to make me that and I can't eat it.  So it would be cool if I could find some way to veganize it and make it for her.",

"comment": "Well, I think we all need to accept that both of these views apply to the people who hold them and not insist that we all agree on them.\n\nBy your definition of restrictive, your diet is restrictive as well if you don't eat human meat, or cat meat, or bugs, or dogs, etc. All diets are restrictive in their own ways. I think that what makes veganism seem restrictive to you is that it isn't what you're accustomed to and it isn't the norm. \n\nI think it feels restrictive to everyone in the beginning, because you have to focus on excluding certain items that you never excluded. Once that becomes normal, maybe you will be like me and find that you eat more delicious foods than you ever did before. But it's a process and if it feels restrictive to you right now, I'm not going to tell you you are wrong. But you should also respect that we don't find it restrictive, even though it has restrictions, like every diet (including yours) does. Feel me? :-)",

It's pretty easy to have a nice, fulfilling sandwich for 300-400 calories. Tons of different types of breads out there. I usually use some Tofurkey for the meat, though this weekend I'm going to make some more seitan and see how well it goes slicing that up. Dump some mixed greens on it- I fucking hate iceberg lettuce, so mixed baby greens like spinach, kale, radicchio, romaine etc- and a bit of sauce or hummus and you're golden.\n\nI think the bread is important. Two slices of white ass wonderbread makes a boring, tasteless sandwich (not to mention the refined carbs aren't great). Look for the stuff with more flavour and texture, like whole wheat sourdough, rye, ancient grain &amp; quinoa, etc.",

When I switched to vegan it cut my grocery bill down by more than half.  In fact, these days I shop exclusively at Whole Foods buying only organic and I still spend less than I did as an omnivorous college student shopping at the discount grocery.  I suppose if you really loaded up on Tofurkey products you could rack up quite a bill, but who can eat that much Tofurkey? And have you ever bought beans? They’ll practically give them to you! I suspect that people who make this claim are confusing “vegan eating” with “healthy eating.”  It is true that whole foods are more expensive than foodlike products made in a factory - whole grains cost more than Wonderbread and fruit costs more than sugary jelly-like things, but it’s not actually correct to apply that to veganism, which could include a whole variety of foods ranging from cheap to expensive. Logically, it should make sense that plant-based foods, at a basic level, would be less expensive because of the tremendous amount of cost that goes into raising and butchering an animal compared to raising and harvesting a plant.",

"comment": "&gt;If we hadn't meddled in the first place, and taken over huge areas of land for specific purposes, the animals would have continued the natural ecosystem.\n\nYou're correct. There's a [really good documentary] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q) about how wolves change their ecosystem when reintroduced to areas they've long since been driven from. However, we cannot change that lack of hunting regulation through the hundreds of years has majorly affected the non-predator populations. Until their natural predators return to keep populations in check, some hunting will be a necessity for not only the deer population, but all others in the ecosystem as well. \n\n&gt;I was homeless and broke af for a while, and even I managed, as a teen who only knew how to boil water, to find a well-rounded diet without meat (extremely rural and exceptionally poor area).\n\nI had no idea what veganism was until I moved to the city. I'd never met someone who was vegan whilst living in the country. Now, that's not to say it doesn't or can't happen, but I will say that veganism seems to be far more prevalent in higher income, more densely populated areas. Now, the fact that you did it is cool, but most aren't going to. Food banks are how a *lot* of low income families make ends meet, and for a lot of those families meals will contain meat. In fact, [one deer on average provides 42 pounds of venison, which is enough for 168 meals.] (https://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2016/nov/3/deer-hunting-season-brings-more-food-for-needy-through-twf-program/) I completely get if you have a moral issue with high production farms that cram animals together in the dark, or hunters who kill an animal just to hang it on a wall, but hunting to provide for you and yours is a real necessity for some people.",

You guys love to do this type of shit, huh? Face it. You guys couldn't make someone vegan if you tried. You know why? Because 99% of you don't want to. When you tell someone about veganism it's because you're projecting your anger. You don't give a shit about people turning vegan, stop lying to yourself. If you really gave a shit, you would know that how you represent yourself is vital when trying to make someone view something associated with you. If you treat people like garbage then they'll view you and all you're associated with as such.",

A lightly active woman of 55kg may only be requiring 2035 calories per day. **Brown rice is a more feasible 2091 calories, but even still is slightly more than the calories required.**\n\nBrown rice isn't sufficient. Point doesn't stand.\n\n&gt;Is this really a conversation worth having?\n\nProbably not in the context of people in the developed world eating vegan diets. \n\nOnly in the context of people in the developing world with near complete reliance on a single plant for their calories (and thus at risk of kwashiorkor) does mixing foods to ensure complementary amino acid profiles become necessary.",

I don’t lecture friends who eat meat and I don’t get disgusted and act unkindly to them when we go out to eat and they opt for an animal based meal. What I do is set an example. I am adamantly vegan and I decline any offers of animal products. I post my health and weightloss updates and my vegan meals. I talk to friends experiencing health problems about the risks of meat and dairy consumption. I try to act as an example and if someone asks me about vegan or says something with genuine curiosity I will open up discussion and I will politely and kindly add comments that make them ponder their own choices. Some vegans who are more extreme will hate this and call it a sell out and not vegan but I wasn’t always vegan. I wasn’t vegan five months ago. I know how hard it is to see things for what they are when you are born into society and conditioned to see and think a certain way. There is strong hegemony in place and people who make comments like the one pictured are fighting strongly against what they have learned to be normal falling apart. It can be an uncomfortable thing to face when you realize the world that you thought you knew isn’t as you thought it was. Some may call me passive and not speaking out against veganism enough because I’m not belittling omnivores and I’m not breaking into poultry farms and rescuing chickens. But I try to stay open minded and kind because I wasn’t always vegan and I wouldn’t have been if the vegans I encountered in life hadn’t set good examples and been kind to me. Be kind to your Omni peers and serve as a resource for transition and hope. You didn’t always know what you know today.",

"comment": "How is there no difference? I see a difference... Barbarism? I'm aware this might come across as boring, but 63% of the electricity produced in the United States is from coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gases. These industries are dependent on a work force capable of lasting the entire day's work load. A vegan diet cannot be reasonably proposed to them as viable to provide for their family. Veganism is just another perpetually reoccurring gang phenomenon with good intentions, but it is a privileged minority group. Most of the world is in poverty. Animal flesh concentrates the nutrients within the plants they eat. Trust me, those dog eating videos get waay worse, but these, as you say, \"barbaric Asian cultures\" are using what is available to them, no? Making the comparison between commercial cow slaughter for food and certain Asian cultures eating dog is grossly out of proportion in so many ways, and, in my view, is a psychological manipulation using xenophobia as a means to continue a doctrine. Which is absolutely fine, but I mean, come on, I see what you're doing here... There's nothing wrong with having selective cognitive dissonance... Not that it matters, but in case it does, I say this as a former strict vegan (like no-honey-strict) of six years.",

"comment": "I’ve been vegan on and off since 2005.  I decided to go vegan because I realised that there was suffering and cruelty in the egg and dairy industry and being vegetarian alone wasn’t good enough.\n\nAs for what it’s like - it’s good.  I feel better, lighter and healthier eating vegan, I get sick much less than I did before.  Prior to going vegan I ate pretty much nothing but chips (which ironically are normally vegan anyway) but after going vegan it pushed me to explore different sorts of cuisine, learn to cook and generally exposed me to a whole new range of exciting food.\n\nHowever, I would say there are negatives to being vegan.  You’ll often be made to feel like an imposition if invited to someone else’s house for dinner and you’ll encounter a lot of people who have very negative attitudes regarding your diet.  You’ll have to watch people you love repeatedly do things that you find unspeakably cruel.  \n\nIt also can be quite hard to fit your lifestyle around veganism (although it is becoming exponentially easier)- going on a trip of a lifetime holiday to discover the only vegan option is a plate of rice served with a side of fuck you for instance (I later complained until they gave me a substantial refund).  Or turning up to the airport looking forward to a sandwich you know you can get there only to find they’re sold out.\n\nBut you look at pictures of pigs and cows, you hear about their lives and you know that you’re doing the right thing.  You feed people a whole bunch of vegan cakes and you know you’ve reduced the demand for eggs at least a little bit that day (and get compliments on the cakes too!). So it’s definitely worthwhile.",

"comment": "&gt;So my life pretty much sucks in a bunch of ways and food was one of the things that made me feel happy and now I absolutely hate it.\n\nEverything you need to know is in this sentence. If you are using food as a distraction from other more important issues then it will never really satisfy you. Sure, meat/animal-based and high-fat foods will be better in giving you the kind of heaviness that'll cut off the rest of the emotions for a while, but that might not be all that helpful.\n\nIt's a bit cliché to say, but food is for fuel and nutrition. That's not to say that even the most basic foods can't be made to be delicious, but they don't really 'owe' you anymore than sustaining and helping you thrive in your life. If you start from that premise, i.e to honour the simple foods and what they give you then it won't take much to make them more enjoyable.\n\nIf you are depressed thinking about your next meal, then the food ain't the problem ;)\n\nAll the being said, here are some ideas:\n\nRe: Protein: Start with that as your main focus. If you keep focusing on things like rice and vegetables you may find yourself less satisfied than if you included beans, lentils etc. The great thing is they are extremely cheap as long as you don't just grab the ready-made stuff (Even then, they are hardly expensive). Soak your legumes and beans overnight, using a little bicarbonate of soda (Only a tiny amount) and lemon. This, along with boiling them properly, should eliminate a lot of issues with gas.\n\nTVP/dehydrated soy is also a cheap, high-protein food, that goes great in stir-fry's, bolognese-type dishes, chilis etc.  and can even be combined with, for example, mushrooms beans, veggies and nuts to make burgers.\n\nTofu is also relatively cheap. Tofu scrambles are extremely easy. double frost and thaw tofu blocks to give them a texture similar to chicken, which is also capable of taking on marinaded flavours better.\n\nAlways look for simple recipes online. Even different ways of preparing simple ingredients e.g making spicy chilli lime crispy oven-cooked chick peas, to top a home-made hummous.\n\nAnd don't be afraid of a bit of oil and salt, anytime you want to really make a recipe pop.\n\nI'd also investigate how various different cultures make simple foods interesting with herbs, citrus and spices. Think Lebanese, Turkish Hindu etc.\n\nOther tips might be to incorporate intermittent fasting, for no other reason than the fact that hunger is the best food-betteriser. I wouldn't recommend one-meal-a-day as a vegan, but being somewhat hungry before you eat will make the experience tastier, but might also help you connect with the fuel aspect of food.\n\nAnother important consideration is preparing all the meals with the kind of love you might do if you were preparing them for the person you most love in the world. Arrange and plate every meal, even if it's just a sandwich, as if you were offering it to royalty...or taking the best Instagram photos. Make an event of even the most humble of dishes. A god place to find inspiration is from  Buddhist nuns:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU76fi3Rduw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU76fi3Rduw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut more than all of the above, you might eventually come to a place of peace with the food and start to work on the issues that you were using food to avoid. You've managed to remove yourself from a major injustice in the world. It can be overwhelming and certainly depressing. But eventually you might find it more empowering. You're only a week ing, so go easy on yourself. You'll probably find in very little time that even though you still crave for certain foods that they will no longer hold any positive feelings for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave fun!",

Guess you can no longer claim to never say or think these things to justify eating meat morally.\n\nWhen you think it’s all chill to kill animals unnecessarily for pleasure and so do your friends, you and your friends have no reason to justify it to each other, but the minute you encounter people who think it’s immoral to hurt animals if you don’t have to, you do indeed find yourself justifying it, saying things like “well lots of animals kill other animals so it’s fine for me”. \n\nMaybe now you understand why vegans would talk about meat eaters frequently justifying eating meat... because they do indeed do this when they talk to us. Even people like yourself who claim they never do that. People who claim to never need to justify eating meat will justify eating meat as part of their explanation for why they eat meat without any justification for it lol.",

I also am just not sure if I trust my local tailors to understand if I try to explain I don't want animal products used in any part of the construction, I have a feeling they won't get it. 😅",

Many diets that demonize one foodgroup and focus on just one have plenty of supported evidence on how flawed it this. When you catch any of these studies cherry picking it’s a clear sign to take everything with a grain of salt\n\nFairly pointing out all the risks that come with processed meats but conveniently leaving out the benefits of unprocessed meats.\n\nFairly pointing out benefits of plant based foods, debunking the myth you can’t get protein from them all needs to said so that’s good. \n\nBlatantly ignoring the poor bio availability compared to meat is just disingenuous. \nThis is not how you win people over guys..",

Over 200 people responded and almost exactly half of the responses expressed that they felt wild animal suffering was an important issue for vegans to focus on.\n\nThere have been a couple people who have repeatedly shown up in comments on the subject to disagree (one in particular who seems to just insult everyone who speaks in favor of doing something about the issue), and many more who have expressed interest in learning more. There are also many, /u/mortress, /u/Zhaey, /u/meatbased5nevah, and several others who have done a good job of explaining the importance of the issue in the comments when the issue comes up, and who have posted other submissions on this subject too.\n\nI will continue responding to comments on this subject, as I have been in all of these threads, but the support for this issue in the community here is broad enough that the discussion does just fine in my absence too.\n\nEdit: I just want to add that I appreciate your politeness in expressing your views, and I still think highly of you even though I disagree with this particular criticism.",

Leaning more into beans would be a good step if you’re not going straight to other vegetables.\n\nSome other ideas- bean dip, artichoke dip, avocado mousse, tofu mousse, banana whips, veggie burgers that are veggie heavy, Asian dumplings",
