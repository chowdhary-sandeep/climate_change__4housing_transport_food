High-end Audis tend to have better quality interior components compared to the Model S - that's not to say Teslas aren't luxury vehicles, but the R8 is designed to be the flagship of the Audi brand. It's no surprise that the R8 will command a higher price than the Model S. I wouldn't call it paying more for the sake of having an Audi badge - the price premium brings a higher level of luxury simply lacking in the Model S.\n\nWith regards to charging, 50kW CCS stations are now quite common in Europe. I think that's beside the point though, because an R8 isn't really meant for long-distance road trips like the Model S is.

If you don't pay enough in taxes to get it all back next year the left over credit rolls over.  \n\nDepending on your state there may be other incentives.  Where I live the power company will issue a rebate every year for the next 10 years at a rate of $.08 per kWh the system produces.  \n\nOur system is 33 panels.  We just got or first bill since the install.  Last year for the same time period our bill was $506.  This year with solar it was $201! \n\nThe system performs exactly like the reps described, maybe a little better.  One of the biggest advantages for us is the monitoring that came with the system.  The extra awareness of the cost of thing and being able to see when thing are running with the cost has helped us reduce our usage.  \n\nI still have about 1.5 kWh of constant draw in the house that I am working on identifying.  Lots of kids and electronic stuff in the house so I am using a kill a watt device that I picked up years ago and never used to figure out what things cost.  For example my beer fridge uses $.05 a day.

Tesla competes with luxury brands based on performance and technology as well as EV-specific metrics (good range/charging combo).

I just note that technological innovation doesn't create more energy.  The improvements in solar PV and windmills have been marginal.  The improvements in nuclear power, on the other hand, have been remarkable.\n\n&gt;That's why the other half of the solution will be moving toward hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nWhy not ~~Zoidberg~~ SkyTran?  And why not nuclear?\n\n&gt;You don't need to predict weather a year ahead of time, just long enough to adjust power levels with the load following generators.\n\nAdjust it how?  If you know a storm system is headed your way, what provides power when solar can't?\n\n&gt;Plus, with improvements in energy storage...\n\nThere's what I was waiting for.  Intermittent power is only useful on a large scale if you have some sort secondary system for storage.  I'm sorry to tell you that advances in storage have been very slow indeed.  The ways to store power on a large scale are generally pumped hydro, which is old technology and very expensive, compressed air storage, which is old and far less efficient than pumped hydro, and static batteries.  The cheapest batteries used for static applications are *still* lead-acid batteries, a technology over 100 years old.  You mentioned flywheel storage also.  It isn't even as cheap as those three options.  I'm not saying there won't be improvements, but the evidence I've seen suggests storage development is very slow.\n\n&gt;Do you mean fossil fuel plants that already exist? \n\nNo.  Large scale plants can't adjust their output in a timely fashion, and natural gas is used most efficiently when used in a combined cycle system.  When you use natural gas to back up intermittent power, you can't run it as combined cycle, so your net natural gas use is not very different than if you had no solar or wind in the first place.\n\n&gt;What we're talking about is adding generating capacity with renewable energy.\n\nAnd that additional capacity, unfortunately, needs a secondary backup system because it is intermittent.\n\n&gt;The only problem is that it has such long lead times for planning, approval and construction that it can't really keep up with the rate of change in our modern economy. \n\nA sound argument against excessive regulation.\n\n&gt;These plants require an immense amount of investment and support from a broad range of stakeholders.\n\nThey do, but there have been advancements in the technology that can reduce those costs.  I think the U.S. would be more favorable toward nuclear than would, for example, major European countries.\n\n&gt;In the long term, the goals of our energy policy should be to have a robust system with minimal possibility of price volatility, accidents, environmental consequences, and other unforeseen events.\n\nI agree.\n\n&gt;The only way to achieve this is to move away from fossil fuels.\n\n...toward nuclear ;-)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006021498314415415,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13726685593137516,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.27794775644749137,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12563061714172363,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2789196224021431,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.37049908673854204,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26300437913353863,"solar_1":-0.12321961417522911,"solar_2":-0.19184252104556537,"solar_3":-0.10875854762323463,"solar_4":-0.2516877581438166,"solar_5":-0.05171762300111974,"solar_6":-0.05614240007707849,"solar_7":-0.017287844006204978,"solar_8":-0.025945672602877796,"solar_9":-0.026893657703652707,"solar_10":-0.07092639237331848},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for solar)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

At the same time, the states with the most solar potential are taking steps to make solar less cost effective.  For example, California is in the process of changing to formula used to determine how much the utilities pay for excess electricity, which will extend the ROI period significantly.

Whatever.\n\n&gt;  **¶ 13.1** Direct aid for industries that are completely unviable (such as photovoltaics and wind\nturbines) but presented as ‘virtuous’ runs into billions of euros, according to recent reports\npublished by the Cour des Comptes (French Audit Office) in 2013. But the highest\ncost lies in the principle of ‘energy saving’, which is presented as especially virtuous.\n\nWind power is not only viable - it is becoming quite profitable. Same for photovoltaics.\n\n&gt; **¶ 13.2** Since no civilization can develop when it is saving energy, ours has stopped developing:\nFrance now has more than three million people unemployed – it is the price we have to\npay for our virtue.\n\nTwo issues:\n\n1. No evidence *at all* is presented that saving energy is incompatible with developing a civilization.\n2. No evidence *at all* is presented linking France's unemployment to policies tied to energy conservation\n\n&gt; **¶ 13.2** We want to cut our CO2 emissions at any cost: it is a way of displaying our virtue for all to see. To achieve these reductions, we have significantly cut industrial activity and lost jobs. But at least we have achieved our aim of cutting CO2 emissions, haven’t we? The\nanswer is laughable: apparently not. Global emissions of CO2 have continued to rise, including those generated by France in designing and manufacturing its own products, as the Cour des Comptes clearly states. Quite simply, manufacturing that is held to be environmentally\ndamaging has been relocated. So the same products are now being manufactured in countries that are far less respectful of the environment, and we have lost all the associated jobs. As Baudelaire says, ‘Nature’s irony combines with our insanity’.\n\nBecause the reason capital chases cheap labor is energy policy.\n\n/s\n\n&gt;**¶ 14** Chapter 3: The crusade is pointless\n&gt;\n&gt;**¶ 15.1** Human beings cannot, in any event, change the climate. If we in France were to stop all\nindustrial activity (let’s not talk about our intellectual activity, which ceased long ago), if\nwe were to eradicate all trace of animal life, the composition of the atmosphere would not\nalter in any measurable, perceptible way.\n\nJust another provable falsehood.\n\n&gt; **¶ 15.2** To explain this, let us make a comparison with the rotation of the planet: it is slowing down. To address that, we might be tempted to ask the entire population of China to run in an easterly direction. But, no matter how big China and its population are, this would have no measurable impact on the Earth’s rotation.\n\nThe total mass of humanity is ~ 7 * 10^11 kg vs the total mass of the planet being ~ 6 * 10^24 kg. Making humanity about 0.0000000000001 of the total mass of the planet. In comparison, the fraction of atmospheric CO2 now attributable to humanity is about 40%. We can't noticeably affect the spin of the planet - but we have definitely affected the composition of the atmosphere.\n\nThese guys are *supposed* to be mathematicians? They are either incompetent or deliberately being deceptive.\n\n&gt; **¶ 16** French policy on CO2 emissions is particularly stupid, since we are one of the countries with the cleanest industrial sector.\n\nWell, [ranked 66th](http://epi.yale.edu/epi/country-profile/france) any way....\n\n&gt;  **¶ 17** International agreements on the subject began with the Kyoto Protocol, but the number of countries signing up to this agreement and its descendants are becoming fewer and fewer, now representing just 15% of emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\n*The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December, 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. There are currently 192 Parties (Canada withdrew effective December 2012) to the Protocol. ... China, India, and the United States have all signaled that they will not ratify any treaty that will commit them legally to reduce CO2 emissions.** Wikipedia: [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol)\n\nWell - 195 countries would be every country. The problem is the three countries who do the largest amount of pollution. They don't want to commit to legally binding cuts. So this is a half truth. Yes - there is a serious problem in that the largest polluters don't want to sign up for mandatory emissions cuts. However &gt; 99% of the countries on the planet have signed up to the agreement and only one country (a major polluter) has withdrawn.\n\n&gt;**¶ 18** This just goes to show the truth of the matter: we are fighting for a cause (reducing CO2 emissions) that serves absolutely no purpose, in which we alone believe, and which we can do nothing about. You would probably have to go quite a long way back in human\nhistory to find such a mad obsession.\n\nAnd this summary, predicated as it is on two previous pages of clear nonsense, is itself therefore nonsense.\n\nI'm tired of this and am stopping now.\n\nThis 'white paper' is just a political rant disguised as a scientific paper.\n\nNot that I expect the moderator will remove it in accordance to his 'no politics' rule","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.052693089858318366,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3574768792878581,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.13162341026094826,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21408276070711607,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24667461954097392,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06962303879360358,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1136944987423097,"solar_1":-0.1256102120011946,"solar_2":-0.1300322785111853,"solar_3":-0.25557972061020945,"solar_4":-0.08701399861456593,"solar_5":-0.061810019852894506,"solar_6":-0.011807404768963655,"solar_7":-0.033811907097209826,"solar_8":-0.04795237840638341,"solar_9":-0.2745879209930209,"solar_10":-0.12261631557097037,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.053347071963071355},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author's stance is against solar and climate action, as evidenced by their dismissive and misinformed comments about the costs, viability, and impact of renewable energy and energy conservation efforts.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

They had not been uncoupled.

Also, and this is more well publicized, building solar panels takes energy including fossil fuel energy for mining and the like so the environmental footprint including the CO2 footprint for the panels themselves is not negligible. \n\nI'm not saying don't buy solar panels.

Photovoltaics doesn't really work well for powering automobiles.  Too little energy over time for the available surface area.  And the extra weight of the cell and components shaves the energy profit margin even closer.  Then the extra cost on the vehicle bottom line kills it all together.  Being cheap and light, OPV is better, but you still get very little energy.  It's not the best application IMO.

I say 4' because new-to-solar installers like to tromp around on the roof near the vents and that causes leaks. Likewise, most installers aren't putting blocking in the attic to reinforce the weakened cladding caused by the roof penetration, nor are they structurally assessing what happens when the corner of the array beings to catch wind and applies force to said rafter/cladding. Nore are they considering the impact of snow mounds to occur between the array and pipe which could potentially clog the vents. So I advise beginners to stay away from the roof vents. That said, I personally think covering the vents (with clearance) is a decent concept that is unfairly discriminated against by code, and should be challenged. These are appropriate classroom topics.

Maybe I can shed a little light here.\n\nWorking backwards through the discussion:\n\n\\- I think you're think of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition scorecard. It's a good resource, but they only use information provided voluntarily by manufacturers or otherwise publicly available, and they have no auditing power. Still, they have been successful at bringing attention to the industry and helping bring change.\n\n\\- You're absolutely correct that the solar industry is actively working on recycling solutions. The industry is wary of giving itself a black eye, and recycling at large scale may ultimately reduce net cost, so many people view it as a long-term win-win project.\n\n\\- As solar manufacturing has scaled up, the industry has been progressively forced to deal with more of these issues for both regulatory and economic reasons. Scaling up production may trigger regulations as waste volumes increase, for example, and falling prices pressure companies to reduce consumption of materials. And larger scale itself tends to lead to more efficient use of materials (less waste per cell, for example).\n\nThis quote from the link is ignorant and misleading at best, but most likely purposeful fearmongering:\n\n&gt;Mary Hutzler, senior fellow at the Institute for Energy Research in  Washington D.C., said that solar panels are manufactured using hazardous  materials — including sulfuric acid and phosphine gas — making them  difficult to recycle. They also contain toxic metals like lead,  chromium, and cadmium, which can be harmful to humans and are likely to  leak from electronic waste dumps into drinking water supplies.\n\nYes, sulfuric acid is used in the manufacture of solar cells, but none is actually contained in the finished cells and panels and impact on recyclability is zero (plus sulfuric acid is relatively easy to neutralize before disposal and the water it is dissolved in is increasingly recycled in-plant). \n\nPhosphine gas is used primarily to make amorphous silicon solar cells, which represent a few tenths of a percent of the global PV market, and again, it doesn't end up in the final product. It's an occupational safety risk, but has zero impact on recyclability.\n\nLead is contained in the solder used to interconnect the solar cells in most panels. The quantities are small enough to escape even regulation under European RoHS laws, but it is (rightly) one of the angles being addressed in recycling efforts. There are also efforts underway to eliminate lead from panels altogether, though they haven't gained much traction yet.\n\nChromium and cadmium are found in compounds -- not elemental form, which is an important distinction when talking about toxicity -- in cadmium telluride solar panels. There is exactly one major manufacturer of these in the world, First Solar, and their total production makes up a couple percent of global volume. First Solar also takes back and recycles all of its own modules, so the recycling of these materials is already being addressed. These materials are not found in the silicon solar panels that make up more than 95% of global production. Saying these materials are \"likely to leak ... into drinking water supplies\" from solar panels is fearmongering.\n\nWhile I agree with not blindly applying a political filter, it does seem rather clear in this case that this particular organization is torturing facts to fit a political agenda.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2832031751001653,"1.1.1_stance":-0.29131798446178436,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18553405273567425,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09665805287659168,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1431247269573978,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18877979282122984,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.019471481680132758,"solar_1":-0.12639196612459003,"solar_2":-0.20816186277860993,"solar_3":-0.040981623712771885,"solar_4":-0.08835673319602695,"solar_5":-0.09082527636201121,"solar_6":-0.004145205091238798,"solar_7":-0.1061594149893305,"solar_8":-0.011278148641698257,"solar_9":-0.05180756906531769,"solar_10":-0.03579891200449007},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Then I started looking at some numbers. In the US, we have 320 million people, and currently produce about 4.2 trillion kWh per year.  Well, we don't consume all of that, some of it is lost in transmission.  We consume, round numbers, 4 trillion kWh per year.   The funny thing is that our electricity use has grown rapidly from, well, the first days of public electricity availability until about 2010/2011, when [it suddenly and spectacularly stopped growing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/201794/us-electricity-consumption-since-1975/). I'm at a loss.  That's an amazing thing.  \n\nStill, that's a lot of electricity.\n\nHmmm.  divide both numbers by a million, we get 4,200,000 and 320.  4,200,000 divided by 320 is... 13,125, divided by 365 days... call it 36 kWh per person, per day.   My whole family doesn't use more than about 1000 kWh a month, so I don't use more than about 8 kWh per day, personally, at home. Let me check that math... 8 kWh per day for me, 32 kWh per day for my family of four, times 30 days is 960, times 12 months is 11,520 kWh per year.  [Average household consumption is 11,700 per year](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-household-electricity-consumption).  So, it appears that average US household electricity use is 22% of the total US consumption, which means that 78% of consumption is government, industrial and/or commercial use. \n\nOf course, Global household use is much lower than US household average use.  \n\nBack to my point.  If I had solar panels to generate all of the electricity I personally use, about 8 kWh per day, I'd need... let me round up to 10 kWh to make the math easier and to account for losses... 10 kWh divided by 5 hours of full sun is 2 kW of solar panels.  At 200 watts per square meter I'd need 10 square meters of solar panels.   Not too bad for just me, and that seems to be an easy round number to use as a metric.  I'd need 40 square meters of solar to cover my family of 4.   It's also less than the footprint of my house.  \n\nBut!  Solar isn't our only option. We also have wind. Let's suggest that wind could cover only a quarter of the energy need, and solar could only cover a quarter of the need.  We still have hydro-electric and nuclear as options (I know, nuclear isn't renewable, but it is still an option).  \n\nMaybe we could stop selling electricity to businesses at 1/6th of the price we sell to consumers?  Or, maybe businesses could buy their own solar panels and put them on their much larger roofs?  Maybe we shouldn't use 3 to 4 times as much electricity as the global average?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.012146998274450501,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13404872894311098,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22522401609000797,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.34166174199993915,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3675022915636267,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3006757564802065,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07329583122433785,"solar_1":-0.12027276447527886,"solar_2":-0.2987053479376428,"solar_3":-0.019394596256461227,"solar_4":-0.026169394392127288,"solar_5":-0.014998985671506185,"solar_6":-0.0016881409277023824,"solar_7":-0.011410479271338167,"solar_8":-0.007270521108390919,"solar_9":-0.10134025377434834,"solar_10":-0.039807011374553745},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Apologies if you have already come across this information in your research, or if you're just downvoting useful information because you're angry.  I've already written it so I might as well post it.\n\n## Price Arbitrage / Load Shifting ##\n\nAs you know, we are still in the early days of storage and minimizing installed capacity is the only way to optimize your investment.  Even in markets with good price arbitrage profits (time of use rates), it only makes sense to invest what you can easily afford, and build only enough that your arbitrage capacity is fully utilized on most days to get your money's worth.  \n\nOn a good day you may be able to bank 50kWh and use it all overnight, but how many days of the year will you fall short on either generation or usage?  If you can only fully charge and/or discharge the battery 25% of the year, your profits will be greatly reduced.  A 25kWh battery that you fully utilize 75% of year will be a better return on investment.\n\nThe Powerwall is really optimized for use in conjunction with strong price signals and grid-interactive services, but those are rolling out slowly to only a few markets a year around the world.\n\n## Backup ##\n\nIf you are in a rural area with unreliable power service, off-grid capability can be really valuable, but it is a very different set of requirements.  I assume the reason you want five Powerwalls is to absorb the full 25kW of your solar array, but splitting your array into two sections (off-grid-capable and grid-tie-only) may be a more cost effective way to achieve the same goal.\n\nTesla systems can be installed with a generator, but a manual or automatic transfer switch is required to select either PW+Solar **OR** generator power to supply the home.  The PW charges only from solar, but can charge regardless of its connection to the grid or the home, and the generator will run 100% of the time until the PW can take over again.  \n\nOther types of systems can cycle the generator like a hybrid car to keep the battery charged, even when solar is low or absent.  When you really need emergency power, how likely is it to coincide with best-case solar output?  You will never really be prepared without a generator.\n\nFurther question to consider:\n\n* How much energy do you really need while off grid?  Can you adjust the thermostat, turn off the pool heater, and hang clothes on the line until the grid comes back up?  \n\n* Likewise, how much simultaneous power do you really need while off grid?  Can you time the EV charger to run while the air conditioner is off, or after the batteries finish charging in the morning?\n \n* Can you invest in efficiency upgrades that will reduce battery usage as well as cut power bills the rest of the year?\n\n* Does it make sense to move some circuits to a critical loads panel, so that backup power is not fed to the entire house?\n\n## Installation ##\n\nOther posters were not as specific about why large battery systems are more difficult to install.  You may already have a subpanel for your 25kW solar array, but does it have enough capacity to add a second 25kW of battery input?  There may need to be an additional line-side tap, and extra panels or breakers added simply to ensure the sum of grid+battery+solar cannot overload any given panel.  On big jobs there are always things that come up, like needing to add a load panel or a generator input even if it wasn't included at first simply to make it meet the customer's expectations.\n\nPlus the usual fun about how much it costs a company to give free quotes and give complicated designs away to people who will probably balk at the price and not call them back.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006433214293792844,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13062486452095073,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2881228031064935,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.281222775904152,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2636406462167642,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2677672366836461,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3695723518418769,"solar_1":-0.21112405315630328,"solar_2":-0.14118781751343443,"solar_3":-0.10408109887806093,"solar_4":-0.26661464958420994,"solar_5":-0.27167717726357904,"solar_6":-0.06825452571916665,"solar_7":-0.0602544581393308,"solar_8":-0.03801071479153683,"solar_9":-0.02598719814697148,"solar_10":-0.22051107880389095},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

On over vast days currently by 8-9am I’m already in the 3-4K watt range which is enough for me to live, as I have an inverter style AC maxing at approx 2.5k watts. Stove would be out of the picture most like until closer to mid day. It hits 4-5k watts. Add one ensemble battery and I’d be in a good spot.\n\nIf you just want battery backup without doing either of the above a cheap MPP Solar inverter w/ some 100ah or larger LIFePO4 cells will give a decent amount of run time. You will need to balance them upon first use and a BMS would be preferred but not required for all new cells in this chemistry. A top or bottom balance yearly just for maint purposes should suffice. With this solution you would either put your critical loads on the MPP Solar inverter and it becomes a fancy custom UPS/battery backup device or you could likely put breakers on both sides and backfeed the power to a sub panel or main panel, just ensuring either source or destination breakers are not on at the same time creating a circle. \n\nSolArk is another solution that is on the market not sure if your optimizers will work with it and it’s not cheap, but a possibility too. \n\nBecause I have 44 360w Panels w/ EnPhase swapping 1/2 to the IQ8s when they arrive, buying a EnPhase batt and smart switch is my preferred route.

It's not AC coupled, it's just a hybrid operating normally.\n\nIt was only until they replied to my post that they mentioned generation.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007365440251305699,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05718889927229611,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.0708719330529372,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16887012869119644,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29193827054182797,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20322149740057208,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03762586789283281,"solar_1":-0.006342893543963631,"solar_2":-0.00801544178587695,"solar_3":-0.00024483283050358295,"solar_4":-0.0004346324300665098,"solar_5":-0.00013095336180413142,"solar_6":-0.00018685177201405168,"solar_7":-0.0014838408678770065,"solar_8":-0.0001079944825808828,"solar_9":-0.0041616789530962706,"solar_10":-0.006840381693715851},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (the reference group is not explicitly stated as a personal group in the text)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.","1.3.3_second_order":"none.","solar_1":"NO.","solar_2":"NO.","solar_3":"NO.","solar_4":"NO.","solar_5":"NO.","solar_6":"NO.","solar_7":"NO.","solar_8":"NO.","solar_9":"NO.","solar_10":"NO."},"year":2024},{"comment_index":13998,"comment":"That is because solar installers are largely scumbags who prey on people that don't know the industry and how billing for bulk versus retail works.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"frustrated but still pro"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002529655039931337,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1360959243029356,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19842377982738604,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06159538651506106,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21966188253624827,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.0030717698003475866,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04128350609486612,"solar_1":-0.001007629616651684,"solar_2":-0.0006225802935659885,"solar_3":-0.003825851163128391,"solar_4":-0.0027371890707096704,"solar_5":-0.00019022470708781233,"solar_6":-0.06028971399783245,"solar_7":-0.0014296727216181655,"solar_8":-0.0008923403996353348,"solar_9":-0.005161182722076774,"solar_10":-0.031761561830838524,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.2486897848870285},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

However, this is precisely the point that Singer is arguing about, so restating the assumption doesn't cover any new ground.\n\n&gt;Veganism is -- by definition -- against all animal exploitation, no matter how the animal is treated.\n\nYou don't seem to know what the words [by definition](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vegan) mean.\n\n&gt;You don't see how those aren't compatible?\n\nI disagree with your definition of veganism, as do most dictionaries and encyclopedias.  This doesn't mean you are wrong, it means we are talking past one another by using the same words to mean different things.  Regardless, you are also conflating two different meanings of the word [exploit](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exploiting).  Singer's defense of the \"exploitation\" of animals would only apply to the first definition, not the latter.  The definition of exploit that the Vegan Society uses also refers exclusively to the latter, as is clear from their stance on horse riding:\n\n\" Question: Are vegans against horse racing and horse riding?\n\nAnswer: Vegans oppose all forms of exploitation of animals. Each situation needs to be carefully considered to see if this applies.\"\n\nIndeed, most conceptions of human and animals rights would object to the exploitation of humans or animals according to the latter definition, rather than the former. \n\n&gt;Veganism isn't a diet, though.\n\nYes, it is.  It is more than a diet, granted, but if a person eats strictly vegan they are vegan [by definition](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vegan), regardless of the philosophical beliefs they may or may not have to support their behavior.  I understand that you value your lifestyle as a vegan, but the fact that it is a lifestyle for you does not make it a lifestyle for everyone else.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002172324423251363,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21168528517766155,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16426526092200658,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.272838425346385,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.30533425216069565,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2668039574040975,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.021317314666589482,"diet_1":-0.02460679373446813,"diet_2":-0.06896326674420077,"diet_3":-0.058904448811517796,"diet_4":-0.0056651408328131465,"diet_5":-0.00797101913849474,"diet_6":-0.002700909332209752,"diet_8":-0.0030575512431217553,"diet_9":-0.0010159959044055238,"diet_10":-0.002892637137847487,"diet_11":-0.0012796666930322924,"diet_13":-0.0034053360407900377,"diet_14":-0.006734129498606005,"diet_17":-0.0017662042913192029},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

If it's so important to you that you have a vegan animal, why don't you pick one of those?\n\n\nIf you're absolutely set on having a dog, let me say this: Contrary to what \"allergic\" says dogs are not \"omnivores just like humans\" they are omnivores but they evolved to have meat make up a larger portion of their diet than vegetation. Humans evolved to have vegetation make up most of our diet and meat a smaller portion.\n\nMost humans can do well on a vegan diet and a small exception cannot. Most dogs cannot do well on a vegan diet and a small exception can.\n\nThere is a better chance that if your dog's diet is merely ovo-vegetarian (meaning it will include eggs but no dairy) it can be healthy, but you're going to want to consult a vet and be very careful about what food you feed your dog (no cheap food that contains corn or wheat). Hint: it will be expensive.\n\nI appreciate your commitment to your veganism, but projecting that onto an animal that has evolved to need meat (or at the very least eggs), is selfish and unfair to the animal that has no choice in what you are feeding it. If you absolutely cannot abide the idea of feeding your dog animal products, please do not get a dog.\n\n\nEdit: I wanted to edit this and say that if you DO decide to get a parrot - make sure to get it from a responsible breeder or rescue organization.

I'm also super picky about the way shoes fit my feet.\n\nLately, I gave [these](http://www.zappos.com/palladium-pampa-hi-black-black~1) a try and I really like them.  They're sort of a cross between a chuck taylor and a proper boot, but they seem much more durable (and comfortable) than chuck taylors but they're about as cheap.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001167948745811979,"1.1.1_stance":-0.004957695227850374,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3199006663918843,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23091143874592016,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.32052262698025996,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30774445476158974,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.09530959091110465,"diet_1":-0.01623040106397866,"diet_2":-0.001876455961943672,"diet_3":-0.010431748624190126,"diet_4":-0.03936501322702194,"diet_5":-0.0011968258501440232,"diet_6":-0.011723335114462921,"diet_8":-0.0009145958914184386,"diet_9":-0.011641673976553099,"diet_10":-0.06279553685453483,"diet_11":-0.030688321028719656,"diet_13":-0.016889423102829444,"diet_14":-0.2438794035303386,"diet_17":-0.001423144060630932},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear\n\n(There is an implied mention of vegan shoes, but it does not explicitly describe the behavior or prevalence of vegan shoe ownership or usage.)","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

The only way my parents would accept my refusal to eat those things was if I was making a commitment to vegetarianism and therefore stopping eating all meat. So I did. \n\nThen when I was 30-something, I decided to cut out all other animal products from my diet (ie. dairy products and eggs). I did this to see if it would make me healthier.\n\nBut once I had cut out all animal products, I started reading about the cruelty involved in dairy, egg and meat production. Since I had already quit contributing to this cruelty, I was more open to hearing this information...I didn't go into denial in order to make myself feel better, because I didn't need to. \n\nNow I stay vegan and I encourage others to go vegan, because I see every animal as the individual that he or she is. I don't believe that we humans have any right to just use animals for our own purposes. Especially when it comes to food. What right do we have to take away someone's life for a meal that we will chew up in our mouths for 10-15 minutes, and then shit out later on? We can just eat something else instead.

I started as a vegetarian shortly after, basically because I felt unhealthy.

It must be combined with other things, for it’s only part of the solution to a number of intersecting problems. Insofar as veganism is only concerned with the plight of those animals we coercively use as resources, it’s speciesist, since the climate disaster in motion is causing as we speak a mass extinction event of wild animals. Insofar as environmentalism overlooks some of the many ways humans force animals to labor and force animals to become raw materials, it is also inadequate (and speciesist). Insofar as both environmentalism and veganism overlook the exploitation of the masses of humans on earth, and explicitly or tacitly go along with capitalism as a mode of organizing social labor, they’re inadequate *and* impotent.\n\nSimply identifying as a “vegan” or as an “environmentalist” won’t do. So it’s not really worth the trouble to figure out how somebody primarily motivated by environmentalist reasons can truly label themselves a vegan. At the end of the day, these labels reference only partial glimpses of the truth. These glimpses are worth talking about, the outlines or borders of concepts like “veganism” and “environmentalism” are worth articulating, but it should be done as part of a larger effort to figure out how they fit together, like pieces in a puzzle.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004219490336254239,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12872242175662763,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17429081796506998,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19524626643897847,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19640543265208543,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.0880817516237092,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.26074061786979047,"diet_1":-0.040164442327901874,"diet_2":-0.15722066533369508,"diet_3":-0.3335452472056204,"diet_4":-0.027690537106536794,"diet_5":-0.008311622931311527,"diet_6":-0.08247782265243586,"diet_8":-0.007847606383923752,"diet_9":-0.0037351850793735744,"diet_10":-0.03334601427801923,"diet_11":-0.008499176379700657,"diet_13":-0.019309763910617523,"diet_14":-0.04985820062776223,"diet_17":-0.045297414011656656},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The whole reason my family is vegan IS for the sake of the animals but MOSTLY for the sake of the environment and the planet. That is the reason we are raising him vegan because we would like to be able to see him grow and live a life past the age of 25 with where the world is going at the current moment. I would hope that the values we instill upon him mean something to him and doesn’t just make him feel restricted and left out. When I say my family I mean my husband and myself, our whole rest of both side of our family aren’t vegan and are die hard carnists in fact. They have joked about feeding him steak n taters when he goes to visit and while that will not be acceptable until he can make his own decision on it, I would not have a problem if one day he does decide to eat what they made.  I miss eating Chick-fil-A more than I can even begin to explain but I will never eat there or support that company again bc it doesn’t feel right TO ME. Being vegan isn’t about trying to control everyone’s diets and preferences it’s honestly doing what feels morally right for yourself and trying to be the change we (vegans) would like to see in the world.
