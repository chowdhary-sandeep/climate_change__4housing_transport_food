"comment": "Was wondering where the money is coming from...\n\nFound this from National Wind watch, link:\nhttps://www.wind-watch.org/faq-economics.php\n\nQuestion: \"How much subsidies do wind power developers get?\"\nAnswer: \"At the federal level, the production or investment tax credit and double-declining accelerated depreciation can pay for two-thirds of a wind power project. Additional state incentives, such as guaranteed markets and exemption from property taxes, can pay for another 10%\"\n\nQuestion: \"How much does it cost to build a wind power facility?\"\nAnswer: \"Construction of a wind power facility costs between $1 million and $2 million per megawatt of capacity.\"\n\nSo this implies that someone (besides the gov) is paying for 1/3rd of the cost to put one of these up. \n\nFrom this link, http://www.tradewindenergy.com/windlibrary_sub.aspx?id=136\n\"The output of a wind turbine depends on the turbine's size and the wind's speed. Utility-scale wind turbines being manufactured now for the U.S. market have power ratings that range from 1.5 megawatts to 3.0 megawatts.\"\n\nAssuming the average wind turbine is at the low end of 1.5 megawatts, (and on the cheap side of 1 million per megawatt capacity) each wind turbine costs 1.5 million dollars to put up. The government paid 1 million, and someone else paid $500k, but why would anyone do that???\n\n\"The federal production tax credit (PTC) currently provides 2.2 cents for every kilowatt-hour of a privately owned wind turbine’s production for ten years.\" -National Wind Watch website.\n\nAssuming 14 mph constant wind speed producing 100 kilowatts each hour. Which is $2.20 per hour, $52.8 per day, $19,272 per year.. and after 10 years only $190,272.\n\nAn equivalent interest rate of about 3.23% would be required (compounded daily) to create the same return on investment.\n\nSo why would someone invest in a wind farm? Because it would be a steady investment for 10 years (If they believed the wind would be blowing at a constant rate of 14 mph, for 10 years.)   I'm pretty sure the CEO of A.C.M.E. wind farm inc. pays himself a nice salary.",

Most of the dealerships wouldn't even answer any questions via email, only responding to call or come in.  Most of the dealerships I called wouldn't give very useful information over the phone, only responding that I should come in.  It seems to me like many dealerships don't want information in print and they like playing emotional games with people.  I would be happy to be proven wrong about this.  \n\nAt this point the California EV rebate is exhasuted, so any EV is going to have be used or wait for additional rebate funding from the state.",

"comment": "Where are you getting this number that you can drive 4 miles on a kilowatt?  And 10 hrs of sunlight?  You do understand that solar power output is not always 100% right. Unless your panels move with the sun as it goes from east to west, they don't produce the power you think they do. (More pro solar team crap??)  What about clouds?  What about dust?  What about morning dew?  10 Hrs??? Maybe in Alaska in the summer...\n\nThe battery is the part you left out too.  You would have to store that power from the panels?  So the cost goes up even more.  And the size of battery vs the gallons of gas is way different.  \n\ntype \t            -             MJ/Kg \t\n \nLi - Ion \t      -           0.6 \t\n\nNiMH \t             -            0.4 \t   Prius\n\nAlkaline \t       -         0.6 \t\n\nNiCd  \t   -            0.14 \t\n\nLead Acid \t      -           0.14 \t\n\nGasoline \t    -             45 \t\n\nBattery technology is clearly far behind liquid fuels in terms of energy density and compactness: to store the same amount of energy as in gasoline, the batteries would weigh a little less than 100 times more.  \n\n\nAgain, the problem is your skewed math, the problem comes up when you reach the end of the performance of both cars.  In a gas car, you just fill up again, and on the electric car, you done.  You will have to plug in and start charging, or drag out 100 panels and set them up on the side of the road. \n\nI agree, there is potential in solar, as it's a free power source that we can harness.  But the science behind the harnessing, and storage is not there yet.  Maybe in the future we can get the power we need from the solar panels, and create a car that can produce enough power from the sun to keep it charged as it drives.  And batteries that will provide enough storage to keep then running on cloudy days.  That is the only way you could move from gas to electric here in the states.",

That's just over 6% of their entire production for the next 13 years if they were all long range BEVs, but of course, most of their production will go into PHEVs. It's maybe half the cell production of Tesla's Gigafactory 1. That's not good for one of the world's biggest automakers. It's basically all going to China, as this is about the size necessary to minimally comply in China.",

"comment": "26:40 Why do vegans need to eat these things again?  Okara coming from tofu and other similar plant waste can be composted (in fact it's sometimes *difficult* to use okara as feed, because it begins decomposing so quickly) even if we're going to produce these things in the first place, it doesn't have to be fed to animals.  \"Throw them away and leave them to rot\" implies he doesn't know of or understand what composting is, and how important it could be for a closed (that means \"more sustainable\") food system.  The food grass-fed cows grazing on land unsuitable for crop cultivation would be a small fraction of what is consumed today, so much so that the resulting diet would be nearly vegan anyway (I think I remember seeing one estimate being ~10% of calories coming from animal products, including seafood, which is horribly unsustainable and I think is debatable whether it should have been included or not because Annual Catch Limits are still often too high for [a number](http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2015/11/04/why-are-cod-struggling/) of interrelated environmental reasons), and could be used for other things (like switchgrass biofuel production) anyway.  \n\n29:00 Not being perceived as \"cool\" by others is not a reason to avoid something.  We shouldn't do anything new or different because most other people won't understand it at first?  Well, goodbye innovation I guess.  \n\n30:40 \"That's exactly what Tesla did.  They understood how people function.\"  They understood how a select small number of people function, and instead of trying to change their flawed perception of what are acceptable priorities, they choose to cater to them and reinforce them.  \"The right way to change a broken system is not to ask people to give up what they want\".  That is a really mindlessly consumerist viewpoint.  There are things that actually make people happy, and ever increasing consumption is not one of them.  It simply tricks us into [thinking](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full) that it were true.  \"Indirectly make them do the right thing\".  That is a proscription for short-term benefit, not long term benefit.  If you don't get people to understand the underlying issues involved, the reasons \"why\" something should be done, not just \"what\" to do, they will not understand when the next problematic product comes along and tricks them into thinking over-consumption continues to be okay.  \"Keep the comfort and convenience and remove the problem.\"  I don't know what he thinks is going to be happening in the future, but if we continue our consumption the way we are neither of those things is going to be around for much longer. [One war has already been triggered by climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War), and we're having trouble dealing well with the refugee problem even that single example has caused.  \n\n32:30  Vegans who know what they're talking about do understand these things (except the nutritious part, because that's wrong).  Vegans just don't think that any of those reasons are a sufficient excuse for industry standard practices like de-beaking, starving, life-long confinement of, or killing an animal. \n\n35:53 \"The right way to change a broken system is to give people the benefits that they love but make them do the right thing indirectly.\"  This is a nitpick, but, that is not the right way to change a broken system, that is the least disruptive way to generate short term benefit within the system.  If we wanted the greatest long term benefit, there are other actions that might work better.  \n\n37:50 and onward. So lower land, water, and GHG use, but higher energy, high capital investment, higher cost (for now- to be fair the early adoption premium is a part of any new product)?  Why not just eat beans?  The solution doesn't have to require all of this hand-wringing and high technology and investment.  Honestly.  \n\n39:37 Sure, at first I felt like I was giving up taste and convenience when I went vegan.  But I gave it a fair chance and boy was I wrong.  I eat more foods and more varied food than ever because of what I learned.  Cooking without raw meat or eggs is easier because I don't have to worry about cross-contamination, and I can taste almost everything I'm making at any time for seasonings or proportions because the raw version won't make me sick.  Back when I cooked meat I'd routinely forget to defrost it the night before, which always ruined my day.  I never have that problem now because you can cook fruits and vegetables from frozen if you buy them that way.  There are so many other benefits it's hard to list them all, but another significant one is that my cooking has gotten better because I have more energy and less stress, because I'm eating foods that don't make me lethargic and irritable.  So yeah, I thought I was going to give up taste and convienece, but it turns out I was wrong.  \n\n39:45 \"People will not give up their prefrences to do the right thing.\"  People have already done that.  And looking at the growth of veganism, more and more people are doing it.  Just because this person does not want to give up meat completely (and I DO commend him for reducing the amount he eats) does not mean that everyone thinks the way he does.  \n\n40:00 As noted earlier, there are better reasons why it would not be a good thing.  \"Or treated inhumanely: they could have just... one.. bad day in their life.\"  So killing you would be okay, because it would be \"just one bad day\"?  I think he should seriously think about whether that's really an argument he would accept if it was his own life on the chopping block, or not.  We don't excuse human violence against humans by saying \"they only had to suffer one bad day.\"  \n\n40:50 \"You can't expect companies to do what's right if it'll make more profit for them.\"  It's so ironic that he can get the main idea right, but then doesn't appy it correctly in a way that completely recognizes what's going on.  Suffering is bad, and these companies produce suffering, so let's... put that to the back of our minds and hype the major solution as lab-grown meat!  Not hype rejection of the industry and products themselves? Suffering is bad, and these companies produce suffering, so let's... consume less of them!  Why not just recommend not consuming them *at all* as the goal?  (And reducing consumption as a way to get there, if it has to be talked about.)\n\nLook, I accept reducitarianism is better than not doing anything.  But it should not be the *final recommendation* in a video (or any other piece of media or mode of communication) that tries to treat the issue comprehensively.  \n\nIf you want a comprehensive goal, Veganism is the goal for these issues.  It is not the endpoint of all moral consideration.  There will still be things to think about and do for these problems beyond veganism.  But veganism is a huge step that takes a large chunk out of all of them (and it doesn't have to be a restrictive or as difficult as many people think).  \n\n41:12 \"Because there is no tax on carbon\".  This is another nitpick, but: that's an oversimplification (granted, it was probably meant to be) and there are many, many other proposed remedies.  This is a huge topic, there isn't agreement on it, and there isn't agreement that it would be solved by this one thing.  \n\n41:38 \"But we don't pay for the carbon, for the forests cut down to create pastures...\"  You know what we also don't pay for?  The animal's labor.  Funny how humans get to sell their own labor (and if they don't we call it slavery), but animals don't even get to do that.  They do not voluntarily enter into this arrangement, so you can't even call their involvement wage slavery.  \n\n42:49 \"Imagine a world in which it's more profitable to go green than to pollute.\"  This is exactly the minor criticism I leveled of a carbon tax being seen as a panacea to all environmental problems. Green house gases are not the only type of pollution.  Would a carbon tax reduce heavy metal pollution? If not, than a carbon tax is not the only thing that needs to be done (it's only the first thing).  \n\n\nThanks for the video.  It had a lot of incorrect ideas longtime vegans have seen many times before, but it was still a lot better than most fitness videos on meat consumption.  \n\nI just wish he had come to a different conclusion.  Maybe watch Earthlings instead of Cowspiracy.",

So it makes pretty much perfect sense to me. 90% of miles are electric, the others petrol and seems they have charging stations they will be sat there charging too so will get more than 70 miles range a day.\n\nPeople need to be eased into electric they want the backup of an engine to drive continuous miles incase they need it.

Sooner or later Croatia is going to adapt and it'll pass dedicated laws, and at that time all the people who bought hyperscooters in the meantime are going to get shafted.\n\nCroatian sellers rebrand the Aerlang H6 as the [MS-Energy E20](https://www.emove-store.com/trgovina/ms-energy-e-romobil-e20-dark-grey/); if I had to buy a scooter in Croatia right now I'd probably go for that one. Unrestrict it and it'll happily do 45kmh, but you can keep it restricted for going around the centre when legislation gets eventually passed.\n\nOr a Chinese scooter like a Unicool VDM-10,  perhaps.

If grid designers/operators do their jobs well, adding lots of EVs will actually improve grid stability when all is said and done.\n\nThis is much less likely to be true for heat pumps.  The incentives in the IRA will result in a huge wave of heat pump installs and in colder climates, this could add as much load as EV charging.  However, unlike EV charging, heat pump load will likely be coincident with grid peaks and isn't as easily scheduled/managed.",

A golf-sized hatchback is more than enough car for most people unless they have a huge family.\n\n\n>paying for an extra 10-15% battery capacity is unlikely to be a popular choice\n\n\nOn the contrary, that's exactly what people want - the option to pay for more range without having to \"upgrade\" to a huge luxury vehicle they don't want or need.\n\n\n>aspects that are extremely important to buyers: performance, handling, ride comfort and efficiency\n\n\nEVs are already really efficient in stop-start traffic where constant acceleration and deceleration are a factor. For high-speed cruising the drag coefficient has far more bearing on efficiency than weight. Heavier cars are no less comfortable than lighter ones - in fact usually the reverse is true. As for performance and handling, most people aren't really drivers and EV acceleration is already overkill.\n\n\nDammit I just want a car that can do everything an ICE hatchback can, except it's electric.

"comment": "For some reason it wont let me edit any of the fields when I go to it.  I would also point out that solar panels become less efficient over time.  When I purchased mine the paperwork for the power guarantee showed a declining efficiency that I want to say was something like approximately 85% power output after 20 years.\n\nAlso the cost of system doesn't scale unfortunately.  Because rebates only cover so much I have found that in real world numbers a lot of the time the smaller systems have the better ROI.\n\n  Also I have helped other people with their systems and in places like California where they have tiers of electricity.  So the 3rd  tier was like .21 /kwh for electricity but the second was .14/kwh and lowest was .07/kwh.  So in his case he needed a system that would cover the usage for the top 1 or 2 tiers of usage but not cover all of his usage for him to get the best ROI.\nSo for example say you use 2500 KWhrs of electricity a month on average.  The electricity company charges .07 an hour for the first 1000 hours.  .14/khw for the next 1000 hours and .21 and hour for the next 1000kwhs.  \n\nthat's 70+140+105=$315 a month.  having a system that produces about 1500kwhs a month is a good target to save you 245/month because the extra solar panels you need to do the last 1000 hours a .07 costs more than the electricity you are buying from the company at that price.\n\nI will have had my system for a year coming in July.  I am working on a spreadsheet showing real world results so I hope to have it up then.  That was 1 thing I found was hard to find was real world numbers when I was purchasing my system.",

"comment": "If when people had to figure the price of solar, the price of only off-grid systems was quoted to them, I think it would scare a lot of people away.  An on-grid system can be continuously upgraded to the point of having the capacity to be off-grid with the simple addition of batteries, then I think that's cool.  But batteries by far are the least appealing part of a solar system.  While a panel might still function at nearly what it did in 20 years later, a battery might be a cost you're having to replace every 5 years.\n\nThe Tesla S is a battery powered electric car, whereas the Prius is a hybrid.  As the Powerwall is a tesla device, it's easy to assume the interest is more akin to a Model S ($70k, niche) than a hybrid ($20k, near-ubiquitous), but that's wrong.  This isn't a solution to off-grid (which I think is significantly over-valued).  This isn't even akin to a drug dealer giving a taste.  That assumes off-grid is a goal.  This is more akin to the 'regenerative braking' of on-grid solar power.  Most people are still, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, best served by being attached to the grid.  We need technologies that take out the fragility of the grid.  You do that by ad-hoc decentralized networking.  Not by making 300 million islands.",

It also doesn't scale very well, and inconveniences people -- they have to go to a supercharger every day? \n\nAdditionally, with the inefficiencies of power transfer, and heat generated during battery charging/discharging, you're actually introducing quite a bit of inefficiencies in the system. I can only see this working if there is a significant overcapacity of solar power, and there needs to be a storage mechanism somewhere in the grid to offload this power. Currently, the grid in most municipalities aren't even close to this. But I can't think of a scenario where a good portion of the population would want to sell battery-stored power on a nightly basis, and keep that sustainable over a long period of time.",

"comment": "That's easy then.\n\nAll you need is a solar panel. A box and a battery, and some fuses obviously.\n\nFind out your total watt draw.\n\nLet's call it 15 watts? Multiply that by 24 to know how many watt hours you need per day. 15*24=360wh.\n\nSo let's say you get 4 hours of really high quality sunshine a day if you have a 100w panel that will be plenty to cover your needs and more.\n\nBuy literally any panel thats in the 100w range. \n\nGet yoself a battery.\n\n360wh/12v=30ah\n\nThat's how many ah it would drain per day. BUT remember it will be running solely off the solar panel during daylight hours.\n\nFind one of those 68ah yuasa batteries. That'll do fine. They come up for sale used all the time\n\nStick your battery in a box.\n\nConnect the wires to the battery.\n\nPoint solar panel southish. If you want to get fancy you could put it on a mount which you can change the angle of so better get winter sun.\n\nPut a fuse on your battery so it doesn't catch fire by accident or something.\n\nStick another wee fuse near your loads. It will only have to be a tiny one though. Maybe even a zener diode if you're feeling fancy.\n\nI've probably massively oversized this but with a bit of careful ebaying you should be able to find everything you need for about $200\n\nIf you want a simple charge controller stick one of those in too. Morningstar if you're rich. Chinese eBay special if not. If you're really dirty you could get a $5 voltage sensing relay and just set it to turn off the solar panels if it gets to 14.5v and turn back on about 13.8v\n\nThough for any panel under 100w you don't really need need one per se as the internal resistance of battery will keep things under control.\n\ndo not buy anything that says MPPT on it unless it costs well into the few hundred bucks range.\n\n\nPeople make this stuff a lot more complex than it has to be. Yes you could use all sorts of clever stuff for absolute maximum efficiency etc but KISS can't go wrong.",

It depends on how your utility company handles your rates, net metering, over production, etc. It also depends on what kind of incentives and rebates you have available. \n\nFor example, in my area we get 30% federal tax credit, 25% state tax credit, and a $1/W ($1000/kW) rebate on the system from the utility company (which is about to run out). So here it makes sense to go ahead and get the largest system you would need. But we don't get paid for excess generated beyond what we use, so going over 100% usage doesn't really make too much sense either. You have to look at what the system will cost you, estimated ROI, and figure out what makes sense in your situation.",

There are 2.2 million kg of silicon for every gallon of oil in the top 5000 meters of the earth’s crust.  2.2 million kg is enough silicon to make 200 GW of solar panels, the entire world has 303 GW. Not bad for the equivilant of a single gallon of oil.\n\nCarbon available for fuel is 100,000 times more scarce that silicon available for solar panels.  Silicon comprises 28 percent of the earth’s crust.  There are 1,570,800 trillion tons of silicon in the top 5000 meters of the earth’s crust.

"comment": "&gt; So many of us see fuel cells as some kind of threat to battery EVs. Doesn't make any sense. The biggest threat to both battery EVs is the gasoline status quo.\n\nHydrogen IS the gasoline status quo. It is a bullshit technology pushed primarily by oil companies (and a few of their less visionary big auto allies) because these same oil companies want to be the people who will continue to provide you your fuel. Rather than freeing yourself from their dependence by installing solar panels and getting a BEV, they want you to keep going to their fueling stations indefinitely.\n\nThis is why there has been such a monumental push for FCVs as the main strategy of getting us off gasoline/diesel - because it is the same dinosaurs pushing it!\n\n&gt;FCV gains are not EV losses.\n\nI disagree, which is the whole point of my post. FCV has been a distraction, a false hope, a false promise. It's existence perpetuated the fake \"weaknesses\" of BEV that were peddled by the same forces that funded FCV - oil companies. \n\nThere are many strategies used to push this, one of which was pointing to areas where it is suggested batteries will never work (like long distance transport, or busses, or airplanes, etc). and then saying that FCV's are ready to fill that gap. As it turns out the rapid improvements in batteries so far (and obviously, we can expect more in the future) makes FCV another \"god of the gaps\" whereby the gap keep shrinking, until only really niche applications are left, like remote areas, or harsh climates, etc... and even those are just as vulnerable to Batteries taking over as well. \n\n&gt; Batteries have an energy density problem that will never compete with Fuel Cells.\n\nImproving all the time, we can't even imagine the things that will be invented in the future when much more demand is put on these technologies. For all you know, supercapacitors we can't even dream of yet will make your statement (and so many others like it) sound like Bill Gates saying 640k ram should be enough for anyone!\n\nAlso, is it fair to compare just the weight of batteries / weight of hydrogen fuel? I think you should include the giant pressurized tank, all of the extra plumbing, fuel cells, etc. with the weight for a more fair comparison. It's not like you can leave that stuff behind. Speaking of which, how much is the comfort/user experience worth to you? Because the space available for a passenger compartment is severely limited with FCV's due to the extra equipment necessary. I know this has nothing to do with energy density but these are much more practical considerations when you bring up energy / space ratio.\n\n&gt;Let's not forget that if you are one of the millions of people who don't have overnight parking near a charger, EVs are a basically a non-starter. If you live near an H2 station and it is adequately supplied, you can grab some on the way to work just like a \"regular car\"\n\nWhat a ridiculous thing to say. Installing an EV charger is a few thousand dollars, these are already popping up everywhere in major cities (even whole countries like Norway!) and will be ubiquitous in 10 years, as we transition to EVs. You don't need much new infrastructure as our power grid is everywhere. This is the exact opposite to Hydrogen, which has almost zero stations anywhere, and will cost a shit ton to install/upgrade the logistical network, pumping infrastructure, etc. You WILL be forever tethered to a gas station, you WILL forever have to give them money to fill up, significantly more than charging directly with electricity in your own home / work / shopping mall / road side parking stall etc.",

There are other cases were an additional meter is required but that is for measuring generation not the electricity being sold out.    \n\n&gt;  I estimate it takes 30- 100 watt panels per person in your home.\n\nDO NOT use 100 watt 12V solar modules (not panels) for residential projects.   You will over spend significantly.  It is far far cheaper to use grid tie 250+ watt PV modules.\n\n&gt; The shorter runs you have to your inverters are key.\n\nWhat?   grid tie solar is 350V or higher, short runs are not an issue.  You can not scale up RV 12V systems to residential like this.\n\n&gt; I have installed modular systems so you don't have to buy them all at once\n\nGrowing grid tie is not really that practical.  You need new permits with every expansion and it can reset your Net metering contracts which often mean lose of incentives.\n\n&gt; Measure your KW per hour your home uses during the day and calculate total panels.\n\nYou want to measure your kWh annual or monthly average from the bills.

If you are one of the lucky few who can, absolutely, you should be doing that, but everyone can switch their diet, and in fact the vast majority of people living in the developed world would be much healthier if they did switch their diet.\n\nAs well, we are multitaskers, we don't have to focus on only one action at a time, I am entirely capable of getting an electric car, installing some solar panels **and** switching my diet, all at the same time! And doing so would put me far further along towards sustainability than only switching the first two and not my diet.",

However if you are just doing a charging station in your home to work completely separate you may just fine. I generally like to keep it tied to the grid as most owners charge the car at night, so no storage is needed. Using the battery storage anyways would not be very cost-effective. \n\nThe only charging applications that I've worked with are 240v and 110v applications. I highly recommend a 240 plug and paying the electrician to have installed. It will be much cheaper charging at home and if you can do it while you're asleep and wake up to a full charge even better.",

Even existing plants emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant. However, all plants also emit 4.4 g-CO2e/kWh from the water vapor and heat they release. This contrasts with solar panels and wind turbines, which reduce heat or water vapor fluxes to the air by about 2.2 g-CO2e/kWh for a net difference from this factor alone of 6.6 g-CO2e/kWh.\n\n • On top of that, because all nuclear reactors take 10-19 years or more between planning and operation vs. 2-5 year for utility solar or wind, nuclear causes another 64-102 g-CO2/kWh over 100 years to be emitted from the background grid while consumers wait for it to come online or be refurbished, relative to wind or solar. \n\n• Overall, emissions from new nuclear are 78 to 178 g-CO2/kWh, not close to 0. \"\n\nsource:\n\n [https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/NuclearVsWWS.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/NuclearVsWWS.pdf)",

Like in a 30 day billing period if you hit 10+KW demand once you may as well hit that same 10+KW every day since you're already committed to that $33 demand charge. I hope that's right, because getting hit with $33 plus actual usage per day would be over $1000 a month. Considering solar here again and I'm not 100% clear on how the billing works. My last place was grandfathered into SRP's net metering billing but its all significantly different now.",

Panel vans are available to everyone, but typically more popular and better suited for the preferred value/economics/functionality by commercial enterprise. In a similar way, some solar panels in product lines are better suited/more preferred by commercial buyers. Hence the model above not targeting the homeowner aesthetic preferences, for example.\n\nIn both cases you get similar transportation or similar solar power production. But you might prefer another model, and the manufacturer realizes that in their marketing and pricing.",

"comment": "How we do expansions varies by install. Sometimes we'll add a second stand-alone system, sometimes we can add panels to the existing inverter, and sometimes we'll put a new inverter in to handle the additional and existing panels. For SCE and PG&amp;E, you can expand up to 1 kW DC without signing a new NEM and giving up your NEM 1.0 grandfather. For over 1 kW, we generally pull a permit, but don't submit a new NEM. We wait until the Utility says something (they never have), and at that point, we can submit the NEM 2.0 paperwork with the finaled permit. So, I would recommend getting a few quotes. Any solar installer can do expansions, so it would be helpful to see if a few of them propose the same solution.",

With the low interest, your PV system actually outperforms your saving account significantly. Good choice on the PV panels -- 5BB 144 cells monocrystalline. That is the mainstream product on the market now. It helps put less panels (labor and racking) on the roof for the same output rating. Great job!!",

"comment": "Solar is a very simple job yet there are countless little details you have to watch for when installing. I lead a crew of solar installers on residential installs and I can say if you're looking at kits you're probably going to end up with some questionable hardware. For most people to install solar on their house it involves a permit since you have to interconnect it to your service. Permits mean inspections so code compliance is essential. In terms of manufacturers for roof racking it varies. If it is a shingle room I would high recommend Iron ridge as it's the simplest to install and everything is 7/16 where some other constantly vary bolt sizes through the system. Everything these days has to be rapid shutdown compliant so if you are looking for a system you should look into microinverters (Enphase IQ7s are a godsend) or if you are dead set on a DC system then a Solaredge central inverter paired with DC optimizers is the easiest install you're going to get. I can not stress this enough. You MUST have the interconnection done properly and to code. This means if you are doing a line side taps that you tie your neutral and ground together in the disconnect before the final connection point. If you plan on doing a backfeed breaker you have to make sure you panel can accept the additional load. Solar is a trade and if not done right you can either burn your house down, fry a lineman, or create mold and rot in your attic due to leaks from improperly flashed lags. Do your research and be careful. And know your code!",

"comment": "\"There is no global cliamate\" Fair enough, yea...\n\n\"There is no global average temperature\" Mathematically, there is. Sum the average temperaturs of different regions and make the average of those. Climate change means the collective rise of all these region's temperatures, meaning that this statement does not contradict anything really.\n\nAnd you're gonna have to show source on that claim that wind and solar power is causing droughts.\n\nAs for your third point, refer to evrrything in the conversation. Rural stations do NOT show a slight decline (again, American rivers running dry, European weather warming in general, Canada and Britain warmer to the point of fertility), there isn't a global climate but that doesn't contradict the climate change theory anyways, and there is a crisis because climate is changing rapidly and brutally. And no, the only solution isn't to \"adapt\", because use logic. If excessive human intervention and action in Nature caused this, restricting human intervention and action in Nature will solve it. Not like other living species can \"adapt\" that fast anyways.\n\nCO2 avoidancd does not help in the sense that doing just CO2 avoidance is like giving thoughts and prayers on a disaster: It's not enough. Sure, it does *something* (note: giving thoughts and prayers does not do anything, that was a bad analogy, sorry), but that's just one of a hundred problems. Sure, it's a stepping stone for solving the rest, but it's not the end of the climb. No one denies that CO2 avoidance solves everything: Everyone (that is informed) says that CO2 avoidance is a start.",

"comment": "Sure, every manufacturer with an underperforming inverter architecture loves telling you how this simply isn't a problem. They love telling you how the real issue is clouding and shading.\n\nI'm sitting here looking at a 6KW inverter connected to a 7.2KW array. The inverter started clipping in February. The orientation and slope for the array tells you that this will only get worse as we approach mid-summer. The inverter is now clipping for over 4 hours a day. The installer (the second largest installer in California) claims that their engineers got it right. The ILR is 1.2\n\nIt would have cost the customer ~200 bucks to toss in the 7.6KW inverter. Add to that, less than $100 for slightly beefier copper in three short segments of the system. I know that the upgrade is that simple because there are Powerwalls in the system. So there's a 'Generation Load Center' and a Gateway. That gets you around any issues with the preexisting main load center.\n\nIIRC, this would have come to less than one half of one percent in additional cost the the non-battery/gateway part of the system.\n\nThe installer want to charge ~$1500 to upgrade the system.\n\nThis is all to common a story. It happens because many installers rely on these outdated ILR rules as final design criterion as opposed to a rough starting point.",

I'm more disappointed that the FWD version is only rated for 250 miles though, meaning the AWD version will be even less. I know most non-Tesla EV ranges should be taken with a grain of salt (Mach-E 4X is rated for 270 mi, Model Y LR is rated for 325, but both get 305+ in the real world), but I was hoping the NA spec would have a bit more juice to compare favorably against the competition, especially after the extremely efficient and surprisingly quick RAV4 Prime. Hopefully we could see a TRD or Platinum trim in the future with a slightly larger battery and some more kick to it, something like 270mi and 300+hp on the AWD version.\n\nWe also lose the solar roof and yoke in the NA spec, though they felt more like gimmicks than honest incentives to get the vehicle anyway.",

"comment": "The one major drawback about waiting is the UTILITY.  Net metering programs are grandfathered. That means getting 100% back what you give may disappear in a year or more. So if you wait, next year you may only get 50% on what you give. Where I live it's less than 50%. \n\nSo waiting is a good option in the sense of not pulling a trigger. On the other hand it's missing out on net metering options that make solar attractive.",

"comment": "I agree with a lot of these but have a more optimistic take on some.\n\nProduction emissions: Yes, these will still exist, but because the driving emissions will be zero a BEV driven for enough miles will eventually be net zero emissions, effectively cancelling out its production emissions relative to a gas car.\n\nPower generation emissions: Now that renewables are (in some cases) cheaper to build than continued operation of an existing fossil fuel powerplant, the grid will progressively get cleaner over time.  Increased electricity demand from EVs \\*may\\* accelerate the trend of building more renewable power because utilities will forecast increased electricity consumption and invest capital to meet demand.  Also, as others have mentioned, having an EV may incentivize people to install rooftop solar because they like the idea of driving for free.\n\nEnd of life processing: As others have mentioned, there are a bunch of companies working on pilot programs to recycle batteries right now.  I think the scarcity of battery materials and their high prices may actually work in our favor here, as there's a huge economic incentive to recover high-value materials from used batteries vs throwing them in a landfill.  It's kind of the opposite of plastics where it's so cheap to produce virgin plastic that there's no incentive for companies to develop expensive recycling methods.  By the time there is a critical mass of EVs on the road where end of life processing may become a serious issue, pretty much the entire vehicle should be recyclable, except maybe the plastic components.",

Which a hypothetical 1t year old EV battery wouldn't be. Hence worth significantly less.\n\nActual costs for new battery production for EVs are trending to $100/kWh right now, so battery value of a 40 kWh vehicle new would be $4000. Take half of that off for the battery being 15 years old (hence having less life available to pay off home battery system use) and you could be looking at $2000 used EVs. \n\nSodium ion battery tech is also expected to significantly drop battery cost for low end EVs over the next decade.",

"comment": "OP: Smart.  Glad you asked.  Those watt hours you don't use have been sometimes referred to as \"negawatts\".  \n\nIn most places, lighting is usually the easiest to focus on - such as replacing incandescent \"luminaires\" (bulbs) with LED or fluorescents.  Then, if you take time to replace other plug loads such small &amp; large appliances (when it is time to buy new or replace), you can work toward greater and greater efficiency - but do this over time so you're not replacing stuff before it has reached its economically useful life.  \n\nIn most climates, the home's \"envelope\" is often the next place to focus on for the best bang for the buck.  Air-sealing the \"pressure envelope\" together with improving the \"insulation envelope\" often gets very good payback.  You can consider upgrading windows as part of this effort, but doing this first - before air sealing, for example - rarely results in significant overall efficiency improvement by itself.  \n\nNext, consider HVAC upgrades.  Lots of possibilities to improve overall efficiency with furnaces, boilers, AC, water heaters.  \n\nAs to adding solar - solar all by itself really doesn't increase actual efficiency of how you use energy.  Sure, after investing in a solar energy collection system you might become very conscious of how you use the energy collected, but just adding solar is not a panacea.  Of course you should add solar.  But it is just not the best bang for the buck with respect to energy efficiency on its own.  \n\nAs to where I am coming from:  I have both PV and solar thermal systems on my home, and I have installed both on other houses.  I also have weatherized my 111 year old house (and even drive a Chevy Volt).  So, I have walked my talk.  A lot.  \n\nI have also trained and coached lots of home owners on weatherization, solar, and related topics.  I taught building related energy efficiency topics at a local community college for over ten years and served on the board of the local chapter of the American Solar Energy Society.  I have also conducted lots of energy audits of both houses and commercial buildings.  I am retired now, but I was very credentialed on the topics:  Licensed Professional Engineer, a RESENT HERS Rated, a LEED for Homes Green Rater, and a Certified Energy Manager.  I do lots less now due to a general re-direction to my life, but I still am loaded with lots of practical how-to knowledge.",

"comment": "If you are saying that a [SPAN panel](https://www.span.io/panel):\n\n1. Can do everything an electrical panel can do;\n2. Meets the requirements of 26 USC Section 25C(d)(2)(D); and\n3. Has additional features that are 100% dedicated to supporting battery storage technology,\n\nthen, you're still wrong regarding how the tax credit would be applied, but it might be possible to allocate the cost of the SPAN panel so that some of those costs qualify for a section 25C tax credit and the other costs qualify for a 25D tax credit.\n\nNotice that this is different from saying that the *entire* cost qualifies for *both* tax credits.\n\nSpecifically, the authority for this would be two IRS private letter rulings. The first is [IRS Private Letter Ruling 201130003](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/1130003.pdf), which, on page 5 says:\n\n>As represented by you, Manufacturer determined that x percent of the purchase price of the Condensing Unit relates to the generation of solar energy and use of this solar energy in your dwelling, and thus qualifies as a solar electric property expenditureunder § 25D. Manufacturer represented to you that this percentage was determined by totaling the costs of the Condensing Unit that are attributable to special modifications that allow it to operate with the Solar Energy System, relative to the total cost of the Condensing Unit.\n\nBasically, this paragraph says that the **extra** costs incurred that relate to the section 25D qualified properties qualify for the section 25D tax credit.\n\nThe second is a pre-Inflation Reduction Act [Private Letter Ruling 201809003](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/201809003.pdf), which, on page 4, says:\n\n>Accordingly, 100 percent of the energy used by the Battery must be derived from the sun. If this is not the case, the Battery does not meet the definition of “qualified solar electric property” in the Code.\n\nIn other words, the costs must be 100% dedicated to the Section 25D-qualified property.\n\nSo let's say that a standard electrical panel upgrade costs $2,000 and a SPAN panel costs $3,500.  Let's also assume that all of the SPAN panel's additional features are 100% dedicated to the battery.\n\nIf that's the case, a taxpayer could make a strong argument, based on the two private letter rulings, that $2,000 of the cost would qualify for a section 25C tax credit under 26 USC Section 25C(d)(2)(D) and the remaining $1,500 would qualify for a section 25D tax credit 26 USC Section 25D(a)(6).\n\nIn that case, the tax credits would be:\n\n* $2,000 x 30% = $600 for the section 25C tax credit; and\n* $1,500 x 30% = $450 for the section 25D credit.\n\n$600 + $450 = $1,050, which is not the same as the [$1,650 claimed by Lumin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7WmDLZAvSc&t=2624s)",

"comment": "First of all, Greenhouse Theory is completely messed up from what I can tell. Yes, it is true that so-called GHGs are instrumental in maintaining warmth in the lower atmosphere...to a degree. For all sorts of reasons due to complex interactions and exchanges between radiation and gases, warmth can only be trapped to a finite degree and the addition of more GHGs will just cause the same level of IR saturation earlier and lower in the atmosphere without any noticeable effect elsewhere. But without GHGs we would all be dead, no doubt about it.\n\nHowever, I think you do misunderstand some principles. The Sun does not warm the atmosphere to any significant degree (except in some specific cases). UV is absorbed by the ground, the molecules of solid substances absorb UV, get excited, bump into each other and cause heat, thus emitting a very broad spectrum including visible light and IR. That IR is then absorbed by certain gasses which get excited and bump into each other, causing heat and thus emitting IR, but IR at much longer wavelengths that cannot be re-absorbed by the same gas...but can be re-absorbed causing further heat by other gasses - primarily water vapour. But we are talking -50 to -100+ degrees C.\n\nConvection is so ridiculously complex, one cannot simply say that heat is transported or lost because of it. Neither does warming necessarily lead to convection. An example is a standard European 'heat wave'. The reason for the heat wave is there is no convection. Also, the atmosphere is subject to lapse rates depending on density and humidity, so a parcel of air will cool as it rises and warm as it descends. How far it rises depends on the adiabatic lapse rate vs the environmental lapse rate. Warm moist air is generally the most unstable and in a low-pressure area can convect all the way to the tropopause. The height of the tropopause is also highly variable which affects everything else!!! If the sea level temperature is high enough this could lead to a hurricane. But most convection needs a trigger such as being lofted by terrain or passing over a city. In the case of tropical storms moisture-laden air passes over particularly warm ocean regions. Indeed it is descending air that causes a lot of regional warming, for example, look up the Ferhn Effect to understand the mechanism. It is next to impossible to find any reliable information about this on the web but to understand the very basics of this you need to understand the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, the Hadley Cells, Ferrel Cells and the Polar Cells and how they all interact. If you understand this then you would soon realise that European heatwaves are just as likely in a cooling world as a warming one (more likely perhaps?).\n\nThen there is the effect in the sub-tropics (the interaction between the Hadley and Ferrel cells). This is a predominantly high-pressure dust-laden and primarily arid area of the world. The concentrations of dust in the lower atmosphere are so great in some areas that a significant amount of UV is converted to IR before getting to the ground causing warming directly in the atmosphere. I noticed this during my time in the Middle East as I did not need to use sunblock and sunlight was significantly attenuated despite temperatures in the 40s (deg C). Indeed, the attenuation and dust is so significant that solar panels are ridiculously inefficient. I believe at one time it took more energy to clean them than they could harvest!\n\nIn short, it is obvious that CO2 traps heat, but only to a degree. It is also obvious that there is no experimental evidence (other than using computer simulations) that back up any claims made by the theoreticians. We are clearly not seeing any felt changes in the climate compared to the past and we do not have sufficient quality data that goes back far enough to know that anything significant is changing. So...big picture...I agree with you.\n\nIf you want a recent example of where experts are so convinced they are correct that they will denounce anybody who dares to contradict them, look up the fallout from the Monty Hall Problem in probability. The world's best mathematicians all were wrong (maybe not all, but the vast majority) and that was a simple problem that you can work out with your fingers. We could be seeing this same situation with experts now but with something so ridiculously complex that it practically defies definition and explanation.",

Oddly the numbers were right when they installed it, but then started getting messed up a month later. The data was wrong for maybe a month total (because I didn't check it all the time and then I didn't email them for a bit, then it took them a bit to fix it), but my electric bill was correct, so it wasn't an issue with the actual connection and system.\n\nI think I saw a post on here a few days ago with a similar issue.

Every person on the planet eats mostly a vegetable diet (or a diet dependent on another living thing or things that eats a mostly vegetable diet); some of us have decided to cut out the non-real food items from our diet, i.e. edible but not nutritious ones like meat.\n\nThe B12 advice is good, but also no panacea. As you can see from my post and others, vegans are not a less depressed lot, just more realistic. I've been a vegan for almost a year and what I have gained is mostly clarity of thought.\n\nIt sounds like you want a magic bullet, not a cuisine change. May I suggest you start a subreddit: reddit/r/inuit_diet? This will get you [started](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_diet). If that isn't exotic enough for you, perhaps just go Atkins.\n\nWe live in a modern world that likely causes a lot of anxiety and therefore depression. You are better off finding ways of changing your life, work, life style, etc. as determining factors than what is on your plate.

Both are important, though the most significant impact would certainly come from people becoming vegetarians.\n\nWe also have to be realists: people are not going to stop eating meat overnight, or even completely. It's much better to promote a gradual decrease in consumption while privileging local products. A great first step is to stop eating fast-food on a regular basis, especially from large chains.",

It basically amounts to a defense of the term \"vegan\", as if being \"vegan\" (according to the author's particular definition) is somehow meaningful.\n\nIs veganism is about embracing a label for oneself, or is about the impact one has on other beings?\n\nTo me, veganism is merely a means to an end. Inasmuch as sticking to a strict definition of vegan helps improve human and animal lives, you should try to stick to that definition.\n\nFWIW, I won't eat shellfish because I find sea creatures completely revolting, and the idea of eating them nauseates me.",

I eat a lot of legumes - especially in the form of hummus and tempeh - and I was under the impression that foods in this group are downright toxic in their raw state?\n\n2. Why is it that toasted seeds and nuts are so damn tasty if they really are healthier in their raw state?",

I can't just get rid of my kitties, I love them. But they need to eat meat. \n\nSo for right now I stick to fish based food. Fish have a smaller capacity to suffer, and although I don't agree with current fishing practices, there are methods of fishing that are not damaging to the environment. There is still the issue of fishing being damaging to the fish, but while I'm trying to figure out the best solution to this issue, I feel feeding my kitties the seafood cat food contributes to less suffering than cow, chicken, or pig food.",

"comment": "So, you're not pushing your beliefs on the fish, chicken, turkeys, cows, pigs, etc that die to feed your cats? I can understand why a vegan wouldn't want to have pet cats in the first place if they thought they \"needed meat,\" but it's harder for me to understand how someone could be vegan for ethical reasons, and then still buy meat-based pet food. Are you not still \"abusing your position in the food chain\"?\n\nAnd you don't *need* to check the pH of a cat's urine, especially on a regular basis. It's just suggested if you want to make sure they're healthy. If their pH is fine once they've switched to a vegan diet, you don't really need to check it much after that. Initially, you just want to make sure their urine is acidic enough, because meat is acidic and plant foods are not.\n\nVegan humans have to watch that they get enough B12, and probably enough calcium, iron, and vitamin D, too, if you want to be on top of your health. Eating healthy is work, and eating vegan is work, and eating healthy vegan can be quite a bit of work. How natural of a diet is this for humans, to need at least a supplement or two, and yet we do it--why? Because we feel killing animals needlessly is, well, needless.\n\nAnd the same applies to animal food, if you decide to care for one. Dogs are easy omnivores, I'm not even sure why you're opposed to a vegan diet for dogs. They don't have the taurine requirement cats do--[here's their nutritional requirements](http://www.vetinfo.com/daily-nutritional-requirements-for-dogs.html). Easy to do vegan there.\n\nAs for cats, I don't know what more I can say that I haven't. There's nothing magical in a can or bag of cat food that cats need that they can't get from not-meat. As I said, it's really ironic that the one nutrient cats require from food and that will lead to a painful, slow death if they don't get is taurine, which *has to be supplemented (synthetically) into meat food* because the processing of the food strips it of natural taurine. So.... it's some protein, carbs, fats, and minerals, that gets supplemented with synthetic taurine. So, then why is it unthinkable to supplement taurine to a different source of protein, carbs, fats, and minerals?",

"comment": "Hey, this is just a short response.\n\nYes, I am very wary of \"Alkaline/acidic\" diet stuff, but this is a way to think about it with meat.\n\nThe reason cats can't (no fighting on this now) be vegan is because they have to maintain a low pH blood so crystals don't form in their urine.  They can get blood that acidic without meat.\n\nFood does/would affect blood pH, but we have systems to regulate it to keep it in normal boundaries.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate_buffering_system",

They should be let out when they want and  ome in when they want. \n\n It's their life and all my cats had a desire to go out. Fight cats, chase birds, have sex, befriend cats, live an actual life.\n\n I had a cat who lived for 19 years who would come in whenever he wanted, fought, had three cat friends he would sit on fences with.\n\n He died after a fight nearly 20 years into sn awesome cat life after a fight. I cried as I had him put down but I'd never of kept him indoors for another 2 years of life.\n\n People need to realise that cats are smart social creatures and not cuddly toys. They deserve as free of a life as possible.\n\nWow lots of vegans defensive about their double standards.",

"comment": "Yeah sure, cucumbers are great, but how many different greens can you name that you can eat raw? Cucumbers, tomatoes, a wee bit of onion and garlic, zucchini, carrots (and similar), bell peppers, kale, salad. Maybe I'll find 5-10 more if I think real hard. That's about it, compared to literally 100s of different species you get when you cook your food. Plus, you get to buy all kinds of vegan spreads and stuff from the supermarket.\n\nLast night I made a wonderful vegan cheese, with lots of garlic and just a hint of almonds. Easy to use as a dip, too. There is absolutely no rational reason to pass on this delight. But the agar-agar needs heat to thicken, so it's out if you're raw. Blargh. I see no reason for that.\n\nDon't get me started on cucumber/zucchini \"noodles\". That's like saying you can put chocolate on your spagghetti. Yeah you can, of course. As a college student, I did stuff like that when my fridge was empty. It doesn't even taste half bad. But it obviously has nothing on a true bolognese or carbonara sauce.\n\nAs for breakfast, by the way, I'll probably eat raw overnight oatmeal for breakfast on most days, but in the winter I shall so love the cooked version.",

Today all I'm looking at is the carrot-ginger soup in one location and steamed collards in the other. But the menu info is available online each week and vegan stuff is clearly labeled, allowing you to know what days packing a lunch is necessary.",

"comment": "Hello there, it's OP's fiancé here. Prepare for an incoming wall of text!\n\nI've become a lot more philosophical lately, and I've no doubt that it has contributed to my change in mindset. Not to mention the ever-looming threat of climate change which honestly terrifies me. But the clearest change in my case started after learning about lab grown meats. I've always said that I'd switch overnight if a cruelty-free meat source was available, and that kind of thought pattern absolutely requires you to recognize your conscience (otherwise you'd never concern yourself with that line of thought in the first place). Once that seed of conscience has been planted, there's not a lot you can do to shake it and it'll only continue to grow. \n\nOn top of that, my vegan fiancée prepares the meals in our home, so I felt even worse because not only was I still contributing to the meat industry, but she was having to handle and prepare the meat. It felt evil and I decided that I absolutely had to take responsibility and correct it. I always had an admiration for my fiancée's tenacity when it came to explaining veganism to the willfully ignorant, which definitely made the change easier. I think leading by example like that is always going to be the better option. It's better to encourage someone to come to the conclusion of veganism by themselves rather than giving them an excuse to feel forced into it; it'll be much more likely to result in a lifelong vegan.\n\nI'm quite a picky eater (heavy on meat/carbs in the past) which definitely contributed to keeping me ignorant on the subject. I figured there's a whole world of food out there that I should be exploring, and there's zero reason why it needs to involve cruelty to animals in any form. It was only really cowardice that was holding me back in that regard. If your BF is a bit of a picky eater too, using a lot of mock meats like Quorn/Gardein might help the process. It definitely helped me, even if it's just because it fills that void on your plate that would usually have meat. They taste great and can slot into all your usual recipes without much change in prep, and I quickly found that I could reach all my protein requirements. It made switching a no-brainer, there was no need to wait for lab grown meats when a functional, cruelty-free alternative was easily available.",

Stop watching Brogan for 5 mins and consider logic. \n\nQuick kills are rare, and many animals suffer prolonged, painful deaths when hunters severely injure but fail to kill them. Hunting also disrupts migration and hibernation patterns and destroys families.\n\nThe fear and the inescapable, ear-splitting noises from the gunfire and other commotion that hunters create cause hunted animals to suffer tremendous stress. This severely compromises their routine and their eating habits, making it hard for them to store the fat and energy that they need to survive the winter. \n\nLoud noises can also disrupt mating rituals and can cause parent animals to flee their dens and nests, leaving their young vulnerable to natural predators.\n\n**Hunted animals do not agree to be maimed and chased through the woods until they are finally killed**, nor do fished animals agree to be lured, stabbed through the mouth, and brought up out of the water to suffocate.",

I have thought about this, and my reasoning as to why it is okay to eat animals/young animals is that were it not for farming the vast majority of these animals were not going to be born were they not bred for eating. If we did not use chickens for meat and eggs they would still be in New Guinea in very small population and may be threatened with extinction like many other species.\n\n Are chickens ungrateful for their existence? I don't think so. I raised chickens, and they are very in the moment. I think feeling bad for their situation requires intelligence and information that chickens do not posses. Factory farms suck, but if a chicken is given a reasonably good life and killed quickly I don't see a problem with it, even if it is killed young.\n\nIf I am wrong, why?",

Their chicken pesto sandwich was rolled out nationwide over the course of a weekend, the same can be said of almost all of their menu items.\n\nThen they make the “mcplant”. The mcplant was tested out for almost TWO YEARS!!! They tested it out in primarily red leaning locations in the us and never tried it out in Canada. From what I can tell from the test, it sold quite well even though they tried to make it fail. They then canceled it anyways and beyond meats stock dropped 80%.\n\nMcDonald’s will be releasing their own plant meat burger before too long, and I guarantee they won’t test it out at a handful of locations for years, they’ll just roll it out nationwide.\n\nI guarantee at least a few McDonald’s executives (or at least their families) truly enjoyed shorting the beyond meat stock as they ran it into the ground.",

( I know health and environment are separate issues than animal rights.) etc etc etc\n\nI don’t know if I ever would have become vegan if not for being a hunter. People can block out factory farm footage from their mind. Killing a deer up close and personal really drove home all the arguments I’d been learning about for months and made me decide this was the last time I’m going to participate in the culture of animal exploitation",

At that time, my decision was solely based on taste-i still ate the chicken that my grandma made, even though we raised chickens that i loved ourselves. Same with cheese. I didn't care about the animals, i was just a picky eater, which i'm now very happy about as that made it ridiculously easy for me to go vegan, as long as my food doesn't ressemble meat.",

Two thanksgivings ago, I got a last-minute invite to my sister’s house, and ate carrots with some hummus I made and cranberry sauce. The next time I came over, she left the eggs and milk out of the homemade hot rolls and sautéed some mushrooms and onions in olive oil, and I brought some vegan dish (I can’t remember what it was). \n\nThis year, I asked what to bring and ended up bringing a giant organic veggie tray with organic hummus and ranch (they’re obsessed with organics now, idk why but obviously I’m going to respect their preference), and she thoughtfully planned with my mom to make several of the vegetable dishes with vegan butter instead of regular, and set aside some boiled potatoes for me to mash and season when I got there and veggie broth for gravy. :) When your family cares about you, it doesn’t have to be a struggle or a fight, and everyone secretly ends up eating less animal products as a result (we didn’t dare tell them a lot of the dishes were vegan after they were so verbal about their fear of the vegan gravy, lol). \n\nI was so happy and thankful.  I didn’t ask to be accommodated - I don’t have time or money to cook a whole vegan feast for 16 people, or even myself honestly, and I would have been more than happy to eat a carrot and enjoy their company, but now I know they love me :’)",

The same way they appear to us. \n\nI do this all the time. If someone says \"what if plants feel?\" Sure what if plants feel? Then you'd still need to go vegan as they reduce it the most. Do they feel though? Can you show me anything that says this is the case? If not then it doesn't matter. \n\nCounter with similar hypotheticals that aren't based in reality to illustrate how this one isn't relevant to keep a conversation on track with actual reality. Ask them; \"what if pigs were shown to have greater intelligence, language, and emotional capacity than humans. We just had the tech to overpower them and didn't notice. Is it still ok to farm them?\" They may and likely will concede this is bad as it means they'd need to accept slavery too, but then they'd point out its not the case so it doesn't matter. Of course it doesn't matter for the practicality, and now you have your point to keep a discussion on reality and way to reign it in.\n\nMy only point is don't wall them from discussing by appearing stubborn and unwilling to talk yourself. It's doesn't do the real victims any good, the animals. We aren't the victims, we're advocates on their behalf.",

For instance Jack Daniels & Kraken, one of my previous favs, openly admits to using animal byproducts in their production of whisky. Always best to check the alcohol brand on [https://www.barnivore.com](https://www.barnivore.com) before you buy\n\n  \nHope this helps! Cheers",
