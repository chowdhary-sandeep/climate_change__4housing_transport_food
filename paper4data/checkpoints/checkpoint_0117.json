"comment": "The reason car companies are interested in hydrogen again are the huge advances in easy hydrogen production we have seen recently. There have been several different methods of high yield hydrogen production using enzymes reacting with glucose/Xylose that have been shown to be easily workable at an industrial scale (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201300766/abstract). These methods of production use waste biomass and are low temperature/pressure systems so can be located almost anywhere negating any transport and production cost issues hydrogen had. \n\nThe other big factor i see at play is the lack of EV charging infrastructure investment. The number of EV charging stations are still pathetic especially outside of first world nations. Hydrogen can be sold in a similar way to fossil fuels which is why we see the oil giants playing with the idea of hydrogen. They have the resources and global distribution networks to implement a global H2 fuel industry but there are no similar big players in the battery/EV charging market to make the investment. If this biomass/enzyme production technology system works then hydrogen could be produced and sold anywhere with far less infrastructure investment, think about India or China where H2 could be rolled out but there is no chance of an EV charging system being rolled out there anytime soon. \n\nI think it will all hinge on these enzyme systems working, if they do then hydrogen will gain a massive advantage over battery EV systems.",

A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California to meet the state’s mandate for [Zero-emissions vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle).  As of mid-2012, there were almost 500 units still in use. \n\n&gt;Toyota worked together with [Tesla Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors) to develop the second generation RAV4 EV, and the electric SUV was released in the United States in September 2012.   Production will be limited to 2,600 units during the first three years, and sales are limited to California only.   The [US Environmental Protection Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Environmental_Protection_Agency) rated the second generation RAV4 EV with a combined range of 103 mi (166 km) and a combined [fuel economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles) rating of 76 [miles per gallon gasoline equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_per_gallon_gasoline_equivalent) (3.1 L/100 km). \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/hhtts4V.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Toyota_RAV4_EV_concept.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Tesla ^Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors) ^| [^Toyota ^RAV4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_RAV4) ^| [^Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota) ^| [^Magne ^Charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magne_Charge) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ci3qj4b) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ci3qj4b)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",

(I can't attest if something else in the car has animal origin).\n\nThe article goes to say,\n\n&gt; What’s kind of funny about this whole story is that Tesla [already offers a completely vegan interior](http://www.ecorazzi.com/2015/06/25/tesla-offers-fully-vegan-car/); in fact, it’s the only luxury brand that does.\n\n&gt; In June, company spokeswoman Khobi Brooklyn [said in an e-mail](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-10/tesla-shareholders-ask-musk-to-make-its-electric-cars-go-vegan), “Tesla does offer a vegan option to customers who express that this is a priority for them. If they want no leather in their car, the customer would choose the Multi-Pattern black seats which have a synthetic leather trim and then custom-order a vegan steering wheel.”\n\n&gt; Well, we’re just happy the Peters were able to receive the Tesla car of their vegan dreams, and that a high-end car company like Tesla does provide a vegan option when asked. However, we would prefer the company to change their policy on animal products so its entire fleet of cars are cruelty-free indefinitely.",

Then, based on an average of 3.5 miles/kWh (assuming your area gets cold in winter), you can derive a per-mile cost. Compare this to gas which should net 35mpg in mixed driving. Plus what your time is worth getting to and from charging stations that aren't located directly where you'll be.",

There will be such a car soon, and it will certainly be a reasonable range: [the next Renault Zoe.](http://insideevs.com/renault-electric-program-director-next-generation-renault-zoe-with-real-world-range-of-186-miles/)\n\nRenault Zoe already has a good reputation as a well-priced electric vehicle with a relatively fast charging time. Could consider getting a cheap petrol/diesel banger in the meantime until then.\n\nAlso heard similar about the Leaf, apparently it will be boosted to 48 kWh by 2017/18 as well. Assuming the very common figure of 3-4 miles/kWh for real world driving, that's about 140-170 miles.",

Electric cars still need energy to be produced somehow and most electricity is still produced in coal factories(for most places). And while those factories are more efficient than have a local internal combustion engine, they still have a significant environmental impact. Also electric cars often use rare earth minerals which can have a big environmental impact too.\n\nIn any case, a used car is a much better choice than a new car. And ideally living in a place that doesnt need a car is even better.",

A construction crew to run the new conduits and cables to the parking lot then repair the surface costs $$$$. The charger itself costs $$$$. The contract with the charging network costs $$$$. Upgrading the building's electrical service to support the higher amperage needs costs $$$$.\n\nIf you were hoping for a DC fast charger in addition to the basic L2 chargers, then the full installation cost would be in the range of $50,000 to $100,000. Most of it is in upgrading the business's electrical service and installing a 480V transformer, on top of around $17,000 for the charger itself. That's quite a bit of money for the average business owner, even one with multiple franchise locations under their belt. There's a lot of things you can do with $100,000 other than providing a minor convenience for passing motorists, most of which will be coming by to take up your parking spot without even shopping with you.",

"comment": "You can add the Smart ForTwo ED and ForFour ED models. Not sure if VW sells the E-Up! in the USA, and your chart seems US-centric, so I'm not sure if you'd want to include it.\n\nAs to the Zoe, I'm a bit confused. Which model did you take? Its range seems too large for the 22 kWh battery, but too small for the 41 kWh one. Experience has shown that taking NEDC numbers and dividing them by 2/3rds yields surprisingly close to EPA numbers for electric vehicles, usually +/- 5%. Since the ZE40 is rated at 403 km NEDC, that should put its theoretical EPA range in the rough neighbourhood of 168 miles. That goes well with Renault's own statement of \"realistically up to 186 miles\", which I assume is city driving, since that's the most favorable realworld figure you can quote as an EV manufacturer. Combined regime would be a bit lower.\n\nIf you want to compare apples to apples, at the current Euro/Dollar exchange rate, Renault quotes a non-binding retail price of roughly $31,450 before tax for the ZE40 for purchase with the battery included instead of rented. But do note that Renault has been giving ~€2,521 pre-tax ($2,957 US) off of all its electric offerings by default for over a year now, and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. So it's probably more realistic at $28,500.",

"comment": "The Zoe is currently a very attractive offer: 41 kWh provides about 250 kilometers (150 miles) of real world range. The Ampera-e (Bolt) and Model 3 will not be on the European roads for at least a couple of months. \nThe relatively low price of the vehicle is in particular attractive when the EV subsidy is a lump sum (e.g. 4-5K Euro's in France). Renault together with Jedlix is also active to reduce the costs of charging even further with smart services. I am a Tesla fanboy, but happy to see other parties (Renault-Nissan) also doing their fair share in the transition.",

"comment": "You're right that the REx isn't specifically marketed by BMW to be \"used all the time\", but if your destination or charging station is 300km or even 500km away, it absolutely will get you there, just like BMWs statement says, especially if you have the luxury of turning on the REx in advance like you do in Europe.\n\nHow do I know? I've actually done it. Not 2nd or 3rd hand or speculation. I've done a 2,400+ km trip in my i3 (among other shorter ones). When I needed it to go 418 km in between chargers, it did it with no issues and no limited power. Then, for the remainder of the trip, I was able to use almost exclusively electricity just charging while I ate or went to a Baseball game or slept because it charges so quickly. \n\nThe i3 can be our only car. It can do long trips using mostly electric and filling in the gaps, even long gaps as long as some people's trips, with the REx. A Bolt (Ampera-E) may not have made it between the 418 km gap of chargers and the Ampera would have been relegated to mostly using gas the whole trip because of slow charging.\n\nI'm not saying the i3 REx is the best solution for everyone. But, it's basically a BEV during normal driving and the REx fills in the gaps of mostly electric  trips, otherwise.",

"comment": "I’m in the “demand will go up,” camp.\n\nI don’t doubt that $60k Model3 demand in the US is getting thin.  They mined it pretty hard.  There’s likely 2x demand outside the US remaining in the price range.\n\nI think I read somewhere that every $10k price increase halves the size of the market.  So making a $45k version  will bring many new buyers to market.\n\nGetting to $40k will do the same, more buyers to market.  Ditto with $35k, which should be really big numbers.  I could imagine $30k buyers stretching for the bottom end Model3 because of fuel and maintenance savings.\n\nI’m an EV owner, and can’t imagine going back.  These things will sell like hot cakes and spread like wildfire.  Every owner is a salesperson.  Not just Tesla, the other guys will quickly become supply constrained too — if their products are halfway decent.  We’re in the exponential part of the S-curve.\n\nGiven that the EV market has been growing 50% annually, it’s crazy to think that demand is about to run out.  That’s not how disruption works.",

That wasn't a valid excuse to dismiss Tesla back then and it still isn't a valid excuse to dismiss EVs today.  \n\nThe world is changing, EV infrastructure is growing, and this shouldn't be opposed.\n\n&gt;I don't have a Tesla\n\nThis makes sense; I do, and I can tell you there is nothing magical about Supercharging and nothing worth opposing from any company that wants to build more chargers for us to use.  It's a tech that could have existed decades ago, and it's a tech that will happen for all cars in the next decade.  I love my car for what it is and it's cool to drive the pace setter, but Tesla's mission was always to push VW and the rest to do exactly what they are doing right now. The dieselgate network is actually a better thing for society than Tesla's Supercharger network because it legally can't be exclusionary.  The one thing I dislike most about Supercharging is its apple-like closed ecosystem, EV adoption would happen much quicker if Leafs were charging next to me.",

With the battle for range ongoing, we are less likely to see many rugged EVs. I'd be curious to see the range of the off road model VS the on road model. I am very interested in EVs that are more capable off-road. I hope they become common soon.",

"comment": "Its worth comparing the battery packs, throwing extra $ of battery into a vehicle doesn't mean they are more advanced, just more expensive.  The model s was and still is a nearly $100k car.  A model 3 standard range has a 50kwh battery and 220 mile range, a chevy bolt has a 60kwh battery and a 259 mile range, and they msrp about the same, though I've heard some people getting new bolts significantly under msrp, and very few model 3's are at the $35k price, I was excited for the model 3, but the $35k model is really basic.  And the bolt beat them to market for that price.  The model s and model sales were down in 2019.  The model 3 is doing well, but its only one model.  The model Y and Cyber truck have to be wins.  They are entirely new models.  Traditional manufacturers only need to electrify some of their existing vehicles to be competitive and relevant.  They can share a lot of parts and manufacturing between ICE/EV/Hybrid/PHEV models.\n\nEverything I have seen about Tesla's new battery tech is using the same lithium chemistry they have been using.  I see others researching solid state and lithium sulfur.  But maybe they are too and I just haven't seen it.  Tesla is also set on using cylindrical cells.  This means they are using thousands of battery cells in their vehicles, in the model 3 they are glued together even.  A bolt for comparison only has 280 cells.",

And I am willing to pay for that as if it was a diamond covered cell phone.\n\nBut then, I also have 2 EVs and having 40 kWh of battery storage will allow for at least some EV charging during a power outage should that be necessary.\n\nWithout any batteries I will be sitting in the dark during a power outage and that is not what I ever want again after living through many hurricanes in Florida. \n\nYou asked if I lose power that often. For me experiencing Wilma was enough just ONCE. there were people in FL who didn't have power 2 months after Wilma.\n\nWhile I am always hoping for the best I still like to be prepared for a worst case - just in case. At least I can look in the mirror then and say to myself that I did everything in my power without any \"I wish I had done this or that\"",

You guys barely have a charging distribution network comparable to the Supercharger network. In the different countries of Europe there's several.\n\nJust as there's several more EVs from other manufacturers available.\n\nIt's not practical to europeans to have to download and install an app for each distribution network available in their country and neighboring countries, which again, Tesla's just one of many. Charge cards that provide you access to multiple charging networks charge a monthly fee. If you don't travel long distance frequently it's one added monthly fixed expense for little benefit.\n\nBy making it mandatory that card and contactless payments must be available by everyone, people don't have to deal with this frustration point if they don't want to. Also, it's the same rule for all charging networks so no one gets an undue advantage.",

"comment": ">  Just mentioning Tesla creates so much emotion\n\nI feel like all the emotion is from your post.  It's a lot of emotion that I first took for not liking NACS. All your logical arguments seem to be for NACS.  It was a confusing post.\n\n> how horrible public charging is for the rest of us.\n\nIf you want to blame someone, blame the CCS manufactures.  They didn't invest the money into building out the charging system like the non-CCS manufactures did.  Tesla was a startup without the massive amount of cash reserves others had and they got it done.  If the other manufactures had spent ~$300 per car building chargers there wouldn't be a problem.  At some point the chargers will pay for themselves but that is 5-10 years off for a network the size of the US.  The good news is everyone by VW (for now) is getting access to the Tesla network.\n\n> It works fine every time. Nope not 350kW, not cooled, but still, it works every time.\n\nIt works for the reasons I stated.  It's low power with thin cables used by only one person who treats it like they own it, which you do.  This is completely different that something doing 40x the charging speed used by the general public.\n\nI build things for a living and I can have built products for consumers where there is also a commercial version.  The consumer version is $X but for commercial use it's $3X.  That is for the same piece of hardware but commercialized.  Why?  Because we assume that consumers that paid thousands of dollars for something aren't going to literally hit it with sticks.  They are just different beasts entirely.\n\n> I can go to a gas station, put my card in a reader, and have the pump turn on after the credit card network authorizes the transaction.\n\nI live in a big city.  I 100% promise that if I go down to the nicest gas station in my area, a Quick Trip or RaceTrac with say 30 pumps, 5 of them will be broken.  These are stores that have probably $12m+ in gross annual sales.  A 4-stall 350kW charging station has a theoretical max gross revenue of $2m if it can keep an EV charging at all 4 stalls 24/7/265.  Of course the actual gross revenue is likely to be only $200k or even less.  Maintaining them just isn't going to be on the same level.  Credit card readers are the worst of the worst for reliability and mostly what breaks a gas pump too.\n\n> We don't need all these apps, QR codes, NFC readers, touch screens, etc to simply flip some amount of relays to start flowing electricity.\n\nI'm with you somewhat but you go too far. Removing complexity that was previously required, like the touch screen is good.  Removing optional redundant ways to pay like apps just makes it more fragile.\n\nWe need plug-and-charge. That is what the number one most reliable network has had for 10 years and it works. V4 was forced to add credit card readers so you're basically getting what you want.  In 18 months you can just stick to V4 chargers and you'll be fine.\n\n> Yes, the car type/charge profile may be interesting during car/charger connection handshake\n\nThis is THE problem with charging.  If you go watch what the CCS charging manufactures are doing, it's mostly sniffing the wire trying to figure out what car is plugged in since CCS doesn't tell you.  Then they can work around all the bugs in the various cars.  Even the best standards have to have corrections for broken vehicles.\n\n> flow electricity\n\nYou realize that the electricity doesn't just flow right?  The car is constantly communicating back to the charge to tell it what it can accept.  This isn't a dumb load, the car runs the show as the battery will eat 2x the amount of electricity that is good for it and fry itself long term.",

It took many iterations to get it to look homogenous due to space constraints and board/led placement.\n\nIf you look at it at night for long enough you will notice the slightest dark spot vertically along where the outer lens curves. We used LG leds for those - far from the cheapest. But that's the look they wanted and that's what they got. The back bar that runs between both lenses on the trunk wasn't made by us, Ford wanted to try different suppliers - which was a btch to get it to look the same. We couldn't contact the supplier directly and everything was relayed thru Ford. But I think at the end it looks close enough. It's a really nice truck. Congrats on the purchase. Now I'm on to my next two evs. Cybertruck (former iron belly/now everest) and gmc Sierra.",

I use my small blue recycling bucket and a natural soap. I don't do much actual washing but I soak them, mix them around and scrub with my hands.\n\nMy cell phone has been off for a very long time. I skyped my family for christmas, but otherwise I don't seem to need it at all. I have a work phone at my City job, but that's it.\n\nAbout 7 months ago I had an Iphone. At the university we have a research lab that tests small personal solar panels. When they're done, they've been run through several tests and taken apart, but they donate them. One came with a small battery that had a usb connection. I charged my iphone off the solar panel that sat in my window all semester. I realized that I was basically addicted to my cell phone, so I donated it for a flip phone. Then I stopped using it and now I don't use it.\n\nI know it's crazy and hard to believe, but I'm real and I'm doin it.\n\n*I had to edit out the link to an article about me because so not to expose my personal info but if you want I can pm it to you.",

"comment": "&gt;That's trying to make the curves fit exactly - they don't need to exactly line up the curves to solve the problem. \n\nCorrect, because even if they're perfectly lined up, cloud cover means the utility will still have to have the capacity to provide most of the peak load. But in general, trying to fit the curves exactly would help solve the problem.\n\n &gt;According to the diagram, peak load starts at 10am in the morning and ends at 7pm in the evening - these are times when solar panels are working - although granted, by 7pm in the summer they aren't working great.... but most panels are active to some extent right up until the sun sets. \n\nIn a clear day, the output of the panels will look close to a half sine wave. So at the beginning and end of the day, power is much less than at solar noon. Them being \"active\" isn't a bit help when they're putting out 10% of their power.\n\n&gt; If the panels were correctly installed, then generation and demand should be roughly matched.  Any time during the day, solar on that house will drive that house's energy demand, and if there's surplus then a couple of the neighbor houses as well.  This effectively takes that house's energy consumption off the grid - supply matches demand.\n\nIf panels are correctly installed, they will be facing south to maximize energy, and peak generation will occur at solar noon, regardless of the load. The fact remains that the utility must have close to the same capacity with/without solar, but are getting less revenue to maintain that capacity due to the solar. \n\nI get that this fee/tax sucks, but the utility isn't lying about there being a cost associated with distributed pv. Their fee may be ridiculously too much, I don't know, but there is an added cost to the utility.",

With full off grid you need to plan for worst solar time, and least solar day (mid winter), and still have a backup option for multiple continuous no sun days.   I would suggest an OutBack Flexpower 1 system with 48Volt, 400Ah AGM battery bank.   A 4KW solar array will work well with the included charge controller in the Flexpower 1.\n\nIn NH you have Netmetering so you can utilize the batteries just for backup (extending their life) and effectively zero out your bill.",

Call electric company to be sure,) see about getting an In-Home Display installed so that you can see the data on your home's energy consumption. There are options that work without a smart meter, but require wiring to be done in your main panel for the reader/transmitter.\n\nOnce you get your house to an efficient state and it runs that way, then you will have to generate a lot less power. Less power needed means less panels to purchase! \n\nAlso, net metering, which was mentioned by someone else is a great way to use the grid as a giant personal battery.......basically!",

"comment": "If there were no Solar Utilities would still have to add all those costs in.  There is a reason that batteries can earn money by load shifting and Solar Peaks at the same time as peak demand.  Utilities get a great deal selling your solar power during the day while you are at work, then selling you cheap power at night when the costs are so low.  \n\n\"a new study by Robert Kaufmann, a professor of earth and environment at Boston University’s College of Arts &amp; Sciences, their solar panels, along with those of about 40,000 other Massachusetts households and community groups, are reducing electricity prices for all of the approximately three million electricity ratepayers in the state, even those with no solar panels.\n\n“Until now, people have focused on how much was being saved by those who owned PV,” says Kaufmann. “What this analysis quantified was that it actually generates savings for everybody.”\" http://www.bu.edu/research/articles/solar-energy-advantages/",

"comment": "LIDAR can be used to estimate roof pitch, and even get the height of things like chimneys, substantial vents, and tree volume. So I'd say its for detailed mapping of the home. You might be off on 4/12 vs. 5/12. Most of my clients are DIY types, architects, engineers, or can put me in contact with their builder who typically is the general contractor of the project. So its not too hard to extract that info if I'm unsure. Also, I do alot of projects in rural jurisdictions where the permit office isn't very thorough.\n\nI think there is plenty of reason to do a site visit - particularly for roof underlayment, structural engineering, and mapping out the internal cable run. And unless I have a customer willing to gather site data themselves, you can easily miss a roof obstruction by relying on overhead internet photography.\n\nWhile its different for large companies, my experience has taught me not to invest the time into a robust site evaluation until the client is willing to pay for it. To that end, I think the software is a major plus. The client is more willing to pay for a site visit if they get a professional looking report.\n\nBut also, I'm usually not in a bid situation against other installers. Solar installers, particularly those who get fat rebate checks from their local power companies for the arrays, can be the worst. My strategy with this kind of software is to enable clients towards performing project management. I can rapidly assemble project permit and construction documentation, charging a fee to do so. By enabling general labor to perform the project (and charging additional site support services), the client realizes cost savings while using the contractor of their choice, removing me from a bid situation. This lets me charge what I want for the \"solar design\" part of the project, while removing me from construction liability and management responsibilities. Then again, this puts me into sort of a \"freelancer\" type job description, and I don't grow into a major construction company like a turnkey installer.\n\nI don't get layout issues when comparing, say, Helioscope vs. Aurora. SolarDesignTool doesn't do shading and EnergyToolBase is a different kind of tool entirely. \n\nThe user may have different experiences. Aurora in particular seems to be working towards more design automation than the others. I think it still takes a knowledgeable designer to use the tools effectively, in order to produce an installation-friendly, aesthetics design.",

Take even a 25% efficient solar panel and that gets you around 27kWh/day of energy. Its not insignificant but its nowhere close to what a semitruck would go through. Ten years from now when panels will be more efficient, cheaper, and likely lighter then maybe it will be worth the extra cost and weight but for now it would be better to just mount the panels on the ground, angled properly, and let them export to the grid.",

You don't need premium panels just if you have limited roof available. Stay away from cheap no name brands, but many known brands have a quality solar panels.

"comment": "It's not a wrong question to ask as long as resources are finite. I'm not comparing solar to fossil fuel, fossil fuel is out of the question. We have a build-up of waste, especially from tech, where many materials are combined together. Almost nothing from a plastic bottle to a smartphone is designed to be recycled. We simply throw these things away once we're done with them. What about when we need to produce things in 100 years, what about 1000? We need to start thinking of producing things that when thrown out, go directly back to the environment, nourish it, or we recycle the technological material continuously. This is known as the cradle-to-cradle approach or more commonly circular economy: we use biological material and let it decay and go back into the environment (biosphere) to nourish it, and we re-cycle technological material (technosphere) so that it goes in a continuous (infinite) circle. Solar panel production doesn't currently take this into account, at least on an over-encompassing scale. Sure a few companies and recycling plants do it, but it should start with the design. \n\nAnd this is why I made this thread. I was directed here from /r/sustainability because this article was shot down immediately as if an entire ideology has formed around solar power as if it's the silver bullet solution to everything related to the environment. There are externalities, and we should address them now rather than later.",

"comment": "Production of hydrogen is like a bizarro version of \"clean coal\". it assumes some fantasy where because hydrogen is literally the most abundant *anything* in the universe, that it intuitively makes sense as a primary fuel source. it's funny how they don't consider light energy to be as abundant as baryonic matter. they also neglect that hydrogen production from electrolysis is unbelievably energy intensive and from stripping methane it's as polluting as anything else. hydrogen was a mythical energy proposed by oil and gas in order to pull funding away from more plausible and affordable fuel sources like solar, tidal, or wind with battery storage for supply/demand alignment via software. Hydrogen is another funding stall for renewables. Pointless and inefficient.\n\n\"The advantages of hydrogen praised by journalists (non-toxic, burns to water, abundance of hydrogen in the Universe, etc.) are misleading, because the production of hydrogen depends on the availability of energy and water, both of which are increasingly rare and may become political issues, as much as oil and natural gas are today,' says Bossel. 'There is a lot of money in the field now,' he continues. 'I think that it was a mistake to start with a ‘Presidential Initiative’ rather with a thorough analysis like this one. Huge sums of money were committed too soon, and now even good scientists prostitute themselves to obtain research money for their students or laboratories—otherwise, they risk being fired. But the laws of physics are eternal and cannot be changed with additional research, venture capital or majority votes.”\n\nFrom a great source of science info: https://phys.org/news/2006-12-hydrogen-economy-doesnt.html",

It works out with the daily average rate, so you don't get any benefits from those mid-afternoon spikes if you're selling.\n\nI'd guess that following that would probably be worse than what they're proposing, just because renewables push power costs quite low for a lot of the year.  The first 4-5 months of the year, the hydro plants are running full bore for water flow reasons, and the system is selling about 30-40% of the total generation off.  Later in the year, they'll buy power back, but I don't think Idaho Power, at least, suffers from those insane power cost spikes that some other companies have to deal with.",

My utility chooses to offer net metering and incentivizes solar installations as a cost savings measure.  Customer solar generation reduces the amount of expensive peak power the utility buys and lowers the \"fuel-adjustment factor\" that all customers pay.",

"comment": "&gt; NEM 1.0 customers get to keep there rates for 20yrs...\n\nThis is a common misconception, but is not true.  For example, PG&amp;E will be moving existing solar owners with NEM 1.0 from E-6 (peak rate hours during the day) to E-TOU (peak rate hours at night) starting next year.  SDG&amp;E and SCE will probably do the same a few years after PG&amp;E.\n\nWe still be on NEM 1.0 and won't have to pay the non-bypassable charges, but those are minimal compared to the financial loss NEM 1 users will take by moving from daytime to night time peak rate hours.  \n\nI figure I will need to add about 4-6 more panels when this happens to get the same financial return from net metering that I get right now.",

But we would not eat those calories instead of animals, would we? Find a farm, take a handful of what the chickens or pigs are eating and try it for yourself. Find a park and try to digest grass. This argument of yours is useless since animal farming is creating really high nutritional value food out of pretty useless stuff. Animals are not taking land away from crops, trust me.\n\n&gt;So arguing as meat as somehow sustainable\n\nWhy the hell would it not be sustainable?\n\n&gt;is like arguing that we should use solar panels with 2/3 of the their area covered, since it's not 'that wasteful'.\n\nBad analogy imo.\n\nAnimal farming is not a separate thing from crop farming. Together they form the industry called agriculture. You take things like manure or residue feed out of the equation and you expect crop farming to have the same efficiency and emission when you scale it up to 3 times it's size... The world does not work like that you hippie.\n\nYou do not have crop farming without animal farming in a modern environment. And when we talk about sustainability: if we consider nutrition value instead of calories the food source with lowest emission is a farm with animals and crops too. Obviously, since it does not use much artificial fertilizer and can allocate residue aswell.\n\nSo yeah. The vegan utopia does not have answers. Try counting how much emission we'd have to meet nutritional guidelines with monoculture farming, without a single animal. If you have a basic idea about ecology, economy or climate science then you'd know this is ridiculous.\n\nAnimal farming should not even appear in a discussion about climate change.",

The limitation is that you need to have enough PW inverter capacity so that if the grid is down they can consume all of your production above internal consumption.  Since their inverters can go up to 5kw sustained, 7kw for 10 or 20 seconds this isn't a huge limitation since the limit is aggregated across however many PWs you have.\n\nOnce you have PWs the Fronius inverters will have no idea when the grid goes down and they'll keep on chugging unless the batteries are full.",

The North is our largest roof which can hold ~8kW of panels. 2/12 slope. Almost dead on North. Ottawa, Canada.

This week  they are telling themselves 'a decade of unpleasant stuff and then we'll be back on track' and 'by 2030 will have defeated Russia &amp; China &amp; India and then we can go full Green again'.\n\nThe actual environment? let's look. in the UK there is a new policy, which is their environmental agency [will no longer investigate](https://twitter.com/Jamie_Woodward_/status/1564166021421883394?s=20&amp;t=pDx9xM-FID3IgVAVJwNpHg) pollution in streams &amp; rivers.\n\nOr the forests? Personally I get  my info from text not video. and lots of people don't  like Tucker Carlson. However a link to his show last night came in my feed,  called '[Back to the Dark Ages](https://youtu.be/Zn6c-UkqlHo)'. stuff about a German town taking the initiative and chipping up trees from a nearby forest.  As a trend.\n\nThis subforum for years had posts urging the UK to frack for natural gas even as their govt was doing the opposite, and putting cement caps on existing wells.   A few years ago the too cloudy &amp; too far north country was ludicrously planning to build a big solar farm near London as a total pose instead. \n\nTo me it seems obvious that a society with no culture, which hates families, with not enough protein in diet, with no free speech, with no cheap energy, and a disappearing industrial base will not return to former successes, but then I don't believe in magic solar panels for cloudy places in distant northern latitudes or other Green magic tricks.",

Convert existing home heating and ground transport into electric (hell, or even bikes)\n3. Convert existing industry into electric, in some cases with flexible demand built in. A lot of industrial fossil fuel use is for heat, so you can use electricity to heat some tanks of water or rock or sand and store the heat when you need it (less battery storage needed)\n4. In the meanwhile, invest in research for the remaining challenging problems without clear answers, like decarbonizing concrete and shipping and aviation\n\nThere's also work to be done on agriculture to make it less carbon-intensive but I'm less knowledgeable on those",

"comment": "\\> …ALL the materials required to extract renewable energy… \n\n  \nThis makes hardly a lick of sense. You don’t just extract energy from wind using a diesel engine, that’s not how it works. Solar panels don’t run on gasoline. For someone who apparently works in the energy sector, you sure don’t fully grasp the process by which renewable energy operates, and the scale at which innovation is occurring within to the point where we won’t have a need anymore for fossil fuels to support extraction.",

"comment": "I agree this is extremely cool, but a practical 100% solar powered car isn’t ever going to be viable. There is only about ~900 watts per square meter of solar energy. \n\nSo with a 25% efficient solar panel, assuming 6 hours of direct sunlight, you would generate about 5 miles of range. 5 miles of range per day, per square meter, on a ultra efficient vehicle like the Prius or Tesla Model 3. \n\nIn order to get ~ 33 miles per day like the average person drives in the US, you’d need about 7 square meters of efficient solar panels, roughly a 9ft by 9ft square. And this isn’t taking charging losses into account. \n\nFor solar to work, it is best suited for large surface areas like a roof on a house, not a car. \n\nBut again, I agree this is really cool, and any free range is better than none. It just wouldn’t make financial sense to add the feature from a cost perspective, it would take decades for the solar panels to pay for themselves on the car.",

I was told they couldn't turn it on that day because the previous tenant had the service shut off and if they try to turn it on that same day then there was a possibility of some big problem that they didn't really explain, so they would be turning it on following morning. When I turn my breakers on the next morning I had no power so she said she'd send a technician out to find the problem because everything that she looked at was showing that I should have had power. After three calls about having no technicians come he finally got here late last night. He was looking at the electrical meters and what he was telling me was not the situation so I was trying to explain to him that we only have solar power in the upper apartment where the power wasn't working and that downstairs they only have electric and gas and they weren't having any problems. He said they didn't tell me that you had solar power I don't have training for that and he couldn't help me. I said okay I'll call Peco again and have him send somebody to me that knows about that stuff. He said that that wasn't who I wanted to talk to they don't have anything to do with the solar power and that's the third party company and he didn't understand why they spoke to me at all yesterday about solar power. I'm just trying to find some answers on who is really the people who handle this the solar company or the electric company? I also like to get a little bit of knowledge about solar power and how it works turtle that is confused when I talk to people. I tried reading it on my electric company's website but I just couldn't understand it it was very confusing.",

Plus putting the batteries at the individual stations means the grid wiring only has to handle the very high loads (350 kilowatt a vehicle times 8 stalls soon) over the short distance between the batteries and the pedestal.  (Some designs put the batteries inside the pedestal itself)\n\nSo doing it this way would be closer to 20 percent and would probably require modest grid wiring improvements.  More capacity along highways, and branches to bring in power from solar arrays.",

"comment": "How many times are we going to see this same nonsense?\n\nIt takes 14-16 KW of power to create high-grade silicon, and the amount of CO2 is miniscule compared to fossil fuels. Furthermore, solar panels are recyclable and have been for years. A 5 KW solar array pays for its energy and CO2 costs in the first 6 months of operation, and they have a typical lifespan of 25 years.\n\nIf you want to talk about something that requires a huge amount of energy, why don't we take a look at what's involved in refining oil?\n\nIt takes 5 KW to refine 1 gallon of oil. The US alone refines 275,940,000,000 gallons of oil per year, resulting in an energy consumption of 1.3 terawatts. That's every single year.\n\nA one-time cost that is paid within months and lasts 25 years, versus a massive ongoing cost every year that has multiple detrimental impacts on the planet.\n\nYou're going to have to do better.",

"comment": "You’ve raised some interesting points, but let’s break them down and look at the facts.\n\n1. “Outcompeted” or Market Manipulation?\n\nYes, I understand the notion of free market principles, but what we’re seeing from China is not a level playing field. Free market competition is one thing, but China’s approach—specifically through state-driven subsidies, forced technology transfers, and protectionist policies—undermines true competition. China’s overcapacity in industries like steel, solar panels, and more recently EVs, isn’t a sign of outcompeting in a traditional market sense, but a product of heavy state interference. When China hoovers up industries by flooding markets with subsidised products, it doesn’t reflect natural market forces but rather strategic manipulation. European and even US industries have struggled with this, and that’s why it’s being called out.\n\n2. The Reality of China’s Debt Trap Diplomacy\n\nThe claim that China’s debt trapping is a “US invention” is simply not supported by the facts on the ground. Numerous countries, from Sri Lanka to Zambia, have struggled with the ramifications of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) loans. This isn’t Western propaganda; these are the real consequences of China’s lending practices. Take Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port: China financed its construction, and when Sri Lanka couldn’t pay back the loans, China took control of the port on a 99-year lease. This is the textbook definition of debt trapping.\n\nMoreover, organisations like the Centre for Global Development have published studies highlighting that several developing nations face distress due to Chinese loans. Zambia, Kenya, and Djibouti have all been forced into renegotiating their debts under terms that give China greater leverage. These aren’t isolated incidents, and while the US may amplify the issue for geopolitical reasons, the core problem is rooted in China’s lending practices.\n\n3. European Industry’s Future Viability\n\nYou mention that Europe’s high-end manufacturing and world-class educational institutions aren’t in dispute, but you question their future viability. Let’s look at this critically:\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing: Europe still dominates in key areas like aerospace, pharmaceuticals, precision engineering, and green energy technologies. While China is making strides in these areas, it’s not yet overtaking Europe across the board. For instance, Airbus continues to compete directly with Boeing as the world’s leading aircraft manufacturer. In pharmaceuticals, companies like Roche and Novartis are global leaders in biotech and drug development.\n\nTechnological Innovation: Europe may not have an “Nvidia” or “Alphabet” of the same market cap, but innovation thrives in sectors like AI, robotics, quantum computing, and green technologies. The European tech ecosystem is different from the US or China, but it’s evolving. Companies like ASML, which dominates the market for advanced lithography machines used in chipmaking, are a prime example of European tech leadership. China’s semiconductor industry, on the other hand, still relies heavily on imported technologies from companies like ASML, making it vulnerable.\n\nEnergy: In green energy, Europe is leading the global charge with wind, solar, and hydrogen technologies. While the US and China are catching up, Europe’s head start in renewables puts it in a strong position as the world shifts toward decarbonisation.\n\n4. Growth Disparity Between the US, China, and the EU\n\nYou mention that the US and China are outstripping Europe in growth, particularly in technology and energy. Yes, it’s true that the likes of Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet have larger market caps than Europe’s stock market, but this comparison oversimplifies the issue.\n\nTech Sector: The US has built an unparalleled tech industry, driven largely by the consumer internet economy. But Europe’s focus is on industrial technology, which may not yield the same explosive market caps but is crucial for the next wave of global innovation—particularly in AI for manufacturing, biotech, and renewable energy. Europe is a leader in Industry 4.0, which will drive the next phase of global economic growth. Additionally, Europe’s regulatory frameworks have created environments where digital rights, privacy, and ethical AI use are being taken seriously, which may serve as a model for the future.\n\nEnergy: Europe is transitioning rapidly to renewable energy, particularly in offshore wind and hydrogen production, while the US is playing catch-up. China leads in solar panel production, but Europe remains a leader in wind technology and innovative energy storage solutions.\n\n5. The Second China Shock and Europe’s Future\n\nI understand the concerns about the “second China shock,” but let’s not lose sight of the bigger picture. China’s growth in industrial sectors doesn’t mean Europe is irrelevant or in decline. Europe’s challenge isn’t to outcompete China in low-cost manufacturing, but to double down on innovation in high-tech, sustainable industries. While China’s growth has been impressive, it has relied heavily on centralised, state-driven policies that come with their own risks—like growing economic imbalances and environmental degradation.\n\nComparing Europe’s potential future to Poland’s current economic status also misrepresents the situation. Poland, by global standards, is indeed wealthy and continues to grow rapidly, and this only strengthens the EU as a whole. Germany and France being “equivalent” to Poland isn’t on the cards—those economies are structurally different, with a much deeper industrial base, greater access to capital, and leadership in key global industries.\n\n6. Hopium vs Reality\n\nYou mention that Europeans are riding on “hopium,” believing Europe will remain wealthy no matter what. I think this isn’t about blind optimism, but about recognising the structural strengths that Europe continues to hold. Europe has faced many challenges in the past—economic crises, political turmoil, and now, competition from China—but it has continually adapted and emerged stronger. Yes, the EU needs to invest in its future, and yes, it faces demographic and political challenges, but that doesn’t mean it’s on the path to irrelevance.\n\nIn fact, Europe is already addressing some of these issues through policies like Fit for 55, which is designed to transition the EU into a global leader in sustainability. Europe’s commitment to green technologies, healthcare innovation, and advanced manufacturing makes it a key player in the global economy.\n\nChina and the US may currently have higher growth rates in specific sectors, this doesn’t mean Europe is destined for decline or irrelevance. Europe’s future lies in innovation, sustainable technologies, and maintaining its leadership in high-precision manufacturing. It’s not a matter of being “outcompeted”; it’s about focusing on Europe’s strengths and ensuring fair competition on the global stage.",

Admittedly my criticism was a little harsh, I guess while I have no problem with her doing what she wants, I just feel like this news story will be yet another reason for people to see veganism as fleeting, unhealthy, and unsustainable.  Thanks for pointing out a valid argument.",

Say what you will about it all day, that's what it boils down to. Unless I'm mistaken, it seems obvious that members of your family don't want to be forced to eat your vegetarian cooking, but they didn't want to say anything or start a fight, so they decided they'd just rather pay for catering. They obviously considered being pressured to eat your food pushy enough, or just bad enough that it bothered them, or they wouldn't have paid for catering. The fact that you can't just let them order chicken because it's your event is starting to push you into the self-righteous vegan stereotype territory, i.e. the jokes about \"how do you know if someone at your dinner party is a vegan?\", etc.\n\nThere's another way of looking at this, which is that your mother in law is just being an unreasonable asshole. If you have that suspicion, then it's probably true. Just cut her out of your life entirely.\n\nedit: On the other hand, if you want a self-righteous circle-jerk that will substantiate your own opinion, you've obviously come to the right place. You can't deny that. But I fail to see the point.",

Wheat and milk allergies can both cause acid reflux.\n\nExercising exacerbates acid reflux. So does high fat foods, coffee, and other acidic items like tomato juice, tea, etc.\n\nI think medication would be safer than going untreated. Proton Pump Inhibitors are fairly safe drugs. If you don't get acid reflux treated now it can show up as throat cancer later from years of the acid washing up into your throat.",

"comment": "I have never expressed this desire.  In fact,  there are extant species that are not used as food by humans.\n\nYou are approaching this from an initial false assumption (cows will vanish if they are not used for food). There may well be *fewer* cows in a hypothetical vegan world.  But maximizing the number of individuals in a species isn't the criteria we use for the wellbeing of other domesticated animals (otherwise spay and neuter campaigns would be widely opposed) and it isn't the criteria we use for ourselves (with the exception of those fringe elements who oppose birth control). \n\nAlong with the continued existence of a species,  we also consider individual wellbeing.  If individual wellbeing is important for humans,  and is sufficient rationale to avoid the obligation to give each gamete a shot at life,  why is it different for cows?",

"comment": "There's a lot 'normal' food that is or can be easily made vegan.  I'm going to copy and paste from other posts I've made.\n\nMarinara pasta, garlic bread, (&lt;---vegan margarine---&gt;) mashed potatoes, black bean burritos/tacos, vegetarian chili, pesto (either drop the parmesean or use a vegan substitute), vegetable fried rice (no egg), lots of soups (vegetable, tomato, lentil, etc), onion rings, and fries. There are a lot of other ones but these are ones I find most people have an idea on how to make because they're familiar with the omni version. More complex (or exotic) can be tasty too but I think it's easier to start out with something familiar/easy.\n\nAlso if you don't like fruits and vegetables, hide them in other stuff. Like soup or marinara sauce.  You can cook and blend quite a few vegetables and add it in without changing the flavor too much. Keep in mind though, it will be helpful to try them in a variety of different ways. You might like it one way and not another. For example, I like raw carrots but I don't like them cooked unless they're hidden in something else. And keep trying them, it takes a while. What you might not like one month you might like the next. Your tastes will most likely change as you try new things.",

"comment": "The blogpost is an up to date bibliography on the question of intervening in non domesticated animals’ suffering. It was just meant to show that there is quite some academic debate on the issue and that it’s not at all clear that vegans are always against intervention when it comes to wild animal suffering.\n\nOn the speciesism-part: Suppose you have a human that really doesn’t know better who is about to harm another. Should a third who knows better intervene?\n\nThe key question then to ask about this situation is, how is this situation different from your description of predator prey-relationships except for the fact that the one posing a threat is a human in one scenario and a lion in the other? If it turns out that there is no morally significant difference, I’d say you’re making an unjustified normative distinction on the basis of species, and I’d call that speciesist.\n\nAnd of course I acknowledge the unwanted potential dangers of intervention. Maybe we’ll never get a sufficient understanding of nature to do any of it responsibly. But I think there’s currently very little research being done into these questions -- mostly for dogmatic beliefs in the order of nature -- and that if we had such an understanding and control over the potential consequences, the prevention of wild animal suffering would, philosophically speaking, be a very convincing reason to intervene. \n\nAlso, I also didn’t postulate that we should give wild animal suffering a *priority* over abolitionist politics. I just don’t think it’s something that we should neglect entirely because “[n]ature has always been brutal and always will be”.",

It subsides as your body adjusts, but for that transition period you should definitely eat when you feel hungry, have a snack, but make it as healthy as possible. Fresh fruit is usually what I find best, but my favourite fast snack is avocado on toast.\n\nAlso, you'll definitely be cooking at home more if you don't already. Making sure your meals at home have variety in ingredients and flavour is key to both making sure you get all the nutrients you need and keeping you from slipping up out of boredom for your meal routine. Always look for new recipes, and don't be afraid to tack the word 'Vegan' onto searches for your old favourite foods, you'd be surprised what cravings you can satisfy.\n\nI think the biggest change I made when my wife and I went Vegan is I suddenly acquired more kitchen appliances.

Using that figure to say \"people are stopping meat consumption\" is true only in the most literal context. In fact it's pretty misleading.  \n\nBeyond that, the article finds that the overwhelming majority of vegans are suburban/city dwellers, which highlights the difficulty of keeping a vegan lifestyle for a majority of the population. \n\nAnd the largest portion of vegans are millennials aged 18-34. Note that this is the healthiest period in most people's lives, and many of these people are still being paid for by their parents. \n\nMy point is that while veganism has certainly grown in popularity, it is nowhere near as widespread (or healthy, or sustainable) as you are making it out to be",

The current pressing time-dependent existential problem that veganism is touted as a solution for is climate change. \"Existential\" for our technological civilisation and a large part of the population anyway. I'm sure humans will survive as a species. \n\n2. In reply to a comment on carbon emissions trashing the planet you stated that reducing overpopulation was another strategy for saving the planet.\n\n3. Drastically reducing population to solve this crisis cannot be done by reducing birth rates. That takes too long to mitigate climate change. The only way to reduce overpopulation fast enough would be to remove existing humans. \n\n4. How the fuck do we do that?

Plus, even if someone does see this sticker before the store throws it out it probably won't change their mind and will just annoy them and make them less receptive to veganism in the future. The intentions of op were good, but if something is probably going to cause more harm than good we shouldn't praise it just since it's some type of activism.",

Sure, if it came up in conversation she would share her reasons and that probably helped in the long run, but she never came at me trying to argue me into making the shift. \n\nIf she had, I am ashamed to admit I may well have dug in my heels and closed my ears. Instead she just occasionally shared whatever vegan food she was excited about at that moment and pointed out specific instances of animal exploitation being fucked up. It did the trick for me.",

Have done since prior to being vegan (though was veggy) as did my dad who couldn't have a meal without it containing meat.\n\nIf you can't absorb you need a \"boost dose\" then a maintaining dose. The typical arrangement in the UK is 6 B12 injections in a two week period, then 3 monthly.\n\nI still couldn't maintain by B12 so have my maintainance doses every two months.\n\nIf your gut doesn't absorb it, food or 'over the counter' B12 tablets won't work. You need high dose to be absorbed via a route other than the stomach.\n\nSome people have success with the sublingual spray. But B12 injections are cheap and work. So they are the most typical treatment on the nhs.\n\nEating meat is unlikely to help. You may need a good boost on B12, then able to maintain via diet once your levels are corrected it you've developed a deficiency due to diet over a long time. But if you have pernicious anemia you will need injections - diet will not cut it. Eventually without treatment you can die of pernicious anemia. Exceptionally rare now - but pernicious means deadly because people did.\n\nAs for symptoms. I was convinced I had MS. Brain fog, extreme fatigue, memory loss, pain, creepy-Crawley &amp; electric sensations, numbness, weakness, some stomach complaints, fainting.... Fatigue.... And did I mention fatigue.\n\nBeen on B12 for 15+ years, took about 6 months to feel fully better but my deficiency was pretty extreme and I damaged the myelin sheets that coat your nerves. Felt much improved within a month. You should see some improvement withing 2 weeks (with high dose injections)",

As for the physical aspect: Our bodies will stop producing the enzymes required to break down animal proteins if they're not needed. As biological frugivores, our digestive adaptations to omnivorous diets happened much more recently in our evolution and will basically go dormant when we switch back to eating only plants. If available, I would take some digestive enzymes as well as some probiotics to help your gut biome process and rid your body of the milk proteins (and you could always take something like Pepto Bismol to help relieve the immediate discomfort). I hope that helps!",

There are millions of people suffering around the world right now. Do you truly care and empathize with them? No, and neither do I. But just watching one 15-minute video focusing on a single human going through a situation outside my understanding gives me enough and makes me care and I'll want to do something to help. It should be our job as vegans to get people to watch and learn animal's stories of individually and suffering that people have been shielded from and lied to about all their lives. That's how must people go vegan I think, from developing that empathy at seeking out or being exposed to that material.",

About an hour or so later the temptation got to her and she accepted one, took a tiny tiny bite as though it was poisonous and then went “oh! It tastes like a chocolate chip cookie!” \n\nPeople genuinely get so in their heads about it that they’re not behaving rationally. It’s incredibly silly but sometimes it just takes a bit of time for them to come around (unfortunately though, some never do).",

If I wanna try to cross some dogs that might have a problems, well I wouldn’t even try if I had to pay 300 each to euthanize or more to make them healthy. Im just saying I don’t think they should just have an open policy to take dogs for free without anything. They should be working to stop people doing that by any means.\n\nBut does this actually happen with any regularity, or are you describing a hypothetical scenario that *could* happen? Is there actually a single breeder out there whose business model is based on relying on Peta to take their unsold animals? When you consider the number of breeders out there compared to the number of animals Peta actually takes in, I don't understand how this is remotely possible.\n\nUnfortunately, I live in the rural south, and I can personally confirm that there is no shortage of shitty animal abusers who have zero qualms shooting, poisoning, drowning, or dumping unwanted pets rather than trying to find a home for them of having them humanely put down at a vet or animal shelter. I think it's great that Peta doesn't charge for this service (limited in scale as it may be) because I guarantee you a lot of these animals would be killed in much worse ways if Peta didn't put them to sleep for free.\n\nIt's true that showing gruesome footage doesn't always work on everyone, but cute animal footage doesn't necessarily convert people either. Different approaches work on different people, and a lot of people definitely need to see actual slaughterhouse footage to really understand the extent of animal abuse in these industries. There are other organizations like Farm Sanctuary that have more of the kind of content you describe though. \n\n(if by shock tactics you are referring to their publicity stunts with naked people or petitioning Ben and Jerry's to use human milk in their products I would be included to agree though...these campaigns are just cringey and I have no idea who would be swayed towards veganism by those)",

"comment": "Highly suggest buying a cookbook on amazon or at your local bookstore. Also, doing a quick online search for \"vegan recipes\" will yield enough results to eat something different for every single meal for years. \n\nFor me, success on any type of diet has come down to preparedness. If you take the time to look up a bunch of recipes, make a grocery list based on that, &amp; plan your meals out (it's also always easier to plan on cooking enough dinner to have leftovers for lunch the next day) it will make it a lot easier.  My biggest mistake has always been not being prepared &amp; having that \"oh shit\" moment where I had no idea what food was available other than those I was trying not to eat...which always seem to jump out first!",
