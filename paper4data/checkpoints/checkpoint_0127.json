"comment": "My standard recommendation is to spend &amp;lt;$4000 on designing and installing a 1kw solar array on a family member's home, and recoup your money over the long-term via a solar lease.\n\nMost of your success will be based on avoiding expensive mistakes. College degrees related to electrical engineering, structural engineering, or construction management are useful. Electrical trade school is also useful, except people might try to pay you less than you deserve.\n\nStep 1: Use the internet to figure out how to design a 1kw micro-inverter array. Have two material lists: specialty material that you will buy online and generic material that your installation contractor can buy at his supply house. Also have a line diagram, an array layout, and a racking layout.\n\nStep 2: hire a solar guy by the hour to review your design or post the documents here and ask for help.\n\nStep 3: find an electrical contractor who can work with a roofer. Give him your documents and ask what more he needs to perform the install. Make sure you know what material you are buying online vs. what he needs to supply.\n\nStep 4: Get your business in order. You could file a DBA whose primary purpose is solar lease development, and get a sales tax license.  Learn all you can about solar leasing. Execute a solar lease agreement with your family member, and assign them the tax credit as a down payment. Give them a lease rate effectively 50% below their market rate for electricity, paid annually. It won't be much money anyway, so you might as well be generous.\n\nStep 5: execute the business &amp;amp; the project. Help out with the install as much as the installation contractor will allow. Remember, he is the installer, not you.\n\nStep 6: Learn construction economics (tax credits, depreciation, financing, rate of return, etc).\n\nStep 7: Repeat with other friends/family members, selling the arrays if you can, or saving $ from other jobs and leasing if you can't.\n\nStep 8: Now that you have some design/contracting/project modeling skills, re-evaluate your business plan. You'll likely find a modest degree of success as a freelancer ($50/hr, part time, no benefits), helping other interested persons with the skills they lack. Form partnerships with large architecture firms and electrical contractors. Work on an hourly basis and leverage their financial strength and construction know-how. Once you get good at being their solar guy, you can increase your rate to over $100/hr while still helping them undercut the prices of the \"specialty solar installer\".\n\nStep 9: until you are ready for nabcep installer exam, have a nabcep guy in your pocket who can associate with your project as needed to satisfy and bullshit nabcep project requirements. Eventually you will want to think about getting a master electrician license and nabcep installer certification, but for now it's quicker and cheaper to pay others for their licenses/certifications as needed.\n\nStep 10: Now that you are a successful solar project consultant, master electrician, and nabcep installer, the world is your oyster.",

"comment": "&gt;So? I can talk about electric cars too.\n\nI'm sure.  That wasn't the focus of the article you provided though.\n\n&gt;Most power is consumed during the day anyway, and the wind is always blowing somewhere.\n\nMost data I have seen show peak about 2x baseload.  The wind isn't blowing in sufficient quantities to a) generate, and b) transport that power to all the places of demand.\n\n&gt;All types of power generation needs to be shut down for maintenance, so they're all intermittent. \n\nIntermittent means you don't control when they generate.  Shutting down for maintenance doesn't mean intermittent.\n\n&gt;There is also variable demand, because you have some big flexibility obstacles for turning power plants on and off...\n\nI agree.  To illustrate, consider natural gas.  Fast responding natural gas plants are ~30% efficient.  Combined-cycle plants are around 60% efficient, but they require an hour to get up to speed.  There's a very real cost of intermittency, so that's why the big baseload plants stay on all the time.\n\n&gt;this means letting generation run full blast and dumping the spare energy\n\nDumping it where?  Baseload covers the lowest demand.  Peakers cover the rest.\n\n&gt;and then having another set of smaller power stations that you turn on only in the few days of the year that you expect the very highest power consumption, which then stay off the rest of the year. \n\nUh, that doesn't happen.  Peaker plants are rotated around, and the summer peak isn't *that* much higher than the winter peak.\n\n&gt;but it utterly pales in comparison to having a couple hundred million cars hooked up to the smart grid.\n\nThe smart grid that doesn't exist?  We can run numbers on your claim if you like.  Each car could output, what, maybe 8 kW for a little while if needed?  You wouldn't be able to use much of the total charge, though, because people still need to get home at night.  Keep in mind that you won't be pushing this from city to city, either.  It is only cars in each city that *might* be able to act as storage.  Also, we are talking down the road a bit.  (Pardon the pun.)  Right now, EVs are less than one car for every 1,000 ICE cars sold.\n\nI think we'll see solar panels on roofs help with peak load to a smaller or greater degree.  Charging EVs at night.\n\n&gt;It didn't lose, its politicians are simply sending the milk cow to slaughter.\n\nIt really did.  [Here](http://energyskeptic.com/2013/tilting-at-windmills-spains-solar-pv/) is a report on it.  From that source:\n\n&gt;Previous life cycle and energy payback time analyses used models — not years of data from real physical systems — that left out dozens of energy inputs, **leading to overestimates of energy such as payback time of 1-2 years (Fthenakis), EROI 8.3 (Bankier), and EROI of 5.9 to 11.8 (Raugei et al).**\n&gt;...\n&gt;Prieto and Hall conclude that **the EROI of solar photovoltaic is only 2.45**, very low despite Spain’s ideal sunny climate. \n\nSo Spain got around 1/3rd of the energy return they expected, and they spend government funds to do it.  That's a loss, my friend.",

Billion dollar subsidies are pissing in the wind compared to what the oil/gas and supporting industries earn.\n\nIn fact one of the biggest subsidies oil receives is a manufacturing subsidy tax break which companies like Tesla also take advantage of.\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/7/debunking-the-big-oil-subsidy-myth/\n\nMost green energy is totally uneconomical without heavy financial assistance. I think this is great don't get me wrong this is what subsidies are for but lets not kid ourselves. Right now EVs do not make money. The only reasons they exist at the moment is because they will clearly be the direction the automotive market is going to go and so the R&amp;D needs to be done to be competitive in this future market. They are all loss leaders and most big manufacturers ill just eat the losses with profit from other lines.\n\nI work in automotive design and people are always asking why there are no EVs aimed at mass market. There are and have been for years, ive sat in ones built by Lotus and Jaguar but they are not competitive products even with the heavy subsidies so you will never see them until the market changes.",

So far there are none (at least I do not know) possibilities to use Nissan/GM/Tesla charger in any of the stations - each brand is building and implementing own standard - not making a trust or funding a startup (or whatever legal structure) to maintain all stations so they would be open for all the EV / Plugin Hybrids. \nUnify the charger - get better \"coverage\" of EV charging and get more people willing to drive electric because it would be more convinient.. \n\n?",

That's neat stuff. \n\nThe power delivery and on-the-road \"cleanliness\" of electric is great stuff.

"comment": "2014 Honda Fit EV, 82 mile range, 20 kWh battery, $260 a month lease, Honda pays for part of the insurance, came with a level two chargering station. 40k miles in two years\n\nPros:\nNo oil changes, no emissions tests, fewer brake changes. Full tank every morning, 6.6 kWh on board charger, so it is fully charged in three hours or less. About half the cost per mile to operate if I'm paying for my own electricity. There are about a dozen free charging stations within walking distance to my house, but it isn't worth walking to them when it is so cheap to charge at home. When the power company does \"Energy savings days,\" they pay me ten times the normal price for electricity if I use less than my average between 1 and 7pm. That means I just charge the car after 7 and save money. \n\nCons: This hasn't happened much, but if I forget to plug it in or I need a quick turn around, it can delay a trip. Range is an issue when on a road trip. This is fixed by renting a car if necessary. No level 3 charging. Cold weather sucks all the range out. Honda Fits app sucks and it is the only way I know of to scheduled charging. Honda isn't doing anymore leases of this car. The free charging station broke and had to be sent back for repair. I had to revert to the portable level one charging station that came with the car. The car needs a spot to charge for hours. \n\nStill this has convinced me that all my cars from now on will be electric. \n\n\nEdit:typo",

"comment": "On the one hand, the tax credit will remove a lot of the sting of new vehicle depreciation.  On the other hand, the depreciation seems to be priced into the used market (especially the i3 for some reason).\n\nOn the gripping hand, you might be better off with a lease.  Provided your commute is short enough to fit within the lease terms, you might even come out ahead.  As battery technology improves the perceived value of the used stock goes down.  With a lease, the residual is negotiated ahead of time.  You can let the dealer worry about depreciation.  \n\nThe answer to you question:  Yeah. They are pretty good cars.  The 2014 seem like uncommonly good deals (even if there might be better deals over in the new car leasing office).",

That's more than the number of Supercharger locations\n\n2 or more plugs often times means one Chademo and one Combo plug, so it's really only one useable plug for a Bolt driver.  Whereas Tesla averages 6 plugs per location, giving them well over 3,000 plugs, putting them WAY ahead (although some locations are already seeing saturation anyway). \n\nFurthermore, the charge times make a huge difference to me. Now I'm not one of these \"blah I need to be able to drive cross country at the drop of a hat\" types, but I do need to be able to make the \"across two state\" level trips mentioned elsewhere on this thread to see family, plus the occasional beach trip.   I'd average two charge stops per trip. I have two young kids and 20 minutes is the absolute max I'm willing to stop to refuel, which is a best-case scenario even with superchargers assuming no waiting (which is why I still have a Volt and not a Tesla). If I'm on an older SAE Combo machine I'm looking at an hour minimum, and even on a newer one, probably 45 minutes, again best case!",

"comment": "I realize Fuel Cell Vehicles are hit or miss in this subreddit. Personally, I'm excited. Even if Fuel Cells lack some potential in achieving carbon neutrality, it represents a technology that can break into markets for larger vehicles, reducing significantly the carbon footprint of some of our larger individual contributors. This is also neglecting the fact that *just because the primary method of hydrogen collection right now* is bad, doesn't mean it always could be or would be. That's like pointing to coal power plants and saying that BEVs are doomed to pollute.\n\nBatteries are expensive, and the technology, while advancing, is challenging to make breakthroughs in. Fuel Cell technology does away with the biggest concern by giving you an easily scalable, low tech solution to energy density. If you want more energy storage, make a bigger tank. The square-cube law comes in perfectly in a way that it doesn't for conventional battery storage. And on top of that, a conventional battery big enough to move a bus any appreciable distance would doubtless take forever to recharge, which makes fleet applications a nightmare.\n\nLarger vehicles like busses and pickup trucks could benefit from that scalability, and rapidity of refueling. Fleets would get the benefit of low down time, and similar levels of range performance compared to ICE vehicles. Something else I've lately been feeling needs to be championed is the effect things have on rural communities. Urban, and to a lesser extent suburban, communities are well on their way already in terms of developing a network of infrastructure to promote electric vehicles as options. Rural communities are suffering from a lack of options that cater to their needs. These people need things that are larger, able to move more at once, and able to go the distance while doing so. They chug gas like nobody's business, but so far the best I've heard is the *promise* of a *PHEV* truck. I think FCVs stand a chance at punching through into the rural markets. At the very least, even if you can't build a pickup that can tow a ton, you can at least have a pickup with a nice bed that goes just as far on hydrogen as you can with gasoline. That makes an amazing entry point.",

With the Model 3, there was a LOT of pent-up demand from reservation holders who signed up two years ago (when the market was in a different place.)  So, in some respects, this is two-year old demand finally being realized.   \n\nStill, there really aren't many other cars on the market in that class (Bolt... maybe the Leaf?) so people had no incentive to bail.  That tells me Tesla still does have a market advantage (though the cars they are currently selling come in at least $10-15k above the Bolt in price - so maybe it is still a different market)\n\nI'd be more interested to see the numbers in 12-18 months, once the reservation holders get their cars and a number of affordable 200+ mile vehicles from other companies start hitting the market.",

"comment": "&gt; Where do people who live in apartments charge? I think that is one of the biggest issues ATM.\n\nIf you look at countries with higher shares of EVs, these problems are starting to be solved. Oslo has had one solution for many, many years, with public street side charging poles. That's not a solution for every city obviously. It requires a lot of political will and a decent budget. But it just illustrates that if there's a will, there's a way.\n\nAs others pointed out, charging while shopping is another solution. There are increasingly many supermarkets, shopping malls and other shops with level 3 and 2 chargers in Norway.\n\nWhat needs to happen is to grow the market with the suburban garage owning users first. That'll make it safer for companies to invest in charging infrastructure that solves it for others.",

YOU havent seen it if you think the interior makes a car lol also, an interior that costs as much as the supposed BEST electric car. I know that there are electric cars in racing, there is an electric car for every type of car, and also HYBRIDS HAVE ENGINES, in case you didn't understand that. To call them hyper is something they collectively made up. You think that a Porsche is as good as a Koenigsegg, when its the white trash sports car. I'm sorry you cant understand an electric motor, which is DIFFERENT from an engine. The more you know!",

"comment": "There are always renewables available somewhere. \n\nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles honestly just make no sense when you think about it using any kind of logic\n\nGeothermal energy is self balancing against tidal drag forces. Using it cools it off which increases viscosity which then increases drag which gets hotter, slowing Earth's rotation slightly in the process. \n\nThere is wind, which is consistent some places, and inconsistent others. There is tidal generation, which relies on the moon existing, so fairly reliable, and solar, which is damn predictable. Not only can you predict how much energy it will make day by day, month by month, and year by year for a given location, you can generate about half the amount of power as you normally would when it's raining. \n\nYou can store energy in batteries, instead of hydrogen. It's more efficient. \n\nThe infrastructure is everywhere. Our house has solar, most have solar, and since most land is not in city or metro areas, it's trivial to lay a few panels outside or get even a small 5kw turbine for a few hundred dollars, that will likely offset most of your electrical cost over the course of your usage. And if you have a battery in your home, then you don't even have to worry. \n\nAnd the biggest reason why hydrogen fuel cells are so silly, is that the whole purpose of it in the first place was that you could fill up quickly. This is less of an issue now that batteries can charge very quickly, in 15 or 20 minutes A lot of the time. and this linear progression that we see every year in charging rates means that in two years, batteries will be able to charge up as fast as fuel cell vehicles would be able to refuel. You can already charge a Tesla Model 3 at 1 mile every 4 seconds. \n\nI just don't see the point. If you have to use a bunch of electricity at the gas station in order to make a fuel Just to pump into a car and try to turn it right back into electricity, why not just transfer the electricity directly to the car? That means it's coming directly from the grid.\n\nand I know what you're saying, that you would be able to mass produce hydrogen off site and have it shipped. but if you think about it, the amount of energy that that is using, why not just transmit that energy directly over the power lines instantly and just skip the roads in the middle which is burning some of the fuel?\n\nIt just makes no sense if you use any kind of logic.",

"comment": "I'm in a very similar situation with my '07 Civic. A few factors have me in limbo. For one, my Honda is such an incredibly reliable and inexpensive car to drive, that I find any other make or model hard to compete with. Another being that car prices are bonkers right now because of the pandemic. Used cars are selling for 2, 3, or 4 times their normal value, and new cars are selling for above sticker price. I could sell my car now for more than I would have 2 years ago, but I'm also paying more, and then getting taxed more if I buy a newer or recent model car. It doesn't balance out. \n\nBecause I'm moving this year, and work changes will allow more camping, skiing, and travel, I'm really interested in a PHEV or EV SUV, but I can't seem to find the one at the price that makes me pull the trigger.",

Rawlinson’s commentary may be correct for some of them, but not correct for the best of them.\n\nSpecifically, bringing tabless or whole edge tab technology to cylindrical cells blends the cost effectiveness and structural advantages of cylindrical cells to bigger form factors and probably brings better thermal management. That helps with cell life too. And that is with zero change to the cell chemistry. It is an incremental improvement, so the difference, while significant, isn’t dramatic.\n\nHowever, DBE can be a huge change in both cell costs and c-rates. It can also change cell life and make alter the balance on some cell chemistry choices. He would be wrong if Tesla is able to scale up DBE.",

What the narrative they want to oush is, that bikes are even less expensive, take up much less space, have practically no emmisions and are as quiet as EVs. \"Oh but what about the rain\" you say. Well a dedicated bus lane has a high hourly person count than 2 car lanes  while also taking much less space (especially when you arenot driving), also lower emmisions and also cost much less than a car.\n[just a random video i found of the true cost of a car](https://youtu.be/d5uJDcqJPFw) I think I dont need to specify the cost of a bike for a year and also, yearly public transport tickets are usually much cheaper than what the video number says (didn't even look at the number but am 100% sure the bus ticket is cheaper)",

This statistic and comparison is extremely important, and it's possible these technologies are safer than not having them. \n\n... but I'm not prepared to simply believe what I'm told by GM or Tesla or BMW or any other company. I want access to the data. \n\nWe need much better data from all sources. And this is not the only statistic we need to understand.  We need to be able to analyze data and to improve data points around accidents for older vehicles as well. \n\nIt's not just deaths and accidents and injuries either, we need metadata to compared to \"like data\" like: Locations, driver data, vehicle make, model, age and vehicle tech data, conditions, with and without the driving tech in place. \n\nWe really shouldn't be comparing a 2023 Tesla or 2023 mustang to a 1985 death trap without air bags or decent crumple zones for meaningful death rates.  We should be comparing similar vehicle types and years and locations.\n\nIf for example, (I'm making shit up), California might have the highest rate of EV or vehicles with advanced driver tech ownership, but California may be a moderately safe place to drive.  Montana might be the most dangerous place to drive, but very low in adoption of these technologies. This could impact statists.  \n\nIf 45 year old upper middle class drivers with generally low risk driving habits are most likely to drive vehicles with self driving tech, then this could also impact the numbers dramatically when your are comparing them to teens and more safety challenged drivers. \n\nOld cars are far more dangerous than newer cars before accounting for new driving technologies.  Who is buying, where do they live, how and where do they drive, all matters. \n\nA micro-sized car is also likely not comparable to the new multi-ton hummer EV or an semi autonomous semi, etc. A technology may be safer in some instances ...and possibly more dangerous in others.  \n\nIt will be easy to deliberately skew outcomes using real data to make claims that may not be actually true.  I want smart, independent bodies to review this data to help make sure what is being reported is a fair interpretation and I want the source data to also be public.  \n\nThis will allow the tech and vehicles (and communication around the tech) to be continuously improved while providing the public with the information we need. \n\nI am guessing lower forms of ADAS (level 1..) are likely safer than vehicles without, all else being equal, but I believe people are prone to misuse these technologies-like FSD beta, making them possibly more dangerous than intended. \n\nI believe companies have a vested interest to misinterpret the data they collect and to frame it in the most beneficial way to improve the bottom line. \n\nKind of like when most car manufactures ran an anti-seat belt and misinformation campaign, to save $100 when manufacturing a new car.",

Turning left, the trailer follows the path of the truck. Turning right, the pedestrian is often crushed under the trailer when a right turn is tight and the trailer sweeps over them on a tight right turn.\n\nIn this way, there is a dislocation between the visibility needed for these scenarios, and the location of the traditional drivers seat.\n\nIn the Tesla Semi, the driver is not super far back, there is not a large hood over an engine like the hood of a traditional Mac Truck.

Tesla's motorised port is mostly a gimmick, albeit a pretty clean one. \n\nTesla isn't intentionally hiding the charge plug. They are cost cutting. By not painting the door they don't have to have the supplier paint and sort them to match the build order of the factory. For many cars painting and sorting the door costs more than the door. So Tesla avoids painting the door by having a reflector glued on instead. They do the same with the handles, not matching them to the paint is a huge cost saver.",

Divide you battery size (kWH) by charger kW, and that’s how many hours to go from 0 to 100%.   \n\nThe one exception is Porsche that offers a 19.2kW wall charger and, optionally, the onboard charger to accept that much current.\n\nhttps://www.caranddriver.com/news/a42691039/ev-charging-level-2-porsche-wall-connector/",

If oil changes become irrelevant, then that just frees up more labour and time slots for the services that EVs do need.\n\n\nAlso as EVs become more commonplace, there will be demand for technicians to repair and replace traction battery packs. People worried about losing engine maintenance jobs can retrain in battery maintenance instead. \n\n\nI remember when I had a leak in my tire and had to keep pumping it up multiple times a week because every shop was fully booked for all kinds of car services. Take away the ICE-specific services and I would have been able to get the tire patched much faster.",

The battery stores your excess solar production and powers your home during peak hours.  This avoids paying your utility for peak hour consumption.  Plus you have the battery for back-up resiliency in case of power outages.  \n\nThe battery yields a 30% IRA federal tax credit like the solar panels.",

Is wasting 2/3 of energy green?\n\nMost electricity is generated between [30%-45% efficiency](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=107&amp;t=3), so 300 kWh of energy only generates say 100 kWh of electricity, take away [6.5%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission#Losses) to deliver to the home, and 10% for battery charge/discharge.  You're left with ~85 kWH which drives a Tesla around 300 miles in good conditions.\n\nSo hydrogen is green compared to most grid power.  It's certainly not dirty at least.\n\nCompared to solar panels it's still fairly green, because the 'battery' in a hydrogen storage system is very cheap compared to the battery needed to store the power in electricity so you can buy more generation to make up for some of the storage loss.",

"comment": "Where are you located? How much money do you have? Or how much time do you have? About seven years ago I was thinking the same thing as you.I now have my own solar company. I went to work for a company and did installations for two years and then sales. I try to learn the business as best I could. I also went to Solar conventions, to trainings through solar energy international and worked for a couple other companies.  \n\nas someone who grew up in the trades as a painter, I was exposed to all the other trades.  Solar is a trade. The solar installer shares a lot with roofing and electrical but it is definitely its own trade. If you don't have pretty serious electrical knowledge and you are young I would start out working under an electrician. Try to find one that does commercial troubleshooting work. Don't just go to work for a new construction electrician pulling wire through houses.  You need to pay your dues and learn the trade unless you have enough money to hire people who already have. One of the worst things you can do is take a one-week course, decide you are a solar installer, and go out and start learning how to do solar on the public. Bad installations that don't work or are dangerous really give solar a bad name. Our industry is also full of fly-by-nighters and ripoffs who jump into solar looking to make a quick buck. Bottom line solar is really hard work and it is a trade like painters electricians framers plumbers pipefitters welders",

"comment": "Absolutely get them mounted!\n\nSolar panels don't suffer from being in the sun but not having current drawn, and if you have an off grid setup with enough panel, it's likely that it will spend large chunks of the summer connected with full batteries and either not drawing anything or not drawing nearly what the panels can produce at that moment.\n\nThe same is *not* true for wind and hydro - you can't unload them or they'll destroy themselves, so you need a diversion load that can dump the entire system output safely.\n\nIt doesn't bother solar panels at all, though.  Go ahead and mount them!",

It is a single inverter solution similar to the existing Bimodal systems but even more advanced in that there are multiple MPPT systems (one per PV module).   They maintain the DC bus at ~350V, there is a similar battery optimizer unit which handles the battery.   It has two AC connections, one for grid and one for emergency loads.   It is very integrated and very efficient.   \nThey have had the StorEdge solution with different batteries in EU for a while and just expanded it to support the powerwall.\nhttp://www.solaredge.us/files/pdfs/storedge-grid-tied-and-backup-na.pdf\nhttp://www.solaredge.us/groups/us/products/storedge\nhttp://www.solaredge.us/files/pdfs/products/StorEdge/se_storedge_inverter_datasheet_na.pdf",

Let's say that sponsor offered portions of the 75kw array for sale, under a 20 year lease, which had a 12 year payback. But the sponsor keeps the tax credits and depreciation due to the lease structure. There's little difference between this \"private sector\" community solar model vs. one that is managed by the utility, except perhaps it is more fair and flexible. \"Community Solar\" is a label that utilities don't have the exclusive right to define.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; In the 3rd quarter of 2016, the United States installed 4,143 MW of solar power per a report released by Greentech Media&amp;#039;s Research Team - 191% greater than Q3&amp;#039;15. This volume represents the largest quarter in US history, even larger than the historically largest 4th quarters during the prior decade.\n\n&gt; It looks like Americans installing solar power and the Department of Energy are turning their nose up to Donald Trump&amp;#039;s Chinese Hoax.\n\n&gt; Below we see that solar module pricing fell from $.63 to $.49/W from the 1st to 3rd quarter, with a full $.10/W occurring in the 2nd to 3rd. Personal experience has seen an additional $0.06/W fall off of panel pricing in the more aggressively priced manufacturers - we should expect to see another strong quarter of price declines.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/5ifgee/usa_installs_record_amount_of_solar_power_191/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~34220 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **quarter**^#1 **price**^#2 **solar**^#3 **power**^#4 **3rd**^#5",

There are people who have a plugin where it's not worth it for them to plug it in at work and then move it off the charger to be courteous to others, but still want to gain a bit of EV range during the day.\n\nWill the solar fill the battery?  No.  Is a plugin as good for the environment as a straight EV?  No.  But it could be effective in swapping out gas miles for EV miles, in particular if that car wouldn't otherwise get plugged in.\n\nPeople buy plugins and then never charge them for one reason or another, between effort and availability.  I bought my C-Max Energi used and the previous owner had literally never plugged it in.  According to the trip odometers it had consumed 0.1 kWh of EV over it's short lifetime prior to me buying it.  I don't know why they did it, but dammit they lost a ton of money when they traded it in a few months later, money that I saved.  If it had solar then the previous owner would have driven a while lot more EV miles versus never plugging it in.\n\nThink about the older Prius Plugin with the 12 mile range.  It seems almost silly to plug that in, but mile 1 of any trip would always be electric.  Yes, miles 12 and up would be only hybrid milage, but you start every single trip with the first mile, not the 13th.  That makes it a win.\n\nOn paper the solar panels are a stupid idea, but in practice a stupid idea that works isn't a stupid idea.",

"comment": "But the Powerwall only functions when there's a power outage - it's not a daily charge-and-discharge battery (except in a few cases where it does a bit of TOU load-shifting). So you wouldn't size the solar system any differently whether there's a Powerwall or not - the goal would still be 100% offset either way, the only difference being whether or not you have back-up protection if the grid power goes down.",

"comment": "I doubt it.  I expect most of their sales are golf carts and industrial equipment, with a good extra bit going to off grid or semi-off-grid structures - and in those situations, if you have enough panels, lead acid still works perfectly well.\n\nWeight doesn't matter, volume doesn't matter, and the only real annoyance of lead is having to water it (AGM and gel don't last as long as flooded lead acid).  Also, I suppose, offgassing hydrogen, but that's a simple vent fan to solve, and pretty much every charge controller offers a \"Battery is into gassing voltages, turn a relay on\" type output.\n\nLead is happiest being fully charged, with moderate daily cycles (ideally in the 20-30% range - you can run into issues if you only cycle it too shallowly, and you hurt lifespan if you regularly cycle it deeply).\n\nLithium is happiest at a moderate state of charge - the cells are most stressed at 100% and 0% SoC.  For longevity, you need to short stroke them, losing capacity.\n\nThere's also an issue with temperature regulation.  Lithium pretty much requires thermal regulation.  Lead... benefits from it, but mostly doesn't care as long as you keep it mostly charged (or above 50% SoC in most climates for the winter).  Cold lead is less efficient and is saggy about output, but you won't damage lead charging it when cold, and that's quite untrue for lithium (lithium plating is a serious concern when charging cold).\n\nAs far as off grid type structures go, a large lead acid bank paired with a somewhat oversized array offers a lot more flexibility than a smaller lithium bank.  Since I know you spend a lot of time in r/teslamotors, a Powerwall 2 is 13.5kWh for $5500 (assuming you can get one, which is far from certain).\n\nOn the lead side, $2800 gets you 8 Trojan L16RE-6 batteries - a 48V string at 370Ah.  That's about 17.5kWh.  And, for the same price as the Tesla unit, you can get about 35kWh.  That's a Trojan Premium line, rated for 3500 cycles at 30% DoD - so somewhat less than the PowerWall, but still up in the same ballpark.\n\nFor off grid solar, if you put up enough panels, you pretty much don't cycle the bank much at all during the summer.  Depending on night time loads, you may not pull more than 15-20% out of the bank, and it gets back charged in a hurry during the day - during the summer, I'm into absorb by 10-11AM, typically.\n\nI've got a year's worth of data now, so I really need to sit down and do the analysis, but 200+ days a year, the only question on an off grid battery bank is, \"When does it hit fully charged during the day?\"  And, as long as it's getting a few hours of absorb time most days, it's going to be absurdly happy.\n\nFor the winter, the extra capacity is quite useful.  Having 2-3x the bank capacity for the same money means that you can run a few more days without having to charge, either waiting for sun, or waiting to run the generator until the bank is going to accept charge quite efficiently.  If it's super cold, you can't drain it fully, but a lithium bank is going to be drawing a decent bit of power to remain warm as well.  Pick your poison.\n\nAnd then there's the availability issue.  I can order a bunch of Trojan batteries and have them next week.  It's much, much harder to order a lithium battery for home scale energy storage and have it delivered when I need it.\n\n... so, long story short, no, I don't think they're really likely to notice lithium ion yet.",

"comment": "Panels have come down in price a lot but $0.3/w still seems a little on the low side.\n\nThings like regulatory compliance and building codes aside I'm not sure solar shingles are that bad of an idea. \n\nEven if solar panels do hit 30 cents/watt this year a 10kW install will probably still cost $25k because of all the other costs. \n\nIt doesn't make sense to replace your roof with solar shingles but if you are about to dump $15k on a roof anyway does it make sense to upgrade the shingles to solar ones instead of doing another $25k solar install after that?\n\nIf you can do a solar shingle roof for $30k instead of a roof + panels for $40k that's where the economics of vertically integrating them starts to make sense. I think as panels themselves continue to plummet in cost and all the other costs remain mostly the same the economics of an integrated solution starts to make more and more sense.\n\nThat doesn't happen last year or this year but in the next 5-10 years? maybe.",

"comment": "Typically LA should only be discharged to 50%.I've heard people say even just 80% depth of discharge. So for 50% you'd need to double your capacity and for 80% you'd need even more. Lifopo4 can be discharged more but the less you discharge it and not charging it fully can drastically increase the life span. Typical usage of lifopo4 is charged to 80% and discharged to 25%. You get most of the capacity and can cycle them a lot more. Over the life span Lithium typically ends up cheaper but higher initial cost. That is as long as you charge the Lithium properly. Most of the cheap chargers aren't setup for Lithium and don't allow you to adjust the voltages. Also you'll need to have a BMS that will balance the Lithium cells because over time they'll drift apart and won't stay the same voltage. You can get one for $30-40. Just make sure it balances them at lower voltages than 4.2.\n\nThe lifopo4 will take more to setup properly but should live longer. If you aren't willing to do the setup required for it then I'd recommend just going with flooded lead acid. I don't have any personal experience with it but I've heard good things about Trojan LA batteries.\n\nAlso you'll need more solar panels. Your load will consume about 1kwh but your panel will produce less than half that. I'd double or triple it (depending on your tolerance for cloudy days).",

"comment": "The idea has merit, but I think what's tricky for most people is that the times with the highest demand are the times you'd have the lowest charge. I never have any battery capacity left at 5pm on a weekday, and if I'm going out later in the evening I'll want a charge then. \n\nI think it could work with more widespread public charging or workplace charging. If my office had a free charger that was contingent on me being able to do vehicle-to-grid as necessary all day, ensuring that I have enough charge left at the end of the workday to make it home, that might be an interesting proposition. \n\nI'm curious how solar ties into it, especially with stuff like net metering (which the utilities are lobbying hard against). I'm in the process of installing a grid-tie net-metered solar system, and I'm essentially the power company's worst nightmare. I'll generate a shitload of power and backfeed the grid all day, then I get home around sunset and turn around and start pulling mucho kilowatts during peak hours (I don't have time of day pricing, so I start charging the minute I get home and I am usually full by 9-10pm)",

"comment": "The costs in this plan are well beyond 10 times the face value of the currency of the bank. The entire US economy is about 19.4 trillion dollars, and that is all economic activity, goods, service, everything. This is an infrastructure plan not a social benefits or entitlement plan. Whatever money you print to pay for it has to actually directly translate into new production of solar panels, wind turbines, and their installation. It's not a print money situation. Let me see if I can make this clear. The US auto industry is roughly 3.5 percent of GDP or around 679 Billion dollars. This is at the very least a trillion dollar a year plan so in a magical world where you could instantly convert the auto industry's production over to making solar panels, wind turbines, and the equipment to support renewable energy it still wouldn't be enough. You'd still fall short by about half.  We don't live in a magical world where production lines can seamlessly change production, or materialize out of thin air. Another thing to consider: it's a fifteen year plan we actually will need the auto industries and every other industry to keep doing what it is doing so we can keep things running until we can transition over so the industrial capacity will have to be created whole cloth from whatever economic potential (labor and industry) isn't already actively engaged, and there isn't 1.1 trillion dollars of that just laying around in any given year.\n\nWhen I say it's a fantasy I mean that it is not physically possible. There is no amount of financial wizardry or printing money that can make the labor, physical equipment, and materials needed to do this appear in the outlined time frame. \n\nIn regards to EVs what you're calling a narrow use case is the more important. A semi-truck can go 2000 miles on a tank of gas. The Tesla semi can go 300 to 500 on a charge. Now you can argue that it can just stop and charge more, but time is money in transportation and the profit margins on food and consumer packaged goods is very thin. We're talking about 10 to 50 cents per unit depending on exactly what it is. That extra charge time for the long haul trucking trips means rising food costs so we actually do need some sort of portable ultra dense powers supply just to keep everyone fed. Hydrogen sort of fits the bill. It contains less energy pound for pound than gasoline. You do need to be able have excess energy to plow into separating the hydrogen in the first place. Although, someone apparently made a breakthrough with separating hydrogen from fossil fuel sources without releasing carbon so maybe that helps. However, you also have to keep in mind that whatever you use to power EVs and alternative vehicles is now coming from the grid. So when you swap over to renewable you not only have to meet today's power capacity you have to exceed it by whatever energy consumption is needed to keep everyone on the road, and since both EVs and hydrogen are less dense and less efficient for long hauls that's actually going to exceed today's overall energy grid by a good margin.",

"comment": "For an AC system you need an inverter to take the 12v power you are storing in the 110AH batteries and turn it into 110v AC (or 220v if that's the standard in Uganda). Yes Air conditioning compressors require more wattage on start for a few seconds. You can solve that by adding a \"soft-start\" device before the Air conditioning unit or by buying an inverter that can handle the surge current.\n\nFew questions back:\n\n* 1. How well insulated is the structure you are wanting to cool? Your air conditioning will work less hard and consume less energy if the structure is insulated enough to stay cooler longer.\n* 2. Will you only need to run the air conditioning during daylight hours (Say between 9am and 5pm) or will it need to run overnight?\n \nYou will want to give a generous overhead in capacity in both panels (add 20%-25%) and in battery storage (you need to be able to feed the inverter enough amperage reliably. If you need to run overnight then you need to size the array for additional capacity (both charge the bank &amp; run the AC during the daylight) and battery bank for enough capacity to run overnight (That amount will be determined by duty cycle of the air conditioning.)",

They generate electricity when the sun shines on them. What do you do in the dark? Well, you double your panels plus add a thing that stores electricity - a battery. In my example, a wind turbine helps out with this, as they can generate power at night, or during storms, and with the solar panel, antenna, and light an excuse to add a pole in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAnyone that puts air suspension on their car can run power tools, the cybertruck is cool but hardly new in that regard.\n\nBasically, a self sufficient kiosk that helps electric motorcyclists who don't have the advantage of massive batteries in an over-heavy cage, primarily but also anyone with a car, electric or otherwise (jumpstart, radiator fluid, tire pressure, call for help), traveling in a remote area.\n\nTbh I've been thinking of confluence of alternative energy before PayPal was a twinkle in musk's eye, though he's done a lot of cool shit. Maybe I'll make something of it or maybe I won't, but it's not derivative.",

Solar doesn't work at night, and wind is reduced, so charging a huge number of EVs at night will require huge increases in either hydroelectric power or battery storage. \n\nThe current rate of EV adoption will give at least a few years to build out that infrastructure. Let it grow at 20% - 30% per year and build chargers that won't be obsolete in 5. Growing EV adoption at 100% per year will be too much of a shock on the economic ecosystems of energy and transportation, and will cause problems that are more expensive to remedy then they are to prevent by moving a bit slower.\n\nAlso, moving a bit slower gives time to recognize and address unforseen problems while they are manageable... Before they grow into huge problems.",

"comment": "Home batteries are generally only hold a day or two of solar production (off-grid systems sometimes go bigger, but it's expensive), and provide at most a week of home power if you use as little as possible.  You would probably use the battery in \"self-consumption\" mode, so that it charges during the day using solar power that would otherwise have gone back to the utility.  Then at night it powers your home, instead of drawing from the utility.\n\nSome days it will not be able to fully recharge from solar, so your house would still draw from the utility unless you reduce consumption.  Some days it will charge up early and there will still be excess solar being generated, so you would want to increase consumption while the sun is shining (doing laundry, A/C, EV charging, etc).  You minimize the power flowing in both directions to/from the utility to minimize your bill.\n\nMany places will actually not let you disconnect from the power grid entirely.  Even if you could, you would need a more expensive system to live off-grid reliably.",

I linked the wrong source then went looking into that article for bits to back up my arguments for what I remembered.\n\n[This is the technology I was thinking of before](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-062011-080951), in conjunction with bits and pieces I've read elsewhere\n\nEssentially they start by burning coal with pure O2 to (after a little filtration) create very pure CO2. Then they compress this into a liquid state. One option at that point is they sequester it in rock at a depth of roughly 1 km and wait, and there's a bunch of other processes they want to use it in with industrial applications.\n\nThe main use when it comes to the production of \"fuel\" in the short term is to create solar fuels, where they use solar power and a catalytic process to create methane or liquid hydrocarbons, to serve as a sort of low-loss long term storage for solar power. The extremely pure CO2 produced by burning coal with pure O2 is ideal for these systems since it takes far less work to produce much higher purity CO2.",

If the OP is in a cooling-dominated climate (which are also the best candidates for solar in North America), then the reduction in heat gain in the summer is more important than the reduction in heat gain in the winter. This is magnified by the fact that those trees are deciduous so he'll see less shading in the winter anyway. If he's in a cooling-dominated climate, cutting those trees down will cause a net increase in energy consumption.\n\n2) Trees are a carbon sink/sequester. Panels are a carbon creator (net lifecycle, depends on the type of electric generation you're supplied by otherwise, etc etc etc). You burn a lot of dead dinosaurs to mine the raw materials for the panel, produce the panel, ship the panel most of the way around the world, and install the panel. Same for the wiring, inverter/charger and batteries.\n\n3) While I think solar panels are cool to look at, trees are cooler.\n\n\nIMO, I want as much solar as I have room/budget for, but not at the expense of trees.",

"comment": "Toyota already has what's effectively BEV powertrains in their PHEVs and FCEVs.  The only difference is the size of the battery and power of the motors.  They're launching two BEVs in 2022, showing they know  how to do it, which will no doubt be low volume.  A whopping 1 year behind the Mach-E (also low volume)... yet they're getting loads of flack for being \"so far behind\" on the technology.\n\nIf Toyota knows the raw material supply chain isn't going to cut it for large scale production, then why would they commit to large scale development of the supply chain?\n\nThose RAV4 Primes are being built in Japan; while I believe all other RAV4s are built in the US.  Not sure about the RAV4 HEV.  They'll double their RAV4 Prime sales in the US this year.  They're also selling them in Japan and in Europe under a different brand. (Suzuki?)  I think it's more a matter of Toyota not wanting to over commit to cell supply and oversupply the market, getting stuck holding too much inventory, as these are expensive vehicles.  It may also be because Toyota simply doesn't think the supply chain can handle BEVs, and cell suppliers don't want to commit to Toyota without a larger contract for BEVs; so they're choosing to sell to other OEMs.    \n\n\nPeople love to compare everyone to Tesla... so I'll do that real quick here.  Tesla can deal with a cell oversupply by sticking those cells in their powerwalls and megapacks; as they mentioned in their earnings call.  Therefore, they can order excess cells at a discount, and won't be SOL if the demand isn't there for their cars.  They may take some minor losses by selling to home/grid storage, but it won't be a total loss.",

"comment": "true.  some of it also depends on the OP's overall plan.  For example, is he driving an electric car today?  And are cooking, heating, hot water, etc. all on electrical systems yet?  If not, would he consider subsequently changing those?  That could generate usage for additional demands.  \n\nThere are also natural growth of usage.  This is especially true as families age.  Older people stay in more and use more electricity.  Teenagers will have larger electricity footprints as they start to have their own phones and computers.  Etc.\n\nA third possibility is battery.  As a society we are finally tackling that technology head on, and it is possible that in 3 or 5 years, battery prices willl have plummeted either with lithium technology or one of the emerging ones.  At that point, it could make financial sense to have batteries that are capable of supplying the home for entire days, and we will need enough solar power for that.\n\nExtending the system three to five years down the road may or may not work.  There will be a second installation fee, and if the expansion amount is too small, you may have difficulty finding a supplier.  So there is a case for having some excess power to future proof the system, as long as the excess installation is not creting too much of a financial burden.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen Sullins talked about future proofing the system by 20 - 30% in this video (his analysis starting at about 15:00):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ5zzS6W13c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ5zzS6W13c)",

Changing out the breaker shouldn't affect the inverter during normal operation so something is wrong with the solar installation. The fact that the 40a breaker tripped is an indication that the breaker needs to be replaced or the solar installation is very wrong.\n3. The RV parking spot breaker is not enough room, you want a 30/40 quad breaker to replace the 40/40\n4. In most places blue #8  wire is very rare. I would verify the brand and type of wire. In many places incorrect coloring is not to code \nNext steps should be- have the electrician out to replace the breaker. Then have sunrun send a technician to resolve their issues. \nSorry for this experience, next time choose competent installers vs big box stores.",

Of course all the sellers in this area only recommend the Powerwall but I think that might be too much battery for our needs. Will ask about the IQ8s though. Thanks!",

"comment": "The cheapest energy is from a source which requires less capital and labour to harvest. Since solar power only requires the initial infrastructure cost and annual maintenance it would be vastly cheaper then using fossil fuel energy sources which require constant investment in equipment and labour to harvest, plus profit for the entity which is harvesting the energy. There is also the additional costs of refining these energy sources to allow for proper consumption.  Last time I checked the sun doesn't require financial compensation  for using it. \n\nSolar power combined with electrical storage in the form of battery banks is the way of the future. Most of our energy comes from the sun already. Fossil fuels are actually solar power which was absorbed by various forms of organic life millions of years ago and was converted to hydrocarbons which we now ignite to release this energy. Let's cut out this unnecessary component to our energy grid. In essence Fossil fuels are actually \"natural batteries\" which we no longer require due to technological advances.",

There’s also something called a gravity battery which would be a solar array a water tower and a hydro turbine. The solar powers a pump and puts the water into the water tower and then when you need the energy you can release the water to generate with the hydro turbine. I’d love to see a water heater steam engine/generator for a community. Everyone showers and uses hot water why don’t we use that heat more effectively?

"comment": "I acknowledge nuclear is expensive. A large reason it hasn’t met any of the previous promises is because legislation and funding hasn’t been there. Nuclear being expensive is a problem that can be solved. And I think we should pursue solving it.\n\nI am arguing from primarily a US perspective. I have no qualms with smaller and more legislatively friendly countries such as the Netherlands not needing or wanting nuclear. The US faces unique challenges with state governments and beauracracy, and its sheer size and variety of climates for where it gets its energy from. \n\n“Cost” is a not a feasible enough argument from my view to say nuclear is the “worst possible source” to make up for seasonal peak demand. Every grid is different, and every technology has pros and cons. Battery storage is also expensive, and we are working to make that less so as well. I celebrate that, but I also acknowledge there are challenges with the materials used to build these batteries and disposal of these batteries after their end-of-life. \n\nNuclear has its own challenges with cost and minimizing environmental impact, which people within the industry take very seriously. I don’t think we should pursue simplification and cost effectiveness of nuclear above all, I think we should pursue it in tandem and use whichever energy source is most suited to each unique case.",

That's two big power plants worth of capacity.\n\nAnd it's cheap power. Mostly hooked up to natural gas plants that can now operate at high efficiencies and use the batteries for peak demand instead of spinning up secondary turbines. It can work with renewable too, but these gas plants are making a killing with it.\n\nThe economics are very lucrative, I'd expect it to be a growing trend in the power industry.",

All the voltages from each panel is stepped up to 400-600V so that no shaded panel can bring down the power of the string. \n\nHigher DC voltages also mean lower losses during transmission to the inverter.  Solar edge also sells a High voltage battery that ties directly into the inverter and management unit.  \\\\\n\nThe only thing I would investigate is getting the battery at system design time.  Many if not most installers will not upgrade after the fact and require you to buy a battery addon as a new system.  The reason is the lease/loan sold with X equipment and changes outside warranty service would void the conditions of the service agreement. \n\nAnd sometimes city/state rules also get in the way. You might start the system under one net metering system and changing that system down the road my have it reevaluated under a new less favorable system.",

"comment": ">Solar on roofs is a scam for most home owners. Either pay out or pocket, or lease them\n\nOh, so paying for a product outright or financing it is a “scam” now? Sounds like basic economics to me. And if you think rooftop solar is a scam, maybe check how much homeowners in sunny regions save on their energy bills. Even financed or leased systems save money over time for many homeowners, especially with incentives like tax credits. Calling it a “scam” just because you can’t understand the math is lazy.\n\n> If you lease them you can't sell the house. Basically the realtors say pay off the panels then we will put it on the market\n\nWrong again. Homes with solar panels, even leased ones, can be sold—often at a premium. Many buyers see value in lower energy costs. Yes, you may need to negotiate a transfer or buyout if they’re leased, but that doesn’t make it unsellable. In fact, studies show homes with solar sell faster and at higher prices than those without. Maybe if you checked real estate data instead of talking to your “sources,” you’d know this.\n\n>These companies install panels on houses until the first one starts to fail and then dissappear.\n\nTotal nonsense. Solar companies often offer warranties lasting 20-25 years. Plus, reputable installers have dedicated maintenance teams, and customers can choose from companies with strong service records. Sure, a few bad apples exist in any industry, but they’re the exception, not the rule.\n\n>They can't be used for anything else.\n\nAnd here we go again with this bizarre fixation on “dead zones.” Ever heard of agrivoltaics? You have, because I already told you about it. How about using solar installations on brownfields, rooftops, or even water reservoirs? Many farms even allow for vegetation and grazing underneath and around panels. Solar farms don’t “kill” land; in many cases, they give it a new purpose. Educate yourself on dual-use solar installations, because “dead zone” is just nonsense.\n\n>And they still require maintenance\n\nWelcome to reality, where everything from coal plants to cars requires maintenance. Solar farms need far less maintenance than fossil fuel infrastructure, and their operating costs are a fraction of other energy sources. And, yes, sometimes that involves mowing grass and managing vegetation—just like any other property. What exactly do you think this proves?\n\n\n>I know a guy who quit this field and started doing weed control around the panels on solar farms.\n\nCongratulations, you know a guy. Anecdotes don’t replace data. One person switching jobs says nothing about the viability, sustainability, or value of an entire industry. If anything, it shows there are jobs in solar farms for all types of work, from installation to maintenance.",

"comment": "I have Tesla solar with powerwalls. I configure it to operate on time-base control which will maxize my TOU credits. I believe it's highest priority is to fully charge the powerwalls, then the house and finally the grid. In a typical day, solar will charge my powerwalls to 100% before 4pm (peak time). After the powerwalls are fully charged, solar goes to house consumption and any excess solar goes to the grid. From 4-9pm, all solar goes to grid (maximize TOU rates) and powerwall powers the house.\n\nIt's a little different on weekends as super off peak is from midnight to 2pm. So my powerwalls will not fully charge on Friday and Saturday since it has until 2pm next day to fully charge the powerwalls, again to maximize TOU credits. The level that the powerwalls are charged up to on Friday and Saturday depends on your past usage. Mine typically charges to 70% on these two days because I set my backup reserve to 20% and typically don't use more than 50% of my powerwalls during peak hours.\n\nHope this explanation helps.",

Is Brudin another clueless liberal-arts major who can't read and process information?\n\nWhen solar disappeared at night, hydro output was increased, but fossil-power was still needed to supply 60% of the grid.  Batteries only cover very brief dips in solar output.\n\nThe investment in solar panels will need to be repeated when they reach their end-of-life after \\~25 years.  Most of California's solar production is not from the industrial array in the photo, but rather from residents feeding the grid.  Utilities don't want any more of that since credit minimal now for grid-feed (7 c/kWh) and keep petitioning the PUC to lower it to 3 c/kWh.  No more net-metering, unless grandfathered.  They also want high fees to grid-connect.  Much of this investment was via tax credits, meaning everyone contributed towards it, both State and Federal taxpayers.",

Is it utilitarianism or deontology that motivates anti-poverty institutions?\n\nPeace activists and anti-poverty institutions do not share a monolithic ideology.  Similarly, to my knowledge, veganism does not share the dogmatic and codified structure of the Roman Catholic Church (at least, not yet).  The reason you haven't seen \"a\" standard on the exact ethical grounds for veganism is because there isn't \"a\" standard.\n\nYou have every right to criticize individuals for inconsistently when jumping between standards, though you don't give any actual examples.  However, this doesn't add support for your seemingly pointless criticism that vegans are not all unified in the personal beliefs that motivate their veganism.",

"comment": "Pizza was my weakness, and in some ways it still is. After just a month or two I was able to fight the cravings even with several pizzas in front of me. \nI was lucky enough to have been given a couple pucks of Cheezly (which for some reason is no longer being sold in the USA) and sprinkled it on a homemade pizza. This with broccoli, tomatoes, garlic and basil made the most amazing pizza I've ever had!\n\nYes, cheese substitutes are expensive, but you can buy in bulk and freeze the rest of the block and get months of use out of them.\n\nAlso, nutritional yeast is so delicious when used in pastas. I want to try a baked ziti with yeast.\n\nMy roommate made an absolutely amazing mac and cheese using squash soup. I'm not sure if this is the recipe, but it's the same thing: http://www.vegsource.com/talk/elders/messages/7713.html\n\nVegweb is an awesome website.\n\nGood luck!",

In general, if countries are effectively implementing public health measures, the risk is very low. For example, in the United Kingdom the current estimated risk of acquiring vCJD from beef and beef products appears to be about 1 case in 10 billion servings. The risk from beef in other high-incidence countries is estimated to be very low, as well.\"\n\nAlthough being vegan has plenty of life-extending benefits, it probably wouldn't have saved your life from this disease because the chances of you getting it from beef are less than .000000001%",

I mean, they knowingly ate animal products! It may have been only once over their entire 5 years of \"veganism\" but by golly, they don't get that label. What should they call themselves?\n\nListen, I appreciate purists and abolitionists. I think that they do great things and keep the vegan label non-muddied. I just don't see the point in vilifying people doing their best and doing a fairly good job at it.",

They cannot plausibly feel pain without a CNS. They are also good for the health of the water they're grown in, and do not cause any deforestation or other destruction of habits to grow. They contain iron and B12. This is my only deviation from a purely plant-based diet, because I prefer to base my eating habits on whether I'm actually causing harm, not arbitrary taxonomic groups.",

But the way we do it, is much more hassle free as people for some reason think cheese is good on everything, or milk should be added to shit. \n\nTL:DR\nPick your battles. :-) keep it up",

No problem just tell them for no reason at all. \n\nUnsurprisingly things get really awkward and the person I'm talking to feels the need to get defensive immediately. \n\nMeeting somebody, showing them that I'm not completely weird and then letting them find out that I'm vegan would be so much better. But, hey I guess I have amazing friends so I don't ever have to tell anybody.\n\nAtleast nobody here in Germany thinks of veganism as some fad diet.",

"comment": "I very heartily object to the act of eating meat and the abuse of animals. I'm dedicating my life to working with conservation, education, and the rehabilitation of animals. I do not respect their decision to ignore the abuse that livestock goes through, as they are aware of how much suffering those creatures undergo. I do, however, respect their choice to choose what goes into their body and to not make the -difficult- conversion to veganism. Because it is hard. And it isn't practical for everyone. My parents can't really afford it at the moment, nor can my boyfriend with the way he eats (literally just one giant carne asada burrito a day plus a couple snacks here and there gets him through. it's weird.). Sure, they could do it, I'm not saying it's impossible, but this is easier for them. And when they weigh it in their minds, they value their ease and convenience over the suffering of animals. I do not. While I'm not -okay- with their choice, I still respect the fact that I cannot change their minds. Lord knows I've tried. So I choose to just respect their decision, and back off.\n\nIt's been hard though. It's especially hard for me to not feel mildly repulsed by my mom, especially... She tells me stories of how she bottle-fed calves for their herd when the mother rejected them, and how she'd go out and play with them years later and they always remembered her. How she loved all the baby piglets and how once, a sow died and she and her mom raised 12 of them in their basement, converting it to a piglet nursery. How some of the hens she raised remembered her and loved to sit on her lap.... I don't know how she can eat them, knowing what they suffer, and knowing these animals so intimately. It baffles me. But it is her choice, and I refuse to alienate myself from my mom just because of that. It's bullshit. She's one of the most kind-hearted people I know. I could make her watch Earthlings by tying her up and taping her eyes open, and she'd be an emotional wreck for weeks, if not months after. She knows some of it, but chooses to be ignorant for her own emotional stability. This is just how she was raised; on a farm in the midwest, where meat was in every meal. So I accept how she is and love her for it nonetheless. Her choice doesn't make any sense to me, not at all, but I know she isn't eating meat out of willful cruelty. She eats it because she always has, and because it tastes good. \n\nIt is trying. Especially so when my stepdad frequently says I should at least eat like, chicken, because it's good for my health (I'm underweight by ~20-25lbs, and yes I could give up my morals to make the weight gain easier, but that's not fucking happening). And I have to have almost an entirely separate meal from them because they've got butter and milk in one thing, and then meat's the other dish, and only the untainted veggies are left for me to share. / shrug. I'm thankful they're willing to provide me with food that meets my needs though. That in and of itself is a step forward, I feel. Acceptance. It isn't easy. I'd love to sit down and eat a meal with my family without any need for double-prepping stuff. It'd be great! But the 4 of them (incl. siblings) against the 1 of me... They aren't changing. I'd have to change. And I'm not doing that. At least one of my siblings is showing vegetarian tendencies and while she does eat some meat, she's been avoiding it recently and preferring more veggies and grains. I'm trying to get her into tofu or even fish if it's easier for her (12 y/o) to perhaps change just one of them. :')",

I leave out the cheese and do not substitute *or* sometimes substitute with hummus, nutritional yeast, avocado, baba ghanoush, etc.....depending on what flavor or texture I'm trying to emulate. Hummus = creamy and tangy, nutritional yeast = sorta cheesy, umami flakes, avocado = smooth and creamy, baba ghanoush = savory and creamy. Experiment and have fun in your cooking adventures!",

"comment": "I used to bash vegans before I became one, what matters now is that you realize that veganism is a more ethical way of living. You have to find what works for you in the transition. Some people need to replace things slowly whereas I needed to do it cold turkey or I would never make the change. What helped me was watching documentaries to help me support my decision, looked up fun recipes or vegan recipe blogs, tried vegan restaurants in town and started to actually learn and understand nutritional science so I could learn how to properly fuel my body on the vegan diet. People who quit the vegan diet usually don't eat enough calories or the right calories and then blame the vegan diet for making them feel tired or crappy. Making vegan friends or joining vegan clubs also helps a lot. Also, slip ups can happen, but it is ok, just move on and be better the next time. Good luck!",

"comment": "I haven't received any pushback for refusing to do animal research, but this isn't the focus of our lab. When he hired me, my PI mentioned that it would be something I could do if I were interested and I said I wasn't, after which there wasn't any further discussion. I would say about a third of the lab does animal experiments, and they are not held in our lab but rather in partnership with another lab whose main area of research it is. My lab knows I'm vegan but I haven't had many questions about why I abstain from animal products - only recently they realized I hadn't always been vegan, which is quite funny to me (there aren't that many vegans from birth! (yet)). \nI'm happy to answer any other questions you might have, but I'll tell you one thing: a PhD is hard. Lots of work, little reward. It's a marathon, and if you start your project with doubts, it is very unlikely you will get to the finish line. Definitely choose a project that you can feel passionate about, not one whose usefulness you already question.",

"comment": "It doesn’t have as much to do with big-ag as you think. It was foreseeable if you know how Italy ticks, and especially, how it currently ticks. The mediterran cuisine is low-key holy to them. E.g., there is the [Italian Academy of Cuisine](https://www.accademiaitalianadellacucina.it/en/content/academy-and-its-aims) and they make the official recipe for sauce Bolognese. It was a borderline miracle when they[changed the official recipe some time ago](https://cookingitalians.com/bolognese-sauce-official-recipe-changes-the-new-version/). So the italian cuisine is serious business in Italy. And tradition is their criterion no. 1.\n\nApart from that, Italy is currently governed by a far-right government, which, as you surely can imagine yourself, isn‘t too fond of everything ‚meatless alternative‘. I know, I don‘t understand either, but that‘s just how it is.\n\nAnd besides, why should any meat producer oppose lab-grown meat? If they are not dependent on raising and slaughtering billions of animals, it just means they can sell cheaper goods for the same price. Why should they care where their meat comes from?",

I acknowledge this can be tricky, depending on the area we live, and what's available, especially throughout winter. Still seems important though, to eat as local and seasonally as possible. Additionally, I eat various fruits and vegetables. A variety of proteins, including hemp, soy, nuts and more. Soaking is recommended for all nuts and seeds, besides hemp. Dabbling some with sprouting seeds and fermenting vegetables as well. Being extra careful with added sugars...most days. \n\nUsing a b12 supplement, and also testing out a vegan taurine and creatine supplement. Recently adding iodine but haven't noticed any symptoms of diffeciency. No noticeable difference with the b12, taurine and creatine either. Maybe more subtle, who knows. \n\nEating an average 50% raw diet, I usually only eat one grand meal each day. Intermittent fasting otherwise, with plenty of clean water.",

Ask yourself why no social justice movement has reached its true goals and then ask why you think veganism will be any different. \n\nWhat's funny is all these corporations (beyond, impossible) test on or kill animals for profit. Like they literally tell you that's what they're doing and vegans just go \"well its for the greater good. We have condone these corporations killing &amp; abusing animals for profit to achieve  a vegan future.\"",

One can also deduce that there are more and more low-income vegans, that may have kids who want burgers/chicken like many of us did when there was no such thing as veggie anything.   Now parents (Vegan or not) can choose something healthier for their kids, and will maybe even try it themselves.  The fact that so many people think this is bad thing is pretty fucked up.....it already was a horrific situation so how can adding something \nVegan being added to It be worse?

I have never recommended a fad diet, and I AM well aware of the dangers of inadequate diets.\n4. If I have a client who wants to feed a non-commercial diet (i.e. not complete & balanced), I ALWAYS direct them to a veterinary nutritionist. \n5. We have a vegan pet food available in Australia that has been around for almost 20 years (since 2007) that is AAFCO certified.
