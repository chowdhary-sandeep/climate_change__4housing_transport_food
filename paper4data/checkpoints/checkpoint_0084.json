For example let's say your going 50mph, if you had either a front crash into a stationary object or a head on collision the car will literally go from 50mph to 0 in a fraction of a second. The crumple zone spreads the force over a greater amount of time to help reduce the violent stopping effect of the seat belts and air bags as your body continues moving forward after impact and you head and limbs are forcefully whipped forward. However if you were struck from behind by a car or truck going 50 you will almost never go from 0 to 50mph due to the weight of the Tesla. The force of the collision will be much less than a frontal crash and even be less than that if whatever hits you has its own crumple zone. Lastly in a rear impact this force is not being pushed against your body on two small seatbelt straps and an airbag, but it is pushing your body back into a large seat which will cradle your body and head perfectly to reduce injury, especially head and neck injury.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001256696879863739,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28094758454614494,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17451218889874007,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.32186183457573253,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2881924709974036,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21243037630849798,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10998743456730153,"ev_1":-0.02838177912296184,"ev_2":-0.008267194027818428,"ev_3":-0.0008042967213744608,"ev_4":-0.0018081368786321643,"ev_5":-0.006315333865738164,"ev_6":-0.2306968008148639},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

If the panels were ideally tilted for the sunlight, you could probably dump 1500W back into the battery.\n\nThe panels, racking, and cabling would likely weigh around 600 pounds. A 25 foot 10 canoe trailer weighs around 700 pounds, probably pretty close to what we'd need here.\n\nA 3300 pound Nissan LEAF uses about 250 Wh/mile at 55 mph on level ground, or about 14 kW. Add a 1300 pound 25 foot trailer behind the LEAF, and the power draw would probably increase by at least 40% (to 20 kW).\n\nThis solar trailer would use 4 times as much power as it was giving back to the EV on the road!\n\nAfter an hour of driving, the trailer would use an extra 4500 Wh from the LEAF battery. After 3 hours stopped at rest, it would be back to net zero and would start adding net charge to the LEAF. It'd take another 10 ish hours to fully charge the LEAF from its hour of driving, ignoring the fact that the sun is probably down by this time.\n\nNot very good!\n\nHow to improve?\n\nOne way would be to slow down. At 40 mph, the LEAF without a trailer would only use about 8 kW. The same 40% penalty is now only twice as large as the gain from solar; after driving an hour and a half to cover 60 miles, the LEAF would need to stop for about 10 hours to charge back up (vs the 13 hours at 55 mph).\n\nAt even slower speeds - say 20 mph - the panels would start to produce more power than they used. At 10 mph, the panels could almost produce enough energy to drive both the car and the panel trailer.\n\nAnother way would be to ditch the trailer, and carry the panels in the car. The same 8 panels carried in the car would take up most of the cargo volume and payload capacity (not sure they'd even fit), but it would only impart a small penalty to highway power consumption (+10%). After 60 miles of driving at 40 mph and pulling the panels out, the car would fully charge in about 9 hours at the destination.\n\nAnother way would be to build an integrated aero tail for the LEAF and cover the roof and tail with solar cells; probably 1+ kW could be fitted. The solar tail would add some weight - say 200 pounds. The solar tail would really only help at higher speeds, say 25% reduction in power draw at 40 mph (12% from improved aero, 12% from solar power) and about 25% at 55 mph (18% from improved aero, 7% from solar generated). At 70 mph the majority of the power reduction would be from aero, still about 25% overall (20% aero, 4% solar power).\n\nThe 1 kW tail would still take quite a while to charge the car even in ideal conditions: 1.5 hours of driving at 40 mph would take 9 hours to charge; 1 hour of driving at 55 mph would take about 10 hours to charge, and an hour of driving at 70 mph would take about 18 hours to charge.\n\nTo do much better than this you will need a much lighter, more aerodynamic vehicle.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00017587708862265572,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17901197418948414,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2822253389019499,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24678600141078277,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1459410380034919,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22028878334986052,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.027543894248083234,"ev_1":-0.2242489581053559,"ev_2":-0.02316679014378072,"ev_3":-0.037706207117783684,"ev_4":-0.0016555740427672088,"ev_5":-0.003266582417078704,"ev_6":-0.016953967727507308},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I am a Musk fanboy.  That said.....  We need to learn more about this battery system.  At first glance from the specs online his system is more form than function.  Here is why:\nMy home usage is about 30kWh a day.  Since you don't want a battery dropping below 50% average a day then you need about 60kWh capacity.  A Trojan L-16RE-B battery would take 3 strings of 8 batteries to get to 60kWh .  Total cost would be about $9438 at last nights price online.\nTesla will have two models.  A (100Hr) 10kWh backup system for $3500 that isn't designed to be drawn down every day.  A (20Hr) 7kWh system for $3000 that is designed to be used daily.  **IF** that is total capacity and **IF** we can only use 50% of that on a daily draw then you would end up needing the max 9 units which would cost you $25,800.\nThe Tesla system does not come with the DC-AC inverter so if you don't have an existing solar system be prepared to spend several more thousands.  Lets assume though that if your looking at this that you do have the inverters and they are smart enough to run this system.\n\nTrojan system would cost you $9,438\nTesla system would cost you $25,800\nSo you would be spending $16,362 extra to have a pretty wall mounted setup.  \n\nUntil the end of 2016 we get tax rebates that equal about 50% if you add the battery system as part of a solar install.\nSo the Trojan system will end up costing $4,719 as apposed to $12,900.\n\nI'm using Trojan as just an example.  A high end rolls S-530 setup would cost you $10,598 for the same 3 string 60 kWh system.\n\nI'm hoping that the Tesla kWh figure is actually the 50% usage number.  That will make it much closer and form may be worth the extra cost.  Will be interesting to see how this battery is actually tested in comparison.  I know Elon says current batteries suck but his battery is still Li-Ion based.  There is a lot of really cool battery technology that is being tested that should come out within the next 2-5 years that will see these numbers change drastically and could see costs drop over 70% by the end of the decade.  Especially if Graphin turns out as good as it looks. \n\nThis all said I hope that lots of people buy just one of these batteries from Tesla so that advances in research and the influx of other companies create an environment that finally pushes solar power of the top of the hill.  These systems are already cheaper than the power company for most areas.  But if they get another 25% cheaper or even better we will see wide spread adoption.

The interest comes from not spending on gasoline, maintenance, etc. Often, this customer is cross shopping an ev with a civic or corolla to see what will cost less in total over their time of ownership. This crowd generally looks at bolts, e golf's, leafs, etc. \n\nSecond, there are people who are looking for cachet. They want the \"cool\" factor and are willing to pay more than they would for an ice vehicle to get it. This crowd generally looks at teslas, taycans, I paces, etc.\n\nOf course this is simplifying it a bit, but from a primary reason for buying perspective this grabs almost every current ev buyer. \n\nThe problem for oems is that the first group is almost by definition less profitable. When you're comparing dollars saved on a spreadsheet, you'll be cutthroat in your shopping. If a bolt is 200 less than a leaf, almost the entirely of this market will go to the bolt. If the leaf becomes cheaper, it will dominate. This market will always squeeze profits down to the absolute minimum. Even worse, for an oem, these same customers are likely to hold their cars for a decade or more. Limiting potential future sales, and requiring a better built car overall or risk having this customer jump ship when stuff starts to break at year 5.\n\nThe second group will more often go for a specific car because they want that one car, even if the costs are higher. This customer will live with lower build quality because they wanted a different feature instead (speed, looks, branding). This customer is also significantly more likely to lease or turn over cars every few years, increasing selling opportunities. They are also more likely to pay for expensive (and profitable) options. \n\nIf you're an OEM looking at this, it's pretty clear which option is more profitable. GM focusing on the later makes a lot of sense from a business perspective. Until the ev market is large enough that making a very small amount on a lot of cars is feasible, associating your ev with existing high end branding just makes sense.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.009647864828972766,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3354679898580022,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.13898846101574178,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1787287085780278,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.161370124403202,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2091982292673298,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23765357018137198,"ev_1":-0.12292310500573073,"ev_2":-0.19049562418578128,"ev_3":-0.1228052925884731,"ev_4":-0.12195988462796474,"ev_5":-0.13201473703647332,"ev_6":-0.20235352762507977},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed\n\nThe author expresses an understanding of the different motivations for buying EVs, but does not explicitly state a personal stance.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I think most of us, when we first switch, set up a handful of apps and charging accounts. Once those are set up, using those tools makes long drives pretty straightforward. (And a lot of EVs are also now building-in this sort of functionality to their onboard nav systems.)\n\nAnd you're right, most EV owners just charge at home, overnight.

I have one of the Harbor Freight kits (not really worth it) and I have a 100 watt 12v panel from WindyNation. *Totaling 145 watts) I know WindyNation has a 200 watt kit on sale right now with 2 100 watt panels, charge controller, mount brackets and I think some cabling + 25 year warranty on the panels for 279 with free shipping.\n\nThen you'll want a charge controller.  I have a cheap 30 amp charge controller that I got by looking on Amazon.  It's basically the cheapest one from China.   The important part about the charge controller is that it has a DC output on it.  Mine does what the documentation calls \"street light mode\"   By this, it will activate the 12v output when there is no longer voltage coming from the panels.  I'll get to how I have it set up in a bit.\n\nYou'll want a battery or more.  I use 2 group 24 Marine/RV 12 volt batteries from Wal-Mart currently. Probably pick up more when I get more panels.\n\nAnd an inverter.  You'll probably want something in the range of 3000 running watts, so you'll be putting down some money on this.    You'll also need some pretty healthy wiring for that.  As you'll be talking ability to put around 200 amps to the DC side.  I have a 1200 watt MSW inverter that won't start my 10 amp circular saw, so you need to have more inverter than what you're planning on pulling.  \n\nPure sine wave is the preferred inverter, though more expensive.  The Modified Sine Wave, like I have, doesn't do the best with inductive loads like electric motors.  The motor will tend to buzz, and run a bit slower and less efficient.  But they do work.\n\nWith my Harbor Freight solar kit I got 2 12vdc 5 watt CFL's with it.  I use them for outdoor lighting. (Though, I haven't had the CFL try to light during the cold winter months yet so I'll find out here in about January if they work when really cold).   These bulbs, which might just be on a adapter base, have a regular medium screw in base like a household light bulb does.   So, they're screwed into an exterior light fixture.  The other end is wired to the DC output on the charge controller. The controller is set to street light mode for 2 hours (which is adjustable from always off any number of hours, dusk til dawn, always on, or selectable).  So after the sun goes down, the controller simply draws power from the batteries for the exterior lighting.  \n\nFrom the sounds of it, you'll probably want to set up something similar.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23259872781151594,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22678698616003656,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.11080886982142601,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22668720474292847,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28789923517397903,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.33114764963587123,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.199502360867616,"solar_1":-0.12665599980285885,"solar_2":-0.1931145920069488,"solar_3":-0.028981076913623838,"solar_4":-0.26648582993342035,"solar_5":-0.11407589865484624,"solar_6":-0.27465792556176893,"solar_7":-0.0269102160333811,"solar_8":-0.05515429905158666,"solar_9":-0.09899243780628808,"solar_10":-0.06087836933632692},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

I really want to know how much it would cost since it would be good to make a comparison with battery packs.\n\n&gt;No, pressurized hydrogen does not leak out any quicker than your gasoline evaporates.\n\nThis one I have a hard time to believe, but let's move on. \n\n&gt;We're not talking about fossil natural gas, we're talking about using existing fossil natural gas infrastructure\n\nMost of the hydrogen today is obtained from natural gas that's why I said that in my previous comment. \n\n&gt;The electrical grid doesn't store, natural gas grid does.\n\nYou also misunderstood me as I meant that the grid is far more developed for charging cars then any other alternative infrastructure that has to be built. Also, storage will arrive to electrical grids soon.\n\n&gt;Toyota is banking in wind to gas hydrogen becoming abundant and cheap. In my opinion, that bet is far from being lost yet.\n\nIt's a matter of time until battery storage becomes cheaper than anything else but granted right now it might not be. Although I do take issue with this statement\n\n&gt;The only technology which can absorb arbitrary amounts of power is water electrolysis, because it's simple and cheap, and water is everywhere.\n\nWhy? It's not even the prevalent energy storage system deployed today and that in itself should be a hint that it's inferior to others and it only makes sense if you really need the hydrogen. \n\nI recommend checking out this discussion regarding grid power storage\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R7EzO3uBms","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00012590714201602773,"1.1.1_stance":-0.03769699268268454,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18635311339182403,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.313686330161194,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2481874481273221,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20339137335753077,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.01220666696705545,"solar_1":-0.1348755949407157,"solar_2":-0.20961813911410737,"solar_3":-0.2065722132853504,"solar_4":-0.09710715198525577,"solar_5":-0.022838777692716878,"solar_6":-0.01550010676267751,"solar_7":-0.10147288361865019,"solar_8":-0.018670158890017774,"solar_9":-0.012622490570748823,"solar_10":-0.2493104218544128},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I looked on eBay and their prices seem a lot higher than that. For me it's a workable solution at that price. But there are many other heat transfer solutions. Brines are popular as well. \n\nOne consideration you haven't mentioned is pumps. That's a lot more problematic at high temperatures than low temperatures but it is one that I have to admit is quite serious when you're getting into liquid heat transfer solutions. \n\nYou asked about humidity and that's a great point. I already have several Panasonic dehumidifiers in my house so it stays quite dry. I've modified them so that they continuously dump water out to some flower boxes. I avoided them for years assuming that they were electricity hogs but I later learned that they were quite efficient and the ones I have are each about 150watt. I run them 24 hours a day but it's not a huge burden. I have some PV on the roof as well. \n\nAs I was explaining in my original post, I have this big hot solar thermal tank and I have considered using the heat from that to run a dessicant wheel in one of the air conditioning holes in the walls of the house. However, since I got the dehumidifiers I'm not sure if it's really worth the hassle. What I keep coming back to with all these neat solutions is the need for pumps. This is definitely the big gotcha in all of these projects. It's not a deal killer but it's definitely worth considering carefully. It's easy to think it's all simple but the pump issue doesn't solve itself. Just finding pumps can be tricky business and many people who sell them have no idea what their actual specs are and simply say that they're for water or diesel fuel transfer and can't be used for anything else. I've had many pump dealers simply refuse to sell me anything at any price when I started telling them what I was doing. It can be frustrating. I've ended up with some interesting industrial grade solutions from Aliexpress though. The trick is that when you start adding more and more applications you need more and more pumps. It's better to stay focused on the big goals like whole house cooling instead of getting off into say a solar clothes dryer or something of that nature which sounds cool till you realize how complex and costly all the pumping and heat exchange equipment is.  \n\nI also can't get net metering although I do use a grid tie inverter and some panels to offset some of my usage. I have no agreement with the utility on that though and net metering is not an option. They haven't complained about what I'm doing so far but I never asked them for any permission. I used a very cheap grid-tie inverter off of Aliexpress that only ran me eighty bucks. It's rated for 1000 watts and I run two 250 watt panels into it. For me the PV partly offsets things like my dehumidifiers but they really don't draw much current. I highly recommend dehumidifiers as a first approach because it blew me away how much it improved the interior air quality of my house when I got one and then I wanted another one because it was such a nice improvement. We used to really struggle with mold and dampness and those days are gone. \n\nAlso, you might find this helpful when considering the economics of transfer fluid: \n\nUsing 1/2 inch tube it's about one US gallon per hundred feet of tube. So at four liters per gallon and eight bucks a liter that's US$32 per hundred feet of heat exchange tubing to charge it with 1cSt silicone oil with the price I can get here. If you can't get a reasonable price consider going with a brine solution. Naturally you have to take that into account with your pump selection as well.  \n\nYou could even use regular table salt but nitrate salts should be cheap too. The reason I like oil as a heat transfer solution is that I believe it will be easier on the pump and the pumps are very much a real-world issue. In the end, if the pump ain't working the whole thing is going nowhere. Again though if you're only targeting cold you've got it way easier than my case where I need high temperature. High temperature pumps suck because you can't use plastic and it's hard to find small metal pumps and then if you do find them they have to be appropriate for the viscosity you're targeting and can't have seals that will be eroded by what you're pumping and all this bullshit. I confess that part sucks. But that's my burden with the snazzy heat-to-cold plan. For this other idea of going with an off the shelf ice source it's much simpler because you should be okay with plastic. Plastic should work for low temperature and even brines should be fine with plastics. You can probably get away with even a cheap pond pump since you don't need high temperatures.\n\nA 16% NaCL brine will enable you to go down to -10C and would be a very cheap and easy to source way to go that would probably work with a cheap plastic pond pump.   \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine\n\nYou could start with that and if you ran into freezing problems (rather unlikely in the hot summer when you'd be using it the most) you could take the plunge and try to source some synthetic low viscosity oils.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00045362667394025874,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21012289734122272,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16645666667373007,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17108835031588873,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18388927570668068,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1893051125248655,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08830987904426972,"solar_1":-0.10251170787435225,"solar_2":-0.163802818977274,"solar_3":-0.18610391802697754,"solar_4":-0.26860241046597366,"solar_5":-0.05702769492927473,"solar_6":-0.08295826509129256,"solar_7":-0.18541104674901968,"solar_8":-0.03931697438868772,"solar_9":-0.2225864918921919,"solar_10":-0.23523969767928093},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Utility scale solar sees benefits in capital costs because of the scale - buy more get a lower price. But it also tends to add to distribution costs (many solar farms are not ideally located near highest demand). Total net, it is somewhat cheaper per kW and per kWh.\n\nResidential solar is typically all behind the meter. So it theoretically could lower distribution costs (utility or provider costs). Currently one issue preventing residential solar from being almost equally cost effective is the time of day supply/demand reality.  Time shifting or leveling the demand per 24 hour period (demand = what is seen at the meter) is getting more cost effective, but energy storage has a ways to go.\n\nSome who have installed solar on their homes also are diligent in their energy monitoring and management.

Americans seem to have better interconnection rights than they realize (although, my belief is that the electric grid should be a public asset with extreme consumer protections such as net-metering, RPS, and PURPA enforced at the federal level in addition to a carbon tax).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006678211793769151,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12216915084482025,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2934293375432436,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.09977219998836517,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29738779809687715,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.217277581461218,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02779171855460542,"solar_1":-0.04720575337705668,"solar_2":-0.034582201847418524,"solar_3":-0.004338153907156084,"solar_4":-0.0034914569017322115,"solar_5":-0.039854030086038016,"solar_6":-0.0005861297825807318,"solar_7":-0.0009777580514006938,"solar_8":-0.0018842981371562928,"solar_9":-0.159056573894001,"solar_10":-0.03168783317475269},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Even if only 1% of that land is usable and you cover it in solar panels, you would still produce more power than humanity would ever consume. In fact, it would only take a 10,000 square mile array in the middle of the god-forsaken desert somewhere to completely replace the entire source of power for the USA (http://www.terrawatts.com/PV-production.html). \n\nNow that we have established there is FAR more land area available than could ever conceivably be needed, why on Earth would you want to put fragile solar panels in the dang road? The venn diagram of things a road does and things a solar panel does has just about no overlap whatsoever. Solar roadways are one of those things that appeal to the scientifically illiterate because at first glance, we have lots of roads sittin around doin' nothin' all day, why not slap solar panels all over them? Putting solar panels in the road can certainly be done but why would you want to put something that needs as much sun exposure as possible in a place where it won't be pointed at the sun any other time besides noon and where cars will be driving over and shading the panels? Putting solar panels under civic areas and where people live means they won't get any sun. It makes soooo much more sense to put solar panels on buildings or in large solar farms where their positioning and maintenance can be optimized for peak power production. Getting power to where it needs to be is not a problem that needs solved in most of the world. The electrical distribution grid is already pretty much in place where it needs to be.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001855659900077929,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20187649587975898,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3087167630552573,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24016558062408427,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18254564460787337,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22822794131934643,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19070965283208352,"solar_1":-0.1254461535007956,"solar_2":-0.08521730263047837,"solar_3":-0.25976949900359614,"solar_4":-0.049235939794016303,"solar_5":-0.20453585969517007,"solar_6":-0.005466211910970742,"solar_7":-0.008442203371184101,"solar_8":-0.01813691798573321,"solar_9":-0.02710384290384127,"solar_10":-0.3349636387574719},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options for solar in roads.

Public utility that crushed rooftop solar a few years back with bad rates, not subject to corporation commission review btw, bc it was taking a substantial revenue hit. This was when zero down was allowing solar city/tesla and others to basically circumvent the monopoly provider and provide lower electricity rates. They couldn’t stand the competition and jacked the fees on solar customers to kill the economics. There was a lawsuit, but basically the damage was done.

It's like if I knew you were about to ask out a crazy girl.  I can tell you she's psycho and she'll screw up your house and finances, but I can't stop you from dating her.\n\nBefore you agree to anything with Vivint, at least ask to see:\n\n1. The billing history.\n\n2. The system production history from the equipment, not from Vivint.    This generally comes from the inverters.  I usually see EnPhase and their Enlighten monitoring.   I've found that Vivint is extremely reluctant to share this information, even though it should be very easy to access.  \n\nThese two sets of numbers should match.\n\nVivint's solar contract doesn't hold them accountable for much.  There's zero guarantee of how much power the system will produce. \n Generally, if the system stops working, they are extremely slow to respond (if at all).  From what I've seen, they will simply keep billing customers, even if they can't prove the system is making power.  \n\nI don't know your specific market, what utility you have, or the specific production of your system, but I'd be very surprised if a new 4.5 kw system would cost you any more than $13k (after the 30% federal tax credit).  If your lease payment is $100/month, and the escalator is only 2.9%, you'll pay about $24,000 to Vivint in the next 14 years.\n\nIn my area, net metering is also grandfathered.  It's based on approval size, not any specific system.  If one of my clients wanted to replace a 4.5 kw system with another 4.5 kw system, they could keep their existing net metering agreement.\n\nI will agree that replacing an existing PV system is fairly extreme, but that's the level of problems I've seen people have with their Vivint systems.  If it is working, and you (or the current homeowner) are able to buy it out and get Vivint out of your life, that's still a better option than taking over the lease.  \n\nAgain, I strongly urge you to check out the comments and reviews before agreeing to anything. You don't want to spend the next 14 years shackled to this company.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.013977172745702168,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26192130203570385,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1803175906340281,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3395231763217514,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22184541167229574,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16895486697363885,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013335250589686135,"solar_1":-0.2812555519243081,"solar_2":-0.006342451332481384,"solar_3":-0.014308342700436091,"solar_4":-0.22946066489610342,"solar_5":-0.0011641417598487653,"solar_6":-0.11554182422161337,"solar_7":-0.011679371120408177,"solar_8":-0.005161865716218017,"solar_9":-0.1747996373831523,"solar_10":-0.2570604951942739},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"The author's stance toward solar: neither/mixed.

It talks about vegetarianism and then sneaks in how eggs and milk are bad in the back door. Also, veganism is about more than just about diet, even though that is by far the biggest contribution to our exploitation of animals.\n\nIt would be nice to see the references to the claims made. Some readers will appreciate the transparency.\n\nI like that there are no horrific pictures in the section on animals. There were some good parts of the argument against animal exploitation and I felt like it needed a clear summary of why exactly it is unjustifiable.

It would most likely be a matter of several generations to get the world to even be a majority vegan. I probably wouldn't personally eat it, just because meat grosses me out now, but wouldn't really have a problem with it from an exploitation standpoint.\n\nI agree my diabetic analogy was flawed, and the makeup one is better. You say \"those ingredients aren't themselves from animals\", which is the exact situation this lab meat is. It would be an almost exact replica of meat, but still would not come from animals (beyond the very beginning stages). I don't see how lab meat encourages the notion that animal exploitation is OK unless people are not told it is lab meat.\n\nI would be perfectly OK with taking cells from a willing human to grow for human meat (though I doubt it would be a hit). I am against both slavery and animal exploitation, but I think if you asked a slave to give up some cells to free all of the slaves of the world, he/she would probably agree to it. Unfortunately, animals cannot consent, so we must make this choice for them. Just as we have chosen to exploit them now, we must make the choice to stop exploiting them. I feel that lab meet would be a more practical answer to this in many people's cases who have no interest in cutting down their meat production.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0017312746689034004,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3542805631420031,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20484099861513416,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25397595449888083,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1857713908795715,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27065190438084086,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1360344188772918,"diet_1":-0.14301062585339727,"diet_2":-0.19231052493764234,"diet_3":-0.11587962857653716,"diet_4":-0.12476248603364581,"diet_5":-0.22295045170967306,"diet_6":-0.0684805263360128,"diet_8":-0.10480899332852346,"diet_9":-0.007567222407791026,"diet_10":-0.06885427192537463,"diet_11":-0.04115345318799276,"diet_13":-0.006843923489213921,"diet_14":-0.09358285826116723,"diet_17":-0.053830732174295313},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Dramatically reduced intake of endotoxins. Endotoxins are parts of dead bacteria. If they get into the bloodstream, it triggers an immune-reaction and thus binds capacities of your immune-system that it otherwise could use to fight an actual infection. Endotoxins are mostly found in meat.\n\n2. More protective gut-flora. The insides of your bowels are covered by a layer of mucus formed by gut-bacteria. What the composition of those is greatly depends on what you eat. The \"good ones\" thrive on fiber. If there's a lot of them, they protect against endotoxins as well as real threats.\n\nBeing vegan, while always reducing your endotoxin-intake, does not necessarily mean you'll have a lot of fiber in your diet. Processed food has very little of that.

I also think it's a good argument in favor of being pacifist towards wars of aggression, strongly pro-life, and against the death penalty in order to be consistent.  And it's true - the suffering argument is also there and good, because suffering does happen along with the unjustified killing, but on its own it can leave the opening for someone to claim they kill painlessly.\n\nI think the suffering argument works best to bolster the killing is wrong argument, because if either might have a weakness somewhere, they can carry each other.  As in, killing is wrong, and now that you understand that, suffering is another layer to why it's wrong to eat meat.  I think arguments regarding suffering on their own could lead others to conclude they just need to improve the conditions and then it's okay, so they buy grass-fed meat once in a while and think that fixes everything, because they don't believe killing itself is wrong.\n\nThanks for helping to strengthen the argument.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.002363524904164175,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2448478644899069,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1933219035466512,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04971678896496693,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2685735247381255,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3108974790664658,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2364476469423001,"diet_1":-0.0047051569175285595,"diet_2":-0.163121055976859,"diet_3":-0.0036642410026009506,"diet_4":-0.00039003259371384047,"diet_5":-0.00026708690226466086,"diet_6":-0.0006492914738676822,"diet_8":-0.0001859195266054788,"diet_9":-0.0005721494574875882,"diet_10":-0.0010821391673137744,"diet_11":-0.0007135409881205609,"diet_13":-0.003934136713117671,"diet_14":-0.0010180657603389893,"diet_17":-0.000657520824461244},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (no possessive reference to a specific group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

He felt great and kept talking about his energy levels. We were really proud of him for losing all of that weight and he bragged about how it was \"all bullet-proof coffee and beef\". He kept saying that \"it's the carbs that will kill you\". Then after a long weekend skiing he took a nap and died in his sleep on the couch of a massive heart attack at the age 62 nearly twenty years younger than both his parents were when they died. We had him tested for Covid thinking that might be the cause, but it turned out it was multiple blocked arteries and a massive heart attack.\n\nI lost a bunch of weight on meat-keto a few years back so I know that it works to lose belly fat and does help you get lean. But I had weird health issues that made me drop the meat and later on the milk products too. Part of the problem is that the way keto people talk, it's like they just look in the mirror and see the real weight loss, haven't had that before, and immediately dismiss stories that don't support the lifestyle they want. I see comments like \"they're lying\" and then attribute anything vegan as being connected to \"an agenda\". For some it is. For me and many others it just isn't.\n\nVic was a decent, genuine guy and we're happy he got to do something he loved for a few months before he passed. We all know someone that's keto. It's not going to lead to death in everyone or probably even most that use meat-based keto to lose some weight but filling your body full of large quantities of saturated fat so regularly causes health issues and sometimes death.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2387117287318751,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22172680507378573,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22450674649264538,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2050517072056683,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19756181328557432,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23839389525262655,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1664582602045256,"diet_1":-0.29360287127605833,"diet_2":-0.042197759636716604,"diet_3":-0.2463842409682305,"diet_4":-0.009958593514359867,"diet_5":-0.05957459260631973,"diet_6":-0.02939157283011203,"diet_8":-0.0018556348792723536,"diet_9":-0.007050019688904285,"diet_10":-0.030347787290035438,"diet_11":-0.01450424438129024,"diet_13":-0.020498055052788306,"diet_14":-0.17327120046441755,"diet_17":-0.02611907074848811},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The way they replied reminds me of the way meat eaters reply when you say \"I'm vegan because\n..\", the reaction is knee jerk. \n\nThis is my opinion and I give no shits about getting downvoted. I don't think there's a direct connection between nofap and veganism. However masturbation is just a shortcut for the brain to get that burst of dopamine. So, it's incredibly addictive and rewarding after putting in zero work to get that reward. So, nofap basically is a way to rewire the brain out of the addiction to pornography or whatever sexual material or stimulus one sees or visualizes. The energy sap from masturbation is high, that energy can be used for other purposes and you probably got a lot of respect for yourself and reduced that awful feeling that you said you felt, maybe that's physical as well as mental. With that comes clarity of thought. You see things the way they are perhaps. You channeled that into a vegan lifestyle. Did you become vegan after the nofap or wanted to always become vegan but didn't do it until now? Congratulations anyway! A Majority of us are addicted to masturbation and won't ever examine that.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.007759640614191691,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16767678586602414,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1342755589848718,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.140523717738688,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.174667597881781,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18494671671493879,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.41473928509124863,"diet_1":-0.003167562339513097,"diet_2":-0.0011606918548447236,"diet_3":-0.014293953268255185,"diet_4":-0.0005294000153905168,"diet_5":-0.0007634812063770369,"diet_6":-0.0010150173111469485,"diet_8":-0.0002164202839291344,"diet_9":-0.0006231591978576034,"diet_10":-0.0021424013563470603,"diet_11":-0.0006296423404516341,"diet_13":-0.0015267088407805811,"diet_14":-0.005128605490123543,"diet_17":-0.003433396103597867},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
