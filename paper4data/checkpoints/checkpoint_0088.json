That is actually worse, because if you are successful it will hurt the climate much much more than what you are saving with your little electric car. It is hypocrisy at its finest.\n\n&gt;I suppose in your mind, what should happen is that we, in the US (and presumably other developed nations, but mostly in the US, right?) should cripple our industry and economy to reduce our CO2 levels to almost nothing, and we should sit back and smile while China ramps theirs up to what our former level was. Because, that's only fair. Then, when South Africa and Brazil joins them in \"continuing to cause this climate problem\" it will be okay, because they have to bring their poor up to our standards. The standards that we are no longer allowed to enjoy, by the way. Where do I get that? From your own words! \"since your life style is continuously causing this climate problem to begin\"\n\nYou don't get it do you? The bar is set by the rich western countries and in particular the USA. China, India, Brazil etc will not stop until they reach US levels. And why should they? The only way to reduce global emissions in the long run is to lower the bar set by the US and other high emission countries by replacing CO2 energy with modern tech. A good way of doing that is to tax CO2 emissions and use that tax to subsidise and stimulate growth in renewable energy around the world. \n\nIt is that simple. But it is not compatible with the Laissez-faire ideology dominant in this sub. You know it, but your ideology is too strong so you handle the cognitive dissonance like true narcissist by claiming that the crappy research you do in your browser is better than that of NASA scientists.",

"comment": "If you fit comfortably in the Leaf, you should also test drive the Ford Focus EV if you can actually find one at a dealership. I think it's a fantastic car, which Ford is not at all interested in selling very many of. Both go about 80 miles on a charge and they're similar in performance and price (after all the incentives and rebates).\n\nIf you're leasing, you'll get a better lease price on a Leaf. If you're buying, be aware that the Leaf lacks a battery thermal management system, so you can expect to lose a significant fraction of the battery's capacity over the years. The Focus (like the Tesla, Volt, and most larger EVs) has a coolant system to keep the battery temperature within a certain range for longevity.\n\nThe Focus looks and drives more like a regular car, and in my opinion handles more \"sharply\" and has a well-designed interior. Integration of the range estimator with the nav system is very good so you have a good idea whether you'll need to stop and charge on the way.\n\nThe newer Leaf has a more efficient heat-pump heater, whereas using the resistance heater in the Focus too much cuts your range significantly. (The Focus' seat warmers use almost no power so they partly make up for this when it's not too cold.) The Leaf also has an option for L3 fast charging, though that may not matter to you with so few daily miles.",

I became interested in EVs in my last year in University and I also decided to wait for LiFePo4 prices to come down. When Tesla came along I was a supporter and wanted to invest whole-heartedly. Unfortunately i worked with experienced engineers who were naysayers and i valued their wisdom. In retrospect i wish i hadn't listened. Had i invested as i wanted to, today i could have bought a model S outright. In any case doing a conversion is still something that i want to do and I'm currently looking for a donor car. Best of luck to you if you ever end up doing it.",

The company didn't go under, they have developed the underlying technology which is the modular platform and it's just a matter of executing the design which, yes, it involves time. Time to get enough funding, which they did, and time to build the actual factory which they are in the process of doing. Were there times in the past to question how serious they were about competing with Tesla? Indeed and that was when it was unclear if they would have enough funds to build the production facility. We don't know what their strategy will be short to medium term, they might not need to innovate in any way, just provide a compelling alternative to Tesla. More range for the same price, better build quality for a little higher price, better charging standards, better cooling for sustained performance, objectively better design etc. Any option would be good.",

"comment": "Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is for public charging. It obviously takes investment to build out the infrastructure, but electricity is so cheap for me at home/overnight (0.055) and I always have the option of putting gas in my Volt (much faster too), meaning I've used a public charger once in 4.75 years. And from what I understand they aren't allowed to actually charge by the kWh, which makes putting a price on it very difficult. Tesla came up with a brilliant strategy.",

"comment": "Come on how can you belive in solar power? First of all, solar is far from a clean energy source, as it requires many precious minerals and rare earths to produce, most of which are in possession of China. For every ton of silicon produced for solar panels, six tons of industrial waste are produced. Next, solar energy's EROEI is not even high enough to compete with oil once you factor in all the real costs of producing solar power, let alone with the more dense oil that allowed the global economy to function. \n\nThe truth is that we need negative emissions to avoid more than 4°C degrees of warming at this point. Scientists will say that we are only at risk of 2°C but with all the positive feedback loops there is around 3,8°C degrees of warming by the end of the century almost guaranteed by this point, and more will get added up the longer we get without extracting carbon from the atmopshere, which I think is impossible to do at the scale needed. The only plant that did that has closed now and it extracted carbon to sell to other companies, so it got reused and put again in the atmosphere. How will humanity invest in something that generates no profits? At 3°C there is no conventional agriculture, at 4°C there is probably no humanity left.\n\nThe population crunch will come from food and water resources being depleted. Current agricultural practices are destroying the topsoil of the earth and by mid century we will need [50% more food thanks to population growth and living standards being increased, and we will be able to produce 30% less food thanks to soil erosion](http://www.popsci.com/topsoil-agriculture-food). That is without taking into account global warming, [which is predicted to reduce staple crops' output by around 30%.](http://www.dailyclimate.org/tdc-newsroom/2017/may/climate-change-could-cut-into-major-crop). Nestle hid a study some years back about how by mid century, two thirds of the population would lack access to water, while one third of those would severely lack access to water, but it hid it so it wouldn't scare people and damage their stocks, you can look it up.\n\nAbout UBI and technological unemployment. I think that UBI is just a pipe dream. Wealth inequality has kept rising, to the worst levels in the past 300 years, despite all that technology advances. What makes you think that the elites will gladly hand out money when they have more than they need now? With technology they will have all the power their want. They will be able to control food production, goods and services manufacture, etc. They will only need a few people to work in exchange for scraps and they will be able to maintain their hold on power thanks to how automation will make most people obsolete. Do you seriously think that they will produce goods and services and then give the money to people so they can consume them, at a time of great scarcity by mid century nonetheless, just out of the good of their hearts? I think that what will come is technofeudalism, where the selected few will work with the elites in exchange for their lives, while the poor masses will be culled by poverty and death. Hell, most people today wouldn't be able to afford a spike in food prices that droughts and floods would bring, and socializing wealth has been proven to increase the consumption of resources, so I don't think that those two go hand in hand together. \n\nThen you have the issues of road prolfieration contributing to the destruction of ecosystems, literally dividing the earth into hundreds of thousands of segments, reducing the ability for animals to travel, to feed, to reproduce, etc. [You have the sixth mass extinction becoming irreversible in less than ten years](https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2016/12/mass-extinction-and-mass-insanity/), you have governments not taking serious action to stop the ruthless extractivism that comes from consumerist culture, you have the far right making a return in Europe, you have Trump, etc. \n\nRegarding AI, I am not sure what to say. I mean the only viable solutions at this point are to end global trade, to end human reproduction until we go back to more sustainable numbers, and other draconian measures that I think would not be accepted by the people, no matter how grandiose the intelligence of a machine that says so would be. Will it force us to do so then? Will it see that we are a blight and erradicate us? Who is to say it will not be used as a weapon, or as a control device by the powerful? \n\nI think you have too much faith in humanity to be honest. I live in a third world shithole, and I cannot see any of the technological prowess most people here mention, I only see misery and disease and death and exponentially growing populations, ravaging deforestation, pollution, etc. I think the west only spews out this techno-fixes because it cannot deal with the cognitive dissonance of the unsustainibility of its lifestyle. When will they talk about reducing personal consumption? When will they talk about stopping to pollute the water with harmful chemicals, the oceans with so much plastic, etc? When will every country talk about population control? You have seen cowspiracy, haven't you? It says that even if we stoppe all other emissions, just eating meat would sends us beyond the 2°C threshold, and yet not serious systemic solution has been presented to this problem, other than individual action and protest. How does that fare out then? What is the solution for that? Lab grown meat? Relying on the free market to solve our problems, be it solar, be it meat, be it electric cars, is akin to relying on the god of the jews to kill your enemies by the power of your faith alone.",

You make dictates about technology as if 2018 is when history stops. All of what we are talking about is a continuum of technology evolving over time. The pace of this progress could speed up, or slow down, based on world events. We can discuss the past, we can discuss the present and future, and how all of these things might be different if more attention was paid in certain areas and not others.\n\nI appreciate that you like EV's, that's cool! Sorry if I come off too pointy, I'm a bit bitter about how history is turning out, since a lot of the progress towards a sustainable future is very long overdue. There are many reasons for it, and misdirection / disinformation is a big part of it. I've been paying attention to this space for a long time and everything I've seen about FCVs over the last few decades has the hallmark of shitty dying industries doing everything they can to stay relevant, while continuing to poison everyone for great profit.",

"comment": "More people need to be aware of this evil situation and what is going on in the vegan community.  The vegan scene has gotten more popular in recent years so it's to be expected, big companies &amp; corporations like the meat &amp; dairy industry are gonna put new campaigns, new propaganda, more brainwashing out.  They want to control the narrative.  And \"pay &amp; bribe\" doctors, nutrionists, cardiologists, etc to be pro meat &amp; dairy and say bad things about veganism.  These companies hate veganism and want more people to buy their meats &amp; dairy products.\n\nThe reason for all this is MONEY and making money.  The root of all evil, what the world truly revolves around.  These new wave of vegan companies popping up are a very big threat to the meat &amp; dairy industry.  The same similar situation is happening with the big oil industry &amp; Tesla (electric car &amp; solar energy company).  Elon Musk is aware and has said he's been under attacked and big oil corporations want him to fail and are trying to shut him down in so many ways, trying to make him look bad.    He's been in the news a lot more recently, both himself and his electric company.  This is the reality, sad world we live in.  Corporation &amp; industry sabotage &amp; damage is real and there is a lot of evil activity going on.  Many are still \"asleep\" and the people who are \"woke\" &amp; \"enlightened / aware\" need to continue to help others and discuss so they can come to important life realizations.\n\nSomeone should document in very fine detail, these new meat &amp; dairy propaganda.  Full detailed list, description, the many pictures, videos, youtube vids, advertisements, commercials.  And which doctors, nutritionists, cardiologists \"sold out\" to say certain things and push certain views on the public.  And deep research to see who &amp; what company funded it and the producer of the content.  With some simple research, it's easy to track where exactly it came from.",

They're officially installed by Tesla outdoors for their \"destination Charger\" program so outside is definitely no problem, and they're cheap ($500 direct from Tesla, $350 new in box from one of the ebay sellers that seem to be getting them from some Tesla warehouse somewhere).  The connector only works with Tesla by default, but a J1772 adapter like the the Jdapter (another $250) and you have an outdoor rated EVSE that charges at 19kw.\n\nThis is a cheap way to get a weather rated fast charger, but it will completely lack Wifi compatibility and timed / other advanced charge settings because it was designed assuming the car they're plugging in to already have that built in.\n\nNema 14-50 is the cheapest 50a solutiion that should work with most cars.",

"comment": "A lot of room for speculation without more details. You can find a fairly comprehensive list of BEV and PHEV models [here](https://insideevs.com/compare-plug-ins/).\n\nWill you be able to install 240V 40A circuit at home? Or, do you have L2 charging available at work? If not, BEV is kind of a non-starter, so focus on PHEV.\n\nIs 100 miles a daily, RT figure? And where are you located? Areas with extreme weather (cold or hot) will eat away at range, so bump up your target by at least 30-40% in terms of range, and for the sake of battery longevity, maybe add another 20% as you never want to run an EV down to 0%. Better to target your end of day state of charge in the 20-40% range.\n\nWill you require the car to do long trips? If so, be sure to get one with DC Fast Charging capability.\n\nWhat is your budget, and can you take advantage of tax incentives? You may be able to get a higher cost car if you are willing to wait for the tax incentives. Some lease companies may roll these into your lease if they understand the mechanics of it. Dealer leases might be a better chance of rolling the rebates into the lease term vs third party.\n\nChevy Bolt leases are common. Not sure about other brands, but certainly Tesla is keen on leasing. Added benefit of Tesla is their Supercharger network allows for easier trip planning at this point than just about any other EV.  \n\nHyundai and Ki are offering CUV models, but availability outside of a few markets (CA) is limited or n/a.",

"comment": "Not an income test, but there are a limited number they will do per year in each province. The numbers are off as well. They suggest there are three subsidies {state, central and provincial} when there are just two. Federal and local. For most areas they combine for about 14k, the best areas are about 17k.\n\nThe base price is similar to the Kona Ev I purchased this year. Subsidies were about 15k. Total cost was just over 30k. I went with the premium model so base model 3 might be slightly cheaper. \n\nThat's assuming you can get the subsidy, since from my understanding, they don't offer it for the tesla cars, only the bolt and hyundai/kia cars because they are manufactured here. Maybe they changed that since I was looking last year. \n\nAdditionally the charging infrastructure is much worse for tesla. Almost every rest stop on major highways (every 40km or so) have one or two fast chargers and most major grocery chains have a charger as well as a lot of community centers. Also some of the major convention centers/malls/IKEA have multiple chargers with free charging. They are all dc combo chargers. \n\nI have only encountered two locations with superchargers so far.",

"comment": "&gt; No idea how you could possibly get access to chargers while towing\n\nThat’s a great point that I haven’t seen mentioned before.  I keep thinking that Tesla has a big advantage over Ford and Rivian, because they don’t have supercharger networks.  So they’ll have to do hybrids or range extenders to allow road trips.  Non-Tesla public chargers are slow enough for small cars, much less a big pickup battery.\n\nBut you’re right, if they want to claim that advantage, then they better start modifying their supercharger locations to accommodate a Cybertruck pulling a big 28ft RV cross country.  Which won’t be easy or cheap.  Maybe they can leverage megacharger locations, if they ever build them for the semi?  The 500 mile range version will have a big battery, and could use the extra charging speed.",

"comment": "I guess I'm part of the \"virtually no-one\" group because if I were spending that kind of  money on a sedan, I would *strongly* prefer the Tesla interior design and technology.\n\nIn all walks of life, I prefer minimalism, clean design, straight lines. The Mercedes interior is nearly the antithesis of my design preference, full of asymmetric or awkward shapes, too many colors, and an overall bias toward curves. I wouldn't be able to put aside the obvious edges of the three screens and their large bezels behind the pane of glass.\n\nI feel the Mercedes interior will not age well. It already feels like the design motif of the 1980s brought forward to today.\n\nIt seems ironic that the Tesla design motif feels more aligned with European design (architecture and graphic design) and the Mercedes feels more aligned with an apartment owned by a former US President.\n\nMost importantly, as someone who treasures software performance and feels humans should never have to wait for computers, I would not be able to tolerate the sluggishness of the Mercedes software. It would drive me crazy and make me regret spending all that money every time I used the car.",

So this is a meaningless answer.\n\nWhat exactly do you gain from adding a compressed air system to a BEV? How would it even work? Would the compressed air drive pistons? So an additional clutch is necessary to connect the motor to the pistons?",

So there are really only 2 standards: J1772/CCS and Tesla.\n\nWithin each standard, there are several different charging speeds. J1772 is actually only Level-1 (120V outlet) and Level-2 (overnight charging). CCS is an extended version that supports Level-3. It is backward compatible with J1772  - i.e. if the car has a CCS port, it can charge from a J1772 Level-1 or 2 charger, or a CCS level-3 charger.\n\nSimilarly, Tesla has level-2 (\"destination charger\") and level-3 (\"supercharger\") chargers.",

"comment": "I think a big problem is that people don’t understand the fundamental difference in how you refuel an electric car vs a gas car. You don’t need to stand there and wait for it. It’s more like a cell phone than a car in their respect. Sometimes it’s an inconvenience to recharge, but you usually just plug it in overnight and it doesn’t matter how long it takes because it’ll be done by morning. Everyone here obviously knows that, but gas car drivers just don’t get it yet and make the bad assumption that it needs to work in the same way that they refuel their gas cars.",

"comment": "&gt;  Subsidies most notably take the form of net metering and feed in tariffs, that are, in effect, a transfer of wealth from non-solar owners to solar owners.\n\nSubsidies are *in effect* a way of lowering the costs of future installations. Once you consider how the higher costs of the first installed 100 GWp lowered the cost of the next 1 TWp, the whole notion of subsidies being only of benefit to early adopters falls apart. In the long run, they may very well turn out to have been a great investment for the future of this planet, although the financial and temporal scales involved may make it somewhat more difficult to grasp.",

"comment": "Here is one idea:  Buy a solar powered mini split like [this](http://www.hotspotenergy.com/solar-air-conditioner/).  Any time the sun shines use the mini split to heat some phase change material, such as coconut oil or the appropriate number of carbon atoms containing paraffin.  Those mini splits use about 900 watts of solar power or about 1 HP worth. They also need to be hooked up to 240 volts.  Undoubtedly, the companies have taken a conventional mini split and rewired it so what ever requires the 900 watts, maybe the outside fan, is run off the solar.  If the outside solar can't produce enough electricity, the fan is run off the 240vac inverted.  It's works like a reversing starter. Solar or 240vac supplies the power, but not both at the same time.  They claim since you aren't converting the solar into AC to use or feed back into the grid, by keeping it DC you gain efficiency.  They don't mention what happens when the sun is shinning and the mini split isn't running. All that solar energy is wasted. They also charge $1000 or so more for their special solar powered mini split.  If you are willing to pay the extra for a solar powered heat pump, you can use it to heat/melt the phase change material when ever the sun shines.  At least then the sun won't be wasted.  To save money you could buy a conventional mini split and convert it into a solar powered mini split.",

"comment": "Not going to lie, this is the exact reason why there isn't a ton of solar in residential... it's super confusing and because of all the different brands, it's difficult to find the \"right\" solution for what you're trying to do.  At least, I don't see much of it in the Midwest.  Also, with the Solarcity announcement, they didn't actually talk about costs other than to say \"will cost less than a new roof when including the power offset\"...\n\nIs there a 101 type of primer that I can read that talks about residential solar solutions?  Truly, I'm not looking to invest a fortune into it, which might mean that I can't have it.... but I'd love to not only say that my $2/day to charge my Model 3 Tesla costs me less than that, but that I can reduce my drain on the grid by generating some of the electricity that I use on a daily basis.  \n\nIs there an option to start small?  Can I invest a little, just to see how well it does before expanding to something bigger, like adding a powerwall and additional roof coverage?  Obviously, if I'm tying it into the grid, I'm going to have costs from a licensed electrician... I actually know one, so that could help me with some of those costs.  I think it would be cool to just buy a single panel to try on my garage roof for now.  Who knows, maybe that would generate enough to offset the Tesla charging?",

We'll see.\n\nReplacing massive spinning hunks of metal with huge amounts of inertia with algorithms is, in theory, possible - but you stand a good chance of running into emergent behavior if you have a bunch of independent systems all trying to stabilize things.  \"Emergent behavior\" on a power grid looks like oscillations of frequency or voltage that may become divergent - and, well, that's a few seconds away from a blackout at that point as frequency/voltage cutoffs trip.\n\nInertia has the nice characteristic of being not-too-smart.  It's really rock dumb, and that makes it easy to understand, and things also react fairly slowly when you're relying on it, and that makes it easy to have slower reacting systems (governors and such) catch up.\n\nHow you regulate a whole slew of distributed energy resources such that you can end up with a stable grid is still very much an open question - look into \"virtual power plants\" if you want to do some reading on the concept.  It's also very much not an answered question.",

When customers want top shelf, it's generally a luxury market.\n\nSolar panels are very reliable, regardless of brand. Not that there aren't differences, but compared to price and brand, differentiating modules based on reliability is splitting hairs.\n\nNobody uses 100W modules for homes. That's more a camping /RV crowd where you need a smaller form factor module.",

"comment": "Over the last few years my experience as an observer has been that the CA market fluctuates a lot. It can be brutally competitive at times and a seller's market at other times. Because there is some uncertainty and worry associated with NEM 2.0 and beyond, it looks more like a seller's market right now.\n\nHowever, there are probably still some hungry installers out there. And if you are still interested in finding a way to make a SunPower system more reasonable, here is a path I have seen others follow in SoCal that worked because it is such a cluttered market by comparison.\n\n* Go to [SunPower site](https://us.sunpower.com/dealers-installers/find-dealer-installer/) and find their dealers using your zip code. (You don't necessarily have to start with their Master Dealers, which are the most legally bound to SunPower)\n\n* Randomly pick a few or more to research. Use Yelp, [SolarReviews](http://www.solarreviews.com/), and any other sites you feel comfortable with (BBB, Angie's, etc.) to see more about their reputation and especially how new they are. If they don't appear to have more than a year or two of reviews, there is a chance they are still in a building mode - both reputation and business. You can feel them out more as you talk to them.\n\n* Get competitive quotes. I would even be upfront that you are having a hard time justifying the premium cost even though you have a desire to buy what is pitched as a premium product. Let them sell you.\n\nIf you end up simply wanting to minimize cost (any other Tier 1 panels will suffice), you could still use those same review sites to find some to reach out to that you suspect are still in a building mode, and are on the path to earning a good reputation. From what I hear - and it is just hearsay - some of the more established installers in CA aren't trying to win every bid right now but they do like sending out bids. I'm condensing my words into a sentence, but you probably get the idea.",

Talk about how when the August rolls in you will never have an outage to worry about because you will have this supply available. \n\nTo continue on that trend. a lot of these 60+ year olds care about their grandchildren. Talk about how these solar panels will provide energy for years to come -- and possibly better/safer for kids when comparing with the alternative (not sure what else they are thinking of using this space for)\n\nUltimately, it might be good to speak to some of these people who are worried - and understand their core concerns. Then, create a good narrative to counter their worries and paint a picture that directly helps them - rather than creates a nuisance for them.",

Local installers definitely do great work, but there are Sungevity customers out there who haven’t been able to have their systems serviced for months/years because they have to wait for the bankruptcy proceedings to finish. So, going win a larger company would minimize that risk.\n\nGiven that you have significant on &amp; off peak charges, if you get a battery, make sure it can do TOU load-shifting. I know Tesla’s Powerwall can and the LG Chem one might be able to as well, so I would ask.\n\nIf you have specific questions on specific proposals, feel free to PM me.",

"comment": "Yes of course a larger battery will be more expensive than a larger one. But the prices will come down, and potentially dramatically when solid-state batteries reach market in 7 years or so. The median range of vehicles in the US today is around 420 miles - American consumers will want and expect long-range BEVs - whether they need it or not. Bot longer range also increases opportunities for consumers to use their BEVs as mobile energy storage vehicles. Extra range makes this a more viable option. When we rethink cars as not just transportation but as mobile energy storage and we as consumers can rent our battery storage to utilities to store excess clean energy during the day and release it  back to the grid during peak demand, battery range takes on new meaning.",

"comment": "Holy Moses that's a lot of power.\n\nHi, I'm a solar Specialist for a company in FL that has been seeking to expand to California.  PG&amp;E has high prices out there making it easy for solar to compete.  Solar companies will charge relative to the area they are installing in though, keep in mind. So with the high cost of electricity, you can expect to pay more for your system.  In FL it's pretty common to see prices range from $2.50 to $3.50 a watt, depending on the quality of the system and dependability of the company.  The cheapest companies will likely go out of business soon and not be around to honor their workmanship warranties, so keep that in mind.\n\nSo, is it worth it?  Well that depends.  Net metering is the backbone of what makes it worth it.  Being able to send kWh to the grid and receive the same amount back at no cost is humongous because it makes batteries unnecessary.  However, the laws are changing in California due to complaints from the electric companies, so if you didn't get grandfathered in to net metering, this will make a giant difference.  Batteries can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a system of this size.  Check to see if you still have net metering available.  If so, get some quotes, talk them down on price, and you should see some significant savings.  Do not get batteries unless absolutely necessary.  Repeat battery replacements over the lifetime of the system will be costly.  Do the math.  It doesn't work with batteries.  Though this technology has had a giant surge in research and development, so it is likely to come down in price soon(ish).\n\nKeep in mind that the internet can be both a wonderful and terrible place to get information.  Solar specialists may also not be completely honest with you because they are trying to make the sale.  Though they can address a lot of concerns you may have too.  Personally, I am always honest with people.\n\nAt the end of the day, the window of opportunity is closing.  Solar grid capacity is filling up.  Install costs have leveled out the last 5 or 6 years and are not dropping significantly. The tax incentives are being phased out.  Net metering is being discontinued for new solar installs.  Knowing what I know, I would go solar in a heartbeat while I still had the chance.",

"comment": "I'm not sure about \"more easily move\" - an increase in electrification of vehicles could lead to some very big demand management challenges.\n\nRight now, peak loads are during the day, and solar is almost perfectly matched to offsetting that.\n\nThat's why power companies currently love EVs - they allow their demand to get spread out into offpeak hours a bit.\n\nBut what happens when nearly everyone has EVs that are charging at night when the solar panels aren't generating?\n\nI already recall seeing an analysis for NYS that past a certain point (I forget the threshold), increased solar deployment would start causing load management problems, basically by more than offsetting daytime peak, they'd force baseload generation systems to throttle down, and then require peaking plants at night.\n\nI'm not saying these challenges aren't solvable, but it's not as simple as you seem to think it is.\n\nAnd if your answer is workplace charging - it's a lot easier to upgrade someone's home wiring a small amount to install a home charger than to put EV charging into every single spot in a large parking lot.  Now you've got a huge amount of load concentrated in a single location.",

There are exceptions like if there is a valley with only panels in 1 side you don't need to have the 3 feet in that corner since you can walk on the other side of the valley. \n\nNow, on top of this , each municipality can increase the setbacks (or reduce them) or not apply it all together. If you wanna get into the details, go to your building department website and search\"solar pv system requirements\" and see what you can find. \n5 feet don't seems to me like a fire requirements.

You will need a generator connected to the system so you dont have to size it such that you have all solar in the winter. The load calcs will drive your system size in terms of solar, inverter and batteries. Once you know this, you can factor in location, shading and orientation of the solar array to determine how many panels you need in excess to account for the less than favorable aspects of the install. Its possible, but really depends on what you want to power offgrid. You may want to call a solar pro that specializes in  off-grid to look at the site. Most solar companies do not do off-grid, so dont just pick names out of a phone book. Off-grid is not the same as \"I install powerwalls\" so make sure you find an installer who has the right experience.",

First the battery storage cells cost almost double what the vehicle cost new, and second no landfill or disposals will allow the batteries to be disposed of there.

"comment": "I can back this up. Even coming from a jurisdiction that is almost completely hydroelectric, rapid ramping presents one of the biggest challenges for grid operators.\n\nI'm a bit more optimistic than you are regarding the potential of battery storage though. Realistically, if we can shift the production from the mid-day demand glut a few hours forward, it can do a lot to ease the pressure on those big ramping events. Still expensive though.\n\nIf the prices are fluctuating that wildly between the mid-day and the dinnertime peak, then there is a huge opportunity for energy arbitrage (buying cheap in the day and selling expensive into the evening peak). BC does this very effectively (because of the flexibility of hydro), by buying overnight power for next to nothing and then selling it right back during the daytime peaks.",

UPS, Generac nat gas, a gasoline generator, a battery charger and outlet inverter...etc.  Or use a solar panel to charge a set of batteries solely used for outages. But my argument against that is, if you're grid-tied the solar is already going to the outlet, so just charge the batteries via the outlet.",

This also does not consider that the electricity price might also go up. \n\nThink of it like this: Investing $30k with a guaranteed 5% - 10% return each year is just sensible.

Sure AC batteries can be coupled, but their peak output and continuous output in one powerwall is well higher than others on the market and has been a good amount cheaper. It has its own disadvantages, no doubt. One cycle off in data down situations, availability, etc.",

The one's I lived in did not, everyone had to use a generator to keep their fridges running else they wouldn't be able to store any food. \n\nSpeaking of food, the rural places I lived didn't have more than one or two stores. I know some people from neighboring towns with none. We had to commute to the nearest 'city' to stock up. \n\nTotally agree that having more choices is better, and I'm excited for when an electric bike will make sense for my lifestyle, however it isn't for everyone yet and city culture is significantly different from rural culture, with different challenges and considerations. I hope someday it will filter down to rural living, but it'll require EV manufacturers to really try to reach them. It won't happen naturally. \n\nMaybe someday if independent repair is allowed to touch evs, and a over abundance of batteries and solar panels.",

California could clear up the requirements, simplify the application process and make it something the solar company does, and pay out at time of install as a direct discount to the customer. \n\nOr we could make it so that utility companies pay a monthly credit to access battery storage for 10 years to provide an ongoing benefit that helps pay for the system over time in exchange for an on demand power resource. It would be paid out to people in wildfire, Public Safety Power Shutoff areas, to help stabilize the grid and in return the customers are auto enrolled in the local Virtual Power Plant Program.",

"comment": "Solar installers almost always use off-the-shelf components in situations they're designed for. These components have well-known engineering characteristics, have warranties, are approved by local building codes, etc.\n\nPutting custom brackets on your roof in a way that's safe requires hiring engineers to examine the roof and the roof support system and to design the brackets to handle the typical wind/snow/whatever loads. There's a lot that can go wrong if they screw up... like the panels themselves lifting the roof off of your house during strong winds.\n\nA DIY'er can do whatever they want, but when a company is accepting money to do a job there are rules they need to follow, there are building codes and insurance requirements, the solar panel manufacturer might mandate certain bracket designs be used to honor the warranty, etc.",

"comment": "Oh wow, ok let’s start with the basis is how the IPCC justifies that they have changed the basic properties of Carbon Dioxide to sell a narrative, CO2 is a cooling molecule that escorts solar radiation out of the atmosphere to now implying it is the warming molecule. How about explaining why CO2 levels have not risen since 2011 but blamed solely for global warming, (which global warming and climate change are not interchangeable terms they are 2 different things, global warming is a very very small criteria when it comes to climate change, this is the suns planet solar activity rules climate on it.) So the day the IPCC can actually show evidence of this instead of having a declared consensus that this isn’t the case (as they have never done this or been able to prove this) I would consider their argument. But A good start would be to not fill the IPCC with climatologist who also sit on the board of major clean energy for profit corporations and not fill the other half of its members with politicians who receive PAC donations from those same corporations. (Really the IPCC is the new big tobacco saying smoking is not only not bad for you but good for you and politicians in exchange for PAC donations pushing that same narrative)  I would like evidence of how they justify ignoring Nitrous Oxide levels. Nitrous oxide is formed when Nitric Oxide (produced mainly by nitrogen run off from agriculture into water) and this forms NO (nitric oxide) gas then escapes into the atmosphere where it is unstable so goes seeking an oxygen molecule which it finds by taking it from the ozone layer, and this forms Nitrious oxide (N2O). This, N2O is a warming gas and has been increasing by 4xs its normal rate and as far as global warming goes it’s effects are about 300xs more impactful on global warming. And if we were serious about slowing global warming we would go after nitrogen use not fossil fuels as N2O only remains in the atmosphere for 10 years so lowering its numbers would result in quickly cooling the atmosphere and stop eating away at the ozone that keeps uh rays out vs CO2 which remains for 100 years but protects the ozone by cooling and escorting out solar radiation particles that enter the stratosphere before they can eat away at the ozone there. We could have open full disclosure reporting so yea the ice on the West side of Antarctica is melting at  65 million tons a year, but they fail to disclose that the ice is building on the east side at a rate of 200 tons per year and this is normal for this planet one reason we know is every 20,000 the Sahara dessert becomes very lush green fertile land. This occurs when Antarctica spreads out and has more ice is to the East, as a result this also weakens the Sahara winds, when the ice melts in the East and forms in the west the winds pick back up and the Sahara becomes desert again. How about we discuss the only evidence that the IPCC has of global warming which is a fact thar more solar particles are entering the lower atmosphere than leaving it, true but that isn’t necessarily because of high CO2, as this actually indicates low CO2 (like we actually have). Also they note the cooling of NO in the stratosphere which yes can be high CO2 causing as CO2 is the cooling molecule but increased solar radiation cools NO in the stratosphere more efficiently and we know the more active the sun the cooler the stratosphere, and the sun in June set its own record for sun spot activity more sun spots=more solar radiation released and entering our atmosphere and is on pace to break another record for activity in July) So in short are humans contributing to global warming yes, but not because of fossil fuels but more likely because of increases in nitrogen in farming and gardening etc, another surprising thing that causes nitric oxide (ozone eating gas)? Solar panels, when direct if sunlight hits a solar cell, the by product from the chemical reaction is nitric oxide which again is very eager to go find an oxygen molecule to attach to and does so by taking one from the ozone, which allows more heating UV rays to enter the atmosphere where increased nitrous oxide (the never mentioned greenhouse gas) helps trap the heat unlike CO2 which helps escort it back out. Now does this mean humans are causing climate change, no the actual science on this has never changed the primary driver of climate on this planet is the sun. And until the IPCC decides to end its forced consensus that solar activity does not impact climate on the planet and steps threatening to strip funding for any science institution or department that receives government funds from any UN country that attempts to study climate without this consensus ends and allows the scientific method to implemented (you can’t base science on a consensus that isn’t science that is politics) then all your asking is for me to believe smoking is good for you, burning fossil fuels doesn’t cause pollution, and OxyContin is not addictive is as valid as the claim humans cause climate change.",

"comment": "\"it would actually be more efficient to convert that gasoline to electricity and then use that electricity to drive the vehicle than it would be to combust the gasoline in an engine to move\"\n\nIn your example, thermal energy is converted into mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy which is then converting it back into mechanical energy, vs the gas engine powering the vehicle whereby thermal energy is converted directly into mechanical energy. You're arguing that with those added unnecessary conversions, it would still be more efficient? Do you have a study showing this? I think you may be mistaken. It seems like you jumped the gun and just calculated the electric motor efficiency, and forgot all the other steps involved in taking the energy from its gas form to its electric form. This \"forgetting\" of steps where energy is lost, is actually not only typical, but intentional, at the highest levels: [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/11/2023-06869/petroleum-equivalent-fuel-economy-calculation](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/11/2023-06869/petroleum-equivalent-fuel-economy-calculation) the federal government themselves admitted here, that they have intentionally miscalculated the efficiency of electric vehicles and electrical energy, in order to push EV adoption. That is from the federal government themselves, and the only reason they're admitting it there, is to push even more adoption, after the Sierra Club pointed out some serious issues with the weighting and construction of their algorithms, which the government admits there was intentionally inaccurate. And in all these scenarios (both before proposed changes and after), some pretty outlandish assumptions are made: the production and destruction of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, the creation and maintenance of additional batteries for the network itself and transmission lines and chargers, the transmission and charging itself, the intra-electrical conversions, etc etc are all \"free\" and perfectly 100% efficient. No, there's a lot of simplistic and reductionist almost religious-like belief that goes into a lot of the current average \"understanding\" and perspective around EVs.  I'm not doubting that it's more efficient, that for the same weight and drag coefficient vehicles, one being EV and the other being gas, that the EV will have a net lower lifetime ecological footprint, but you're kidding yourself in an almost religious fervor if you think there's no footprint for the EV or if you believe that an EV of ANY weight and drag coefficient is more efficient than any ICE-powered vehicle, and I'm not sure it actually has a lower net lifetime footprint than a hybrid of the same weight and drag coefficient. I know there are \"studies\" that say the EV has a lower net lifetime than a hybrid, but when those very studies are relying on intentionally inaccurate data from the government, like this, it invalidates the outcomes of those studies.",

Installation costs are high, but you’ll save on electricity bills.\n\nI’ve found that after about 20 years, most panels still work but with reduced efficiency.

For socks, you can always double up, but I actually hardly ever did that, and found that if my shoes didn't have holes in them, then my feet would stay warm even with cotton or synthetic socks.",

"comment": "Just wanted to update. I'm taking a nutrition course, and I just got to an Iron section. It says the component of tannins that inhibits iron absorption is **polyphenols**. It also said they're present in red wine.\n\nIn addition to the polyphenols in coffee, tea and red wine, it also says that both calcium and soybean protein inhibit iron absorption (so no calcium fortified soy milk with your iron!) \n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't say exactly how these things inhibit iron absorption (competative, allosteric, or something else) so I am not sure how long you should wait between taking one of them, and taking iron. \n\nIt does mention both Vitamin C and cast iron skillets (as others here have done) as good ways to increase iron. So maybe just try avoiding the mentioned inhibitors around meals, and drink OJ while eating, instead (or add tomatoes/bell peppers/broccoli/strawberries, etc to your meals), and consider cooking with cast iron.\n\nOne final thing: It mentions that since non-heme iron is less readily absorbed, that vegans should shoot for 1.8 times the RDA. It actually says that the bioavailability (how much our body is capable of absorbing out of a food source) of iron in the vegan diet is ~ 10% (the ave non-veg diet is ~18%). So for men, the average RDA for iron is 8mg. This means that *vegan* men should be shooting for 14.4 mg. For women, the RDA is 18 mg, so this means vegan women should actually be ingesting 32.4 mg / day!",

Not sure where you live, but in the US it's very cheap to buy simple foods that you can combine together with a little knowledge and creativity. Some simple things are grains like rice and oats, legumes for proteins like beans and lentils, any kind of fresh vegetables you like, and whichever spices and seasonings you prefer. The trick is not to have too many meat replacement things. To be honest they confuse me, because it seems like the purpose is to simulate meat or other non vegan foods, but none of them are like the real thing so they just end up reminding me of the fact that it's not the same, instead of allowing me to pretend it is. Though I will say that one exception is vegan hot dogs/sausages. Tofurky and Field Roast brands are better than any real meat ones I've ever had.\n\nAnyway, being vegan is easy, buy simple cheap foods, learn a little about cooking, and don't eat too many of the expensive meat replacement foods.",

"comment": "Well in philosophy it is already well established that killing animals is morally wrong. There's no real argument that defends speciesism (the idea that one species is superior than the other therefore you can do whatever you want to them). The modern example which shows the flaws of speciesism quite well is that if a superior alien race came to earth and  started treating humans like humans treat animals today. A flawed but logical consistent argument would be that you accept species domination but you are only fine with it because this is a thought experiment not real life. More than likely in this situation you would not like the superior alien species to do whatever they want with you, because you are a living life form just like they are, but you might not be as superior in terms of intellect or technology, it doesnt mean it's morally okay for a superior species to do whatever they want with you. The key to take away here is not to become vegan (althought it is the moral thing to do), it's just to know that you're not a 100% moral being (which is fine). This is what Plato was trying to teach when he created modern philosophy. It's to be cognizant of your moral flaws, challenge the beliefs you hold, and to seek to improve yourself.   \n\nEdit: spelling",

Salads when I feel like spending the money on all the stuff I like in mine lol (olives, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, avocado, the greens themselves, etc., I load ‘em up). I don’t think any of these take more than 10 minutes to make generally speaking, aside from the time to prep the week’s rice in advance. \n\nSometimes I’ll prep a big batch of chili for the week too, it takes a bit to make but then I don’t have to worry about it for a while!\n\nAs for snacks, of course a lot of fresh fruit, and fresh veggies and/or naan with hummus (I like to alternate flavors!). I also like to make a batch of “energy bites” for the week, just oats, maple syrup, ground flaxseed, chocolate chips, and peanut butter. Mix together in a bowl, form little balls about an inch wide, let set in fridge and voila :)\n\nAnd of course, I’m no stranger to frozen meals either! The Morningstar buffalo nuggets with vegan ranch is one of my favorite “junky” dinners.",

I eat vegan food most of the time. I have an occasional pizza and I eat backyard eggs from chickens I’ve had for 10 years. But yeah I don’t care about animals. This is literally why nobody likes talking to vegans. They always tell you that you aren’t doing enough. As a vegetarian, I’m always happy to hear that people are limiting/avoiding animal products. You guys are pissed off that everyone isn’t vegan. Instead of celebrating small victories, you push people away. Talking to you kinda vegans makes me feel like I’m not doing anything at all and that’s not true. No wonder people bully vegans.",

"comment": "Take a look at the menu at Golden Era in San Francisco for one example of vegan done well. They are creative and playful and have such an impressive variety of apps, soups, mains, and desserts.\n\nhttps://www.goldeneravegan.com/s/order#2\n\nWe never feel like we're getting a less-than version of a meat dish. Everything is thoughtful and stands on its own, as opposed to going to a restaurant where we have to substitute or remove a bunch of ingredients in order to \"veganize\" a dish then are left with something boring or flavorless.\n\nSuch as the Italian restaurant we went to last week where the only options for my daughter (she's the vegan but I enjoy exploring vegan food with her!) were dried eggless pasta (all the other pastas were housemade) with marinara, or a basic salad where the house vinaigrette had raw egg and it wasn't even the Caesar. Why???\n\nShe went with oil and vinegar, which she can do at home so it didn't feel like a special meal at all. The restaurant treated vegans like an afterthought. We wanted to leave but we were with a group. 🙁\n\nLong story short, making vegans feel seen and included and deserving of a hearty, delicious meal without having to jump through hoops will go a long way as you develop your menu. Best of luck and thank you for being open and for asking!",

After taking Cannabis at 25 and realising it wasn't the demon grass everyone told me it was, I decided to questions the status quo. My sister was vegan for 3 years at that point and I always gave her a tough time, she told me to watch What The Health and I resisted for months, finally one night I watched it and 15 minutes into it I was vegan for life. I was immediatly on the other side, I knew what my parents thought of my sister since we talked about it so much, so now I was the crazy person sacrificing my health for the animals and she wouldn't have any discussion about it with me. Of course, this is wrong like I learned, but dealing with family is by far the hardest aspect of living a crueltty-free lifestyle.\n\nPigs are like really smart dogs, they are super clean and will poop and pee in a designated corner. They love belly rubs and talk to each other with little grunts. They are social animals and love to play. Sadly, they are killed at 6 months when they are still so young.\n\nCheers!",

In fact, the suffering these animals endure during death is often much less severe than the suffering they endure during life.\n\n&gt; One way or another you have to eat a byproduct of something that is or was once alive, even if you are vegan or vegetarian, lettuce and carrots are livings things, why is it then not wrong to use those items as food? \n\nPlants do not feel pain, or at most very little pain, when they are raised and killed. I choose to inflict as little pain and suffering as possible, so I choose to eat plants.",

I remember my girlfriend kinda scoffing at the food I ate before we started dating until she tried some (granted I was vegetarian at the time). She's tried some of the fake chicken I had and really enjoying it. Trying some salads I've made, stir fries, lentil tacos, things of the sort. She isn't vegetarian, but will go out and buy black bean burgers and such because she genuinely likes them now. Unfortunately we're long distance at the moment (she's in Ohio and I'm in NJ) so I can't really share with her the food I make now but when I go back to Ohio I'll be making her the best damn vegan chick pea salad she's ever had. At this point she's said she could probably be vegetarian easily which is a huge step up from not even being interested. She's actually grossed out now by eating things that are still on the bone (she won't eat ribs, and is starting to be grossed out by eating chicken since she and her family have pet chickens). Just remember that we were all pretty much in your girlfriends shoes at one point (with exceptions to life long vegans and vegetarians). We were all skeptical of being vegetarian or vegan. Don't push it too much. Let it kind of happen naturally.",
