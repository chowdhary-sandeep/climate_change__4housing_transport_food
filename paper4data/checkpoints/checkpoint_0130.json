"comment": "&gt; I'm not sure you can justify that statement. Most states and the federal government subsidize solar and wind in numerous ways.\n \nWell to be fair, just because \"most states\" are eligible for federal subsidies doesn't necessarily mean that they will actually use them.  Let's be perfectly honest, states like [Texas and Missouri aren't exactly scrambling to add solar power.](http://cleantechnica.com/2013/06/25/solar-power-by-state-solar-rankings-by-state/)\n\nAlong those lines, the [U.S. installed 4.75 gigawatts of solar](http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data) in 2013, while [China added significantly more](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-23/china-installed-a-record-12-gigawatts-of-solar-in-2013.html):\n\n&gt; Developers in China installed a record 12 gigawatts of solar panels in 2013, almost matching the total amount of solar power in operation in the U.S., and may exceed that in 2014, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\n&gt; China was the biggest solar market last year, surpassing longtime leader Germany. Chinese installation more than tripled from 3.6 gigawatts in 2012, and the nation expects to add 14 gigawatts of solar capacity this year, according to New Energy Finance.\n\n&gt; China led a 28 percent increase in global solar installations last year of 39 gigawatts, and total installation may increase another 20 percent this year, according to the statement. Before 2013, no nation had ever installed more than 8 gigawatts of solar power in a yea\n\nSo while China's government is wonky in many ways, one of the good things about it is that once it makes up its mind, it can go full steam ahead with minimal red tape.  So actually yeah, China really is by far surpassing the U.S. in renewable/clean energy investment.\n\n&gt; Those programs are in place. How do these so-called \"deniers\" stop them?\n\nBy claiming climate change isn't real, or it's not man-made or that the science doesn't bear it out.  By drumming up public support against the notion of climate change, it creates furor when the government does try to invest in clean energy.\n\n[Stories like this](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/12/28/Tesla-CEO-Buys-17-Million-Mansion-Got-465-Million-Govt-Loan) get pushed all the time by conservative media outlets, yet Tesla paid their loan [more than nine years ahead of schedule](http://business.time.com/2013/05/23/loser-no-more-tesla-repays-465-million-u-s-loan/).  \n\nAnd yes, it's true that there are unfortunate failures like Solyndra.  A badly run business is a badly run business.  However, the focus on Solyndra underscores the fact that there were [numerous winners, and not just Tesla](http://time.com/2955312/obama-solyndraphobia-clean-energy/):\n\n&gt; Overall, though, the loan program has been remarkably successful. It has poured $32.4 billion into dozens of projects that will help reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, including one of the world’s largest wind farms, a half dozen of the largest solar farms, the nation’s first commercial-scale cellulosic biofuel refineries, the nation’s first new nuclear power plants in three decades, and a factory where Tesla Motors builds electric vehicles that are shaking up the auto industry. It has also financed a few clunkers, including Solyndra and its fellow manufacturer Abound Solar, both victims of an unexpected plunge in solar-panel prices, as well as Fisker Motors, which made beautiful electric vehicles that didn’t sell.\n\nHere's the [Breitbart take on the continued investments in clean energy](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/04/17/DOE-Solyndra-Sequel-We-re-Back-in-Business-With-4-Billion-Energy-Loans).  Or the language used [when describing Tesla now](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/02/14/Fifth-Tesla-Car-Fire-In-Five-Months) (since they can no longer consider the company a failure):\n\n&gt; Tesla owner Elon Musk, who donates heavily to both Democrats and Republicans, contributed over $100,000 to President Barack Obama's campaign. Musk and Tesla bagged a $465 million taxpayer-funded loan as part of Obama's \"green stimulus\" slush fund which distributed 80% of its $20.5 billion to companies owned by or connected to Obama's campaign donors.\n\nSo yeah, it's this type of sentiment that prevents or obstructs further investment in renewable energy.  Like I've said [elsewhere in this post,](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/2auio5/big_greens_lethal_agenda_sustainability_and/cj06sjj) there actually is a strong conservative argument to fund renewable energy.  The problem is the fossil fuel industry a lot of money, and a lot of pull.  \n\n&gt; That depends on what part of the fossil fuel industry you mean. You could argue that coal people don't want solar and wind, but coal produces baseload, so their beef is with nuclear. Solar and wind don't produce liquid transportation fuels, so oil companies aren't threatened by them. Gas producers love solar and wind because their intermittency guarantees decades' worth of consumption.\n\nHey, that very well may be true and it looks like you're more well versed than I am in the energy industry.  But regardless of which industry you pick: coal, gas, oil... fact remains that these are all finite resources.   Solar, wind and hydro are all virtually limitless.  Whatever your feelings on climate change, it would behoove a government (who has different motivations from a private corporation) to do the best things for its citizens, both short term and long term.  \n\n&gt;  Solar and wind don't produce liquid transportation fuels, so oil companies aren't threatened by them. \n\nThis isn't entirely true though.  The Kochs and allies have been funding [efforts to *tax* people who sell solar energy back to the grid](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-solar-kochs-20140420-story.html#axzz2zHAV9MB2&amp;page=1).  Yes, that is from a liberal source, so here's the [Breitbart version of the story](http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-California/2014/04/20/la-times-targets-koch-solar-panel-fight).  Note that it doesn't actually refute the thrust of the LA Times piece.  \n\nSo yeah... while the oil companies (at the very least the Kochs) may not be \"threatened\" by solar, they've certainly directed resources towards the advancement of the industry.\n\nDamn.  Apologies on the lengthy post.",

"comment": "Question away my friend.  I used to be one of the poor.  My original point was that they have the money to spend on what they feel is important to them.  It could be beer, or cigarettes, or pot, or tennis shoes, or bling, or Hip Hop Concert tickets.\n\nThe main thing is that they are not without any money, they just spend it all every week, and have nothing left over for savings.  Again, I say, this is the voice of experience. I'm not some 17 year old kid sitting in his daddy's mansion spouting off about \"those people.\"  I lived it, for decades.\n\nI'm not rich now - my family is very solidly middle class, living in what most people would consider to be a very modest home, with very little in the way of valuable property.  I have some equity in my house, and some retirement savings, and the furniture and nicknacks that one collects along the way.  We've to a great collection of \"collectable spoons\" that my wife has put together, and lots of those squished pennies from all over.  \n\nWe also have a lot of books - boxes and boxes of them.  We had them up on shelves, but then we had kids, and the kids needed a room, so....\n\nBut, anyway, not rich, by any means.  I would not \"spend\" hundreds of dollars a year to \"combat climate change\" either, if it was writing a check to some foundation, but I would certainly buy long lasting, low wattage light bulbs.  I would not pay into a \"climate reparations fund\" to be sent to undeveloped nations to assuage my climate sins, but I would (and do) lease an electric car.  \n\nSo, when we ask people, \"would you pay $100 to combat climate change\" you might not get the answer you're looking for.  IF you said, instead, \"would you buy a more efficient water heater, if I could show you that it would save money on your monthly electric bill\" you'd more than likely get a positive response.  And, saving money on the electric bill is cutting down on electricity usage, which also cuts down on the amount of coal needed to power the electric grid.\n\nSurvey's get the responses they want to get by the way the questions are asked.",

"comment": "It's cheaper and more effective to put solar on the roof of a house than the roof of a car.\n\n- solar panels typically last for 25 years or more. many cars are wrecked or retired within 15 years.\n- provided they're well-sited and clear of shade trees, house roofs are in the sun every day all day and usually have roofs optimally sloped for year-average sun. cars can be shaded by garages, trees, buildings, and are typically not angled well to receive sunlight.\n- total surface area on the car roof is small - possible to mount maybe 500 watts of panels, or &lt; 2 miles charged per hour. A 120V outlet will charge 2-3 times as quickly.\n\nEven so, if or when the cost becomes small enough, car-mounted solar may make sense .. but presently a solar roof option would likely cost in the $3000-5000 range. Pretty expensive for maybe 20k miles (10 miles/day * 200 days/year * 10 years).\n\n***\n\nThere are some prototype cars that are able to make significant use of solar energy, due to being significantly lighter, more aerodynamic, and providing more roof surface than a conventional passenger vehicle.\n\nhttp://cleantechnica.com/2013/10/17/stella-takes-first-world-solar-challenge-worlds-first-solar-powered-family-car-wins-michelin-cruiser-class/\n\nThe Sunswift uses about 1/6 as much energy per mile as a conventional electric vehicle, due to being smaller and much lighter (700 pounds total), doing away with much of the safety and luxury of a typical car. Even so, it requires approximately 8 hours of sunlight for two hours of driving.\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/2014/08/eve-solar-powered-car-record/",

"comment": "I do find it amusing that you think this all stresses me out.  It doesn't.  I'm simply advocating a position that I think will be better for the adoption of BEVs in the long run.  There is no question that the single biggest obstacle to a more widespread adoption of BEVs is range anxiety.  A plug-in Hybrid is a great stop gap to alleviate that issue for those who aren't willing or able to stop using fossil fuels completely.  As you, and everyone else knows it makes charging while on the road unnecessary.  \n\nMy car and your soon to be car are cousins.  I applaud all pluggers.  I look forward to a day when charging stations are so commonplace that no one need worry about where to refuel.  But that day isn't here yet, so we get to have debates like these.  Oh joy.\n\nThe more charging stations available to BEV drivers, the more we reduce range anxiety.  Building more charging stations is one solution.  (Hopefully that continues because it is the ideal solution.) Restricting usage so that those who need to use them get priority over those who don't is another solution.  I agree it's not an ideal solution for Plug-in hybrid drivers who want to be off gas as much as possible.  \n\nThere are, of course, other solutions.  Perhaps it would be better to charge significantly more for public EV charging.  Let the laws of supply and demand dictate who needs to charge and when.  That also might make EV chargers profitable enough that it would increase installations by private businesses.  Of course, if prices go too high, it then discourages all plug in use.",

"comment": "First of all, it's *a*ffect, not *e*ffect. I suggest you learn that English is all about learning the alphabet.  Second, you make multiple nonsequiturs.  Third, I never made the claim it was optimal. Fourth, electric cars and solar power are essentially in their infancy as far as widespread use.  Every technology needs to start somewhere, then it can be improved upon over time.  Trying to argue about copper, inductors, and simply bizarre.  I'm not talking about optimal.  I'm talking about the idea as a concept. I wonder how many people told Elon Musk that his electric cars would be too expensive because of the cost of copper and inductors.  He would have told you to fuck off.  Obviously you've thought about this idea too if you've supposedly built cars with solar panels.  You of all people should know that it's not a stupid idea and could improve with time and advances in solar technology.  Lastly, don't talk to me about learning what engineering is all about and asking me why I don't live in a solar house. The type of house I live in has nothing to do with this discussion.  The fact you would even ask it reveals your IQ and thought process.",

"comment": "I have come to the conclusion, form the documentary as well as various others sources, that Hydrogen Fuel cell cars are more or less gimmicks by big oil and car companies to try and further control the market. They try to make the argument that there are other technologies available, they are \"just in testing phases.\" However they come with different risks/rewards, and haven't been accepted as production vehicles because of the risk factors.\n\nIts my opinion that the big car companies are trying to buy time, to build a car that uses a fuel you will have to buy, that produces no emissions. The technology to provide a safe and effective Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is not there, the infrastructure to build hydrogen fuel storage facilities is undesirable, whether you like to admit it or not. I reiterate this is my opinion.\n\nTo answer your question as to why car companies aren't producing electric cars, like Tesla, I think they are just slow innovators. They have rested on their laurels for far to long, and now they have realized in the last decade they must innovate/ reinvent the car. Which, these are multi-billion dollar companies whose only concern has been making mountains of cash from selling new body types, with upgraded features(an exaggeration, hopefully you understand where Im going), for over a century. People's mind sets have changed, the car industry has failed to change with them.",

There's so few of them, and the ones that do work (like the ones at Whole Foods) are always being used.  Its important that you have an L2 charger at home so you can start each day with a full battery.  It also greatly helps to have an L2 charger at or near your workplace.  Just don't plan on doing long trips with a short range EV.  Its not a car for road trips, unless you want to do a lot of careful pre-planning and have a bit of luck with fast chargers being available.",

The Ipace is a pretty great car with a decent price in a very popular segment that should be able to fight Tesla pretty well since that SUV-like tesla is downright hideous (really don't know who they asked to design that thing).",

"comment": "If you wanted to look into setting it up proper, there are a few different options. The absolute cheapest method while providing a charger would run you ~$400 (basically just buy a charger and plug it into an existing standard wall outlet), though if you wanted to offer a proper charger at a good charge speed, you would be looking at $1-2k for a professional install + hardware, depending on how far the power line needs to be run from your service box, assuming it is a straight run, without needing to go under a parking lot or other tricky areas etc. The charger itself costs you $4-600. This is for a barebones charger that is basically free to use, such as ones from clippercreek.\n\nIf you just want to provide an outlet, and would rather the EV owner bring their own charger, the best outlet type to install would be a NEMA 14-50 socket, rated for 50 amps. A LEAF charge caps out on 30 amp service, but EVs with bigger batteries (chevy bolt, teslas, unknown future models) would be able to fully utilize the 50 amp service so it's best to plan for the future a bit.\n\nIf you want to be able to charge for using it, you can look into chargepoint chargers. It gives you the option to set rates and do other advanced features.",

"comment": "Unlike a car, when an EV won't \"go\", you have to hunt for the reason. It will almost never be the drive unit.  Maybe the car will tell you what's wrong through codes if you have the right tools.  Let's see what kinds of things can go wrong on an EV:\n\n* Isolation fault:  An isolation fault is when the system detects low resistance between the HV plus or minus to ground.  Chafed wires, moisture, coolant leaks, water intrusion, etc. can all cause this.   To fix it you have to find it.  How?  The simplest fix will probably be full replacement and refurbishing the bad unit. (Battery refurbishing will become a new business).\n\n* Auxiliary Power Module fault:  This unit charges the 12V battery.  Without it, none of the conventional electronics can do its job.\n\n* Contactor fault: Contactors are just high current relays.   There's a pair for driving, two for charging, a pair for the AC, maybe more.  They are all inside the battery pack.  Gotta drop the pack and open it to find it.\n\n* AC charging fault: The OBC turns AC into DC to charge the pack.   Not an easy task.   It performs thousands of checks per second to make sure all is OK before letting up to 10kW/40 amps AC into the car to charge that HV pack.   When it decides something isn't right, you're stuck with DC charging only or no charging at all until you're stuck getting towed. \n\n* Inverter fault: The inverter turns DC into 3-phase AC for the drive unit.  Lots of high-power, liquid cooled electronics.   Better hope you never have a problem.  Probably just have to replace it.   Not cheap.\n\n* Bad cell in a module: A single cell out of the 288 in a Bolt can disable the entire pack.  Your cell phone has ONE cell in it.   Imagine owning 288 phones and using them every day.  What are the chances you may have a problem with one of them.   The odds are lower the bigger the battery because there are more cells.  \n\n* Cooling leak: Inside the pack, coolant flows to remove heat.  There are hoses and clamps.  They can still fail, although not as likely as a typical gas mobile cooling hose because of the lower temperatures and pressures (5psi vs.16psi).   If you have an internal leak, you will have to perform a full pack teardown to find it.  better watch that WeberAuto video a few times.\n\nMost of these things don't happen often, but they can and will happen eventually.   Diagnostics will prevent the EV entire system from operating.  You can't run on half a battery if the other half has a problem.  It's not like running on 7/5/3 cylinders or driving around with a MIL light on because you didn't tighten the gas cap.  Luckily, these failures are a lot seldom seen compared to the thousands of typical problems that happen on a gasmobile.\n\nMost of today's operating faults seem to be caused by undercharged 12V batteries.  Easy fix.  Except for why the 12V battery failed in the first place.  Tesla has a terrible track record for 12V battery failures.   Chevy Bolts have them, too.  I have no info on Leafs.\n\nSo if you want to do a conversion, it's more than just bolting it in.  Do it poorly, and your conversion is no better than a poorly built house with crooked nails and misaligned wood cut to the wrong lengths.    Do it right and you'll have a hell of a nice retro vehicle.",

"comment": "The short seller was claiming that the truck doesn’t exist, and that there are none under construction. The truck exists, there are more being built.\n\nThe management and board are completely over their heads but that doesn’t mean the product (trucks, fuel, logistics) is impossible. It just means the board need to pull their socks up, secure competent leadership, and focus on making the money the company needs to roll out the Nikola trucks and hydrogen supply chain.\n\nThere are many places that a fuel cell truck will have advantages over batteries, such as anywhere the temperatures regularly fall below zero (fuel cells won’t suffer the same range reduction in low temperatures that batteries do, and the fuel cells will help keep the batteries and cabin warm).\n\nWhat will be a problem is if it turns out that the “driving loops in the carpark” truck is actually fake and not an engineering proof showing that the team were able to integrate OEM components to produce a FCEV semi.\n\nNot that I — with all of five digits of investment funds — could make a difference but to keep me happy I’d want to see that semi’s maximum range as it exists today, and a roadmap of what Nikola needs to accomplish to realise the truck of their original announcements. Alongside that I would want to see a plan for acquiring real estate to build fuel &amp; power sites, and some progress on building their fuel supply chain — even a slapped-together OEM/contracted single demo site capable of filling the prototype truck once a day would give an estimate of the build out cost for the entire network to start with.\n\nOnce they can get a truck that can drive 100km and refuel once a day, realising the rest of the technology side of the business is a set of engineering and licensing challenges — work with OEMs to design or license the bits they need to improve, reduce the weight and bulk of the fuel cells, integrate cooling, etc, then work on efficiency, cost and throughput for the fuel plant, and find convenient property to build a fuel route from Anchorage to Halifax, then drive a Nikola One/Two/whatever on that route towing 30t.\n\nI dunno if five years is long enough to realise that goal if they retain laser-focus on just meeting it with no detours, but at that point they will have concrete numbers for a system that works, and plenty of ideas for where they can improve efficiency or reduce costs.\n\nIdeally they’d be most of the way there by now. They’ve had three years since the original reveals and demos. At least Tesla isn’t entering the space for another two years, so they have a bit of runway left before they absolutely must launch.",

Either VW id.4 or something similar (Ford Mach e). Probably wouldn't get the Model Y since the tax incentives make other cars much cheaper.",

Here in the USA, the EPA range comparison isn't good for the 2022 Ioniq 5 AWD Long Range at **256 miles vs 330 miles** for the 2022 Model Y AWD Long Range.  Since you are in Norway you'll probably be using the WLTP numbers.  Just make sure you are looking at AWD in both cases.",

"comment": "You might be overwhelmed with replies, but here's a go at doing the calculations with better source data.\n\n**Comparison**: Model 3 RWD vs BMW 330i (say what you will about Tesla interior quality, but this is a more appropriate match, given driving characteristics, power, and cost)\n\n**Model 3 energy use**: per ev-database, real-world combined usage is 129 Wh/km in mild weather, 183 Wh/km in cold (-10C) weather. Averaging the two: **156 Wh/km**\n\n**BMW 330i fuel use**: per EPA, **8.1 l/100km** combined\n\nElectricity emissions intensity: per EIA, 388 g/kWh (2021)\n\nFuel emissions intensity: per stoichiometry, 2300 g/l. Upstream emissions (drilling, refining, etc) range from 20-33% additional CO2. Being generous and using 20% yields a gasoline emissions intensity of 2760 g/l\n\n**Emissions intensity, Model 3**: 156 Wh/km \\* 0.388 g/Wh \\* 1.05 (charging losses) = **64 g/km**\n\n**Emissions intensity, 330i**: 0.081 l/km \\* 2760 g/l = **224 g/km**\n\nIn this comparison, emissions intensity of the ICE vehicle was **3.5 times higher** than an equivalent EV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus: the emissions intensity of the electric grid varies depending on where you are. If we repeat the analysis for California's energy mix (30 day average, CISO, per electricitymaps = 184 g/kWh), we end up with the Model 3 emitting 30 g/km (7.5 times lower than ICE). If we look at Quebec (29 g/kWh), we get 5 g/km (45 times lower than ICE). This demonstrates that as the grid gets cleaner, so do the EVs powered by it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus 2: Even if we do the math for a Corolla Hybrid, the EV still wins. Corolla Hybrid = 4.7 l/100km combined. 0.047 l/km \\* 2760 g/l = 130 g/km. Still double the Model 3. \n\n(You will notice that if grid emissions are higher than 793 g/kWh, the Corolla Hybrid will win. There are a couple of such grids in the US. Well, two: Louisville Gas and Electric Company (910g), and South Carolina Public Service Authority (876g).)",

"comment": "In a way, this is good for used EV pricing as many EVs once below 30k will have downward pressure to reach the 25k mark. And, for EVs hitting 20k or below price range, they might keep their price in that level longer due to the credit. If you see, so many 2021/2022 EVs are already going below 30k, and nothing can stop them going even further due to the market conditions.",

One path will be for low cost, supplying affordable EVs with stable batteries that provide reasonable range and charging times.  The other path will be to improve current higher-end vehicles: they'll get range increases, fast charging times, reduced weight and reduced battery degradation over time...but they will keep pushing the envelope so will not be materially cheaper for several years.",

I personally think that Obama is will push for permanent extension because he is a \"greenie\". Also Obama is still pushing for solar jobs, so eliminating the ITC, in my opinion, goes against that. \n\nBush was the president that put in in place in his last year of his presidency. So I think Obama will do the same as well in his last year.  A lot of speculation that the deal will revolve around keystone pipeline for extension of the ITC.  I expect that permanent extension will be suggested. Worth noting that the pipeline is pointless in the current oil market, everything in Canada is shutting down. \n\nAbout tapering... that will depend on what the government wants to support. @30%, everything remains the same. Reduce it down to 10% and the large solar farm and most small installers are kill.  Eliminate it and his speech in Utah about creating solar jobs for Veterans will have been pointless. (Obama has done a lot of pointless things)\n\nI think that Solarcity will survive any scenarios as it is transitioning to battery storage. They will be able to sell as grid regulation service to the utilities as stand alone service. \n\nBarron's has a solid article on how the solar industry can survive without any incentive (one of the better article I have read in a long time). The ITC will decide how quickly we get there....\n\nhttp://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2015/04/08/solar-will-triumph-by-2018-breaking-the-subsidy-dependence-says-bernstein/\n\nEdit: this is all speculation, I don't have any information that is not publicly available if you attend the right events. ITC officially ends at the end of 2016.",

"comment": "Sure, here's one.\n\nMy home is heated with radiant floor heating from 3 water pumps and a large hot water tank that's heated by a natural gas high efficiency boiler. The boiler requires electricity to run as do the water pumps.  I'm looking to have a redundant solar power array to specifically power the boiler and the pumps plus a standard electrical socket that could run a laptop / phone charger in the case of a week long power outage. I understand that a battery pack or gasoline / diesel generator would probably be the best options but I would ideal like suggestions for 100% solar / battery.  That being said, I'd also want the battery to be disconnected in the majority of situations until power goes out to then be charged by the panels as to not use up charging cycles on the battery, ( if that's even a thing? ). \n\nWhat do you recommend?",

"comment": "I appreciate you humoring me, but let me provide a few more points...\n\n&gt; Somehow, I don't think that covering the entirety of the Earth's crust with Solar Panels....\n\nWell, we don't need to produce 20,000x more energy then we need, so we wouldn't get to that point. It would simply be enough to cover our available rooftops with solar, and then have utility-scale arrays outside of town.\n\n&gt; manufactured using highly toxic chemicals and rare-earth-metals\n\nI'd love to see where solar uses MORE toxic chemicals and rare-earth-metals than traditional power generation. All that steel and copper needs to be extracted too. Silicon is the 2nd most abundant material in the earth's crust. Oxygen is the 1st. The primary reason we need toxic material to make solar is because of the energy used in the silicon extraction process (from silicon dioxide, go figure). So again, an increasingly abundant energy supply helps solve that problem. \n\n&gt; rebuilding all civilization from scratch\n\nWell, modern society has been bubbling up to the surface for the past 2000 years... and we're currently at about 1% solar with less than fifty years of effort. So I wouldn't be so drastic. But yes, a lack of available energy supply is the #1 barrier to 100% solar adoption.\n\n&gt; Producing all those panels is going to require massive amounts of oil, coal, and nuclear power to mine, manufacture, and support those panels\n\nThat's true, but solar has a 2 year energy payback. Eventually our linear rate of adoption would begin to hit a sustainable, exponential growth curve. \n\n&gt; not to mention the oceans of toxic chemicals required for battery storage.\n\nIf we had an super-overabundance of energy, we wouldn't use batteries for energy storage. Inefficiencies of pumped hydro, or even the brute force splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen would be a realistic option.\n\nSo yea, a 100% solar society is a whimsical thought, in the sense that it would take a few hundred years to do so none of us would see that happen. But that doesn't mean we should do it. The other shovel-ready fuel alternatives have more significant disadvantages IMO.",

"comment": "You'll never get that.  The most expensive highest efficiency panels routinely installed on roofs these days are SunPower, at 21.1% efficiency.  However, SunPower only sells to authorized installers, and will not sell direct to customers.  You can sometimes find seconds or surplus panels for direct sale, but you'll have to hunt around and ask your local SunPower installers to hear about deals like that.",

This is especially true if you have net metering for this connection. \n\nNot every day is sunny. More panels will make those dim days produce a little more. \n\nIf you do not need 6KW of out put and have space for more panels.

"comment": "Local policies from state-run utility boards. \n\nThey create the rules that favor, or don't favor, policies such as net-metering... Which in turn affect consumer adoption... Which affects market growth, and potential investment by entrepreneurs (that employ people btw).\n\nThe boards are usually comprised of a majority utility representatives and a few consumer rights advocates working in government via some form. Sometimes they have to make policies based on state laws, other times they are completely independent. \n\nWhat we're seeing in many states right now is a concerted effort by the utilities in these public utility boards to put forward rules that stop or hinder favorable net-metering policies because they saw how favorable net-metering policies affected utility profits in other states like CA, MA, AZ, etc...\n\nEven in states with favorable net-metering policies like Iowa, the details of rules put forward by their utility board actually only benefit consumers on two utility grids there. The other 50+ coop utility grids are allowed to make their own metering policies against solar, which they do, thus making solar a bad investment in most of the rural areas because their local coop is allowed to make the net metering rules. Thus less adoption, thus slowing down market growth, thus maintaining the old grid to keep profits up. \n\nThis kind of local policy manipulation is happening all across the country: \n\nCreate local policy to make the ROI on something like solar panels for a home just not worth it and there will be FAR less people investing in solar. \n\nA lot of solar advocates believe that batteries will help solve this. Technically yes, but politically it will be a mess because all of the local utility boards will still control the regulations on how those batteries can be installed. What rate system you will be on. Which types of equipment are allowed on the grid. And so on...\n\nPeople can't just plug solar panels and batteries into a wall and expect a lower bill. It takes micro-level utility planning, certified electricians, approved one-line diagrams, state and utility inspectors, and regulated safety equipment JUST TO MAKE ONE HOUSE semi-renewable. Again all of this is regulated by the state utility boards. Do solar advocates really think the utility boards won't put in more regulatory requirements to install batteries as they gain popularity? \n\nBetter technology is only a fraction of the solution. None of that matters though if the state utility board implements policies that put up roadblocks for adoption. \n\nEDIT: grammar and spelling",

Ever heard of Kodak?\n\nYou really are an idiot btw.\n\n&gt;Luddite\n\nPlease stop, I am hurt and offended. At least you learnt how to spell it.\n\nI have rooftop solar so all I can do is laugh, got it 7-8 years ago. May I ask if you have rooftop solar? Have you had it longer than 7 years or did this little luddite purchase a new technology before you did?\n\n&gt;But even without any number of amazing breakthru developments in solar and battery tech in labs now, solar is doubling exponentially because it is cost effective (idiot's kneejerk \"but, but... muh subsidies!\" argument already debunked). Cost curves are plunging. \n\nIncreasing exponentially? Over how long a time frame? I did not claim muh subsidies, I pointed out your lie when you linked an article comparing prices but only taking subsidies into account for fossil fuels. Subsidize away, I don't care, just don't lie when comparing prices.\n\n&gt;Whatever unspoken alternative you seem to secretly support (yeah, what was that again, \"clean\" coal?) is losing.\n\nClean coal? In my entire reddit history find where I mention clean coal, I doubt you will even find the word coal. What the fuck are you on about? Who said alternative? Fuck AGW and fuck your bullshit. I do not care if we use \"dirty\" coal for now. Nuclear, wind, solar, hydro, fossil. I just don't really care how long it takes to transition to another energy source as long as we do it. I simply argue not to go large scale on any until it is competitive, not cheaper as I will pay extra, just competitive.",

I agree with the other posts about looking for a professional installer and doing your homework on them. I always like to equate rooftop solar to other big home improvements like an addition or a kitchen remodel. You can shop for all of the pieces and find one cheaper over here and another cheaper over there, etc. But in the end you are well served by getting a few contractors to compete and offer you some options to pick from. And even better, when you choose an established and reputable contractor you *can* get good service should there a problem down the road. I once made a small addition and used a family business where the second generation was running the company. Their brand name was very important, and they were very responsive when I had a foundation problem that I suspect others might have blamed on the ground and not their work.",

It's pretty split between people saying the setbacks are required or not, which I guess is in line with what I've heard from solar installers.\n\nIt sounds like the setbacks are not generally *required* in MA (though they could possibly be in certain towns). I suspect that company B being a larger national installer might be part of the reason they abide by stricter setback rules.\n\nI'll still check with my town hall, and call my home insurance provider to see if they have anything to say about it.\n\nI guess the next question is, even if it's not required, should I voluntarily include the setbacks anyway?

The business of building utility-scale solar has been brutal. We don’t think SunPower will ever be competitive again in utility-scale solar.",

It's exactly what you said:\n\n&gt;&gt;In less than 10 years, gas deposition layer solid state batteries **will power a car for 600 miles on a 10 minute charge that can be supplied at home via solar panels.**\n\n&gt;The energy gathered from a solar installation throughout the day can be stored and used to power a car.\n\nNow you are trying to climb down. OK. I'll play along. You are saying you can charge a 200 kW battery from 5 kW of solar panels. That's 40 hours of charge time. Most places get about 6 hours of insolation on average, so you are talking about nearly a week to charge up your car if you use your solar panels for nothing else. See the problem? \n\n&gt;People already do this for their 170 mile range Tesla's\n\nNot unless they have a really oversized solar install they don't. \n\n&gt;Thanks for using foul language. \n\nDon't act like a fucking moron and you won't get called a fucking moron.\n\n&gt;You are really locked into your denial bro'.\n\nLOL! I'm the one doing the arithmetic, bro. You are the one citing articles from 2010 to support your ridiculous claim, which you then tried to climb down from! It's clear you are the one in denial. \n\nIf you want to try again, we'll start from scratch. You make a supportable claim, and I'll just assume you weren't awake when you make your silly claim earlier. Fair?",

"comment": "There are two uses for tariffs; one is to protect native industry against cheaper foreign sources, the other is to make a product less attractive.  If the intent here is to prevent foreign manufacturers from being able to undercut domestic manufacturers, the expectation would be that the increase in prices would enable our domestic businesses to ramp up to meet demand.  We would expect to be investing that extra cost into better factories and ultimately bring the cost of domestic solar panels down to the level where they can compete with foreign suppliers.\n\nTo those individuals celebrating here that US solar costs will skyrocket, thus preventing people from adopting solar, what is your hope here? Are you hoping that we spend just as much, or more, of our national budget on solar panels, thus increasing the profitability of domestic panel manufacturers?  Or, are you hoping that the entire solar industry goes belly up in the US, and we drive as many of these companies out of business as possible?",

"comment": "Here is my experience with Sun Run.  I am not familiar with Mission.  We leased our panels from Sungevity in 2016.  The panels have performed as expected.  Here in NYC, we don't have an electric bill during the summer, generally starting in June.  And, during the winter, the panels offset the electric used.  Whoop Whoop.  HOWEVER, April of 2019, we noticed that we were getting roof leaks, particularly in one room.  We went on the roof and didn't see anything that would cause the issues.  So we took down the ceiling in that room and discovered that the insulation was soaked and molded. The in ceiling wires were rusted.  When the panels were installed, we were told that the posts would go into the joists and not the deck.  Every area where the post screws were in the deck leaked.  We went back on the roof and saw that the pads around the post installs had lifted, the silicone sealant was only about an inch wide.  The post screws had no sealant at all, so as the water went under the pads, it drained right into the post screws and into the insulation.  We contacted Sunrun, after much back and forth, they sent out an insurance adjuster, this was in August.  We were assured that the matter would be resolved quickly.  Kept reaching out to them to see what was the cause of the delay.  Sunrun actually gave me the contact information of their insurance partner, because they didn't understand the delay.  It is now November.  NYC has experienced its first bomb cyclone and about 3 heavy rain events; and the temperature is dropping.  SunRun and it's insurance partner have gone silent.  Good product is great.  HOWEVER, even good product needs repair and SunRun's lack of customer service shows that it does not stand by it's Customer Service claims, it's warranty or it's promises.  Is Solar good ABSOLUTELY.  Sunrun, not so much.  Would I install solar again.  Absolutely.  I would also install wind turbines on my house.  My house faces east/west. \n\n A company is only as good as it's warranty and customer service.  SunRun has some fixing to do.",

It's nothing but shameful virtue signaling.\n\nAlso, what if you want to tap into a market with inferior product? Inventing harder is risky business. It is way easier to lobby a politician to harm your concurrency with green policies and to grant you some substitution to make you relevant. Isn't that how we end up with solar panels covered by snow? \n\nOil industry doesn't need to bribe politicians and academic. They are dedicated customers any way.

Their quote without a battery backup is not bad and I can work with them on the final design layout.",

"comment": "Solar sales guy from MA here. You should be able to calculate your yearly cost of solar by getting the monthly payment from the loan. I’m going to guess here but let’s say your cash price (price before financing) is $54,000. Add in the interest rate and dealer fees (don’t forget dealer fees, they can be up to 40% of the cash price in some instances) and you’ll get a ball park of your monthly payment for ownership. I would guess you’ll get around a 5-6% interest rate including dealer fees. \n\nKeep in mind that if your initial monthly cost for solar through the loan is higher, the cost per month is fixed because it’s a loan. The PPA however will increase at 3% every year until it’s transferred over or the contract ends. \n\nI generally recommend people go solar through a loan or cash purchase because the system is owned by you and every month you’re paying it, you build equity in the system. PPA’s are pretty much only beneficial for people with no taxable income. \n\nAs for the rate you’d get paid back for to overproduction, it’s at the blended rate. Do keep in mind that National Grid and Eversource no longer allow you to cash out your excess credit for dollars. National Grid allows you to transfer those credits to other national grid accounts, and Eversource doesn’t allow any freedom for those credits.\n\nAs for downsizing, you’re at a 116% offset meaning you produce 16% more than you need. Most customers I do business with are around that percentage. Solar panels do degrade over time (1-2% the first year, and 0.5% every year after for mid-high end panels) which is why we recommend that offset. \n\nLastly, the company that is most likely serving your PPA is Sunova. Most solar companies including my own go through them if you’d like to look into them and what they have to offer.",

"comment": "Honestly I'd start with 1 or 2 normal house sized 300+W solar panels. \nYeah, you can add another CC later on. With batteries it's more complicated to expand later. You really don't want to run batteries of different ages/conditions into the same battery bank.\n\nBasically expanding the solar panels and charging capabilities is easy. But adding more battery/stored energy is not quite the same. There are ways to do it properly, but having two separate battery banks can make things more complicated pretty quickly. \n\nI'm considering adding more energy storage to my system and this is what I was planning:\n-Get a nice 48v battery bank\n-Replace my current 12v CC with one for 48v\n-Replace my 1kW 12v inverter with a 3.5kW 48v inverter\n-Add a dc-dc converter to charge my 12v battery from the 48v battery. \n\nThis was I can keep my 1.2kWh 12v battery, but I can increase my stored energy with the 48v battery. I can run heavier loads off the 48v DC or the larger AC inverter. I can keep all my 12v DC loads. \n\nSo something like that is an option if you really want to start small and increase capacity as you go. But you can see that I'm wasting a 12v inverter and 12v CC by expanding in this way.",

"comment": "Your net metering is great. That's honestly the biggest plus you have going on. Covering the delivery fees is amazing, and something that simply doesn't exist in my part of Texas. The tree thing sucks, and it seems like there's no way around it without severely curbing production. That's probably a bullet you'd have to bite. When it comes to origination fees, there are loan plans that have no origination fees, but higher APR. These plans can even be relatively long (up to 20 years). If you plan to live in the home for 20+ years, this is the way to go. You will not beat your monthly energy bills with these plans; it won't even be close. This is the best option if you're in love with the home and can see your family using it for a few more decades. If your home is purely electric, investing in your long term electric future is smart because you'll hedge against rate increases. Being in W Texas, I'm sure your energy prices are pretty damn low considering all our natural gas running the power plants comes from there. Still, it might be worth locking in your rate regardless. When it comes to your pricing, try to stay away from the absolute cheapest quoted price. This is a pretty expensive purchase all things considered, and its intended to keep you and your family satisfied for a very long time. People who are scraping the bottom of the barrel on price are getting you those savings from somewhere, and I don't think they're taking it out of their own pockets out of the goodness of their hearts. Look up the median PPW after financing in your area and try and stick to that. Let me know if you have any more questions!",

"comment": "My 5.4kw system (which isn't fully installed yet) was quoted at between £11-14k with 5-8kwh of batteries across 3 suppliers. All were going to supply JA solar panels, in varying sizes. \n\nWe ultimately decided not to do the battery for two reasons: the upfront cost when you don't know how much you're actually going to use it, and the fact that they're quite easy to retrofit. The system is costing £7k without batts.\n\nBatteries will help you shift consumption away from the peak production time, but if you're not producing much excess, it's going to be empty for the rest of the time. 11kwh seems excessive - it's going to take a 5.5kw solar system 2 hours at absolutely peak efficiency to fill that. Are you going to see that often enough to justify the extra cost?\n\nRegards the size of the inverter, see if quote 1 will match the size of quote 2, or see if quote 2 will match the size of the panels on quote 1. The difference in cost to them is quite minimal, if you give the salesman a poke.",

"comment": "The environmental impact of solar panel production is generally outweighed by the emissions saved during their operational lifetime. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the energy payback time (EPBT) for solar panels is typically within 1 to 3 years. This means it takes about 1 to 3 years for a solar panel to generate the amount of energy required to manufacture it.\n\nFor example, a study published in \"Nature Communications\" in 2015 by Raugei et al. estimated that the EPBT for a typical multicrystalline silicon solar panel is around 1.3 to 1.8 years. Over a 30-year lifespan, the emissions avoided by using solar energy significantly exceed the emissions from manufacturing.\n\nAdditionally, advancements in solar panel technology and manufacturing processes are constantly reducing the carbon footprint of production. So, considering the relatively short EPBT and the long-term emissions reduction, investing in solar panels is generally worth it from an environmental standpoint.",

"comment": "&gt;Everything you said is more complicated and convoluted than the damn tax credit you’re criticizing.\n\nNah, it's really not.  It's not only not complicated, it's also a perfectly fair system, which is critical for coming to the proper solutions to move society in the proper direction.\n\nEmissions taxes can be set by taxing fossil fuels.  Simple enough.  There's only three main fossil fuels.  Coal, oil, and natural gas.  Although that should be expanded to sources like peat and trees... given they're also sequestered carbon being released into the atmosphere.  To reduce the use of fossil fuels, it's a matter of small tax raises until the targeted reduction of emissions occurs.  These tax raises have to be stretched out (to a point) to avoid shocking the system and allow the system to adapt.\n\nTaxing other forms of pollution (and even environmental destruction) is a more complex problem, but not something we should ignore... and ignoring it is what we've mostly done up to this point.  Only going after companies for blatant large scale pollution releases.\n\nRebates or tax cuts for lower income people is pretty simple.  You can do this through the employees paycheck, or through a rebate, which could be as simple as a direct deposit system or cash cards.  We can base this on averages and inflation.  We have some experience issuing checks in the US with the COVID relief payments, or simply tax return checks.\n\nThe tax credit solution has always been an unfair solution that picks one technological winner over all the multitudes of other solutions.  To get an actual fair solution, that tax credit suddenly becomes FAR more complex.  And as if the EV credit was the only mechanism being used.  Nah, we have federal EV credits, state credits, ZEV credits, GHG credits, subsidies to build the factories, subsidies in the form of tax abatements, federal solar credits and battery storage credits, state solar credits and battery storage credits, power companies issuing refunds, insulation refunds... etc.  Going green is a convoluted mess of credits and refunds.\n\nThen of course up to this point, many of the credits have been completely dependent on one's income.  Too high, no credit.  Too low, reduced credit.\n\nThe irony of all these credits is that many setup a regressive system... given that most lower income people can't afford EVs, new or used.  They may be able to afford some short range used EVs, but if all of them tried, there wouldn't be enough supply and the prices would skyrocket.  With my solution, the rebate checks issued to lower income people could potentially be used to allow them to afford a greener solution.  So rather than getting a check to pay for increased gas prices, they could get rid of their old gas car and buy a short range EV... renting a car for any long distance driving.  A great solution that wealthier people refuse to acknowledge because \"it's inconvenient, my car needs a battery that has 300 miles of range and can do everything\".  No?\n\nWhile EVs are certainly better for emissions / pollution than ICEVs, they're not the best solution; especially for daily commuting.  That award actually goes to PEVs.\n\nSo, why are we giving really expensive vehicles a $7500 tax credit for ... maybe a 50%-60% reduction in emissions over the life of the car, when a bike could reduce those emissions by 90%+ yet doesn't get such a rebate in most regions?  Shouldn't the bike get a much larger credit, or even be completely paid for?\n\nThe carbon tax solution makes the situation fair.  Buying and using a bike will allow the person to significantly reduce their transportation costs... no convoluted credit system necessary.  No relying on government representatives to come up with a credit figure for every form of transportation.  A credit system that obviously is setup to reward corporate interests, given the amount of money big auto is using to lobby.  My solution removes this corrupt game and puts every solution on an even playing field.  Whichever form of transportation reduces emissions the most saves the consumer the most money.\n\nRich people can still drive their gas guzzlers... if they like to waste money...  Meanwhile, we can use all of that tax money to pay for the rebates to low income people, and on more directed solutions, like protected bike lanes.",

The real question is do heat pumps make sense at a set electrical rate that solar can provide or does a furnace and natural gas save on utility costs. Heat pumps certainly have value, but this is similar to a solar salesman trying to convince someone to buy an EV to reduce a gas bill. It may make sense, but it's a upfront capital intensive process that most people can't afford.\n\nAlso in the winter things like snow and less sun makes solar panels far less reliable when you would need them.",

(Hand out to Utility companies)\n\nNEM 3.0 introduced a “Mandatory Grid Participation Charge,” which requires all participants to pay a fee for using the network’s resources. Solar customers can expect to pay an extra $8 charge per kilowatt (kW) of solar power capacity. The average homeowner will have to pay an additional $48 per month, further reducing the amount of savings received from solar energy.

(Definitely not a consumer hand out.)\n\nCould you go into a detail a bit how commercial utilities aren't getting a much better deal now than they were?

I feel that my system was appropriately sized and priced.  No financing was involved.  After three months all has gone well.  My only issue is that the communication module within the Delta inverter does not function properly.  But, GAF at least is involved in the solution to this.  I fortunately, live in Ohio, where net metering issues are not currently a problem. As long as my annual production does not exceed my total usage by 20% I am compensated $-$ for what I do produce as a credit against my bill. \n\nI say that I am fortunate to be in Ohio, but that may be temporary. The public utility commission is in the back pocket of the super majority, Republican legislature, and the energy companies.",

Charge the battery off solar in the day and off the grid free at night.   /u/TexSun1968 has posted a bunch of his bills in the past.\n\n\nYou can go with a net metering plan.    Personally, I don't recommend it.   The days of net metering are over and these plans just don't provide the value they used to.\n\n\nYou can go with a wholesale export plan.   This is what I'm on.   Basically you are in self consumption mode year round and chasing those spikes in wholesale prices.\n\n\n\nPeople can share bills and screenshots from their monitoring system, I'm more than happy to and there are plenty of posts on here.   But a word of caution, it's is incredibly specific to your usage pattern on Texas.   I've shifted all my load to the daytime to use the free electricity.   Others have shifted all their load to nighttime.    Your usage pattern can create a completely different bill on the same electric plan",

"comment": "For snacking:  \nhummus and carrots\nsoy crisps or rice cakes (with or without almond butter and sliced banana)\nlow glycemic index foods (whole grains) will keep you from crashing\napple slices with almond butter\nfresh fruit smoothies with soy milk\nwater, water, water.\n\nIf you have a Trader Joe's nearby, they have inexpensive almond butter ($5/jar instead of the $8-11+ I see elsewhere)  Even though nut butter is high in calories, it doesn't take much to make a rice cake filling and delicious.\n\nBasically, don't have many low glycemic index carbs (refined sugars), and make sure you're getting sufficient protein and plenty of fiber.\n\nIf you are wondering why your diet is making you feel cravings, it may be because of nutritional deficits.  If you really want an eye-opening book, read \"Becoming Vegan\" by Davis &amp; Melina.\n\nFor a filling meal, whole wheat pasta with lots of red lentils and hot madras curry.  This is more of an autumn dish, but it is delicious.  Directions for the lentils:  Boil 2 and 2/3 cups water per cup of lentils.  Bring water to a boil first, add red lentils.  Cover, reduce heat to very low.  Scrape bottom every 5-10 minutes.  If you don't add enough water, you may find yourself scraping too often.  Too much, and you'll be waiting for the lentils to cook down.  Cook for an hour or longer -- the red lentils should turn brownish yellow.  DO NOT ADD SALT until the lentils are nearly done... or they won't soften as easily.  Add some salt and a tablespoon or two of hot madras curry powder.  Stir, spoon over pasta with nutritional yeast and black pepper.",

So add a little to bread, but not too much. Add as much as you want to cookies or cakes that are rising with baking powder or not rising at all. The same goes for any pulps you might have left over from milk making or juicing. Just dry it out or use less added liquid. :)",

Have a look at some of the health related posts here on r/vegan, you will see a lot of people here who are very well educated about how to get essential nutrients, probably a much higher percentage than you would find in a group of omnivores. \n\nPeople generally take medicines for survival purposes. This is different from food, clothing, cosmetics, and other household products which are not essential, (and are available in animal free versions.) I think the majority of vegans would prefer a situation where medicines were not made from animals or animal products, and support innovations that work towards that.",

The idea that \"not killing animals\" extends to making them live a little longer in agony is evil to me). Abortion is about not being pregnant any more - about not serving as a life support system for another being, whether you simply don't want to or it is harming you too much. There is no moral obligation to support another's life with your own body, even if it's a tiny defenceless baby, even if it's your own child. The inevitable death of the foetus is unfortunate but that's how it is, just like thousands are dying for lack of blood, bone marrow, organs... bodily autonomy is worth more. The idea that each being fully owns its own body and decides what it will and won't do with it is pretty fundamental to veganism.",

Now imagine that everything she's been served in these situations has cow products in them... milk, beef, whatever.  Is she being annoying because you asked her about how things went and she responded that she was served food that goes against her beliefs?\n\nPeople have a right to believe whatever they want, and consume whatever they want.  She ain't dying here, but it made her day less pleasant.  There's nothing wrong with what she said.\n\nAdditionally, I think you'll find that if she's new to veganism, she's likely to be excited about it.  She wants to talk about it.  She wants to share her experiences with you.  Eventually, she'll figure out that she isn't the first, that she won't be the last, and that life is too short to talk about it all the time.  If you care about her, then just bear with it.  It's (the talking about it) not going to last forever.",

"comment": "&gt; I disagree with the comment. If veganism is to grow substantially, it's going to encompass such a diversity of people with all sorts of motivations. Yet you're telling this girl that there are no vegans allowed anywhere ever who aren't in it solely for animal ethics. No sense in turning people away for not having good enough reasons when the result of health-motivated vegan consumerism and animal-motivated vegan consumerism is exactly the same and benefits everyone.\n\nRespectfully, this absolutely isn't the case; no one has been turned away from anything. What I've done here is correct the use of the word vegan, but I haven't restricted anyone from either going plant based ***or*** from adopting the philosophy of veganism.\n\n_\n&gt; If you want veganism to be a specific minority group forever, for people that have a specific ethical philosophy towards animals and no other reason, okay, and do you have a recommendation for where the millions of people that do this for other reasons should organize themselves and promote this lifestyle? \n\nErr... Vegans went out of their way to invent and define the word vegan to describe a philosophical position. Anyone who wishes to adopt that same philosophy is free to do so. Anyone who wishes to follow a different philosophical path is likewise free, and if there's not a name for what they're doing, they're likewise free to create a name for what they're doing. Vegans aren't getting in the way of _any_ of that.\n\n_\n&gt;Because I want to be part of the movement that gets results. You can have the label but I care about seeing the world change and those people need a place to organize. Do you want them to team up with your efforts or do you want them to start their own thing?\n\nAGREED! I also want to see results, which is why it's so important that the word \"vegan\" be clearly understood to mean exactly what it means. Misuse of the word \"vegan\" has real world negative consequences: when it's obfuscated, it becomes hard to understand what veganism is and isn't, and this ultimately makes the goal of the philosophy of veganism harder to achieve, all of which results in more sentient individuals being hurt and killed longer. Correcting people's understanding of the word \"vegan\" _really matters_.\n\n---\n\n^(**EDIT:** *minor grammatical fix*)",

They both need a heart transplant to survive but there's just one donor heart available (let's assume it's equally compatible with both patients.) If you were placed in the situation of deciding where the heart should go, would you seriously consider giving it to the pig? I definitely want to help the pig, I want them to be happy and live a good life, but I'm not willing to sacrifice a human child to achieve that.\n\nI don't value animal and human lives as totally equal and I suspect very few people do. But I *do* value animal lives and their well-being highly enough that torturing them for the sake of a meal is abhorrent to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA less silly version of the speaker's argument could be:\n\n&gt;As more people understand what goes in to creating animal food products, societal opinions about those products will change. In many societies people who smoke are now at least frowned upon for the damage they cause to themselves and others, people who choose to eat meat and diary could be frowned upon. The social norm would shift to where using animals for food feels wrong to most people.\n\nThere's no need for anyone to choose their actions based on fear of being murdered by a mob of vegans, because that's not how real world society operates.",

By buying massive amounts of dead animal products? Do you not see the irony? Do you see what your own actions do to contribute to that? Sure you may be adding a vegan option, vegans are grateful for that. \n\nBut what you're doing is just describing the current status quo. You're not justifying it. When you get down to the morals here, any justification for supporting the meat/dairy industry, is weak. \n\nYou say we that we can't wait \"until literally everyone is vegan\" as if that's what vegans expect. Nah man, it's one person at a time. We all have at one point, taken some responsibility for how we spend our money and what we consume. \n\nMy point is don't just sit here and describe the scenarios in which everyone's happy at your restaurant. Why don't you, in the vegan subreddit, JUSTIFY all the animals you pay to have killed, so you can serve them to people. Because I don't think you can.",

If you buy the local / organic / grass-fed stuff then you are contributing to deforestation. Cattle need a fair amount of land space to graze, and there simply isn't enough land space on the planet for everyone to eat pasture-raised red meat at our current rates. Factory farms are, of course, also horrible for the environment with regard to their emissions and tend to be even worse for their local communities. There is also the issue of ruminants being emitters themselves.\n\nThe only way to cut back the harmful effects of red meat production is to eat less red meat (until lab grown meat hits the market). If you eat factory-farmed meat then you're contributing to all of the adverse effects associated with factory farms, and if you're eating organic / pasture-raised meat then you're contributing to deforestation.\n\nThis doesn't even get into the ethical issues associated with meat production.",

Like you say, the best thing you can do firstly is to transition to a plant-based diet - a vegetarian saves around 175 animals each year and a vegan even more, so that in itself is pretty incredible. \n\nOther than that, the next step is to get the message out there to as many people as possible - in a compassionate, pragmatic way. I know that most of the world would be horrified if they realised what goes on behind closed doors in farms and slaughterhouses.\n\nThanks for offering to support our work. You can do a number of things! \n\n* You can subscribe to [our newsletter](http://go.animalequality.org.uk/subscribe_reddit) to keep up-to-date with our current campaigns and also follow us on social media. Then basically share, share, share as much as you can, so even more people see our investigative footage and campaigns. \n* You can also become an Animal Protector and carry out simple, quick and easy actions that have a huge impact for animals -  [https://animalequality.org.uk/animalprotectors/](https://animalequality.org.uk/animalprotectors/). \n* Once we’re no longer all self-isolating, you can also get involved with our 360 VR iAnimal project, which shows the typical lives and deaths of farmed animals. We take it to universities, festivals and conferences up and down the UK and it’s a really great way to fine-tune your outreach skills too. You can learn more about volunteering with us on our website here: [https://animalequality.org.uk/volunteer/](https://animalequality.org.uk/volunteer/)\n* And, of course, if you or any of your friends were in a financial position to do so, you can also donate - we rely on the generosity of the public to help fund our important work. \n\nHopefully our paths will cross another time :) enjoy your activism!",

I know, realizing that you contribute to that suffering is a hard pill to swallow. I had to face that fact after 19 years of being a non-vegan myself, and it was not a pleasant feeling. But the good news is, we have the power to change that. It's never too late to become vegan and fight for animal liberation. If it seems too daunting for you, there are resources to help you, such as the one I've linked in my comment.",

"comment": "It amazes me that alarmist think I am just too dense to understand the science, and that I am so awful a person that I just don't care about my own children, or grandchildren, or anyone else for that matter. \n\nI'm certain my kids and grandkids who already exist, will be much happier with the environment supporting much more plant life. They have all been shown to observe nature to better understand how our actions can have positive or negative effects. They all also never submit to consensus views on anything. They are all very astute critical thinkers. Our car ride games were thought exercises where the solution could only be found by utilizing everyone in the car. Or complex ideas where some presented pro arguments and others presented cons. Then roles were reversed. So none of my kids, or GKs suckered for the Covid scare, mask mandates, AGW, peer pressure at school, racism, gun control, religion, or BS from their friends. They see through every scam, because it's obvious. \n\nThey are well aware of the many studies showing higher CO2 density substantially improves most plants growth rate. The studies are good to quantify the cause/effect relationships of each to improve greenhouse yields. Because forest, and grasslands expansion and leaf area density increased 20-30% globally, from 40 years ago. So it looks like this effect was so large it cannot be ignored, but only took 40 years. So I really struggle to understand how CO2 can be demonized. \n\nLet's guess it's due to a warming effect. So why would warmer be bad? I don't know of many species, plant or animal, thriving on an ice sheet. Why do receding glaciers cause angst. Plants need water, and more specifically, liquid water. \n\nDiabetes is a fun analogy. What if the government issued food pyramid turned out to have been the cause of your diabetes? What if the recommendations they provided favored grains, cereal, and bread, ignoring scientific studies but instead enjoying cooperation with cereal companies. Perhaps we learned politicians family members had board positions, or stock options, or some means to profit with the company. Then the government forced the public schools to meet these requirements; cereal for breakfast, not eggs. Less meat, more pasta, rice, bread. They demonized eggs and meat, then claimed vegetable oils are healthy but animal fat is not. But then decades later an epidemic of diabetes, fatty liver, heart disease, vascular problems, and a host of other problems. But don't worry, there's a cocktail of drugs to coax your systems into mitigation of symptoms, and other drugs to lessen side effects. Then we learn this entire government food plan was based on only one cholesterol study done on rabbits. And even today, the most recent food pyramid insists you should eat mostly grains, but finally now specify whole grains, but then they promote corn, soy, sunflower, peanut and \"other\" vegetable oils. It's as if they think all vegetable oils are fine. Where are the studies showing exactly how each affects the liver? They continue to promote margarine, but no mention of real butter. \n\nNow several of my friends and colleagues were diabetic, or had coronary blockage. But they went to wholistic doctors instead. After much analysis, they've reversed diabetes, and have reversed coronary blockage, one reversed memory loss symptoms. Each had a specific diet to follow, but in common were red meat with fat, no bread, no pasta. Only canola or extra virgin olive oil but animal fats preferred. Real butter. Whole fruits, no fruit juices. Only whole real food, nothing processed. One friend had a quantity limitation but not the others. A few had previously failed heart stress tests, but now pass with margin. They are all much thinner, their skin improved, joints stopped hurting, none are taking any meds. How can this be explained?\n\nI don't have these problems but if I did I'd do the same. Why is the medical community not studying this evidence? There are a few doctors trying to get their findings shown. Their studies are blocked from publications, they are not conforming to the consensus, the science is settled; I think we recognize the tactics. \n\nYes Diabetes is a great analogy.",

What if you’ve known him for years and you called him on the phone to talk to him about some child molesting case you were just heard about and he said, “I don’t really give a fuck lol?“ Would he still be your friend? For me I don’t see any difference between someone who doesn’t care if a child is being molested versus someone who doesn’t care that another sentient being is being brutalized and murdered. And as far as you’re trying to force him to become vegan or force your veganism on him, how many TV commercials, magazine ads, billboards, etc. do vegans see every single day of every single year pushing animal flesh & their byproducts down our throats? iI’s like the heterosexual that complains because they see one LGBTQ+ couple on a TV show in an entire season when the LGBTQ+ see heterosexuality shoved down their throats every single day of every single year for their entire lives. My point is, he’s not a healthy companion to have in your life. You can hope that he will change but you can’t expect him to change. And if you’ve known him for this many years and he hasn’t changed by now, my guess is he never will. I’m sorry but that’s just how I see it.",
