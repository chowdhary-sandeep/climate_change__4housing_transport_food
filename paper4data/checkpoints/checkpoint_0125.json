Probably the best thing about the ELR is the design and 'head turner' factor... I valeted (valet'ed? no idea on this grammar/spelling) the ELR one night at a high end outdoor mall with a bunch of nice restaurants (The Domain in Austin) and the valet said he'd \"park this bad boy right up front\"... so yeah, it's got that 'baller' factor to it where it's parked up with the maserati's and high end mercedes, but for the money I'd get a Tesla any day.",

This is more of a competitor to the Leaf chademo chargers. Right now there are very few SAE combo chargers installed in the US(none in my state) so rolling out chargers is just BMWs way of trying to catch up. \n\nI test drove an i3 earlier this year and the salesperson pointed out that the car can fast charge with the SAE combo port and I asked her what plans BMW had to get chargers installed and she said that BMW was working with a group of other manufacturers to get them installed. I said that sounds like design by committee and doomed to delays and failure. \n\nIt is good to see that BMW is doing more to support their EV, but this falls well short of targeting Tesla.",

The ultimate goal is to sell 300 cars per day or 109,500 cars/yr. To put Tesla's sales numbers in perspective, Americans will purchase 17,000,000 passenger vehicles in 2015. That means Tesla supplied 0.003% of the new passenger vehicles this year. Point three of one percent  of sales is not representative of a revolution, nor should there be an automatic assumption that any of what Tesla does can be scaled up to become a revolution. \n\nTesla is a much admired car manufacturer for the rich. Until it proves otherwise, this is the case regardless of its stated plans/intentions/hopes/dreams. \n\nThe challenges for widespread EV adoption transcend unit cost, charging and power grid issues, there simply isn't the manufacturing capacity and/or demand for EVs on a large scale. There isn't any realistic plan for Tesla, or any other EV manufacturer to go from building, distributing and supporting a few thousand cars to millions and millions of cars over any kind of short timeframe.",

"comment": "Hey thanks! I'm glad the owner community is pretty enthusiastic, I'm also on Myrav4ev.com and everyone has a lot of good advice to offer there as well. I've found the range is actually very good if you feather it, I've only needed an extended charge once to get from Orange County to Ojai (south of Santa Barbara). I did end up getting a 40 amp Juicebox and I think it was definitely the way to go. Anything less would be too slow, especially when I have to top off in between errands. I've heard a lot of great things about the J-demo conversions but I don't want to drop that kind of money on my car. I'm more concerned about getting the extended warranty (I already had some warranty work done only 1 week in!). I'm going to try to pay this car down as much as possible so I can sell it or trade it in for a Model 3 whenever it comes out. Truthfully, the only reason this car is as cool as it is - is because it's got the Tesla drivetrain so it's only logical that I use it as gateway for an actual Tesla when the time comes. To be fair, it is a great gateway though...",

"comment": "Tesla's Destination Charger program *only* provides the $500 charger for free. Installation costs are the responsibility of recipient. The only restriction for receiving one is that the destination *cannot* charge for electricity (charging is free). (The destination is still allowed to charge for parking.)\n\nAs such, Tesla's hardly losing out on anything if other EVs charge. As the site argues, it's hardly fair to call it unethical when Tesla owners routinely charge on other's infrastructure like J1772.",

The SE models now have an option for the 7.2 kW charger (you'll be able to charge twice as fast at most L2 charge stations).  The SEL models come with the 7.2 kW on-board charger as standard.",

It's just speculation but my guess is to not disrupt Formula 1, given the fact that if both had similar performance, F1 would become irrelevant for developing technology while the world is going all electric and they're stuck with low electric range hybrid technology that belongs in a museum. FE has to increase the battery pack and increase both range and performance, it is artificially kept low at this time and it's obvious.",

I still believe in superchargers connecting cities, not in cities.  I know that is whats happening, but thats to cover the future flood of Model 3s.  \n\nhttps://electrek.co/2017/07/16/tesla-supercharger-la-las-vegas/\n\nThis is a reality, 40 stalls, to connect cities.  This is what I mean by a gas station style, vs destination charging which you are describing.",

For me to put my Model 3 on the network, I need to realise $0.40/km (Australian dollars). To put a Model S on the network I'd be looking at closer to $1/km. We will see how it goes, but as it stands a Model 3 is a very expensive car to use for a cab.",

It's like they are thinking 80% of the growth in the EV space will already have happened by 2025 and after that it flattens out. That makes no sense. \n\nEither EVs will fail and will keep hovering at 1-2% market share like CNG cars do today (which becomes less likely every day) or they will replace almost all ICE cars. There is no place for a scenario where they will just stay at 20 or 25% market share forever.",

We invest in green energy and innovation, promote our tap water, encourage to use less electricity and water (half of the bills make up for tax on the amount you use, every home has a meter), subsidize isolating homes, subsidize solar panels on homes. Tax reduction for electric cars, low emission zones, crazy prices for gaz per liter, heavy investments in bicycle routes and public transport, no factory farming, national awareness campaigns about waste, plant trees, a concrete stop starting in 2040, ... \n\nWe're doing our best and proceed to do more. It can always be better! We're a tiny country though.",

Ford needs help from other companies to build an EV truck. GM had to source out much of what is the Bolt, particularly the design team.

If the cells used were of some sort of standard size (like today's Lithiums are) it might not be a big deal to reconstruct the pack. It could be an interesting project, but the \"...not very electrically knowledgeable\" part, I don't know.\n\nA cooler way might be to convert the thing to Lithium cells, but then there might be issues with the charging and regenerative braking, which are designed for NiMH cells. Li cells might not play well.\n\nWhile it might be a fun restoration project, considering what the Vectrix was, it might be cheaper just to buy some sort of modern ebike.",

Wonder if the 4680 model y out of Texas are better \n\nYour phantom braking might be related to malfunctioning camera.  Hopefully once Tesla gets these issues sorted it'll be headache free as mine has been",

"comment": "My God, \"sailing\" is a great name for that. I would adore a car that defaulted to old-school cruise control when no pedal was pressed. But I'm not aware of any vehicle that does this.\n\nI think Tesla introduced it to teach drivers about regen, and it is moderately more convenient than using two pedals, I think, but I personally do get a little leg crampy constantly using my foot like that. Maintaining a constant speed means keeping your foot permanently flexed at a certain angle.\n\nBut even Teslas now have disconnected what's going on with the pedals and what's going on with the drive train. In the cold when regen isn't fully available, you can have it automatically add in \"braking\" to keep one pedal driving consistent. Similarly, it will periodically activate the brakes even when lightly slowing, just to keep them dry and rust-free.",

Making me worry about any product delivered by his teams. Laying off a huge chunk of engineering. Scheduling an impromptu meeting to get explained all the code bases in a few days. Changing the name to Titter then X. Using Saudi money for it. Firing the content moderation automation team. Pushing for his own tweets to be ranked higher. Blue checkmark. List goes on and its been little more than a year.\n\nBetween Cybertruck and asking for a multi-billion compensation package, I can't trust the long term state of Tesla. Bad management and questionable cost cutting everywhere, with cars that only Tesla can service. Hertz selling their entire fleet (bad sign and also devaluing the resale market even more).\n\nThe racism is the cherry on top. As a customer now it looks like you support his views because he is way more attention-seeking than any other CEO.",

Your/Irena budget is an overestimate in that China is spending less to do more.  Bottom line is that it displaces extortionist energy.\n\n> How does paying rich folks to buy EVs or rooftop solar help medium/low income apartment dwellers to afford an EV or gas costs raised by carbon taxes, already high in Europe?\n\nAnyone offsetting their pollution helps not pollute others.  Adopting EVs assists the technology/cost curve to bring increased affordability in future.  Europe gasoline taxes have very small \"carbon price\".  Europe doing better job than US on charging infrastructure.\n\n> How does helping China's economy with solar panels & lithium/cobalt processing & EV car purchases help Western manufacturing jobs?\n\nCertainly trying to help domestic EVs is an option.  But buying value from an alien is still getting value.  Americans being enslaved to extortionist climate terrorists is not going to make the planet or American lives better.\n\n>  At some point you run out of rich people to buy EVs & rooftop solar.\n\nCalifornia example is utilities with corrupt government support suppressing home solar.  Instead of more private homes paying for solar with payback, affordable by rich or poor, only richer people can now afford solar + batteries to save on utility bills.",

All of these questions impact the answer without any consideration of string inverters:\n\nAre you an installer? Will you use an installer, if so, will they be a solar contractor or a general contractor? Is the installation residential? What is the project size? Do you want an internal conduit run? Is the attic space accessible? Do you prefer to front load your project cost? How important is online monitoring to you?  What about storage and when might you want to do that? Do you have a solar array already installed? .... and I'm sure there are others.\n\nIn terms of cost, equipment, and performance, SolarEdge would usually win. But DC != AC, and AC has many design and development advantages which DC lacks, especially for retrofits, architects, and general contractors. So typically, I recommend Enphase if forced into a situation which requires module-level electronics.\n\nI know in the debate of module-level electronics vs. string inverters only, I've changed my mind many times.",

Which is dependent on supply and demand, with china currently providing a glut of supply  and under cutting the competition to oust western opposition as they often do. \n\nOnce the supply starts drying up, prices rise. You can't expect solar panels to simply continue to drop exponentially *assuming* demand was to pick up.  \n\nEdit:\nNot to mention that once demand drops for coal, other FF, supply starts to build up. This drops the prices for coal and other FF making it again cheaper than solar. Currently China is buying up coal by the boatload because the UK and netherlands couldn't do away with it fast enough. \nNow though that they're finding solar and wind alone can't provide as advertised, guess who they're going to have to buy coal from?",

"comment": "I believe the venture capital industry is buzzing right now about home battery storage as having a breakthrough that will change how we get energy in the next few years. Pretty soon, it is going to become both economical (and aesthetically beneficial) to put a big solar array on your house and a battery in your garage. This will be for the common man, for everyone, worldwide. Power lines that right now snake through neighborhoods, rich and poor, will be torn down because they are not visually appealing, because they're dangerous, and because they're unnecessary.\n\nLithium battery technology will have adapted to the point where a battery electric car will be more economical than a gasoline car. Renewables will continue to grow exponentially.\n\nThe real issue now is figuring out if we can stave off climate change by seeding the upper atmosphere. Read Citi's report on climate change that was just released. It's not going to be that bad, but we gotta be right on this save. We also have to figure out how to suck out a shitload of carbon from out atmosphere.\n\nColleges really should start offering a climate engineering degree now, in my opinion.",

"comment": "I am in Illinois, have a PV system on my roof, and have helped design and install PV systems in Indiana. I am very familiar with net metering regulations here (IL) and many other states, but oddly, not so much with Indiana.  \n\nThere is some good info &amp; advice from others here, but some not so good.  For one, of the states with Net Metering regulations in place, there is no \"wholesale\" price buy back for surplus.  In fact, the term Net Metering evolved as an alternative to early on utility policies of selling at retail, buying at wholesale.  \n\nI agree with others - to NOT install more than used annually.  Oversizing the array and being a net producer (annually) in most states with Net Metering regulation in place will result in simply losing the credit a year after it is produced.  I understand there are a few utilities around the country that may send you a check, but I know of none myself, and having utility employees from Indiana in my PV training classes, I am pretty sure none in Indiana as well.  \n\nFor my own system, I undersized it.  For the few hours in any given month where my system generates more than my home's baseload (mid-day, no one home), a credit line shows up on my monthly bill, and the value is deducted from the bottom line.  \n\nThink about it:  If you end up being a net producer of power supplied to the grid (annually), that would be tantamount to your system being a utility - so logically, subject to the rules and regulations placed on being a utility.  Fair is fair.  Does your brother want to be another Indiana utility company?",

"comment": "Before you start, if you are going to roof mount, be sure you know the age of your roof.  If it is older, you may want to address your roof before installing panels that have a 20+ year lifespan.  It would suck to have to take it all down prematurely to redo your roof.\n\nChoosing a system with a good inverter and roof rails and all the odds and ends is a pain if you piecemeal it yourself.  I recommend you consider a kit with everything you need minus electrical to go from the panels to the meter.\nIn your situation and with the trees you have, it might be worth it to go with microinverters.  They are more expensive, but easier overall to deal with and could be more efficient in your situation, as each panel generates independently as opposed to a string of several panels working together and only as strong as the weakest one that is getting shaded to go to a single inverter.  (Think of it working like a set of batteries.  Better performance if you are using a matched set, one weak one will bring down performance of the set.)\n\nInstalling the panels is a bit of a pain until you locate the first truss, after that, just mark the center of each truss and pre drill for your lag bolts.  It goes really fast from there.  The panels are awkward, especially on a severely sloped roof, but nothing a couple buddies and beer couldn't knock out in a day.  \n\nMost kit suppliers will provide you with engineered drawings for your system that you will follow for installation and your electrician will follow for electrical and your building dept will need for permitting.  Get this done first so you can get your permit.\n\nHire an electrician for the hookup once you have your panels mounted.  This should take him a day to complete for you.\n\nSubmit for inspection and then submit for hookup with your power company.\nDoing all of this yourself is not too bad at all, and will save you a ton of money over paying a solar installer that does all of this for you.",

This is a common retrofit option for solar + batteries, but can be problematic when taking the home 100% off-grid later. \n\nYou also need to consider overall system \"intelligence\". Are you simply going to be switching between the genny + solar, with the batteries in between them? Or is the solar connected in parallel with the genny? How are you going to keep control of the system? \n\nYou could make the system dumb, and not use the solar array with the generator. Or you could make the system smart with digital controls to land in parallel. Whichever wiring configuration you use has nuance, and I don't know if the industry is mature enough to have established a standard design practice.\n\nAre you going to use batteries? Or dispense with batteries? Have lithium ion caught up to lead acid? \n\nWhat about consumer electronics? Are there any HVAC units which can freeze ice during peak production, to avoid any HVAC load later? \n\nHow much of the generator/battery/inverter/home smart-controller is really necessary to move forward with the project? \n\nHow does this all fit into code?

You'd never call the military \"progressive\", and yet they recognize the tactical advantages of energy self-sufficiency and fuel efficiency. Libertarians have supported rooftop solar as a free-market alternative to government-supported monopolies.

"comment": "Feed in tariffs are awesome. You consume none of your electricity on site and are paid on production only. The likely issue is either a faulty revenue grade production meter or the solaredge monitoring being off. this would be a solar installers issue first to check the software reporting package in your system. If no fault is found then if the revenue grade meter is at fault it is repaired by the owner of the meter. I do not know where you are located so check with the installer to see if they or the utility installed it and have them perform a running diagnostic to see if it is functioning correctly. It is concerning that you are always low and if you have a problem it would be better to get it addressed quickly. 30 years loving solar!",

Some of them CAN provide a single dedicated outlets that is normally off, with power.   This outlet has to be dedicated and will only provide 2kw of power IF there is sufficient light for the production AND the inverter is manually switched in to secure power mode.  It will have to be manually switched back when the grid is back to start production.  \n\nThis is just a sales gimmick, if you really want backup power then get a bimodal system.",

"comment": "&gt; You have zero data to suggest any price for hydrogen at Nikola's refueling stations. \n\nI was specifically talking about the price of hydrogen, not Nikola fleeting initial offering of hydrogen that is sure to expire because they can't possibly sustain the costs.\n\n&gt; Because they don't exist. \n\nNikola didn't invent hydrogen production from splitting water. It's old technology and we know the energy required. It's not going to be competitive with electricity.\n\n&gt; Yes, today you pay a lot for H2 because there are so few locations. \n\nHow many billions of dollars do you think Nikola can afford to spend to provide free hydrogen? Run a calculation, say their fleet is 100000 trucks and each consume 2 100 kg tanks per week. How much money is that per year? They'd go bankrupt.\n\n&gt;When Nikola builds out their stations using renewable energy to generate H2, supply goes up, price goes down. Genius, right? \n\nCompared to Tesla that will spend 1/2 to 1/3 on energy generation to service the same number of trucks going the same distance per year. Alternatively they can build 2 to 3 times more stations for the same price. That's the advantage of higher efficiency from well to wheel.\n\n&gt;All you need are solar panels or wind turbines, an electrolyzer, and a source of water to generate H2 literally anywhere in the world. Cheaply.\n\nIt's cheaper to do the same with electricity and skip the loss in energy to convert the electrons in molecules and back to electrons. That's the point.\n\n&gt; Even cheaper than buying electricity through the grid.\n\nEven cheaper to not...you know what, if you can't wrap your head around the idea that hydrogen is a terrible form of energy storage, you can't possibly hold this discussion.",

"comment": "There are certainly situations where it is true that paying you retail prices makes economic sense but I don't think that is anywhere near universally true. If it was just you then there wouldn't be an argument. But what percentage of power consumers becoming net metering power producers does it take to ruin the economics of the baseload provider? It is a complicated question that goes beyond simple \"Net Metering is \\[Good|Bad\\].\" \n\nThere are even (rare) situations where the value of the power that you're putting into the grid is negative. For example, a cool, sunny, weekend day. The baseload grid is right at the baseload level. None of the big consumers are doing business. No one is running electric heat or AC. The power company could be paying you for power that they don't even want.",

Sounds like each problem is the other's solution: desal plants take enormous amounts of energy but run best during the midafternoon, when we have an excess of solar power.

The cars are rated for around ~900 cycles before you see the same level of degradation (based on the 18650 cell degredation chart). Conversely, the cars can output 300kw of power but a single power wall has a sustained output of 5kw (peak of 7kw). \n\nAgain, I could be wrong but the difference in useage pattern is significant. And how would you feel about replacing your car after just 4 years vs your powerwalls at 10 years. Bigncost diff there.",

"comment": "We do not normally refer to that as an incentive.  We call that net metering with excess production.  \n\nSouth Carolina offers a state tax refund of 25%on top of the federal rebate.   In addition,  we have net metering for 12 months mandatory from the two large utility companies.   Excess credits in November are paid out at the wholesale avoided rate (i.e. .04 vs .12 retail).\n\nThe longer the net metering the better savings you will get.  In my area,  I make most of my solar in March, April, and May.   I then use it in July August, and September.  This is because the heat makes my solar panels less efficient.  The extra sunlight is offset by more than the efficiency losses.  So net metering with credits really help me make the payback I need.  Batteries would not help this scenario because it is so long (months) till I need the power. \n\nGood luck.",

Expect to pay anywhere from $1.50 - $2.00 per watt extra for the structure, not including the solar. \n\nI know an installer that does work like this, but they only operate in California so pricing may be different depending on what state or country you are in and the local costs for materials, labor, and taxes.",

But if you discharge that battery 80+% every day, you're looking at an 8-10 year life.\n\n*You* may not be so concerned with doing that because how often are you going to discharge your battery past 80% DoD in a vehicle application? Probably not often. *I*, on the other hand, am using the battery to backup my house when the sun isn't shining. If I got an LFP I'd likely be doing an 80% DoD nearly every day.\n\nIt being a \"home battery\" or \"car battery\" doesn't matter at all except for how it's cycled. LFP is LFP (or any other chemistry) whether it's used in a car or a house.",

You need to find your average daily energy consumption in watt-hours, e.g. a 40-watt lightbulb running for 6 hours a day equals 240 watt-hours. Take every appliance by its rated power, and multiply that by the number of hours that it's on each day. There's your daily consumption. That tells you the size of the battery bank you'll need, and you can multiply that by how many days of independence you want (when there are days of little or no solar input, e.g. heavy rain). Then you need enough solar PV to recharge that battery every day. In theory, you can put up enough solar PV to do that job, but in practice you'll end up with a backup generator to top up the batteries when there simply isn't enough sunlight to do it.\n\nThere's a lot more to it, but your energy audit is the starting point.",

After paying all the extra fees which will make the ROI much longer than the proposed 10 year window.  Once you factor the much reduced prices for the extra electricity you produce, the extra charges for nighttime power, solar panel will no longer make economic sense.",

It seems to me that you get one 13.5kWh Tesla Powerwall for $10500 in the US, installed and taxed and Everything like that. I'm assuming that that's before incentives, if you have those for batteries.\n\nJust as an example I (a solar installer) can get a BYD 24kWh for $13500 (with taxes and VAT) and I haven't even negotiated that. Say $1500 for labor and permits, that's $15000. Add a ~~10%~~ ~~15%?~~20% markup for a days work and it's still only $18000 for 24 kWh. That's $750/kWh where Tesla will cost $778/kWh.\n\nI don't do many batteries since few people here want them (we have a very stable grid and it's not profitable) so I just took the first big battery I could find wholesale.",

I have literally brought up climate change and plastic pollution on so many occasions over the last 6 years.  Nothing has changed.  I’ve talked to them about an in office recycling program, got an electric car, solar panels and getting a battery and not a single one has made any effort to change what they’re doing.  Over the last 6 years we’ve been through hurricane Harvey and a devastating winter storm all climate change related and everyone has been personally effected by those events to different degrees.  And they have literally done nothing to try and change what they are doing.  These are people who have money, are educated and have the means to make actionable changes…and they have done nothing.  I don’t know what it is about but they see with their own eyes and either the problem is so large they think anything they do will not have an impact, or they don’t want to spend money, or they don’t care.  It baffles me but it absolutely terrifies me because I’m becoming more and more convinced that unless some technology is developed to save us, it will continue to get worse.",

This announcement actually doesn't have anything to do with third party installers, just Tesla customers who ordered solar without a powerwall. \n\nThey haven't delivered a powerwall to a third party installer in months... There are 12 month old purchase orders, not just 6 months. Any installer who hasn't already switched away from the powerwall to alternative products has been misleading their clients if they sold powerwalls on anything less than an 18 month installation schedule.",

"comment": "Here are my answers:\n\n1. No\n2. No\n3. Very similar to what it looks like today. There may be some temperature fluctuations, and seas may be slightly higher, but the Earth has looked very close to what it looks like now for 12,000 to 15,000 years, and it's going to stay similar for several thousand more, before sliding into the next glaciation period, where ice once again covers much of the Northern Hemisphere.\n4. I \"am willing to\" and actually have already done quite a bit. Firstly, I've become mostly vegetarian.  I've given up, not only beef, but also chicken, shellfish, and cut way, way down on pork.  Bacon is \"meat candy\" so I occasionally have a bit on my salad, and I will occasionally have sausage with breakfast.  At home, it's faux sausage, not pork, but when I'm out it's darn near impossible to order plant-based sausage.   \nI bought an EV nearly a decade ago, and have bought electric bicycles and kick scooters, making that \"last mile\" drive on highly efficient electric vehicles.  I charge my electric vehicles via my rooftop solar panels, not from coal or gas powered plants. I also telecommute, rather than drive into work.  90% of my time is spent at home.  \nI've also planted thousands of trees on previously cleared and scarred land.  Now, where there was nothing but red dirt, there is a pine forest. Restoring forest lands helps with CO2, but also by giving small forest creatures back their habitat.\n5. I honestly don't think there needs to be a solution to climate change. I think there needs to be a solution to pollution, to over-population, to over-fishing, to light and sound pollution, to habitat loss, etc.  I think \"Climate Change\" will sort itself out without our help.\n6. No.  Well, let me clarify that; I think the projections of ecosystem collapse due to heat related issues stemming from the increase in CO2 due to mankind's burning of fossil fuels is overstated. We have a lot of work to do on reducing our impact on the planet, but I don't think CO2 induced thermal Armageddon is the number one thing to worry about. Where I live the climate hasn't changed enough to notice without sophisticated measurements and statistical models. We have had fewer over 100 degree days in the last 20 years than we did when I was growing up.  Winters are a bit milder, and nights are a bit warmer, but that's not something to panic over.  I'll be dead of old age before the temperatures here change enough to cause a problem.  Also, I don't live in huge cities, and the Urban Heat Island Effect is causing much more thermal related problems than increased CO2. That's a statistical fact that anyone can look up, if they want.",

"comment": "The place I work for does either SolarEdge or Enphase. At this point, I only use SolarEdge if it's on customer request or it's a commercial job. \n\nTheir customer service/support is honestly just lack luster. I probably a dozen enphase systems to every solaredge system out there, and I have to do more support work for the SolarEdges. From my experience, as well as some industry stats I've seen out there, they just have a higher failure rate. If the inverter fails, the whole system is down until the RMA is issued and the re-installation can be performed. I've had several times where SolarEdge sends me an RMA that is a refurb from an older model that was clearly just rotting on a shelf. (When firmware is so out of date the part won't properly communicate with other devices in the system and even their own support has issues getting things initialized.) \n\nTo try and show i'm not just being biased though, SolarEdge does have a couple strong points. They are a lower cost point inverter, even including the optimizers. So if you're trying to trim the cost it's a good option. Additionally, you can squeeze a little more wattage into the system before requiring any main service panel work or your utility's version of a bypass/RMA. For example, with 400W modules, on a 100A main you can fit one string of 13 modules. (5.2kW) You can put a SE3800H on a 100A, but a 3800 can be oversized to a 5.9kw (so long as you have a decent east west split to minimizing clipping.) \n\nSolarEdge is also a good option if you're interested in batteries like a Powerwall, as the power from the panels is DC until it hits the inverter, so the battery can just snag the power before that to charge. You go Enphase and it's AC from the Micro down, so it would require another inversion for their battery (that's why they have 4 microinverters in each Encharge 3.)\n\n\nSo for residential, I tend to push Enphase IQ based systems (it was IQ7 until recently, as Enphase will be pushing over to the IQ8 systems as their primary by end of May mainly due to resource shortages. The IQ8 series is not affected by the shortage due to changes in design.) The MicroInverter layout, while having more points of failure in the system, minimize overall downtime if there is a failure. A micro goes out, it only affects the panel it's connected to. The rest of the system continues operating as normal. \n\nEnphase's customer service, while not perfect by any means....especially since they started outsourcing some of their call centers, is much more responsive anytime I or my customers give them a call. \n\nLastly, for you as the homeowner, the monitoring platform for enphase I feel is much easier to navigate and more flexible. \n\nIt's ultimately a Ford v. Chevy/Apple v. Android kind of argument though. I'm sure others will have polar opposite experiences than I. \n\nThe biggest thing that I saw, is that price point is just high. For the EXACT same system, using SolarEdge and the identical panels, my company would have charged you around 27,300. If you needed a main panel up, that would run you another 2800 plus trenching if underground utility.",

I'm on Long Island, with most panels facing NW and I'm getting way more production than that (14,500kWh) with a smaller system (13.175kW).\n\nAlso, I too have Sunpower (M425), and I got it on a 10 year loan, my monthly payment is $228 for more power..and it's only 10 years, not 20. I get rates are high, but that quote is literally double my price, and the $0.267/kWh number shows, that's insane, that's more that our current electric rates here, is eversource actually that much more?\n\nAnyways, assuming that monthly price is a loan, and they are excluding the tax credit, that works out to $5.95/W...which again is insane. Again, I think you should be paying like half that (I guess I'd settle for taking 40% off it)\n\nAnd finally, if you're space constrained, you need the higher wattage panels. The M420 is 21.7%, if they gave you the M440 you'd probably get an extra 4% offset. Otherwise, you're not getting anything by going with sunpower, the REC Alpha Pure 410 is more efficient than the M420 and will result in more offset. Sunpower efficiency only matters when you get the M430, M435, or M440, REC will actually beat the lower models such as the one they quoted if you ask for the higher wattage panels.",

So if you don’t use them they electrons don’t move. All the sun does is project photons which knocks electrons off their adams which allow them to become free and travel thru a circuit to reach a positively charged adam which they are attracted to on the bottom side of the panel. This is a simplified explanation but the science applies to modern panels.  Kinda the same way a battery works in a since. When solar was first invented they were called solar batteries, then solar cells and now solar panels. They still call them solar cells in the laboratories. The industry adopted the term panel as a marketing tool. I hope this helps",

But we also have our entire system installed on a non-living space barn 100’ away from any other structure. The building is new, insulated and weather tight. It’s was built with a dedicated battery room in mind. We just wanted to live with solar for a year or two before making a battery investment. We thought, if we could get net metering to work, NGrid would be our “battery” and if net metering doesn’t look like it’s going to happen, we can get our own batteries. \n\nWe talked to the installer about removing panels and reapplying as a 10kW system, but then thought about the winter months…. We have 48 panels working for us right now. Having 20 fewer panels doesn’t seem like a good idea during November-March when the sun is low. So even though we’re losing money in the summer, we are closer to meeting our needs year round with the bigger system.",

The majority of homes that I’ve seen and some that I’ve done are 70-80% systems. And yes in Texas there is no law that requires a true 1:1 net metering which kind of sucks. Since that is the reality of electricity here, it’s hard to sell 100% systems as many buyers are interested in short term savings. Which is why the only way we can save people money is by giving them around 3 quarter systems.",

LCC wise (life cycle cost in co2 or energy use by external energy not created by itself).\n\nOn for example electric cars\nWindmills\nSolar panels\nWave turbines in water\n\nNuclear energy is probably one, but it will run out so Im not so interested and cant buy any nuclear power plants as a consumer.\n\nBioenergy is another one I dont like to touch, as it demands using space which could contain food and the total LCC seems insane on that one.\n\nPlease provide complete info if you care to answer, as my comments are temporary.",

Is there an energy bank, does it talk about exports?\n\nI take the statement \"not connected\" to mean never got PTO, which doesn't really mean not connected. Your utility bill should be an easy way to identify if you have PTO (as it would have exports on it somehow).\n\nOther than that, trace the wires (a picture of the entire wall the inverter is on would help a LOT), see if it is in fact connected. If you do just need to obtain PTO, you'd need to check the model number of the inverter and see if the utility would allow it to get PTO.\n\nI want to say the screen being on might mean it's connected, but honestly, that pic looks like a meter, not inverter.",

"comment": "That's the price for lithium ion batteries. Other battery types are still continuing the trend of the past 20 years: halfing the price every 4.5 years in average. I read that grid energy storage becomes competitive at 50$/kWh. I am not sure if this factors in that the gas price becomes more expensive over time, making gas to power solutions costlier and thus battery storage alternatives more viable.\n\nIf I had to make a bet on one of two cases where A is nuclear power technology and B, a combination of renewables with energy storage, my money is on B. My reasoning is that for both types, I've read lots of articles over the past 25 years regarding breakthroughs and new concepts - like SMR technology or using graphene in battery packs. In the end, all announcements regarding nuclear failed while we saw some real development in the battery technology space.\n\nI'm really disappointed with nuclear. I started being interested and following the developments at the end of the 90s, but it's become a track record of broken promises. And I remember how the journals touted how tesla's approach would be a dead end and that the future car would be using hydrogen (another broken promise game). \n\nHere's btw another graph on the topic of how photovoltaic module prices developed and the past projections of energy organisations: https://energiewende.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IAM.png\n\nIt's totally underrated how disruptive wind, solar, and battery developments have been since the early 2000s, and I believe they will continue this for some time longer.",

"comment": "The label \"abolitionist\" in the context of veganism doesn't mean that you \"actively participate in trying to abolish animal exploitation,\" it refers to vegans who don't support increasing the quality of lives of food animals because they think that keeping conditions terrible will cause more people to go vegan. Basically, in a conversation with someone who is possibly considering veganism but says they \"just can't give up cheese\", a non-abolitionist would tend toward saying \"well, give up everything but cheese\" because they care about minimizing animal suffering and recognize that any consumption reduction or quality of life increase is a positive, while an abolitionist would tend toward telling them to go straight to veganism--which in my opinion, hurts more animals than it helps since most people cut out say, red meat, first, then fish, and so on until they're vegan, or go to vegetarianism then veganism, and telling people they're morally wrong unless they go straight to veganism pushes them away as it seems too difficult. Undoubtedly, some people make the jump overnight, but most don't.",

"comment": "Iowa's elected officials are the scum of the earth. When the USDA issued a newsletter that briefly advocated Meatless Mondays:\n\n&gt; One simple way to reduce your environmental impact while dining at our cafeterias is to participate in the “Meatless Monday” initiative. This international effort, as the name implies, encourages people not to eat meat on Mondays. Meatless Monday is an initiative of The Monday Campaign Inc. in association with the John Hopkins School of Public Health. \n\n&gt; How will going meatless one day of the week help the environment? The production of meat, especially beef (and dairy as well), has a large environmental impact. According to the U.N., animal agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gases and climate change. It also wastes resources. It takes 7,000 kg of grain to make 1,000 kg of beef. In addition, beef production requires a lot of water, fertilizer, fossil fuels, and pesticides. In addition there are many health concerns related to the excessive consumption of meat.\n\n&gt; While a vegetarian diet could have a beneficial impact on a person’s health and the environment, many people are not ready to make that commitment. Because Meatless Monday involves only one day a week, it is a small change that could produce big results.\nDid you notice that our cafeterias have tasty meatless options? So you can really help yourself and the environment while having a good vegetarian meal!\n\nThere was intense protest from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which forced the USDA to retract the statement in the newsletter.\n\nIowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said (on Twitter):\n\n&gt; I will eat more meat on Monday to compensate for stupid USDA recommendation abt a meatless Monday\n\nhttp://science.time.com/2012/07/27/why-it-was-silly-for-the-beef-industry-to-freak-out-over-usdas-meatless-monday-newsletter/\n\nThese are the types of idiots that hold office. He is a Senator and his response was more childish than what a middle schooler might say on the playground.",

What would be a typical day? \n\nYou can really get all essential amino acids from a plant based diet, though you do need to include some high lysine sources like legumes.  Here's all the info you need on protein:  www.veganhealth.org/articles/protein Your doctors are terribly misinformed. Some doctors in the U.S. still believe the same crap, too, though I think they're mostly dying out. At least here, doctors don't actually get a lot of training in nutrition. I'm not sure the title there,  but here you'd want to see a registered dietitian for diet advice,  someone who specifically studied nutrition. Make sure they are well trained,  though.  \"Nutritionist\" here means just someone whose job it is to give diet advice,  but not necessarily someone who is trained in it. Again,  not sure the Russian equivalent. If your doctors hassle you,  ask for specifics.  Ask which essential amino acid specifically they think you're missing. I'm betting they aren't even sure.  \n\nI was lucky that my diet change when I went vegan appears to have cured my PCOS. I still have other unrelated issues from before that,  but at least that is over and I'm fine without hormonal pills for it. Haven't had issues with cysts in many years. And thank goodness because I had cysts with cysts and those thing hurt like a $#^/$#₩¥€£₩#$ when they pop. \n\nPCOS is linked to diabetes. It doesn't mean you're diabetic,  yet, but it can lead that way. Animal fats are actually a risk factor for diabetes.  I would absolutely stay away from them.  Instead I would focus on eating whole plant foods.  Make sure you keep uo with a B12 supplement and probably a vitamin D supplement as well given your location (add checking D to your blood work list). I recommend the book Eat to Live by Fuhrman, and check out Forks Over Knives.  Both of their diet plans should help if anything dietary does. Sometimes it might not be dietary, but at least that would be a good try.",

"comment": "Firstly, is the person I'm punching the one doing the murdering, or somebody else? There's a difference between shooting a person who is about to kill five other people, versus shooting a person to harvest their organs to save five people in need of organ transplants. Despite both scenarios involving one death vs five, ostensibly the lesser of two evils, there seems to be a difference. So does the property you're sabotaging belong to an organisation or person who is innocent, or does it belong to one who is guilty, of harm to animals?\n\nSecondly, if I punch this person to stop this other person being murdered, will I just anger them and cause myself and more others to be murdered? Likewise, if vegan activists commit acts of vandalism, will that damage the cause somehow (e.g. legal retaliation, poor public perception of vegans, etc), which may result in fewer vegans, and therefore more animal deaths, in future?",

I think we overestimate how delicious meat is because we've been programmed to think that way 'mmmm juicy meat' but it's actually not that great unless you season it, and I even ate some recently and realise that it's just not that tasty knowing your eating an animal carcass. Vegetarian/vegan cuisine is much nice in my opinion and I've become a far better cook since learning that I didn't have to rely on '*one meat 2 veg*' for pretty much everything I made. Walking past chorizo was hard for about a month but it was actually **very** easy to give up meat.\n\nHonestly now I can make a plant based burger for you that would make you cum immediately.",

They look just like leather shoes, but the tag says “all man made materials.” That’s how the company can sell them at a lower price than leather shoes. For most people, that’s a negative, but for people like us, it’s a positive. They may not be as high-quality as shoes you might find from specialty vegan vendors, but I’ve had no complaints.\n\nI generally buy my belts on Amazon. There is a decent amount of vegan/faux leather belts.",

"comment": "That’s not really true though. Unless you’re just emphasizing semantics. They are different but they can be interchangeable. Something like hibiscus tea can lower your blood pressure as well as the leading blood pressure lowering medication.\n\n&gt; High blood pressure is where hibiscus really shines. A study from Tufts showed that three daily cups of hibiscus tea significantly lowered blood pressure in prehypertensive adults better than placebo, with a drop in the subjects’ systolic blood pressure by six points over the control group. To put that into perspective, on a population scale, a five-point drop may lead to 14 percent fewer stroke deaths, 9 percent fewer fatal heart attacks, and 7 percent fewer deaths overall each year.\n\n&gt;What happened when hibiscus tea was tested head-to-head against a leading blood pressure drug? Two cups of strong hibiscus tea every morning (using a total of five tea bags) was as effective in lowering subjects’ blood pressure as a starting dose of Captopril taken twice a day, but without the drug’s side effects.\n\nhttps://nutritionfacts.org/topics/hibiscus-tea/\n\nFlax seeds can drop blood pressure and cholesterol more than cholesterol lowering medication.\n\n&gt;But those who were unknowingly eating ground flax seeds every day dropped their systolic blood pressure about ten points, and their diastolic, the lower number, by about seven points. That might not sound like a lot, but a drop like that could cut stroke risk 46%, heart disease 29%, and that ten-point drop in the top number could have a similar effect on strokes and heart attacks. And for those who started out over 140, they got a 15-point drop. “In summary, flaxseed induced one of the most potent antihypertensive effects ever achieved by a dietary intervention.” In other words, the magnitude of this decrease in blood pressure demonstrated by dietary flax seeds, is as good or better than any other nutritional interventions, and comparable to many drugs, which can have serious side effects. And they’re not exaggerating about the comparable to drugs bit. The flax seeds dropped systolic and diastolic up to 15 and 7. Compare that to powerful ACE inhibitors, like Vasotec, which may drop pressures only 5 and 2. Calcium channel blockers, like Norvasc or Cardizem, 8 and 3–half of what the flax can do. Side effects include… Compare this list to the side effect of flax seeds–its pleasant nutty flavor.\n\nhttps://nutritionfacts.org/video/flax-seeds-for-hypertension/\n\nThe main difference is that pharmaceuticals often come with a host of negative side effects whereas whole plant foods seem to come with more positive side effects.\n\nThe food in OP’s picture if consumed for 10 days straight could lead a diabetic on the standard American diet to need to take less medication. When diabetics who eat the standard American diet make the switch to the WFPB, many have to go off their medication. I actually work with whole food plant based leaders from around the world who consistently tell me they are able to get off most if not all of their medications after eating the Whole food plant based diet. If you’re eating vegan junk food, then you’re not going to get the health benefits. \n\nSo in summary, yes food can work just as well if not better than many medications. And those eating the whole food plant based diet often reduce their reliance on prescription drugs because it would be dangerous to continue taking cholesterol lowering, blood pressure lowering, or diabetes medications when their numbers improve.",

You don't have to justify a behavior if everyone does it and your never confronted with the reality that there are other options. So when you are confronted with the alternative you get cognitive dissonance which is uncomfortable.  I think ideally we would accept this is a natural step in the process of coming to terms with the ethical problems of animal agriculture.. even though it is frustrating and annoying to get it those comments all the time.  Getting angry isn't right or wrong.. but it is probably counterproductive.  It allows the other person to maintain their internal narrative that they aren't confronting a harsh reality.. they are simply \"trolling a vegan\".",

We're talking about specifically of people that go out of their way to challenge vegans in every interaction outside of vegan spaces (and sometimes in vegan spaces too, mind you) to such a point that is an observable phenomemon.\n\nNot about the non-vegans that might actually be reasonably worried about the health of vegans.  \nNot about the non-vegans that might raise points for an actual conversation about the subject,\n\nIt's about the people that can't go by a post online asking for a vegan substitution for a recipe on a public forum without totally disencouraging the interaction between groups.  \n  \nHave you ever seen a vegan recipe online that might call itself \"vegan ceviche\" just to see that most comments are from non-vegans complaining that ceviche can't be made without fish or something like that, instead of thinking how cool it is that people can live the lifestyle they chose without giving up flavors they love? I use the ceviche example because it's pretty ironic to me that the sauce used to cook the fish in the ceviche is called \"leche de tigre\", \"tiger's milk\", which is neither milk nor from a tiger, but nobody complains about that. Why do they complain when it's \"vegan something\"?  \n  \nWe are talking about behavior that \\*is\\* adversarial and combative, why wouldn't the top 3 reasons of one answer describe that?",

As an example, my quote from the second link is very literally the opposite of your core argument. In fact none of them said you cannot feed them a vegan diet, I'm not sure why you capitalized \"ALL\", this seems to imply you had a reading error four times in a row.\n\nI appreciate your concern for me.\n\nI did not apologize.
