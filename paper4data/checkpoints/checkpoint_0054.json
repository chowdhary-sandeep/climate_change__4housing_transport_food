Some 3rd party companies also plan on adding CHAdeMO to the 2nd gen RAV4 EV and the Mercedes B-Class ED.\n\nTesla also supports CHAdeMO, via an adapter which is supposed to be available anytime now.\n\nThere are over 4000 CHAdeMO stations in the world (according to CHAdeMO.com: Japan 2129 Europe 1327 USA 731 Others 54), while there are 20-30 SAE Combo stations in the US (not sure about the rest of the world, but the # is small).\n\nAs for SAE Combo, only BMW and GM offer it today, and GM's vehicle is just a compliance vehicle.  CHAdeMO could have been the standard, if it weren't for auto manufacturers railroading CHAdeMO.  Just by creating 'doubt', they managed to stop deployment of CHAdeMO stations all over the country.  Some companies now offer dual-tech charging solutions (ABB comes to mind), but they are expensive.\n\nWith Tesla opening its patents (and some manufacturers already using the patents), I can imagine Supercharging becoming a bigger player.",

"comment": "I was intrigued by CCGI when they first popped up-- they were already locked into Coulomb (now Charegpoint) which I felt was the smartest public charger system.  And I still think it has legs, but then CCGI bought ecotality's Minitchargers which sounds cool and if it works it might really put a dent into chargepoint (or lose their good standing with their supplier)\n\nI think the big question is where do you see these in 5 years? New York City is looking at different wireless charging ideas, there's some nice inductive chargers for home garages...  and I still expect some vanadium redox to show up (ok I'm a dreamer, but it's the best solution for any gasoline company who wants to leap into EVs). So will CCGI-- who had once nice supplier (non exclusive) and then bought a tech that *might be* better, but don't have their own R/D stay in the game?",

"comment": "That's some serious creep you got going on there. The point of me linking the article was outlining California's requirements for plug in (vehicles with an MPGe rating) vehicles.\n\nI know what MPGe is.\n\nMy point was the cost of plug-in versions of regular hybrid cars that qualify for federal and state incentives usually cost an extra amount that is almost entirely offset by the incentive.\n\nTL;DR: you already know the following, still putting it in for anyone else following along\n\nFor instance, Toyota Prius. Website says regular hybrid model retails for $24.2k. Plug in hybrid model sticker is $30k (29.9), difference of $5,800. Federal tax incentive on the plug in prius is $2.5k, plus the CA rebate of $1.5k, is $4k, or instead of the vehicle being $5,800 extra, now it's only $1,800 extra. Much easier to sell a \"you'll use less gas\" version for only that much more.\n\nHere's another comparison. Ford C-Max. I'm gonna compare the SEL to the Energi model since the packages are closer than the standard SE model. SEL is $27.1k, Energi is $31.7k, difference of $4.6k. C-Max Energi qualifies for a $4,007 federal incentive and a $1,500 CA rebate, for a $5.5k discount. The Energi is technically cheaper than the non-plug in version, and only $2.1k more expensive than the base C-Max hybrid model.\n\nSo, with my original comments to the linked article, yeah, it makes a lot of sense for manufacturers to put a higher emphasis on plug-in and full electric models as California's requirements are for MPGe vehicles (as in, the plug-in versions and non-plug-in hybrids don't apply).",

"comment": "Yep, me too.  Brings back memories.  Me and my buddy were going to convert a car back in the early-mid 2000s.  He is a mechanic and access to a lift and welding equipment.  I'm a systems engineer and was used to specing odd gear.  We never got around to it though.  We were looking at a gen 1 Mazda RX7, Mazda Miata, VW bug/bus, Geo Metro, Chevy S10 pickup, and a few other cars.\n\nAt first we were going to use Lead Acid batteries because that was all that was available.  We were expecting to add 1,500 pounds to the car, so we were going to modify the suspension.  We expected to end up with a peppy 144v car with a 30-35 mile range, a bit less than my Volt.\n\nI was on the DIY electric car conversion forum one day, and somebody was talking about these new large format Lithium Iron cells from China.  They weren't available for individual purchase, but a group was thinking about pooling their resources and trying to make a bulk purchase.  There were two Chinese companies, Valkary, and Thundersky.  Thundersky, now Winston Battery Co., decided to sell their cells to the DIY EV community.\n\nI was doing the math for our hypothetical EV with these extremely expensive cells, and found that we could easily end up with a car that had an 80+ mile range, if money was no object.  Charge cycles went from 400-600 to 2,500.  2500 x 80 miles = 200,000 mile battery pack, vs. 21,000 with deep cycle lead.  This was long enough to last the lifetime of the car!  They even delivered more power to the controller, and the kicker was that the whole battery pack would be light enough that we wouldn't have to modify the donor car's suspension.  That was a real eye opener.  \n\n[Jack Rickard from evtv](http://evtv.me/) did an [in depth electric car conversion](http://www.youtube.com/user/marionrickard) of a Porsche replicar using the same Lithium cells I was looking at and ended up with a great car that was capable of 100 miles on a charge.\n\nThis Lithium development put a halt to our plans to build our own car.  I wanted to wait until these cells got cheap enough for a mortal to purchase.  We never got back into it and soon Tesla came out with the Roadster to show everybody what was really possible with these batteries.  Eventually Nissan announced the Leaf and Chevy announced the Volt.\n\nIn 2010, Chevy came out with the Volt, and I almost bought one in Washington D.C. to drive back to Cincinnati.  I went out there to test drive it, but the dealership wasn't willing to budge on price.  They were just too expensive.  A few weeks ago, I finally got a low mileage 2013 Volt just off it's lease.\n\nSorry for the wall of words...",

"comment": "What's wrong right now isn't the speed of charging. It's the location of appropriate charging speed. \n\nHome and work can get away with level 1 or 2 chargers. You're there for 8 hours or so, not driving the car. Even at a 6 mph trickle charge, you'll get enough miles to cover your usual commute.\n \nGrocery stores, fast food joints, convenience stores, and anyplace where you spend half an hour running errands is where you put level 3 chargers. The dealership chargers are nice and all, but they require you to sit and wait instead of doing shopping you need to do anyway. The trick here is to put the chargers where people won't sit and wait for the charge. They'll go about their lives and charging just happens in the background without getting in the way.\n\nBeyond that, putting level 3 chargers every 20 miles or so down the major highways would allow you to get out of town, which is one of the major things people cite when they reject EVs. This will give you unlimited range in the coverage area and enough redundancy that if one charger is down, you can still likely get down to the next one instead of having one charger shut down all EV travel because they're 50 miles between chargers. \n\nThis is the plan I would put out for today's low range cars, but it also will work for higher capacity cars. The infrastructure will provide consumer confidence in the technology. \n\nRight now here in DFW, the level 3 chargers are mostly at Walgreens pharmacies. I don't spend 30 minutes shopping at a pharmacy on a regular basis. I pop in and out if I ever go in there at all. As a result I'm sitting in my car instead, NOT shopping. Put it at Kroger and I'd be charging up while I pick up milk and bread.\n\nThe other location is Cracker Barrel. I've eaten at one Cracker Barrel, one time. It's not a place I would exactly say is a demographic overlap with EV car drivers. A level 3 charger at In &amp; Out would definitely be used. Plug in, grab a burger, car's full in the time it takes to finish your fries. You don't even think about charging because you weren't sitting there charging. You were eating a tasty burger. \n\nIf chargers are placed where people already park and live their lives, existing chargers are plenty fast. Granted, I'm not saying faster isn't better. I'll take faster for sure, but even a 22KW charger is going to take an hour to charge a current Leaf. If you're sitting in the car while that's happening, you'll still be miserable.",

"comment": "Well, Tesla could have chosen to make any form factor they want in the Gigafactory when it opens. They are still saying they will choose to use cylindrical and they state benefits in both cooling and in quality control.\n\nVolumetric energy density is not as big of a deal in purpose built BEVs as gravimetric density (specific energy). Certainly in PHEVs and conversion platforms or suboptimal multi-power source car platforms, volumetric energy density is a much higher concern. Therefore, the advantages of prismatic cells probably doesn't translate to real world benefits in a large capacity battery pack for purpose built BEVs with very high specific energy. Getting the right kinds of cooling, dealing with thermal runaway, and driving the absolute cheapest price for that level of performance are far more important for these kinds of vehicles.",

I love trains.\n\n[**Currently there's a single charger in Temple, about 60 miles north of Austin.**](http://imgur.com/FwSGFQu) I doubt there's a big EV market in Temple. That says to me that they're working on laying out chargers along the way. One at the Nissan dealership in Waco and one somewhere in Hillsboro would open it up to EV roadtripping. \n\nAnd as for Tesla, the only reason I don't have a Model S right now is because the car's doorway was too short and punched me in the side of the head every time I got in the car. I was ready to write a check, but I'm too tall. The Leaf had sufficient head clearance. It was a serious downgrade, but if I give you $70k, you're not allowed to punch me in the head.",

How the hell is it \"zero emissions\" if it uses a natural gas-powered engine to recharge the battery?\n\nEven if your argument is \"hey, Tesla's or other EVs are not exactly emission-free either because they charge the batteries with energy from coal, and so on\".\n\nFirst off, at least with those EVs, coal and other polluting resources will be rapidly declining as a percentage of the total charging of these batteries. Tesla's new gigafactory for instance will be powered 100% by solar power. So at least that argument against Tesla's EVs will be completely null soon.\n\nSecond, when people say \"zero emissions\" what they really mean is that there's no pollution *inside the cities* from these vehicles. That's true for all EVs. But it's NOT TRUE for these Nikola trucks and those garbage trucks made by the former Tesla co-founder either (both use the same recharging engine). These will lose their battery charge relatively quickly, and then the natural gas engine will have to be powered on, and that's when it WILL create emissions.\n\nSo my point is that I hate how Nikola and that garbage truck company, too, try to get attention by LYING. At least own the technology and its disadvantages, and keep telling us how \"this is the only way to do it well right now\", but don't try to lie to us about it.",

(32 MPG or 1.9375 gallons per 100 kilometer)\n* One Gallon gasoline produces 8.909 Kilogram C02\n* One Gallon diesel produces 10.151 Kilogramm C02\n* A 84 miles electric car produces 1 ton more C02 at production than a comperable fossil fuel one.\n\n**Calculations**\n\n*How much C02 does (does he?) the Hyundai ioniq safe per kilometer?*\n\nThe Hyundai ioniq produces 135.177  gramm (13.517 Kg per 100 km) CO2 per kilometer if the electricity comes completely from coal power plants.\n\nThe Most efficient non hybrid car produces 172.611 gramm (17.261 Kg per 100 km) CO2 per kilometer.\n\nA 40 MPG car produces 13.920 Kg per 100 kilometer\n\nThe Hyundai ioniq produces 37.434 gramm CO2 less than the Mazda 6.\n\nThis are 3.7434 Kg CO2 less per 100 kilometer than a Madzda 6.\n\nThis are 0,403 Kg CO2 less per 100 kilometer than a 40 MPG car.\n\n*How much kilometer do you have to drive the Hyundai ioniq to produce overall the same amount of CO2?*\n\nThe Hyundai ioniq has 125 miles of range. This means that the Hyundai ioniq produced 1,5 tons more CO2 at production than a comperable fossil fuel car.\n\n1,500 / 3.7434 * 100 = 40,070 kilometer.\n\n1,500 / 0,403 * 100 = 372,208 kilometer.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIf you drive an electric car, which gets the electricity exclusivly from a coal power plant, for 40,070 kilometers (25,043 miles) than the electric car is as efficient as the most efficient non-HEV fossil fuel sedan. Than the electric car is as efficient as a 32 MPG car.\n\nIf you drive an electric car, which gets the electricity exclusivly from a coal power plant, for 372,208 kilometers (232,630 miles) than the electric car is as efficient as a 40 MPG car.\n\n*Note that a 40 MPG car would be a HEV car which also needs additionally an electric motor and a 1-2 kwh Battery.*\n\n*Note that CO2 production of getting the oil -&gt; gasoline to the the \nGas station was not accounted for while the 820 CO2e gramm per kWh did account for everything.*\n\n**Sources**\n\n* http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf (page 21) (1 ton more co2 - electric car)\n* http://www.fueleconomy.gov/\n* https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=38431 (Hyundai ioniq efficiency and range)\n* http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=35982 (Mazda 6 efficiecny)\n* https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=307&amp;t=11 (CO2 per gallon)\n* https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&amp;t=3 (grid loss)\n* https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf (Coal plant 820 gram/kwh)\n* https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf  (Coal plant 820 gram/kwh)",

Those cost 50k+.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Distribution-of-distance-driven-per-vehicle-day-on-days-when-the-vehicle-was-driven\\_fig5\\_279853330](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Distribution-of-distance-driven-per-vehicle-day-on-days-when-the-vehicle-was-driven_fig5_279853330)\n\n&gt;Well, being that when I did go over battery only range (50 miles), I've used less than .5 gallons, or about 20 miles, I easily could have managed with a sub-100 mile range BEV. How I've used the Volt is over 92% as a BEV. That said, I think PHEVs are a better solution than BEVs. No renting necessary for long trips, but can still operate as an EV with a MUCH smaller battery for the vast majority of daily commuting.\n\nYou've used it 100% as a PHEV, because that's what it is. And you didn't buy a BEV because if you did you were concerned about having to bother with renting a gas car on longer trips. Sounds familiar.\n\n&gt;Absolutely, that's the story the media told the public, and that Tesla ran with. Most people have never even seriously considered buying an EV, much less have they done research on this. Perception based on ignorance does not equate to reality. It was also the story before loads of charging infrastructure was installed.\n\nThis is what the public told people doing polls. The #1 question anyone asks about your BEV is \"what's the range?\" polls are uniformly in agreement on this. Maybe, just maybe...you aren't representative of the world? Maybe it's not a conspiracy? Maybe people just need to drive a couple hundred miles once a month for one reason or another?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw, it's absolutely hilarious to me that you yourself did NOT buy a BEV because you found it insufficient for your needs, but you're acting like it totally is sufficient for everyone else's needs. Absolutely priceless. Like the cognitive disconnect is so readily apparent to anyone on the outside, but to you it makes total sense. Amazing.",

"comment": "FYI. there is a r/BoltEV sub. This sub is weighted towards Tesla. Not that Tesla is a bad choice, their cars are great. Every post for buying advice on this sub tends to get many \"you should buy a Tesla\" responses. So if you want Bolt advice, the other sub may get you more direct responses.\n\nAs for Bolt, I bought mine in April 2018, and have put 34K miles (\\~55km). Colorado gets a fair share of snow and cold weather. I have had trouble once, in an ice storm when a UPS truck got stuck at the bottom of our street (steep hill). It was one of my first inclement weather ventures in the Bolt so I didn't realize the torque in L mode would spin the tires as much as it did. I left the car at the bottom of the hill and went back an hour later and tried again in D, and made it home no problem. I have been out in several inches of snow, but suspect after 5-6 inches, it will tend to high center. I made it through the winter in the stock tires, never really felt the need for snow and ice tires. \n\nWith EV, the FWD\\\\RWD snow dynamics are very different. The center of gravity is low and centered so the weight advantage of a FWD isn't really a factor. In fact, you do tend to get a little torque oversteer in the FWD and VW seems to side with Tesla that the RWD probably makes sense in EVs. I honestly don't know, but the Bolt has worked well for me.\n\nAs for the cheap interior feel, I honestly don't mind it. My previous two cars (Audi A6 and Ford Fusion) were certainly nicer interiors, but my main buying decision was economics and not luxury. The seats are not the most comfortable, but they are passable. Supposedly, late '18 and later models get slightly improved seats.\n\nSurely, for trips, Tesla tends to be a better choice. Between the SC network, and faster charge speeds, you will spend less time looking for, and charging on longer trips. Bolt maxes at about 55-57kW on faster chargers. This means, it may take 60-90 minutes to hit 100%, but all EV slow at 80%, so a 45-60 minute stop will generally get you to 80% or better. I suspect GM went on the safe side with limiting charging speeds, for the long term life of the batteries, slower tends to be better. So, compared to a Tesla, you may spend 15-30 minutes longer at each stop but you will eventually get there.\n\nNot sure what DCFC looks like in your area, but in the states, Electrify America is expanding rapidly. I am planning a trip to Arizona next month and started looking on Plugshare about 2 months ago and concluded it was not going to work out. I looked again this morning and two new EA sites have opened, (with 3 more in the works) so it is now feasible to make the trip in the Bolt. \n\nAs others have mentioned, range will take a 20-45% hit in the sub zero temps, the higher end of that with heat\\\\defrost running constantly. But, preconditioning will start you off with a full charge and warm batteries\\\\cabin. On days with modest conditions, I can go 20-30 minutes without heat by recirculating the cabin air through the defrost vents with just the fan and no heat. This has a minimal impact on range. The heated seats and wheel make it comfortable, and a light jacket helps.\n\nI don't know much re: Leaf or Ioniq, I suspect Leaf, with no thermal battery management might be problematic in more extreme temps, it seems a really good fit for temperate climates like coastal CA. \n\nGood luck with your decision.",

Even now, as the first long-haul models come to market, they have about a 13% ownership cost advantage over Class 8 diesels, according to the Berkeley Lab. The gap is expected to widen to as much as 50% by 2030, as the cost of batteries comes down.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“It is very exciting to see that heavy duty trucks can electrify much faster than what is commonly believed,” said Amol Phadke, lead author and staff scientist at Berkeley Lab. “Because electric trucks are already cheaper to own than diesel models, they are creating a financial motive for fleet and independent truck owners to demand more electric options from truck manufacturers.”",

I thought about building just a Signature but heard about someone recently putting in a build order for their car and got an estimated delivery time of December. The dealer said it should be here by October/November if I order now but they couldn't guarantee it (which is totally understandable).  Since I wanted to purchase the car this year for the tax credit, I opted to pull the trigger. The other amenities on the Signature+ are nice but I'm bummed about not getting the audio system.",

If you are Electrify America and a charger fails and the manufacturer says it will take 2 months to get parts, there isn’t much they can do. \n\nTesla obviously is affected by the supply chain as well, but having more standardization and more control over that supply chain helps. And they’re on the third generation of their charger design. \n\nIt seems like EA has had a bigger role in designing their newest charger design, if they can standardize on it across the country they might be in a better position to maintain them, and hopefully they’ve learned a bit about what to improve in the design.",

All around me are individuals who constantly bray about the problems of climate change, fossil fuel use, consumerism, and overpopulation. It's tiresome, in fact, because it's a constant topic of conversation, and the same old story all the time.\n\nThese same people try to vote in the best way they can. But, at the same time, they are hamstrung by their own behaviours: there are a lot of electric cars here, and they think everybody in the world should own one (forgetting that in most places that means that they will be burning coal or gas to create the electricity needed to power them). They jet off all the time on vacation to far flung places, and they continue to want their avocados in January and as much coffee as they can get. Generally people are extremely enlightened and know a great deal about politics in other countries, but we're still stuck on the treadmill of advanced consumer behaviour, because it's always somebody else's fault.",

And more Republicans don't believe in climate change and Fossil fuels affecting the planet. I didn't want a Tesla just because of Musk, but there was nothing in the vicinity except maybe ID4. Car is decent but it's probably be my last Tesla. I don't care if peoples have their own stupid views, it's just wrong when you put them out . But again there are more dumb people to follow, lies so it easier, to hate than just live and let live",

"comment": "If you think energy companies actually produce energy you're mostly misguided because they are only in the energy TRANSMISSION business, due to liabilities, not the power production business. \n\nPeak time varies from state to state and season to season, it's not such a specific problem for everyone the same way. Prices for MW/h will vary from state to state and time to time. \n\nUtility companies are interested in buying power from companies that establish plants to sell power, it doesn't matter when they produce the power, set up through PPAs.\n\nYou are completely misunderstanding the graph you are presenting and how it relates to batteries and utility companies. For example,\n\nCalifornia has eliminated \"peak time\" because of the SOLAR capabilities the state has, not the battery technology. Before all the solar, utility companies would get premium rates for kW/h because there was an increased demand and a limited supply during peak time, but now with an increased supply of energy from SOLAR POWER PLANTS (NOT BATTERIES), they don't have that problem. Grid energy storage has nothing to do with it if you can't produce the W you really need. If it's there, on the grid, all the time, you won't need batteries. You're just moving power with batteries you're not making any...\n\nAlso your graph doesn't explain how Alevo's \"breakthrough\" tech would solve this problem. Building solar plants to increase supply of energy is more practical than building batteries with coal produced energy and charging batteries on coal or whatever. \n\nI mean you look at peak time in solar (10am-2pm roughly- maximum absorption) and this coincides with peak time and increased energy demands. Building a power plant to supply energy specifically for peak time is a dumb idea. \n\nI actually work in solar and I can tell you batteries are gong to become outdated because capacitors will be more efficient, better for the environment, cheaper to produce and hold more energy.",

If someone receives a subsidy from the government and their business fails, do they still get to keep the money, or do they have to pay it back when it fails?\n\nFor example, let's say I get the government to pay me $15,000 to make solar panels, and I invest $5,000 of my own money, so the company has $20,000 to start with. I sell two panels for a total of $10,000 back, it cost me $15,000 to make them, so I am $5,000 in debt in the end and therefore the company fails. However, of the $15,000 in cost, I paid myself $10,000 salary. The business went bankrupt and so $5,000 goes into the wind (presumably), because the business cannot possibly pay that back. Do I still get to keep the $10,000 salary that I paid to myself, giving me a personal end profit of $5,000?\n\nIs there something I am ignorant of, or is this just legalized theft of the taxpayers? I am serious. Do they not have to be personally liable for the missing money from the subsidy?",

"comment": "When you're talking about \"ground fault,\" you mean a neutral-to-ground fault is what you are concerned about?  I am assuming so, because a phase-to-ground fault would trip the breaker.\n\nNeutral is, of course, a grounded conductor.  Current flows along the neutral conductor, meaning there are tiny voltage gradients along the conductor, but anywhere within a reasonable distance from the power supply, the neutral voltage should remain very small with respect to the ground.  Ideally, the neutral conductor will be bonded to ground at only one point, because that avoids any load current flowing through the actual ground.  However, the way it is usually done is to bond the neutral conductor to ground both at the utility transformer and at the main panel in the building.  The effect of multi-point bonding is to allow some of the neutral current to flow along the ground conductor, the ground itself, and anything metal that is grounded.  That's not a good thing, but as long as the neutral conductor stays well-connected, it generally carries most of the current, allowing only a small portion to travel through other grounded paths.\n\nYour diagram shows that the neutral is NOT connected to ground within the generator.  This is OK, but then it must still be connected to ground at another point, so then it is very good that the neutral is not disconnected by the transfer switch, because it must remain continuous to the point where it is bonded to ground in the main panel.  Without this, you would have an ungrounded, \"floating\" electrical system whenever the generator runs, and that would be very dangerous.  High voltages could develop from any current-carrying conductor to ground, possibly exceeding the rating of the cable insulation, and definitely making it hazardous for people working with and using the electrical system.\n\nSo, if a neutral-to-ground fault were to develop within the generator, that would effectively have a similar result to the multi-point grounded nature of the normal power feed.  Small amounts of current would flow through the ground, but otherwise there would be no problem.  And, there would certainly be no effect at the location of your proposed solar system, because it is on the other side of the neutral-ground bond in the main panel.  So even if some current were accidentally flowing through the ground, instead of just in the neutral like it is supposed to, the solar power system would not be affected.\n\nTo put it another way, because the solar system is located between the neutral bonding point in the main panel and the one in the utility transformer, any stray current along the ground would have much more effect on the solar array during normal conditions than during generator-power conditions.  When the generator is powering the load, any stray ground current flowing between the generator and the transfer switch (due to a ground fault in the generator) will go back onto the neutral where it belongs before it even gets to the location of the solar array, because of the neutral-to-ground bond in the main panel.  So, I would say there is absolutely nothing to worry about.",

"comment": "Very much utility specific.\n\nNet Metering is/was an \"introductory\" way for utilities and solar owners to value their relationship.  It was simply the net (consumption minus production) kWH at retail prices, and if you overproduced, good for you.  However, as the solar industry evolved and grew, this is becoming untenable for utlities, and they're trying to find new ways to value solar (fairly or not, depending on the readers experience and the given rate definitions in question).  \n\nYou are very right that there are a variety of methods to handle excess production.  Some utilities have a max $$/month that can be \"overproduced.\"  Others have a % cap on how much consumption can be covered.  Others reserve Fees and Service Charges as un-coverable by production gains, in order to protect overheads costs.\n\nYour best bet, as onerous and malodorous as it is, is to call that beaurocratic mess that is your utility, and try to find someone in the solar program, and ask them, directly, how their overproduction is valuated.  \n\nI'm sorr, that's not terribly helpful, but there's a wide array of ways companies handle that, and I just can't predict.",

"comment": "&gt;  I do like to know how many items within my car work\n\nThen solarEdge is for you with the monitoring capability, or enphase with their monitoring.\n\n&gt; I purposely haven't upgraded my laundry machines because the older ones are able to be maintained by me, a guy with youtube and a handful of tools and basic knowledge.\n\nyep know what you mean there but there are still mechanical parts that can be easily replaced (just surrounded by lots of wires).\n\n&gt; but it would be pretty sweet if somebody made a plug and play system for people to at least start with\n\na few people have tried.  It doesn't meet code and not legal to have a plugin inverter in the US.  Off grid with batteries doesn't have any savings and uses different equipment all together.\n\n\n&gt; Say I want that to be able to handle 14 kWh max... for a single powerwall 2 installation down the road, couldn't I get setup for that, minus the powerwall.   \n\nSure but you would need a SolarEdge StoreEdge inverter which is rated for 7.6kw and has a minimum requirement of 8 pv modules to work.   So even if you just put in 8 modules it is going to cost a lot more to put in the SolarEdge storedge version of the SE7600 than the non- StorEdge version, and you could just put in an even cheaper SE3000 inverter.  So you are paying for future expansion.   That said yes you can do it.   Though you mention the powerwall 2 which has it's own inverter (unlike the powerwall 1) so with that you don't even need solar to have it.",

"comment": "&gt; Moron, you also used 10 hrs a day of sunlight, when there is only 5hrs of good light to be used,\n\nI also said that where I live, in the summer, I'd have 10 hours of sunlight.  Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  I also said that the national average year round is 5 hours.  So, a 2 kilowatt panel using 5 hours of average sunlight gives one 10 kilowatt hours of electricity. That's good for 40 miles of driving, at MY average driving efficiency.  It's good for 30 miles of driving with \"average electric car with average driver.\"  Whatever, that's still enough for the average US driver, with a bit more than 12,000 miles of driving per year.\n\nYou can claim all you want that electric cars don't work, or that solar panels can't collect electricity, or that one would have to have 100 times more batteries than gasoline for equivalent range.  What I'm showing you is that this works today.  It actually does work. Your claim that \"it isn't ready\" is simply wrong.  You are saying that what I've been able to do for the last two years can't be done.  There are thousands of people actually doing this, so how can you say it can't be done?  \n\nThe costs line up, too, even if you refuse to believe it.  Post as much crap as you want stating that it's impossible.  I am about to drive my electric car to my father's house.  I will use about 1.25 kilowatts of electricity to do that.  Get over it.",

"comment": "OPV is basically a piece of plastic, liquid processed, roll to roll...  I just don't see silicon approaching that cost potential.  China, or anyone else might try to artificially depress the price of silicon to drive out the competition, but I don't think $0.30 is realistic in the long term, and even if it is, the infrastructure needed to hold the heavier, more rigid panels in place will control the cost anyway.  Solar for the side of a home, would have the same problem.  You need to package each panel, support each one so they wont fall and connect them all together.\n\nThere is a turning point where the preserved lower light efficiency of OPV, the extreemely low infrastructure costs, the low cost of production, the potential for rapid production pace, will make OPV the better option for some existing large area applications and many new ones.  Not just niche.  We probrably disagree about where that turning point is.\n\nBut hey!  Time will tell!  We need different people pushing different things if we want to find the best solution.\n\nI'll leave you with this.  Imagine some wires extended from one skyscraper to another with enormous OPV sails (with holes for wind to pass, and at an angle (preferably towards the sun) for rain and snow to slide off) threaded across the wires.  The OPV sheets have sections of different colors and are all semitransparent so that it makes an enormous image that can be seen from the ground, but also creates that image on the ground as a colored, partial shadow.  The whatever it is, maybe a sports team logo or something, travels across the ground during the day.  The whole thing is a giant art installation (advertisement?) that produces sizable amounts of power due in part to the sheer size of the install.  Do that with silicon. : )\n\nOnce you start thinking about, ok, where can I put photovoltaics if curvature, weight and low light are no longer an issue, huge new markets open up.  Think parking lots, any non load bearing structure, anything you can string wires between.\n\nThanks for this great discussion!",

"comment": "simple, complex regulation. \n\nmost inverters company still have not figured out Arc Fault and Rapid Shut down. since most of these system will be on residential, they will need to hit the ground running with module level electronic with solid communication.  Given past experience, that makes the old timers a little skeptical. \n\nIt will be very difficult to install a powerwall to the new NEC 2017 without module level electronics. Today, there is only one company that can make MLPE profitably... \n\nEnphase is about to release 6th generation and Solaredge might be on its 5th generation and both companies have their sporadic issues. \n\nMy experience with Tesla and the Powerwall is that they are not always the fastest to understand and meet regulations.  For example, It cannot be installed in NYC because it does not meet NYC regulation.\n\nEven is they announce an inverter in 45days, they will need solaredge for at least 1yr, probably more. \n\nIn short, can Tesla make their own inverter, Absolutely.  Are they patient enough to wait? probably not. Those batteries need to be sold and factories needs to be filled and they just spent ~10% of the company to buy Solarcity.",

"comment": "I have alot of experience in different aspects of solar for good and bad companies. Smaller companies in rural areas will eventually be targeted by the \"national\" PPA style companies. I'm actually from Houston but have worked on the east and west coast installing, site Auditing and eventually running operational offices. I take back saying you will get destroyed, you might make it but my advice would be to become a dealer for a reputable solar manufacturer (like SunPower but a less expensive product would likely be more profotable.) Avoid doing PPAs period. They will ruin your reputation and you will be out of buisness as soon as the tax benefits or regulations for solar change. Do loan and cash deals, maybe some leases but those aren't great. Solar is simple but it has been convoluted by confusing contracts that are scams which you may not realize until 5-10 years into your contract. I am actually working on starting an agricultural solar LLC out of central cal. If your interested, I could speak with you about your concerns.. I'd love to see honest solar being brought to texas!! BTW vivint solar is about to open an office in Austin and SC is headed there soon too according to people I know at both companies. These guys do door to door sales and lie lie lie.",

I agree with Rocksteady2r that having microinverters or solaredge's will REALLY REALLY help with your shading issue. I am not so worried about 8 panels having partial shade - the hardware is cheap enough that moving up from 24 to 32 makes sense.\n\nOne key point though - make sure your stringing is smart. Do you have three 8 solar panels string? Mainly, is your back batch isolated from your front batch? The back batch dealing with the shade could have a negative influence on the front production...unless of course - as mentioned above - you get solar panel level electronics to manage shade/strings.\n\nCool image.",

"comment": "Both power companies out in Phoenix are working on battery storage pilot programs. Neither are up to the challenge yet, though they are getting better. And both use turbines to generate that increased demand for power after the sun goes down, since they can't ramp any of the cleaner sources fast enough. If I had to guess, it's because of the difference of people mainly being at work during the day, needing to power 1 building to cover electricity for large numbers of people vs when they get off, go home and all turn on tvs and ac. It can be fixed with better storage, but as I said previously we're still running off phone battery technology as the most advanced for production in scale. I'll take a look at the Germany link, but as far as the US, I don't think we're there yet. I'm not eager to be proved wrong on pride, but I'd rather be wrong on this.\n\nEdit: just the first thing that jumped out was that solar was helping reducing the cost of peak mid-day demand, which is true, then the amount of power they produce in other ways during the day is less. They still have to produce at night. I may have poorly explained what I meant due to an imperfect understanding. They still have to be able to accommodate demand at all other times solar isn't working. The duck curve is about the energy we have to produce in other ways due to lack of storage.",

"comment": "&gt; Jeff Juger, business development director of JinkoSolar, said the $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese products “do not impact our operation in Florida because all the cells we’re going to import (to the plant) come from Malaysia.” And to deal with tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported solar panels earlier this year, Juger said the Florida plant would take advantage of an exemption that allows U.S. manufacturers to import 2.5 gigawatts of tariff-free cells for use in manufacturing solar modules at American plants.\n\nMy point is that because of the additional tariffs that Trump is likely to put on a host of Chinese products (*outside* of the pre-existing solar tariffs that you get 2.5GW free of tariffs), Chinese cells might become more expensive.",

"comment": "&gt; Financing a $35k purchase will cost you more in interest (40% more, to be exact) than financing a $25k purchase\n\nWell that is one thing I agree with, but you're arguing the mythical $25K car again, not the reality where most people buy off the lot and buy at sticker price. I've already said the most apt comparison would be a REAL-WORLD $29K Camry Hybrid LE. Excluding the documentation and dealer fees from BOTH cars I calculate a real-world difference in interest of about $500 over 5 years or more like 20%. But if we want to get into TCO like that then we would also want to include oil changes and so on (which BTW I heartily disagree with 10K mile oil changes as proposed by you, preferring a 5000 mile interval after driving for many years and actually doing oil analysis on a number of my cars). \n\n&gt; Many people considering a $35k Model 3 would be just as well served by a 2020 Corolla sedan, in terms of cargo space and passenger space\n\nBecause it has 10 cubic feet less of passenger space and 2 cubic feet less of cargo space? You are arguing different classes of car here, mate... the Camry is the competitor, not the Corolla. But it's obvious you've made up your mind. Someone might buy the Model 3 because it fits their use case and they actually need more passenger space rather than the fact that it's a Tesla.\n\nOil is not a limitless resource, and supply chains aren't impossible to disrupt. Technology has improved in oil extraction but that's just pushing the problem further down the line rather than actually dealing with the fact that oil will become uneconomic to extract at some point, and the price of oil and therefore gasoline is probably going to dramatically increase in price VERY suddenly. \n\nThing is, it doesn't even have to happen on a national level. Earthquakes and flooding can interrupt the supply of both oil and electric to an entire region, but electric is far easier to restore and source. As I said I could cover my garage roof with solar panels and still be mobile while my neighbours are waiting in line for a few gallons of $10 a gallon gasoline. Not likely where I live, granted... but there are plenty of regions where this could happen.\n\nAgain, it doesn't fit your needs and doesn't fit your world view. Great, don't buy one or any electric vehicle (and for the record there are plenty of good options other than the Model 3; Kona EV springs to mind as well as the Leaf, i3... pick your poison). But don't be under the delusion that because it doesn't make sense to you it won't make sense to someone else. 5 years ago I never would've thought an electric vehicle was in my future as I'm a die-hard petrolhead… but recent developments, studies have led me more to the mindset that my next car will be electric.\n\nFor your reading I have gathered [a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/constancedouris/2017/10/24/the-bottom-line-on-electric-cars-theyre-cheaper-to-own/#3845b5a610b6) [few](https://www.mdpi.com/2032-6653/8/4/996) [references](https://www.hybridcars.com/5-advantages-electric-cars-have-over-gas-cars/). But as I stated earlier it is of little concern to me... I merely wished to provide commentary to what I viewed as misinformation.",

It is \"fine\" (I've since added an additional, non-financed/leased system to add capacity).  witha  big caveat:\n\nFor most people, simply buying a system, even if financed, is more WAY financially sound. (that is kind of the WHOLE REASON THAT PPA/LEASE works as a business model - the profit margin for these companies is this spread)\n\nSunrun mostly seems to exists as a vehicle to market to people who aren't considering solar on their own: Show up at the door, say \"I can save you $100 a month on your electric bill and you can pay us $70 instead, 25 year term\". And on those very narrow terms, they are a fine deal.\n\nIf you include the option of financing a competitively priced system, the math often works out more like: Cut $100 from electric bill, pay $85/month... for 10 years then $0 forever after.\n\nAlso, the lease/ppa structures are much more hassle when selling house than just owning the system.",

If you have 10kW of panels on a 5kW inverter, your capacity factor goes way up because you can get 5kW even on a cloudy day.\n\nYou can compare it to basically any other technology that has become commonplace.  At first when they were expensive, people went to great lengths to make maximum use of cars (taxicabs), televisions (theater/pub/family viewing), even bread-baking ovens (the town would have only one baker).  But now all of those are made cheap enough that everyone has one, or several, idle most of the time so that they can use it at a moment's notice.  \n\nThat extra 5kw of panels doesn't really do anything unless the whole array is getting only 50% sunlight, but that happens often enough it can still be worth it.",

"comment": "Now is a great time to switch to the solar industry, especially as an installer. This is because the current federal incentive is available for another 2 years or so and interest rates are at historic lows. So if you’re in a state that has a net metering program and the market you’re in has high electric rates, there should be lots of potential for solar. Despite the global pandemic, 2020 had the most solar installed than any year ever. If there were another lockdown, being laid off in the industry really comes down to who you work for. Reputable, local companies may find you as too much of an asset whereas the bigger companies that operate in multiple states may think twice. So it’s really about what company you would want to work for and if it’s worth their price.",

"comment": "In my opinion it is not anti-solar. I am an electrical engineer that has self-installed a residential enphase PV system and passed code inspection the first time. I also understand what other states such as Hawaii have done and more importantly, why they did it.\n\nI know analogies are not the strongest argument, but one needs to be used. If you raise chickens in Florida should you be able to sell the eggs back to Publix for full retail? No one is saying you can't make your own electricity for you r own use, they are saying you can't ask to have them pay a fair rate for all the generation capability 'just for night time or in case a cloud goes over.\n\nIn my opinion, there are three facets for net-metering, long term refund, monthly rollover, and daily in/out.\n\n* I just got my statement with the yearly credit from Duke Energy, and it was 129.000 kwh at 0.03665/kwh, so $4.73. So losing that facet of 'net-metering' is no big deal.. \n* The second item of Net Metering,  being able to carry from month to month like rollover minutes, I estimate that could be about a hundred bucks a year savings, and therefore not a deal killer either. \n* Daily in/out from the grid is a bit of a bigger deal if they charge about $0.15 for the stuff I get from them and give $0.03665, then that makes a bigger impact, and would make batteries have a ROI... a 10KWh battery for 30 days is 300KWh, probably 200KWh of 'usable', which at a $0.12/KWh diff, is $24/mo or $288/yr and would take about 12-15 years for the battery to pay for itself, but then you also have full battery backup when power is down...\n\n\r  \nBottom line, when they stop giving you 1:1 daily credit for your elec fed back in like Hawaii does, batteries are a no-brainer... right now batteries are a luxury.",

If the meter is showing anything at all it has power, so between that and the pwoerwall there has to be a switch/fuse/breaker interrupting power, or the powerwall has power and is not happy with the quality of it.\n\nIf you reboot the powerwall, in the user manual there is a specific sequence - are you following that? If so, and if you really can't find any interrupting switches between meter and PW, might be time to call Tesla support.\n\nEDIT - some breaker designs can appear ON when actually tripped, so it's worth resetting any tht are between powerwall and grid.",

"comment": "I think standard 4kW systems are typically around £6000, so you shouldn't be looking to spend over £24,000 for the panels themselves. Obviously brand and efficiency will change that. But I found most are around the same efficiency regardless. 25 years is typically quoted as the lifespan of most solar panels, although if they are washed / cleaned, and if the inverter is changed I think they can last much longer. From what I read typically lose 1-3% power after first year then 0.8% power for subsequent years, presumably down to general wear and tear. Depends where you are, but could be worth looking at wind turbines too. In the UK it makes sense for a lot of places, and you don't need planning permission for smaller turbines. Best of luck though, I am happy you have found your forever home!",

"comment": "Investing in the stock market is a wholly discretionary activity. 100% unnecessary to day to day survival.\n\nBuying power is not. \n\nSo comparing paying less for something you HAVE TO BUY no matter what to investing in stocks is a non-starter. Owning stocks is not necessary for your survival. Having power … and thus refrigerators, freezers, heaters and air conditioners … is necessary for a comfortable day to day life. \n\nAlso, stocks can go up in value, but they can also crash and you can lose 6% or more just as easily in a year or a decade. YOU HAVE TO BUY POWER no matter what. There is absolutely no guarantee your investment in the market will make ANY return. You could lose all of it. \n\nPaying 50% less* for something you have to buy no matter what is a GUARANTEED ROI, not a gamble. \n\n*assuming a system is priced competitively for your market and you purchase with cash, 25 years of power from solar should cost about 50% of the cost of power from your local grid assuming a 1% annual inflation in the cost per kilowatt hour of that power.\n\nI have both a paid for 36 panel solar array and a robust stock portfolio. I bought my solar first. Build your foundation strong by reducing monthly expenses and securing the giant tax credit so you can invest in the future.",

"comment": "Another point about EVs that doesn't seem to have been covered yet here is that as the grid gets greener, every EV that's charging from it gets greener. The same cannot be said of ICE cars. They start out dirty and continue dirty until their dirty lives end.\n\nBut it may be a better strategy to focus on the money.  EVs are much cheaper to operate, especially if you pair them with other green technologies like solar panels. For example, my Chevy Bolt gets 4.1 miles per kwh. In my state, a kwh costs 24 cents, which is about double the national average. That's 6 cents a mile. With gas above $4.50 per gallon, a gas car would have to get 45 miles per gallon to have operating costs of 10 cents per mile. And of course I'm not paying for oil changes on my EV.  And I'm not even really paying the 6 cents per mile, because almost all of the electricity I put in the EV comes from home charging, and it's effectively free because it comes from solar panels which have paid for themselves. I pity my poor neighbors and friends who are shelling out $80 every week to fill their gas tanks.\n\nIf after going through this argument your family members still come at you with \"but EVs are bad for the environment\", ask them \"since when did you care for the environment?\" and point out that their whole political party and movement has long advocated \"drill, baby, drill\".",

I bought one made by an electrical engineering student in Sweden. It can make the BMS, controller, inverter, and motor all work together. This will be used for an EV conversion project.\n\nAnother example is Dala, he recently released an open-source software package that works with a programmable microcontroller for making a Leaf battery pack's BMS work with an solar inverter so the battery pack can be used for residential backup power.\n\nSimilar work has been done to Prius systems, especially the inverter, so it can be used with other motors.",

"comment": "I'm very late to this, but I've had this tab open for a little while meaning to get a response together and wanted to note something:\n\n>And how do we make the same decision on a global level? Isn't the option to go vegan a privilege when so many people struggle to survive another day?\n\nPutting solar panels on your house is a privilege. Buying organic produce is a privilege. Buying plastic-free alternatives to products is a privilege. Owning an electric car is a privilege. Living in a walkable and bikeable area so you don't have to drive at all is a privilege. Not living in  a food desert is a privilege.\n\nPrivilege is a useful framework for understanding social stratification and oppression in our society, but dismissing a person doing something that's better for society, the planet, animals, etc. as a privilege is a deeply unproductive way of viewing things. People who are struggling to make ends meet are often in a position with more limited options, and I don't judge them for doing their best -- I just try to make the world a better place so no one has to struggle in the first place. That's a privilege, but if I chose not to utilize it because not everyone can, would I actually be helping anyone? Or would I be surrendering responsibility to do better even though I can?\n\nI think that when it comes to causes, there's a very real risk of \"perfect is the enemy of good.\" There's a lot of bad going on in the world, too many for any one person to tackle all of them. But if everyone were to pick a few causes and fight for them, then we'd get a lot farther than spending too long trying to figure out the absolute most useful causes before we do anything. When it comes to doing the right thing, it's often better to do something imperfect now than to wait to try to do it perfectly later.\n\nI can make a lot of arguments as to why I believe veganism is a useful place to spend my energy. I can point out that in addition to animal welfare concerns, there are huge environmental concerns surrounding animal agriculture. That it's using huge amounts of water, land, and resources which could go directly to humans instead. I could point out that all the soy that goes into cattle feed could instead feed a lot more people than the slaughtered cows will. I could point out that animal agriculture results in a whole lot of methane emissions, contributing to climate collapse. I could point out that animal agriculture is a major contributor to the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I could point out that animal agriculture is a major source of zoonotic diseases. And then I can point out that it's something I personally do, that I have to get food and feed myself anyway, so it's worth it to me to put in a bit more effort in order to minimize the harm my food does, especially given that I genuinely believe that animals have emotions and it's wrong to harm anyone who can suffer if I can just... not do that. And literally all of that is true! But honestly, if it's in the context of \"So, how do I justify personally focusing my energy on veganism when human societies are in such a state? Even if I do both (help animals and help humans), when I act for veganism am I not choosing animals over humans?\" then I feel like it's not even worth pointing that out, because that involves accepting the idea that it's an either/or proposition. It's not. You can do a lot of stuff.\n\nWhich wraps back around to:\n\n>Absolute Code:  \nI find that vegans I know, in person and second-hand, have a near-absolute code. For example, if one would get pizza delivery but the cheese seems like it might not be vegan, they would rather throw it away rather than eat it themselves.  \nI worry that this absolute code, in the long term, causes several of the negative behaviours I have observed from vegan media: be it self-hate when one fails to uphold their code, a feeling of superiority against people who do not have or have failed to stick to their own code, an attitude of misanthropy (e.g. \"We really are the worst species\"), a general cult-like mindlessness of the \"we are all doing the right thing, you should too\" vibe.  \nI also worry that I will not be able to avoid posing an absolute code to myself as well, possibly falling into the trap of such behaviours.  \nIf you have had these worries, how have you dealt with them? Is my perception possibly flawed as an \"outsider\"?\n\nHere's my personal suggestion: just don't do that if you're worried about it. There's a whole range of vegans, from those who would never knowingly eat an animal product to \"freegans\" who consider it acceptable to eat animal products that would just be disposed of anyway. Most of us fall somewhere in between. I tend to fall more towards not eating anything that an animal has died for even if it will just \"go to waste\" otherwise, but if it turns out that the restaurant put butter in my rice, then I'll see if anyone else wants it, and if not, well, that's life. My number one rule is not to judge anyone who's trying their best. Some people will gatekeep veganism, but that doesn't need to impact whether or not you choose to follow the vegan philosophy at all. Only you get to make your own decisions, and if they're not good enough for some purist who only accepts vegans who exclusively eat pesticide-free crops they've grown themselves in till-free soil with vegan soil amendments, well, then don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Just do your best, and don't fret too much about whether it's good enough by someone else's standards.",

"comment": "My situation is very similar and have the exact same question: is it worth it.\n\nI also live in SoCal and have SCE. I use close to 5,000 kWh a year (ave~400 kWh per month). My bill is generally a little less than $2000 per year (on a Tiered Schedule D rate plan). Most of my electricity usage is in the afternoon/early evening. I don't own an EV and no plans to significantly change my usage in the future. I was curious about solar and possibly a battery under this new and confusing and strange NEM 3.0 so got a couple of quotes.\n#1 Solar Only\nSystem: 4.10 kW, Estimated Prod: 5,696 kWh/year, Installed cost: $8,000 (after tax credit), ROI: 5.5yr\n\n#2 Solar + PowerWall\nSystem: 4.10 kW, Estimated Prod: 5,696 kWh/year, Installed cost: $19,000 (after tax credit), ROI: 11.8yr\n\nI saw the Solar Only ROI and want to pull the trigger. But maybe those calculations are off. What I have read about NEM 3.0 makes me think the 5.5 year ROI is shorter than it should be and the 11.8 year ROI is longer than it should be - but maybe they are correct. Can anyone shed some light? Are these calculations still using NEM 2.0 data to predict ROI? Anyone with a NEM 3.0 bill?  Is there any easy way to pull usage data from SCE?",

Mounting solar on your house has so many significant negatives, artificially inflating your real estate taxes, inflating your insurance premiums while limiting your eligibility for many insurance companies in the first place, is far more difficult to clean, maintain or repair, permitting issues, hoa issues, etc etc, whereas ground mounting has so many positives and is significantly less expensive in the long run.\n\n\nGround mounted panels are also physically and 'legally' detached from your home, so if you want to you can take the system down, cleanly uninstall the equipment and bring it with if you move.  Almost every location in the US you need an additional permit and inspection after take down to make sure that your home roof has been fully repaired. (A process which can cost a couple thousand dollars by itself.)",

"comment": "I work for a solar company one of the largest nation wide (not trying to sell you) but yes a lot of the time companies can include a reroof and/or a tree removal and “include” it into the price of the system and still have your solar payment (which will now have “adders” being the tree removal and the reroof) and have it be less than what your currently pay on average on your current utility bill. Sounds too good to be true but the catch is 1. You have to put solar panels on your house / property and 2. You go through a finance company that takes the loan over for you, they claim what would’ve been your tax credit / incentives and apply the full amount needed to keep your rate locked in and pocket the rest which is how solar reps get paid.",

Likely still yes (otherwise nobody would be able to sell a PPA), but nowhere near as good as having an owned system\n3. Whether or not you buy the system, it's grandfathered into NEM for 20 years\n4. Your NEM arrangement with SDGE is independent of your PPA arrangement with Sunrun. You can use however much electricity you want at any time of year. You'll just pay SDGE for whatever your NEM credits can't cover.",

You’ll see both imported and exported energy.\n\n* Imported energy is what you draw from the grid (e.g., during cloudy days).\n\n* Exported energy is what you send back to the grid.\nThe energy independence score measures your self-sufficiency in meeting energy needs.\n\nWhat I've also heard, and I'm not sure how true it is that the Metered version will have much better API abilities. I.e. you'll be able to set an API to for example: Determine when you buy/sell power stored in your battery (buy low, sell high). Have access via the pannel to various energy providers and buy from the lowest priced. Integrate it into your smart home etc.",

By analyzing my bills I dis find that the cost of power has increased significantly and the power company has devalued my reverse power by 3/4.

There are times in the winter when I get minimal sun because of excessive cloud coverage. I'm waiting on some new equipment to start shipping from eg4, that will allow a generator to plug in and charge the battery. It doesn't have to keep up with the entire electrical load, it can just run and slowly give the battery enough capacity to run HVAC for an hour here and there. \n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by backfeeding a generator into your car charging port, but my understanding is that you cannot use generator to charge the power wall.",

We have a fleet of around 3k systems that have sunpower AC modules with the inverters manufactured by enphase, but programed to work with SunPower's PVS5/6 monitoring.  Hoping it won't be a major challenge to swap out the PVS for enphase envoy to ensure continual monitoring.  There would be a cost associated with that option for folks that want to do it, probably somewhere in the $1000-$1500 range.  Product, truck troll, installation and commissioning labor.",

To stop climate change, all that is required is for us to do some combination of keeping the levels of greenhouse gasses below a certain level, and lowering the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed by some other means.\n\nAdditionally, I also said industrial and transportation sectors.  If you are going to use quotation marks, don't leave out 2/3rds of what you are quoting.\n\nThere is plenty of money to be made in energy efficiency upgrades, decarbonization, and renewable energy infrastructure.  Could it get done a lot quicker in a non-capitalist system? Jesus, yes.  Are we likely going to blow past our emissions limits due to capital being uncooperative?  Yes, again.  Could the process be much more equitable outside of a capitalist system?  Yes, for a third time.\n\nI am a socialist.

Veganism is a philosophy against animal exploitation. Reducing it to a diet is like calling su vegetarianism a form of Buddhism or not eating meat on Fridays during Lent \"Catholicism\". The diet changes are but one part of the philosophy and really quite a small one. Veganism isn't just what you do but the reason you do it -- the realization that animals shouldn't be exploited.  \n\n&gt;So there is a movement of people who eat steak and call themselves vegetarian?\n\nI wouldn't call it a \"movement\", but there are enough to drive me a little nuts from time to time ;) \n\n&gt; \"vegan\" is already understood as someone who doesn't eat animal products at the dinner table\n\nActually, I've found plenty of people who have NO CLUE what vegan is. So, I don't think it's time to give up educating people about the true meaning just because some people get it wrong. To the contrary, all the more reason to educate! \n\n&gt;Are you doing okay? I'm enjoying this debate, but I get the feeling you're actually kind of pissed off at me as a person. \n\nDoing fine, thanks for asking. Nope, nothing personal. And thanks for not making it personal.",

Enjoy :)\n\n \n\nWEEK ONE\n\n1 Watch \"meet your meat\" video and cry\n\n2 Go round telling everyone how bad it is only to get allot of rolling eyes\n\n3 Get more angry at peoples apathy and decide to do something rebellious, cut out meat.\n\n \n\nWEEK TWO\n\n1. Realise from your research that you'll have to cut out all animal products.\n\n2. Go shopping, excitedly zipping around\n\n\"no thanks, no meat for me today\"\n\n\"milk, milk, milk, AHH, SOY, thats what i want\"\n\n3. Get home and realise that most of the things you bought have animal in them\n\n4. Decide to go vegan next week\n\n \n\nWEEK THREE\n\n1. Join a vegan forum\n\n2. Do shopping properly this time.\n\n3. Throw away half the stuff you bought that tastes like dry cement.\n\n4. Find the one vegan food that you like and eat way too much of it. Never eat that food again\n\n5. Experience an embarrassing scene at a restaurant with friends\n\n6. Feel as though your a successful vegan\n\n \n\nWEEK FOUR\n\n1. Find out that pretty much nothing is vegan.\n\n2. Find out that that being vegan doesnt help you sleep at night.\n\n3. Suddenly anarchists arent so stupid and that hippy down the road actually isnt as environmental as you thought.\n\n \n\nWEEK SIX\n\n1. Forget that you were ever carnivore and cant believe others stupidity.\n\n2. Go a little too far when explaining animal rights to someone.\n\n3. Become a little bit angry at fat people ;)\n\n4.

Become a bit more clever in how you speak to others about veganisim\n\n3. Begin to sleep a little better\n\n4. Find some awesome new foods\n\n \n\nWEEK EIGHT\n\n1. can pretty much name 300 things that arent vegan, at least 3 conspiracy theories, 5 environmental hypocrites, and 4 diseases caused by animal protein ;)\n\n2. Have put weight back on.\n\n3. Wonder why you werent vegan from birth\n\n4. Appreciate the earth allot more",

I've been eating them pretty much on a daily basis with my breakfast for the last year, and I'm certain that they've played a large role in my ability to maintain my health and my weight. I'm a *very* active person, and one of my hobbies is weight lifting so it's important to me that I retain the strength and muscle that I've gained at the gym. Hemp products (specifically the seeds) have been a godsend in terms of weight management (just check out their nutrient profile!). (I also recommend Hemp milk as an alternative to Soy, Rice, and Almond milk. Check out Living Harvest Temp if you're interested)",

I then discovered a plethora of vegan places in cities like Chicago and San Fran and ate there and did not feel like crap afterwards, plus it was really tasty! I'd been vegetarian before for ethical reasons and I was just thinking about it and it all seemed to make sense. The big turning point was when I'd been back for about a week and had made spaghetti bolognaise mostly out of laziness/habit and was eating it and thinking about it and then just couldn't physically put it in my mouth anymore. That was 2 months ago and I haven't looked back. I just feel like such an asshole for not doing it sooner! It just makes so much sense!!!",

"comment": "If you want something a bit more authentic, [Taco Santana](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-santana-brooklyn) (just a few blocks from my door) is probably one of the best kept secrets in Williamsburg. It's just a tiny little hole in the wall but it's so good and so cheap. I usually get 2 big vegetarian tacos there and a guava juice for a total of $6. They also deliver. A lot of the reviews and people I've talked to about it say that it's really similar to the taco trucks that are popular in California. It's a real bargain, though.",

"comment": "Hey there, congrats on your week of vegan! I totally know what you mean about not eating only veggies and not eating mock meats. I like mock meats, but it's good to know how to cook without them. I used to live in a country with very little access to mock meats so I cooked a lot from scratch (still do), and despite this I probably ate less plain vegetables than other people of my age and gender.\n\nPasta dishes are a great way to explore cooking and eating scrumptious vegan food, as there are endless possibilities for sauces. It may not be as healthy as eating a plate of steamed kale, but on the other hand, it is much healthier than a cheeseburger. \n\nBefore you start your week, I recommend you make a few things in large quantities: \n\n- cook some chickpeas, white beans, or any type you like, and store them in small batches to throw in salads or other dishes. \n\n- make a batch of hummus. this is super easy if you have a blender: blend well-cooked chickpeas, roasted garlic, tahini, olive oil, and salt. Voilà! When you want a snack or a quick meal, you can use this as a dip for vegetables or spread on some bread. \n\n- make a pot of marinara sauce and also store in small batches, so that you can dump it on some pasta when you don't want to cook, or elaborate on it with more ingredients when you do want to cook. For a nice flavorful marinara: sautée onions and garlic (there is no such thing as too much of either), add in mushrooms/bell peppers/capers/anything flavorful, add canned or fresh tomatoes, red wine or lemon juice, fresh or dry Italian herbs, salt and cayenne pepper. Simmer for a while. You can use as is, or incorporate zucchini, spinach, etc. \n\nNow that you have these three things, also buy \n\n- some fruit that you like - you don't have to snack on fruit to be a vegan, you can also eat peanut butter by the spoonful, but since you are also trying to be healthy and lose weight, fruit is a better choice. \n\n- nonetheless, I recommend also getting peanut butter for convenience, you can spread it on apple slices instead of bread. If you are not tight on money, get [this kind](http://ilovepeanutbutter.com/whitechocolatewonderful.html), as it truly is wonderful. \n\n- unsweetened unflavored soymilk for cooking, and also sweetened vanilla soymilk if you want some for cereal or smoothies. \n\n- vegetables that are suitable for a variety of uses, such as carrots; you can include them in salads, sautées, eat them raw as a snack, steam them and eat with a sauce, etc. I think cabbage is also great because it can be made into slaws or thrown into sautées, anyway here it's a question of personal taste. \n\nYou now should have enough things in the house to turn to when you want to snack but don't want to cook. This is important since you may be accustomed in this circumstances to having bread and cheese or something. Now instead, have some bread and hummus, or fruit and peanut butter, etc. \n\nAs to your meals:\n\nWhat do you like to eat for breakfast? For a sweet breakfast, 3 easy choices are vegan cereal and soymilk, smoothies (blend fresh/frozen fruit with vanilla soymilk or water) or oatmeal. For oatmeal, buy it in bulk, unsweetened and unflavored of course, cook in a small pot with some banana, and then flavor with some cinnamon and raw sugar. If you like savory breakfasts, look up tofu scramble recipes.  \n\nLunch: leftovers from the night before; bean salad with hard vegetables such as radishes, carrots etc (that way you can mix in the sauce before going to work and don't end up with wilted lettuce), olive oil and apple vinagar, dried dill, salt, pepper; or sandwiches - some great sandwich fillings are avocado, tapenade, dried tomato, lettuce, arugula, etc...\n\nFor dinner, try making different pasta dishes! You already have marinara, which you can eat as is or bulken up with vegetables or olives. \nOther ideas include: \n\n- sauteed veggies with soy sauce, mirin and cayenne, mixed in with spaghetti to make chowmein. Top with sesame oil. \n\n- blend fresh basil/arugula/spinach or a combination of the above with raw or roasted pine nuts/walnuts/cashews, roasted or raw garlic, extra virgin olive oil, nutritional yeast, salt and pepper. Incorporate resulting pesto into pasta.\n\n- sautee mushrooms with some onion, add some unsweetened soymilk, safran, salt and pepper and allow to simmer until soymilk is reduced. \n\n- sautée eggplant, bell pepper and onion and incorporate into spaghetti with a lot of olive oil. Add a touch of lemon. This is also great in a sandwich instead of with spaghetti.\n\nAnother thing you can make with mushroom is risotto: sautée bolete with onion and garlic, then add in rice so that it gets coated in oil. Add water, veggie bouillon, saffron and vegan white wine. Simmer and keep wetting it with white wine and water. When it is done but still liquidy, stir in nutritional yeast.  For another great risotto replace the bolete with spinach and the white wine with red wine, omitting the saffron. \n\nAnother piece of advice is to look up a vegan chili recipe and if it calls for mock meat simply omit it, as it truly isn't necessary. Chili may be one of the yummiest ways to eat a high-protein fat-free meal. \n\nGood luck and let me know if you want more ideas!",

If only Japan hadn't killed 6 million in that empire building strategy, &amp; Italy hadn't been fascist, then the Allies would have been fighting against totally different nations. Yes, great point... if the Axis Powers weren't totalitarians murdering millions of people, &amp; were different, then the war would have been different. Fantastic history lesson... the Allies were just \"out for revenge\", sort of like the Mafia fighting aliens. Let's get you that history teaching job at a Liberal Arts college right away! -This is why we don't talk history on /r/vegan.",

It's the false dichotomy fallacy that there's nothing in between whole foods plant-based and a horrific omnivorous diet that I take issue with.  How about we limit our refined sugar intake to &lt;5% of calories as the WHO recommends instead of the FDAs &lt;25% of calories?",

It's actually more like a 'Not eating animals for dummies' style of writing than an in depth philosophical treatise, but if you enjoy logic and reason, I highly recommend it. What I like about the book is that once you finish it, it helps you to mentally distill all of the million and one different reasons to go vegan down into one very simple principle. Personally I have a supreme intolerance for logical fallacy based conversation (and this will account for 99% of the conversations directed at you), and this book really helps you to quickly identify them when people bring them up so you can have more productive conversations. Even if you don't plan on being some vegan advocate or even telling anyone, trust me people will notice, and when they do they will by golly want to let you know all about what they think.",

So how would it work as an excuse?\n\nIt's easy to get 2000-2500 (my breakfast alone is like 1000 calories) calories from healthy sources as a vegan, and I'd assume that's enough for at least most women to start gaining weight if they're otherwise not active, so I don't see how the logic in their reasoning.\n\nMaybe it's a budget issue?",

If that's all it is, then how is it anything other than symbiotic to use the eggs of old rescue hens kept on a proper diet where nutrition isn't an issue? I've seen references to them not being able to consent before, but frankly that's anthropomorphising them. Some think that's promoting the industry by buying the old hens, but I find that laughable, the money is in the eggs, it's just cheaper than killing them to let them be rescued. It's not possible for everyone, you'd need a good bit of outdoor space and it would take a good deal of effort too, more than its worth if the eggs are all you care about, but they can be cared for properly and given good lives.\n\nThe same could be said of sheep, give them loads of land, other sheep to socialise with, feed them well, give them shelter; then where is the issue with keeping the old wool they need to get rid of coming in to summer if you shear them *very* carefully?\n\nCows and milk is a bit more shaky because of the reasons you gave, but I wouldn't suggest it can't possibly be done ethically, though I think a reliable, and more importantly ethical, supply would require your own personal farm and a hell of a lot of land, cows and bulls.\n\nThe idea mainly falls down because to do it properly, and only take the excess, would require a lot of effort for a very low return. I read up about a farm somewhere in south England which tries to keep hens this way to make 'vegan-friendly' eggs, and they cost something like 4-5 times the price of organic eggs.\n\nOnly a sith deals in absolutes.",

I talked to her, she had no idea of the cruelty involved in egg and dairy, and she's in the process of going vegan.

"comment": "I cannot recommend any books but I will tell you this- cooked meat is incredibly bland unless you season it. So season your starches, vegetables, and everything else and you won't have a risk of anything being bland. Just took care of your biggest worry! \n\nCongratulations on making the first step to becoming healthier! Before you know it you'll be a pro plant based eater. Stick to the basics, no need to cook gourmet level vegan meals just yet. Breakfast can be oatmeal with fruit and nuts in it, or diced potatoes sauteed with green peppers and onions, lunch can be an easy tomato and pickle and avocado sandwich with plant based mayo and a pasta salad with olives, beans, tomatoes, cilantro, bowtie pasta. Dinner? Rice and bean burritos, broccoli, mushroom and rice stir fry, yellow rice and beans,  mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts, endless possibilities\n\nDon't just cut out meat. Replace it! Don't skimp on the starches. You will be hungry if you do",

I think lots of people train themselves to think about animal issues when they look at animal products and it makes us sad to see them. I dont like to be thinking slaughterhouse thoughts every 5 minutes and I dont want to turn of awareness. so better to just not buy those objects.\n\nit's great to be non-vegan if the cost benefit analysis comes out positive though - the costs might be worth it. there's no need to be dogmatic.",

So nice to see they’ve made a change and put in the effort! Most restaurants don’t realize how much money there is to be made just simply by putting vegan food out there.

Some already vegan options are aglio olio and kimchi fried rice. Mushrooms were a lifesaver for me as their umami can be a good substitute for a meaty flavour. Vegetable broth and sauces are also easy to make and can help a lot with varying flavour.\n\nMy suggestion is to work with what you know first to build up a set of dishes that you can vary throughout the week without getting bored, then start experimenting with new recipes and ingredients/substitutes.\n\nAlso, you're gonna have to get used to reading ingredients lists if you like processed food. I found a lot of things like cookies or instant ramen that were vegan although they were labelled with \"milk\" or \"chicken flavour\" by reading ingredients lists :)",

"comment": "People use medical things as front for not going vegetarian or vegan all the time. \n\nVeganism, by the sidebar definition, is \"a way of living that seeks to exclude, **as far as possible and practicable,** all forms of exploitation, and cruelty to, animals.\" \n\nSo, for example, someone with celiac disease and multiple food allergies (rare case) may be precluded from going vegan due to being unable to get all the nutrients they need to be healthy. This person can stop eating meat/dairy/eggs/honey and have a diet of predominantly bivalves and maybe dairy/eggs, then they would still be considered vegan. \n\nSame thing with certain eating disorders. Outside of anorexia, all the others eating disorders, a vegan diet is practical and possible. With anorexia, I understand that it's very serious and a major health concern. It's up to them, but if they are ever at a point where they've gotten past it, they can look into it. \n\nBut if the reason is that it's purely an inconvenience, then it's the same excuse as everyone else.",

I'm a vegan bot.  \n\n\n-------------\n\n**Your Fallacy:**\n\n&gt;animals not allowed to eat other animal **(ie: Animals eat animals)**\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\nNon-human animals do many things we find unethical; they steal, rape, eat their children and engage in other activities that do not and should not provide a logical foundation for our behavior. This means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. So it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior.\nThe argument for modeling human behavior on non-human behavior is unclear to begin with, but if we're going to make it, why shouldn't we choose to follow the example of the hippopotamus, ox or giraffe rather than the shark, cheetah or bear? Why not compare ourselves to crows and eat raw carrion by the side of the road? Why not compare ourselves to dung beetles and eat little balls of dried feces? Because it turns out humans really are a special case in the animal kingdom, that's why. So are vultures, goats, elephants and crickets. Each is an individual species with individual needs and capacities for choice. Of course, humans are capable of higher reasoning, but this should only make us more sensitive to the morality of our behavior toward non-human animals. And while we are capable of killing and eating them, it isn't necessary for our survival. We aren't lions, and we know that we cannot justify taking the life of a sentient being for no better reason than our personal dietary preferences)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]",

I already knew I wanted to switch to a vegan lifestyle but was procrastinating doing to research nessasary because....well no actual reason, I'm an adult with ADHD and procrastinating things I actively WANT to do is one of my curses. But I ended up at the hospital after a dairy heavy day and discovered I'm deathly allergic to dairy but just had never eaten enough at a time before to have the worst affect. I talked to my doctor and he told me to never have dairy again if at all possible and to only have the smallest amounts if I couldn't go cold Turkey. \n\nI took that and used it to springboard into a vegan diet. I'm still in transition though, and am still making mistakes and finding things I didnt know. But I'm trying and getting better every day.",

Processed foods like crackers and vegan yogurt should probably be cut too. Eat vegetables, a lot of them. Drink water, not soda or alcohol. Hopefully those trials didn't screw you up permanently.",

It's a bit weird for me as I only found out about the concept of antinatalism after having a child. \n\nWhen I initially read about it on this sub I went majorly on the offensive (defensive?) in the comments. I then forgot about it for a while, before coming back to it again via the Cosmic Sceptic podcast with philosopher David Benetar, who's the best known advocate for antinatalism. \n\nSince then I've been down the rabbit hole, reading both antinatalism arguements and pro-natalist rebuttals (and deleted my prior comments for not being sufficient informed). And I have to say... I'm genuinely not sure where I come down on it. I've been back and forth. I think it might come down to whether you fall on the side of philosophical pessimism or not (note pessimism doesn't = depressed). \n\nIt's worth bearing in mind that antinatalism is debated by philosophers. They don't all agree. Whereas I don't know of any serious philosophers who have argued against veganism on an ethical basis? \n\nI think you're right that there is some overlap with vegan ideas, but I think it's best to treat them as two independent philosophies. They should each stand or fall on their own merits, and not be conflated. \n\nI will say if you're an antinatalist but not vegan that seems weird to me. You can't be against causing unnecessary suffering but paying for it at the same time. That just sounds like you like meat but don't want to have kids.",

Which is none!\n \nVeganism is definitely much more popular nowadays &amp; you see a lot of positive new stories on it, but I really don't think most people know or care what it actually means to be vegan.\n\nAnd most polls that I've seen show the vegan population in the US at around 2%. Of course there are polls from vegan groups that show the number of vegans to be much higher,but I'm not sure how valid those polls really are!",

I’ve been this way long enough that I could give AF less about the social aspect. My vegan husband on the other hand is constantly having to explain himself and sit through dinners at steak houses with his less than accommodating friends. It frustrates him but won’t ever break his resolve. He’s entirely a junk food ethical vegan. Just remember- everything you do saves a life. You’re helping to preserve antibiotic efficacy and clean water access/ food access to countless people and animals. You’re doing as much good as you can and that’s amazing. Maybe introduce the vegan challenge to some local food spots and see what they do?",

"comment": "Yea man I’ll be honest, although I’ve been a life long vegetarian, I’ve only been vegan two months and like I’m still figuring out the right approach. For me, like a fuck you to the face is what got me to wake up and be vegan, but I need to understand that that’s not how everyone works. It really sounds like you’re trying to do the right thing. I’d love to send you some really healthy vegan recipes that I think are like crazy good. I’m also like totally happy to talk avout any nutrition questions you have or anything like that. \n\nNow to your point about messaging. I understand from your perspective, vegans come off like pushy assholes and militant, ect. Now, just to get into our head space, put yourself in our shoes. From our perspective, there is an animal holocaust every single day, and no one gives a shit about it. There are 100s of millions of sentient lives unnecessarily taken every single day. and these aren't happy lives. 70% of cows, 98.3% of pigs, 99.8% of turkeys, 99.9% of chickens are factory farmed. And like no one cares. Almost no one gives a shit about these animals, but we see people giving their puppies and their cats love every day. Emotionally, it’s just really hard to deal with. I’m not saying this stuff to point a finger at you at all, I’m just trying to get you to understand the militant vegan perspective. For us, this is an unimaginable injustice that occurs every single day, and all we get for speaking up about it is to be the but of every joke or to be yelled at for being too pushy. Again, that’s just from our perspective. From your perspective, you have struggles in your life, like everyone, and then some asshole comes along, and is like “hey fuck you, take that burger out of your mouth, you’re a literal murderer”. I’m sympathetic to how that comes off, yes that guy seems like a prick. But remember what’s going through his brain, it’s what I just mentioned. That’s a huge ramble, I hope it makes sense, but again, whatever u want dude I’ll slide you some recipes or some literature or documentaries or YouTube vids, whatever u want I’m ur guy",

It worked for us because he was breastfed until 2.5 & then really just wanted to drink all of his calories…it was such a struggle to get him to eat, finally about 5 he started to eat better, like have interest & enjoy more foods than just like a core four that were tolerated on top of shakes. I know this is a common issue with breastfed (& imagine bottle babies too?!) babies so really this could be advice for anyone worried about their kid not accepting eating over drinking their meals anymore! Now that he is a good eater & we don’t have to just rely on protein powder, he does take a multi…I believe the brand is called Renzos? & I do annoying things that plenty of parents do vegan or not like hide veggies within food…blend an insane amount of spinach & beans into pasta sauce, put them on pizza, in wraps, etc. he had blood work in April & it was all perfect, & that was before we started the multi actually, his doctor just recommended one so I got one…& honestly doctors probably recommend them to all children no matter how they eat 🤷🏻‍♀️he is 8 by the way, technically 8.5 as of yesterday (which is a big deal when you’re 8)",
