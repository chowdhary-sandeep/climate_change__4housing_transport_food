You've essentially traded your own lifetime of reflexes and instinct for the equivalent of a student driver you've now driven 10,000 miles with, watching continuously and being ready to step in at any time.

Like I said, if it works for you, that's great, but I think my confusion is reasonable.\n\nEdit: I also disagree that monitoring something and putting your life in danger are different at all, let alone massively different. The entire reason you're monitoring this software as it mediates your car's reaction to traffic lights is precisely because your life will be in danger in the event anything goes wrong.

I think we're coming to a \"I guess you can go into just the decking if you put down 3x as many L-feet\" consensus.\n\nOne note is that most L-feet are slotted, which would allow you to overcome some sag.\n\nMy next thought is that if you lag into every 3rd truss, are you really distributing the loads evenly amongst the trusses? Also, what is the risk involved if your lag is off-center on the truss, or misses a truss entirely? So what are the values gained in \"idiot proofing\" the installation by going every 2' on center, into the decking? Would those values be worth the added cost of the penetrations and flashing?\n\nExpanding on that thought, what is the better practice if both cost the same? For example, I could hire a roofer to put down the L-feet and flash 2' on center. That might be more affordable than hiring the solar installer to lag into my rafters 6' on center... be more structurally distributed... be less prone to failure for missing a rafter...\n\nI've only been thinking about this recently because I have come across a few standing seam metal roof installs where we had to put down the attachment points 2' on center due to the weakness in the roof attachment point. And then I recently came across another metal roof where I did not want to go into the truss, because the trusses are much less overengineered on metal roofs vs. residential shingle roofs. Again, I found myself going 2' on center to design around attachment strength of the roof deck to the truss.\n\nAnd I think there is a legitimate concern that if you go into the roof deck, you might well be increasing the likelihood of ripping the roof off the truss in a tornado-like event, which could blow a huge hole in the \"mount to the decking\" theory.\n\nI think it really boils down to the following questions:\n\n1) How accurate are installers being when they lag into the rafter?\n\n2) Does lagging into the rafter weaken the rafter in any consequential fashion, considering both normal and lateral forces?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0014879772594819467,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24002065911062084,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26886735177201604,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2638221252298081,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11360189618835648,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19395794848922893,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2853049781690457,"solar_1":-0.11999259861150077,"solar_2":-0.043187498235768625,"solar_3":-0.045662791250401194,"solar_4":-0.05202449501401381,"solar_5":-0.10197477750984024,"solar_6":-0.18211260228179632,"solar_7":-0.044088482498179836,"solar_8":-0.06617808395960839,"solar_9":-0.06525495728399733,"solar_10":-0.3044838085433125},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

You're only several orders of magnitude out of what he actually said!\n\n&gt;[1] Injecting sulfate aerosol precursors into the stratosphere has been suggested as a means of geoengineering to cool the planet and reduce global warming. The decision to implement such a scheme would require a comparison of its benefits, dangers, and costs to those of other responses to global warming, including doing nothing. Here we evaluate those factors for stratospheric geoengineering with sulfate aerosols. Using existing U.S. military fighter and tanker planes, **the annual costs of injecting aerosol precursors into the lower stratosphere would be *several billion* dollars.** Using artillery or balloons to loft the gas would be much more expensive. We do not have enough information to evaluate more exotic techniques, such as pumping the gas up through a hose attached to a tower or balloon system. Anthropogenic stratospheric aerosol injection would cool the planet, stop the melting of sea ice and land-based glaciers, slow sea level rise, and increase the terrestrial carbon sink, but produce regional drought, ozone depletion, less sunlight for solar power, and make skies less blue. Furthermore it would hamper Earth-based optical astronomy, do nothing to stop ocean acidification, and present many ethical and moral issues. Further work is needed to quantify many of these factors to allow informed decision-making.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009GL039209/full","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13055561607082686,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28037242893061226,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1539464013459149,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13127445033703983,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1579295521671807,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18571078880225364,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18934543544859767,"solar_1":-0.11343867369595766,"solar_2":-0.17064412241692198,"solar_3":-0.1019516052148896,"solar_4":-0.09186172440949072,"solar_5":-0.1388721529175103,"solar_6":-0.11599228962993877,"solar_7":-0.10969878831911771,"solar_8":-0.043797409315995385,"solar_9":-0.10393861438693613,"solar_10":-0.1686410891252045,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.1796995426458848},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against, specifically against the use of solar power due to less sunlight for solar power being a potential consequence of their proposed geoengineering method.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I believe they're called 10K and 10Q reports. I don't think they break down actual costs of transformers, but I don't have the time or interest to look through them. High voltage LPT's like the ones behind Aria/T-Mobile Arena cost millions of dollars per unit, while the average medium voltage transformer is between $5k to $15k per unit. These prices don't include shipping, installation... \n\n&gt; At what point does the relatively minor costs of upgrading distribution transformers\n\nDefine minor cost. Define when these upgrades will be done - when the unit fails, or during it's normal operation. Is the upgrade something that can be done in the field or does the unit need to be removed and sent to a facility for the work to be done? The initial work of disconnecting and reconnecting the unit must be done by IBEW linemen and groundsmen, but who is qualified to do these upgrades you're talking about? Is this something the original manufacturer does, or is a 3rd party allowed to do it? Does the unit need to be inspected, tested, and certified after the upgrade, if so, by which entities? How long does the process take - will the customer be affected for minutes or hours?\n\n&gt; a public benefit resulting from\na) increased transformer life due to load reduction at the hottest times of day\n\nThat's not how transformers work. They don't get cooler by pushing electricity from the secondary side to the line side. If anything, 3 phase transformers could start getting unbalanced if you're pushing enough back on only two legs. Houses aren't daisy chained together like that. While the ratio isn't 1:1, there's a lot of transformers out there in relation to the number of houses. If you're pushing energy back to the grid, it will pass through at least one transformer if someone in your immediate neighborhood needs the electricity, more so if there's enough to \"avoid powerplant expansion\".\n\n&gt; more optimal use of existing infrastructure which results in avoided cost savings of distribution transformer, substation, and powerplant expansion\n\nConsumer level generation doesn't effect expansion of infrastructure. That's all based on the number of customers and the size of the service on the building, not the actual usage or the adjusted usage because a neighbor belongs to net metering.\n\n&gt; The utility is out there to protect their bottom line,\n\nI agree. The nature of for-profit business is inherently evil, to make more money.\n\n&gt;  environmental cost be damned.\n\nSee the EPA and the Clean Air Act.\n\n&gt; who are coughing up the majority of the money necessary to move our society to renewable energy.\n\nI don't have exact numbers, but I'm going to say that the leased roof space/PPA companies paid for more installs than individual home owners. And that one company is inching toward becoming a utility/service provider in their own right. Buffet and Musk are both billionaires, and neither are in business for the philanthropic aspect of it, otherwise NVE would accept a lower profit, and SolarCity would still be doing installs in the state of Nevada.\n\n&gt; But sure, choose the utility's side and call my \"why should solar owners who use .0001% of the grid pay 100% of the transmission and distribution fees\" argument obtuse. That's cool too.\n\nI may have misread your original intent... not sure at this point, and honestly I don't care. You're not the first person to wrongly accuse me of being on the utility's side, probably won't be the last. We've both ignored enough points from either side and focused on specific details that things have been missed, and I've run out of time for the week.

The sane way is to charge a battery. Then use the battery and leave the array stationary.\n\nThe less sane part:\nSolar arrays have a  complex current/voltage/sun irradiation profile, but the voltage max out. Get a battery  whose operating range is within the array top voltage. Connect the array to a diode to block the current from exiting the battery and a resistor in  series to make sure nothing explodes and it should work. Maybe a zener paralel to the battery for extra caution\n\nThe insane part\nProper solar harvesting will need a DC-DC converter to make sure the voltage is adequate at all sun times. To make it you will need at least one extra capacitor, an inductor and a transistor and I would use a simple microcontroller for data acquisition and simple PI controller implementation  ( the derivative part is overrated).\n\nThe almost sane drivetrain\nFor the drivetrain get a DC motor ( inefficient at high speeds, but really strong and easy to control) and connect it to in series with a kill switch ( circuit breaker ) a variable resistor in series with the DC motor. This set up is dumb, you will probably fry the resistor and the cables, but it could (in theory) work as a small proof of concept. Maybe just connect a weak motor directly to the kill switch and just stutter step along the highway.\n\nThe proper drivetrain\nGet a power module ( a series of transistors, that will get very hot an require a heat sink). And connect it to the battery\n\nGet a microcontroler put the variable resistance in the analog input. They will probably convert to an integer. Lets assume 0 to 31 and call it X\n\nThen  use the microcontroler to activate the power module ( a separate power source is best... :)). For X milliseconds and repeat this process each 32 milliseconds. This is called PWM and will regulate your motor speed as you change the variable resistance. You can even make a easy speed (cruise) control implementing a PI controller ( you will need as speedometer though).\n\nHave fun, and this was meant to be fun and informative.

Literally one year to go! Too bad this isn't in the US though, but I guess if it works out it will eventually come over. Love the concept.\n\nHowever, I do have some concerns about safety due to all their weight saving measures. Plus the range limits it to a commuter vehicle, but that's okay for most households as long as they have a longer range car.\n\nBut if everything works out, the next version of this car (in maybe a decade) will be my dream car! A nice, roomy hatchback with a bigger range (due to battery advancements), better solar panels for faster charging, and of course I'd like AWD and a little more performance. But I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't have bought the current version of this car (as it comes out in 2020) over my Model 3 if the price was attractive, and safety was proven!

And there is always wind blowing at high enough levels to power turbines everywhere!  Of course there isn't.  Which is why we have the grid that you touted.  When places that lean heavily into solar power run short, they pull energy from places that are burning with coal, natural gas, oil, or nuclear.  The grid is the only reason that renewables are even added.  But even still, places that have them don't abandon their power plants either.  They keep them running because it costs a lot of money to buy from outside your grid.\n\n&gt;Hydro-Electric we know is reliable and is powering Las Vegas for years so that’s not surplus energy\n\nYes, because you're going to build a dam in every single major city in the US.  Also, in times of drought or low rain, they aren't spinning the turbines at full capacity making it unreliable.  Hydro is the most stable of the major renewables, but it isn't 100% reliable either. \n\nYou've simply gone on long winded rants proving exactly how unreliable they are.  The US consumes roughly [4.1 trillion kWh per year](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=30).  You would over a million wind turbines running at the [average capacity of 25%](https://www.wind-watch.org/faq-output.php) to supply power to the entire US not account for losses sustained in transmitting that power over distances.  This is just to meet minimums.  You'd need several hundred thousand more to deal with peak hours and gaps.  And that's only if you're placing them on land.  Offshore has a lower generation, so if you tried to split between land and sea, you're looking at millions of turbines.  Iowa, that is covered with wind turbines, only has about [4000 of them](https://www.iowafarmbureau.com/Article/Iowa-is-a-Leader-in-the-Wind-Energy-Industry#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20latest%20(October,counties%20have%20wind%20turbines%20installed.).  They're one of the leaders in wind farming.  This is before you consider the environmental impact [of blades that go into landfills](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/10/759376113/unfurling-the-waste-problem-caused-by-wind-energy).  Solar panels have much of the same problems, but require even more land than windmills, and are more fragile than windmills.  Plus there's the massive amounts of pollution required for mining the materials and creating the things in the first place.\n\nIf you are placing your hat on renewables as a means to combat pollution, you've bet on the wrong pony.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0027809550859577334,"1.1.1_stance":-0.356258627337714,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1591363925244331,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16173683510472378,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1274700398797716,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.018619208596646786,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22717122609416643,"solar_1":-0.10408945817202535,"solar_2":-0.0798091858287916,"solar_3":-0.04492026570175275,"solar_4":-0.03600952614140303,"solar_5":-0.03677933952165057,"solar_6":-0.23811026388041986,"solar_7":-0.1625534182312549,"solar_8":-0.07430545958777657,"solar_9":-0.015099872946699122,"solar_10":-0.07366424350991121,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.06867933482863009},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I don't export back to the grid (not allowed to), and noticed that once the Powerwall is fully charged, the solar panels show as producing 0.00 kW, and the house is running off the Powerwall alone. However, Charge HQ thinks that there's no excess solar, so it never starts charging the car.

Is this right?\n\nI should also note that the amount of solar production exactly matches my consumption. If I go over what the solar panels can produce, then it starts taking from the battery, but otherwise if the solar production is enough to keep up with consumption, then it exactly matches; 1 kW of consumption means 1 kW of production, and as consumption steps up and down the production follows suit.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.054223841056227684,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24704765772649467,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22685705118373783,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20573637707844222,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.302259743525112,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2594196119131534,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10198448544057707,"solar_1":-0.16549355010094532,"solar_2":-0.16758777196302982,"solar_3":-0.2169734441808779,"solar_4":-0.07620057280848869,"solar_5":-0.20907027350383983,"solar_6":-0.07176272678360796,"solar_7":-0.30626817256895905,"solar_8":-0.053913966456261224,"solar_9":-0.13809027619074082,"solar_10":-0.33215397711068284},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

The only possible difference that could make would be to tip the scales against you in a competitive job.\n\nStocking shelves in the average supermarket you will certainly be stacking products of animal exploitation. Even  vets will use medicine tested on animals, any academic job will be at universities that conduct animal testing. There's hardly anything corporate that doesn't have ties to something dirty. If you limit yourself in this way you can essentially only work in hippy co-ops and exculsively vegan restaurants.  \n\nNot that there's anything wrong with those jobs, but what do you think it would do for the image of veganism if being vegan ruled out having any other kind of career? How would  that help animals?\n\nReally, I understand why you're conflicted, but you need pick your battles.

But I tend to agree with her now. When you go vegan, there absolutely *is* a bit of learning curve. Not huge, but you do need to learn a few things. You need to pay attention to B12. To D. To zinc, iron and calcium. To iodine. To omega 3s. In terms of satisfying cravings, you need to learn about healthy fats and umami/glutamate.\n\nAnd vegans shouldn't be afraid to admit this. We always see those studies about people who quit veganism and the top reason is, pretty consistently, they quit for health reasons.\n\nI'd venture to guess many of these \"quitters\" don't know about the handful of nutrients you need to learn how to get. Maybe people know about B12, but they could be eating a diet totally devoid of zinc and calcium. They might be eating way too many omega-6 fats. They might not be eating enough calories in the first place. Yes, this info is online and pretty easily available (I'd plug this easy chart for how to get everything http://veganhealth.org/articles/dailyrecs)\n\nThat's people who have left veganism. Then there are those who are afraid to try veganism. And I honestly think, based on talking to lots of non-vegans, the main reason they don't want to try it is a fear of being deficient in nutrients, with the social 'being left out' element as a secondary reason. When people quit veganism b/c of health reasons, it only furthers that belief. People have this hunch that there's something in meat--protein, or maybe something else--that simply doesn't exist unless you eat meat and dairy.\n\nOn top of that, in my experience, most people know very, very little about nutrition. Worse, many people out there *think* they know about nutrition, but have a lot of misinformation or are falsely confident. This applies to non-vegans and vegans, alike.\n\nI'm not claiming to be an expert. But as easy as it is for us to say \"Oh, that info is easily available on the internet...\" ...we have to admit there are many people out there--smart people---people who know tons about politics, or history, or even a lot about certain areas of science. But they know almost nothing about nutrition. \n\nThe most important thing to do, in my opinion, is when you come across a new vegan, be careful not to overwhelm them, but gradually let them know they should pat attention to a couple important nutrients they might not be getting enough of.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.11528948170396486,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22651712535358048,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.186619814820378,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1774256746363218,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24667106916972292,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2623038455640971,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22352710059483757,"diet_1":-0.16010724587897585,"diet_2":-0.2050045654935179,"diet_3":-0.10566953795235687,"diet_4":-0.0836006406430343,"diet_5":-0.10880026226281142,"diet_6":-0.0522268108521297,"diet_8":-0.03588723384018522,"diet_9":-0.23331790149004825,"diet_10":-0.2808213858188671,"diet_11":-0.09864860176517215,"diet_13":-0.19048287095665944,"diet_14":-0.17283872694959623,"diet_17":-0.12105813547621835},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

The first being to your health, the second to the environment and the third to the animals. \n\nA vegan diet removes that dangers of eating meat / dairy. For example, did you know that eating a serving of processed meat (such as lunchmeat) is the equivalent of smoking 3-5 cigarettes. It's a class 1 carcinogen, up their with asbestos. Unprocessed red meat is also awful for you, and is only one tier below that, being classed as a class 2 carcinogen. White meat has also been linked to many health issues, but particularly prostate issues within men. A vegan diet is shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of developing ilnesses such as heart disease and is shown to drastically decrease the presence of bad cholesterol build up. \n\nAs I said the second is the environmental impacts. Vegans have a significantly smaller impact on the environment. The average vegans carbon footprint is 1/50th of the carbon footprint of someone who eats meat and dairy. Eliminating meat and dairy from your diet is probably the most effective step you can take to alleviate and prevent climate change via the release of green house gases such as methane and CO2 (as much as an individual can). \n\nAnd as I said, the third is for the animals. These animals are all 100% innocent victims of a needless crime. Thousands of animals have their throats slit every day, or heads cut off everyday so we can consume their remains. My counter argument and main food for thought for you would be, do you *really* love animals if you're still contributing to their needless slaughter and abuse.

If there's no animal they would feel bad eating, and no way to explain to them how disrespectful their actions are, no need to bring that up.\n\nSomething similar happened to me (though it was probably a mistake), I asked a few times if something was vegan and was told yes, but later found it was not.

I learned a lot from those hypotheticals, because i'd say about 90% of the people who engaged had clearly thought more about their reasoning behind their beliefs and engaged with me to help me grow. it's only the other 10% of virtue signalling vegans who make facile statements like \"you're not a vegan if you're not disgusted by meat\" lol. (this is the group you're in)\n\nhowever, I would point out the hypocrisy on your of attributing hypotehticals as a carnist trait, while consistently using them to convey your points in relation to ethical comparisons of the original real life scenario I was in. If i was anything like the 10%, I'd say something like, \"I don't deal with ridiculous hypotheticals. I'd never find myself in that situation in real life, so I don't think about it. I only concern myself with real world situations. seems like you just want to argue over silly things\". see how that works? but I didn't, did i. I found your hypothetical intellectually rewarding and challenging. So, i think it's just a case of abstaining to think, being angry and refusing to challenging your views. and you're ironically pulling both of those strategies in one reply lol \" - you're not on a desert island\". you can't have it both ways, as by your own definition, this is \"carnist behaviour\".\n\nyou also talk of morals objectively, which they're obviously not. all we CAN say for certain is there's objective ways to maximise the well being of conscious creatures. your consistent obsession with conflating sexual perversion, with nourishment through food, is a false equivalence:\n\n&gt;So yeah unless you're in this magical situation where its eat roadkill or die\n\nthis proves the false equivalence, as, for starters,  it's not a \"magical\" situation that people in the world MUST eat animals to survive. that is a real world situation for many humans alive today. it's also why animals eat animals. there is absolutely 0 survival reason to have sex with children. while there's a victim in both scenarios, only one of them may be necessary for self preservation. this proves they are not the same, obviously.   \n\n\n&gt;Also child porn doesn't 'only cause harm' - one could argue if the porn already exists and the victim doesn't know they're being wanked off to (or even knows the photos were taken) then who's bring harmed? Not the kid certainly. Still doesn't make it okay to produce.\n\nlol all this proves is there's some more ethical ways to be involved in sexual abuse of children than others. I'm saying that child porn serves no purpose in the grander scope of the world other than causing harm for simple sexual gratification. it's not comparable, and your fixation with child porn is starting to worry me lol","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.054170155664905906,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2520970249390208,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20326364179205836,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19137109863659885,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19010146229209987,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23932560789994994,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2427154943337276,"diet_1":-0.03072965484321344,"diet_2":-0.21750448319740595,"diet_3":-0.06192990914816316,"diet_4":-0.058253701586981774,"diet_5":-0.14980804909828294,"diet_6":-0.16673847020986918,"diet_8":-0.11587836337942765,"diet_9":-0.03861324345780304,"diet_10":-0.051212910778167496,"diet_11":-0.1369581316345375,"diet_13":-0.039532951074458346,"diet_14":-0.1033781589686795,"diet_17":-0.06379225128344729},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I'm happy people are being vegan (especially when for the right reasons - for being ethically and politically aware). I guess I only raise this as a challenge to the extent to which we should live ethically - what *is* reasonable, where should we spend our energy? I have found it harder to be vegan, but easier to incorporate being without a car or phone. That doesn't mean I shouldn't be vegan. \n\n&gt; In other words, the means justify the ends. If I'm living on nothing but the clothes I have right now, throw away my computer, throw away my phone, there is no way that I could sit here and preach socialism along with you right now and get my message out to the world, while at the same time, I exploit the workers that I'm \"fighting\" for. \n\nBut then the ends actually have to be better, and along the way we have to be able to look back and see it was worth it. I'm not sure that's the case - or at least it may be very difficult to prove so. This seems to be just a rationalization, and a perhaps dangerous one at that. \n\n&gt; The difference between using computers, cars, etc. under capitalism and veganism is that there is no valid argument for the means of carnism that justify its ends -- we can do what we're doing right now on a vegan lifestyle with negligible change.\n\nThat may be the case for some, but that kind of change to my diet isn't that negligible, whereas changes vegans may find more difficult I find negligible. Diet and food for me is one of the few pleasures in my life, and while I truly believe I *can* find joy in vegan food, it has been much harder to change that than I would have thought. I have to really change some reward patterns and expectations for food, which is what I'm in the process of doing now. \n\nThanks for hearing me out. You have been the most understanding so far out of my interactions like this in /r/vegan. That makes me feel a bit warm. :-)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0018197976363201935,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23365051548685187,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.196312032945063,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3082443675268917,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38104757261885697,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3153952524782064,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.074874758196529,"diet_1":-0.0958168042670593,"diet_2":-0.28117613274089104,"diet_3":-0.16116724261661863,"diet_4":-0.07424554223325686,"diet_5":-0.16970980106998468,"diet_6":-0.18517088882557195,"diet_8":-0.013294416093534286,"diet_9":-0.006136389446813458,"diet_10":-0.06663141758062921,"diet_11":-0.08434562827945531,"diet_13":-0.010578110493952408,"diet_14":-0.09891554046526431,"diet_17":-0.089322543349449},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.
