"comment": "I think you might be mistaken on a couple of things.  Let me point them out, in no particular order\n\n&gt;We are all now aware of climate change \n\nClimate has pretty much always changed.  Humans have been around for a long time (more than a million years) in some form or another.  We've seen several glaciation periods that saw most of the northern hemisphere under massive sheets of ice.  Temperatures were several degrees cooler than they are now.  Then, temperatures warmed up to a couple of degrees WARMER than they are now for most of the Northern Hemisphere land masses.\n\nDo you know what didn't happen?  We didn't have ecosystem collapses due to massive amounts of change in temperature over short periods of time.  We didn't have runaway feedback effects that continued to heat the atmosphere until we reached extinction levels for humans, polar bears, or other creatures we have on the planet now.\n\nYes, some very large creatures died out, like mammoth or the Tasmanian Tiger. But if you look back over the course of millions of years, there were a great number of species that popped up, existed for a while, and then were supplanted by a new species.  That's how evolution works.\n\nWe are NOT just now discovering climate change.\n\n&gt;but no one is changing their lifestyles dramatically to make an affect without some kind of legislation imposed on people and companies.\n\nUm, that's not true.  There are thousands, tens of thousands of people who are jumping onto the bandwagon and changing the way they live to reduce their carbon footprint because they think it is the right thing to do.  People have voluntarily bought $10 lightbulbs to replace $0.29 ones, just because they use less energy.  They have voluntarily bought less safe and less luxurious cars because they burn cleaner, or use less gas, even though those cars are more expensive.  There's no law forcing people to spend more to buy a Prius. \n\nThere are people who give up owning a car and are spending much more of their lives commuting by mass transit, or riding a bicycle rather than using their own, comfortable and safe private transport vehicle.  No one forces them to do that, no law has been made in that regard.\n\nI am spending a bunch of money leasing an electric car.  It's the most expensive car I've ever had (sticker price was $36,000, 50% more than any other car I've ever owned), just because it was electric.  Could I have spent half the money on a car?  Yes.  Hell, I could have spent much less money and driven the car I already owned....\n\nI personally drive about one sixth the distance that I used to drive each year, and I use the electric car for about half of that driving.  So, I buy about 1/12th the amount of gasoline that I used to buy.  That's a pretty dramatic change.  \n\n&gt;If you help or improve the under developed countries first then the impact is much less and the developed countries wont have much need to change, which really are the one's making the problem.\n\nThe scary scenarios that the Climate Scientists predict are based on three things: 1) the direct effect of the GHGs themselves, 2) GROWTH of the emissions of GHGs, 3) feedback effects of increased emissions causing more warming than just the effects of the higher levels of GHGs due to emissions.  If any of these things is not at the levels they suggest, then the catastrophe they predict is averted.  \n\nSo, saying, \"which really are the one's making the problem,\" is not perfectly accurate.  Remember that without growth, there is little problem.  The industrialized nations are pretty much all at or below their peak in emissions, and will not grow any more.  In fact, almost all of them (except for China, which really is an Industrialized nation) have reductions planned or already happening.  The US, for example, reached a peak of about 20 tons per person back a couple of decades ago, and is now around 17 tons per person. We're still twice as high as China, but we're slowly reducing our per capita emissions rate, while they are rapidly expanding.\n\nIf the feedback effects from increased atmospheric GHGs are not what the Climate Scientists predicted, then we won't see anywhere near the amount of warming they project.  In fact, if water vapor causes more clouds and more precipitation, the ultimate effect of more water vapor could be a negative feedback, slowing rather than accelerating warming.  More winter precipitation can lead to an increase in albedo, rather than a decrease, as the Climate Scientists predicted.\n\nThis does NOT mean that we should continue doing business as usual, or increase our fossil fuel use, or anything like that.  What it does mean is that the shouts of doom and the call for immediate action based on their scary stories might be misplaced.  What we need is to continue to improve our use of energy, because efficiency is better than waste, and continue to increase the use of renewables like wind and solar *where they make sense.*   They don't make sense everywhere, and pushing for them to be used everywhere is foolish.  Use them where they have the greatest effect, continue to improve the technology so that they are more cost effective, and we will have a better society overall.  Don't do it because CO2 is evil, or because greedy oil companies make a profit (because profits are evil) or anything like that.  Do it where it improves the lives of people.",

"comment": "Very good points about the relationship between DoD and battery life, and the possibility of falling battery prices in the future. These just further go to show how the issue is much more complex than it might seem at first glance.\n\nVery true also that the ICE comes in handy in cold weather. Don't get me wrong, I think the Volt's a great car, and a great choice if you'll make frequent use of the ICE, either for long-distance driving or heating. However, it is kind of silly to run a massive ICE designed for powering a car just for heating, don't you think? EVs designed for cold weather have utilized standalone liquid/gaseous heaters in the past, and I expect we'll see this again in the future. \n\n&gt;One other thing we didn't mention- the bigger Tesla pack allows more power to be fed to a bigger motor, resulting in the face-melting acceleration that the P85 can do. Now that's a reason for a bigger pack!\n\nHaha, how silly of me to forget that! I pointed out the greater power \"intake\" available for charging, but of course it works both ways!",

"comment": "&gt; This sports activity vehicle will be built on the second generation of the modular longitudinal platform. From the very beginning, this tool for optimal drivetrain diversity implementation has been designed for a broad variety of concepts.\n\nI really don't understand this approach. From an engineering perspective, it is much better to design a platform from the ground up to be all-electric. If you add the requirement that it also be able to fit a gas engine or a turbine, the electric version will be worse.\n\nIt's nice that Audi is moving towards electric, but it's disappointing to see them taking a half-assed approach.",

As a result it behaves in an unusual manner.  \n  \nSecondly, the reason tesla is valued so highly when it has made so few cars is because there is potential for it to become a huge player should vehicle electrification become widespread.  The fact that VW are planning on going electric in a big way, indicates that we are heading towards a future in which tesla will be a gigantic company.  \n  \nThe point which this article might be making is that in the short term, competition will be bad for tesla: Currently if you want an expensive long range electric car then you only have one choice.  However even this argument is weak - the MS and M3 haven't created a new market, they are eating into existing markets traditionally dominated by the likes of jaguar and bmw.",

It's not a magic bullet or anything though, all it means is that the design passed a specific set of tests and that UL will accept liability in certain situations.\n\nFor future-proofing purposes, you probably want a 40A/50A EVSE (50A is 40A continuous usage), which works out to 10kW, plenty for any EV.  It's way overkill for a Volt at 3.6kW, but the Bolt can draw 7.2kW, and the Model 3 may be able to draw 10kW (I don't think it's been announced yet).",

I would rather spend the money on a better built car with a nicer interior then a ropey car with a massive battery. Those kind of long journeys are pretty rare, nobody commutes from Hull to Coventry, paying tens of thousands for the Tesla's battery pack would be a total waste of money. Maybe if you drive to the continent it would make sense but most people fly or use high speed rail for that, 66% of car journeys in the UK are under 5 miles so a 200+ mile range is complete overkill. Tesla owners would compromising on interior quality, reliability, vehicle size etc just to have a massive range they will use maybe once or twice a year. Add to this there are plenty of rapid charge points so even if you want to do a long journey in an i3 you can charge at a motorway services just fine.",

I can think \"well, a Model 3's range is *probably* enough, and it's charge speed is *probably* enough, and in my area of the country charger congestion *probably* won't be an issue, and the build quality will *probably* be good, and it will *probably* last a long time\" but that's a whole heck of a lot of probablys for a $45K or whatever purchase... and if any of them turn out to be false, then I'd have paid three times as much for a car that is worse for my needs than the PHEV I went for.",

I'm a battery systems engineer so think a lot about drive cycles and charging schedules, and PHEV only makes sense to me when you have a reliable charger somewhere where you leave the car for long periods on a regular basis, which it sounds like you do. \n\nIt also seems like you're very conscientious when charging which is equally commendable. I'm very careful to avoid stopping others charging when it's their only option, but would happily put my ampera on a public charger if on balance I don't think it'll affect anyone and I leave my number on the dash so people can ring me if they need the charger more than I do\n\nHow long have you had the volt? I'm absolutely loving my ampera. Really stretched to buy it but so happy with it. \n\nI also 100% agree that snobbery towards PHEV drivers is ridiculous. The whole idea is that they're cheaper to open them up to more people, it's people doing what they can afford to do. \n\nI think the focus for charging (while it's a limited resource) should be about need, not what we deserve. I don't need to charge, whereas some BEV drivers do, that's why I try to be as flexible as possible",

"comment": "New or important info highlighted in bold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;[Volkswagen](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volkswagen)’s first mass-produced electric vehicle, the ID. hatchback, will be the world’s first carbon neutral vehicle **when it launches at the end of the year**, the German firm has claimed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VW has invested 10 billion euros into the development of a fleet of [electric vehicles](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/best-cars/electric-cars/86169/best-electric-cars-on-sale) vehicles with a target to be a completely carbon neutral company by 2050.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Over the average car’s lifetime, it emits a total of 44 tonnes of CO2. Around 65 per cent of that amount is fuel consumption, while the production process and supply chain accounts for around 15 per cent.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the case of the VW ID., a variety of measures to help reduce the CO2 output during production have been implemented, including converting factories to run on natural gas and greater use of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind power. VW has also tasked its vast supplier base to prove they now use green energy and minimize their carbon emissions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**To offset areas of the business that cannot yet use green energy, VW is also engaging in ‘social and ecological projects’ in Asia and Brazil, to help some of the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Carbon neutral recharging solutions for customers are also being developed, which include VW’s Elli wallbox charger and the [IONITY rapid charging network](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/101586/shell-ionity-network-opens-fleet-of-fast-chargers) across mainland Europe. Both are refueled by green energy solutions that could enable electric cars using them to become effectively carbon neutral in the usage phase.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;The transport and automotive sector accounts for 14 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and remains one of the only sectors in recent years where emissions have not fallen. VW hopes that its ID. will set an example for the rest of the industry in terms of how a truly carbon neutral car can be achieved.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Production of the new Volkswagen ID. is edging ever closer, and our latest spy images show the all-new electric car undergoing winter testing before its goes on sale towards the end of 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Volkswagen will launch the ID. (codenamed ‘Neo’ within the company) with a range of three battery capacities, and is aiming to significantly undercut the likes of the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia e-Niro with a starting price of just £22,500.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Given the aggressive pricing, VW has set itself strong targets for the electric ID. sub-brand - it hopes to shift 100,000 cars per year in 2020, and ten times that figure just five years later.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As revealed by Auto Express towards the end of 2017, the first ID. will be a five-door hatchback which, at 4.25 metres long, is almost identical in size to a [Golf](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volkswagen/golf). However, the use of the all-new electric vehicle ‘[MEB](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volkswagen/104634/volkswagen-reveals-details-of-new-meb-electric-car-platform)’ platform means the wheelbase is around 20cm longer, at roughly 2.83 metres. As a result, interior space should be similar to that of a [Passat](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/volkswagen/passat).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The potential for extra cabin space can be seen in the proportions of the car in our spy images. The bonnet is much shorter than that of a Golf - it only needs to house an air conditioning system - allowing for much more space inside for occupants. Boot space is also expected to measure up closely to a Golf, so expect around 380 litres with all five seats in place.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Initially, the ID. will be powered by a single rear-mounted electric motor powering the back wheels only, but four-wheel drive versions (and higher performance options) are expected to follow later.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Each of the three battery capacities will be paired with e-motors offering different power outputs. Christian Senger, VW’s Head of Product Line for E-Mobility, told Auto Express, “The entry-level car will have a** [**WLTP**](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/102453/wltp-and-rde-economy-and-emission-tests-explained) **range of 330km (205 miles), and it will also have more limited performance. If people want a faster car then I don’t want them coming back after three months telling me that it’s fast but that the range is too short. So if you want a fast car, you’ll need a bigger battery - simple.”**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The most modest ID. hatch will get a 48kWh battery, while above that will sit 55 and 62kWh variants. The top spec model will provide a WLTP-certified range of around 341 miles.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Charging will be catered for via two forms of AC charging - 7.2kW and 11kW - **plus DC charging at up to 125kW via a CCS connection; the maximum that can be achieved with the car’s 400-volt electrical systems.** This latter method should result in an 80 per cent charge in 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of the battery.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Senger said buyers should expect a less complex buying or leasing process with ID. cars - not least because the company has removed many of the intricacies of combustion-engined line-ups in a bid to raise economies of scale and cut costs. “There will still be enough versions of ID.,” he told us, “but it will be much less complex, yes. **You’ll still be able to choose different colours and specs of seats, but you won’t get the thousands of permutations that come with, say, a combustion-engined Golf. Complexity costs, and you have to remember that our goal with ID. is Electric for All.”**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The prototype platform shown at VW’s launch event revealed predictably short overhangs for a car that doesn’t have a combustion engine or an exhaust - and a multi-link suspension arrangement at the rear to accommodate the electric motor.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The chassis also includes a large area ahead of the dashboard - space freed up by the lack of a combustion engine - that VW will use to install a projection system for an augmented reality navigation display. This was previewed on the original ID. concept but the bare chassis indicates that it is likely to make production, at least as an option. There’s also a gap where an induction charging panel could be installed, as and when the technology becomes available.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The ID. will be VW’s first permanently online vehicle, allowing a range of services to be offered to customers through the cloud, and over-the-air updates to be installed in the same way as Tesla does with its cars**. Only three of the car’s electronic control units (ECUs) are unable to be updated wirelessly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Senger revealed that VW had even considered installing one set of hardware and allowing the user to activate or deactivate features via smartphone apps but he said, “We did the numbers and it was still too expensive. You can’t just put heated seats in every car and then charge some people for them; the unit cost is too much.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The update causes worse caps for a lot of people - most new caps are are limited to under 30% of a full charge (I don't know if anyone tested vMax but that would be in the 3.3v-3.5v range at full charge) , and are having batteries replaced with refurbished capped ones that are worse than before the update or replacement.  tesla isn't figuring anything out they are making everything worse.",

"comment": "Yeah, and TCO varies significantly based on prior ICE expenses, gas prices, taxes, how much you drive, electric rates, EV purchase price etc. Electrek can claim a model 3 TCO is already cheaper than a camry (it's not - they grossly overestimated the costs of maintenance on the Camry and the rest of the expenses on both side are all somewhat questionable assumptions), but it's not yet. It's getting closer... but EVs are still more expensive to purchase and getting them fueled and serviced is not as familiar and ubiquitous as gas. All bets are off once initial EV purchase price is close to parity with equivalent sized ICE cars or if gas ever spikes up to $4-5/gal nationwide.\n\nSince my last ICE was extremely efficient, our local gas prices are consistently low, and our electric rates are average, the $200 tax eats the entirety of my fuel savings. With it factored in, I save about $2.50 a year. Thankfully I bought the Volt because I wanted to move the majority of my miles to electric and keep fuel cost low like I already had.",

"comment": "I agree that Tesla includes hardware that is software-locked for a fee. That's different than what the parent comment said though.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that Tesla doesn't require secondary owners to pay that fee after the initial owner has already paid it. I believe the article you're linking to is consistent with this. It's not alleging that the specific vehicles that had seat heaters enabled are now having to pay for it; it's saying that in later-shipped vehicles, Tesla began charging for use of that hardware.",

"comment": "That's not a terrible idea, although it means the Superchargers will be mobbed on holidays, yet not take in enough extra to be able to meet the demand... So, it sort of screws Tesla owners who want to be able to use Superchargers on holidays, without adding sufficient cash to help expand the Supercharger network. I suppose you could have blackout days around holidays... But that still means people can get stuck when the CCS network is down.\n\nHolidays are already problematic for Tesla owners, this will make it worse. I think it has to be more like $200 plus electricity costs... If you're in the middle of nowhere, $200 is still better than having to call a tow truck, but it's enough that most people won't pay it on a holiday just because there's a line at the CCS station... It has to hurt enough so that most people won't use it just for convenience.\n\nI don't know how much the average Tesla owner ended up contributing to the Supercharger network, but I'd be surprised if it was less than $1,000... Tesla has spent something over $1 billion on the current network, not including operating expenses.\n\nIt wouldn't be out of line to charge CCS vehicles $1,000 / car to use the Supercharger network... But of course that's steep if they're only going to use it once or twice... But maybe the economics are they should pay $1,000 per car and then use the Tesla network *instead of* the CCS network... Let Tesla become the de facto charging network and let CCS wither and die! 🤔",

"comment": "I did misspeak above.  An engine converts fuel into energy, and then that energy into motion.  A motor converts stored energy into mechanical energy.    Thus, a direct comparison is not possible, because an engine does two things, whereas a motor only does one.    There will *always* be less losses with an electric motor because of the second law of thermodynamics.    This is also why PHEV's that can directly couple the engine to the wheels during cruise are more efficient than ones that can't.  One less conversion step.  \n\nMPGe is a tool used for comparison of how far a car can travel with  a given amount of energy.  It is not a comparison of an engine and a motor.   \n\nPut another way... if I pour a gallon of gasoline into a generator, plug that generator into an electric car, run it till it runs out of fuel, and the car is rated at 100MPGe, it's not going to get 100 miles of range on that fuel, is it?  It will likely get something like 20 or 30.    I haven't actually tried this, but I do have the tools to do it and kinda wonder.  My generator will probably run for about 5 hours on a gallon of gas with an L1 charger plugged in, and my car seems to charge at about 5 miles/hr on L1, so yeah, 20-30 miles sounds about right.",

"comment": "This is hilarious. You realize BMW, Mercedes, and Audi all drive differently, right? Have you driven any of these cars? Suddenly when they make EVs they’re all going to drive the same? A car’s dynamics are not simply 0-60 times. Even then, the difference is technology will further separate brands based on their need to hit range numbers, which is why vehicles such as the EQS and EQE are so slow compared to something like a Model S. There’s already been countless reviews on the Polestar offerings and Mach-e and those vehicles do not match the 3 or Y. The EV leader in driving dynamics is without a doubt Porsche, as they have a history of developing amazing driver focused cars. However, commenting that any brand that produces an EV will offer cars that match Tesla simply because they’re an EV is ridiculous.",

We don't have a carbon neutral / zero carbon infrastructure, and to build it will require using the infrastructure we DO have.\n\nWe can have a *more sophisticated* debate about how to get this done, how to promote it or even how to mandate it. But blaming our current predicament on Republicans is counterproductive, and assertions that oil = bad solves nothing. We're at the bottom of a hole and you're shouting that we're too deep.

Defined as the modern era of western civilisation.\n\nTechnology is developed to fulfil the challenge before us, and to solve the task at hand. We do this by applying our problem-solving mind and ingenuity to drive innovation.\n\nBut when it comes to the ‘green energy revolution’, have our policy makers really thought the problem through?\n\nThink about it. Returning home from a gruelling day to conduct the simple act of flipping on the wall switch, giving us light and security. Powering up the computer or flicking on the television seems so trivial. Lest we forget the vast infrastructure behind the pressing of the switch.\n\n…..\n\nNews headlines bombarded the senses bringing confusion and panic throughout the brutal cold spell the UK experienced in late December early January. For months the recurring word of “blackouts” and the theme of not enough supply to meet the draw on demand.\n\nThe National Grid, the UK’s chief energy and infrastructure provider, and they put out updates of the struggle – their claims boiled down to that there are too many people having the heating on. Imagine that, it’s the dead of winter in the UK and people have got the heating on. Who knew?\n\nSo according to the experts, energy available on the National Grid is not sufficient to meet demand, whilst pointing the blame to the Trikolor of the Russian Federation. Gotta keep poking the Great Bear to the east……\n\nAn important question to ask of our MPs is: If there is a challenge of not enough power in the system to get us through a few days of cold, then how will we ever have the sufficient level to have an entire region of countries running on electric vehicles that require frequent recharging?\n\nEspecially considering the legislation they have voted to put into place that will see the traditional fuel coal-fired power plants and natural gas processing closed?",

Instead, it's two things. \n\nOne is that EVs are already competitive now in a lot of ways to ICE vehicles (especially in China and markets without tariffs on Chinese vehicles) and that's before the likely much greater economies of scale and production learning curve benefits that have continued through to today and will likely continue for the near future. Essentially, EVs have improved rapidly in recent years and are likely to continue that rapid improvement for at least the near future where they are obviously better than ICE vehicles in almost all aspects.\n\nThe other is that electricity has a very large range of sources from which it can be generated and so is a lot more flexible than internal combustion engine vehicles where their engines need much more specifically formulated sources. This has large economic ramifications for various countries in terms of how much dependency they have on other countries as well as price volatility.",

Right now Superchargers allocate 350kw to four stalls, but I’d like to see Costco or some grocery store do something like 350kw spanning 8-10 stalls, maybe more.\n\nAlmost no cars today can take that full power for more than a few minutes and so there’s a ton of excess capacity sitting idle. \n\nI’d love to see 50 stalls in a grocery store lot, or strip mall with no idle fees and maybe 2Mw site allocation, 40kw per stall. You can happily go to 100% without blocking other people and just gamble that the site will almost never be at full capacity.",

There are quite a few solar professionals in here who will give you feedback - and a few who can probably manage the project from design through construction if needed (though you seem to not need that service).\n\nAs a side - you've done the most important thing first: lowered your energy usage through heavy efficiency applications. It is most appropriate to install solar power at the end of that game. Good job!",

"comment": "If you're willing to relocate, my recommendation would be Maine.\n\nWhy Maine you ask? Well, for one, its underappreciated. Portland, ME is an awesome \"small town\" city with Amtrak access all down the coast.\n\nSecond, I doubt its a saturated market. Sure, California has great sunlight + some incentives. But everybody and their mother is a solar installer in California. Very difficult to break into the market. You'll find the same in other states.\n\nNorth Carolina or Louisiana would be nice. They have robust state tax credits for solar which make projects very easy to justify. NC is better for small commercial. Louisiana is better for residential.  But you have to ask yourself, do you really want to relocate to another market that could evaporate the minute the incentives get tossed out the window?\n\nMaine has a very high fuel cost. 10 cents per kwh before getting into any distribution or transmission fees! That market is gonna stick around. Plus you won't have much competition, meaning you can charge closer to $4/W vs. $3/W. Higher margins, fewer projects, no incentive plan to deal with... it all sounds pretty nice huh?\n\nPlus you got the high margin off grid market to exploit. Vermont + New Hampshire are good markets too.\n\nI'd say the winters are dreary, but you're from Ohio.",

"comment": "Not Commercial:\n\nI recently bought a house with some solar panels installed, they look to be from about 2007.   Hard to say the size but there are about 16 panels installed on a lower south facing roof.\n\nProblem is they aren't working, as in no power or indicators on the inverter.  I had an electrician come take a look and he said they were wired in such a way that when there is shade on even one panel it cuts the voltage of all the others.  There are trees on each end which cause at least one panel to be in the shade all day except right at noon.  I can cut some trees down to get more sun but I can't do anything about neighbors trees so there is likely to always be some corner shaded much of the time.\n\nMy understanding of series circuits is that the voltage should be additive even if one source is low, but electrician said not so for panels and when he bypassed half (I guess they are in 2 strings of 8?) the inverter at least powered up status lights and voltage measured 190 but not enough to run.  \n\nSo question is, is this electrician correct and is there anything I can do to get full power that is generated even with one panel partially in the shade? He mentioned optimizers?\n\nIt seems like the inverter would run and I could at least get some benefit, im guessing even with 2 panels down in shade (sunny boy inverter manual says it needs at least 300V to run).  Sunny boy has some kind of swap program I haven't checked into yet if a new inverter would help in this quest.",

Every single report I've ever seen just lists a cost associated with the projected damage.  Nobody to date has done a study of x dollars being spent on adaption or mitigation. Even better, It would be nice to see a HDI outlay with x dollar spent on modernizing Africa vs solar panels for the first world.  Something tells me that a trillion spent in Africa would significantly raise the global HDI and first world solar would have a negligible impact at best. (maybe we can do another ethanol mandate and lower the global average again?)",

The cost is so unbelievably large, it’s hard to grasp.\"\n\n\"What if the President said the US will only buy solar panels that are 40% efficient and will only pay $2/watt installed (achievable through economies of scale). Installing a 6kW solar system installed on every home in the US would only cost $1.67 trillion (which includes the 107 billion for administration).

Fuel is natural gas represented as a construct in a FL PSC rate case for what you buy at your meter.\n\nWhen TECO buys your \"solar\" power, it's not 1:1 for what you pay for your power. It's what they negotiated with the FL PSC to buy your power at. And while I'm the first to call them full of shit for what they do, there is no way they're going to pay you the same amount for power *delivered* than you pay for power *delivered*.",

"comment": "The reduction in carbon emissions was led by a slow down in the Australian economy.\nWe also had the introduction of extremely generous solar feed in tariffs whereby end consumers were paid two-three times what the market was paying for wholesale electricity generation, with none of the risk.\n\nhttp://theconversation.com/is-carbon-pricing-reducing-emissions-15562\n\n&gt;The greenhouse emissions from the National Electricity Market (covering around 80% of electricity supply in Australia) showed a 7% reduction from 2011-12 to 2012-13. However, much of this is due to demand, which reduced 5% over the same period. According to the electricity market operator, the reasons probably include dramatic increases in rooftop solar, customer responses to higher prices (mostly caused by rising network costs), increasing incentives for energy efficiency, and reduction in industrial and manufacturing loads (driven by the high Australian dollar).\n\nThe decrease in emissions started before the carbon tax was implemented and the rate of reduction didn't increase after it was implemented.\n\nhttps://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/5e5fafe9-15be-4eb9-a8cf-a92db6814ea6/files/nggi-quarterly-update-mar-2015.pdf",

I have been our service tech for just over a year now (based in western New York) and I am a NABCEP certified solar PV installation professional. \n\nI have only seen one case of a leak caused by our installs. \nOn shingled roofs, we use flashings (ecofasten) that get up and under 2 layers of shingle, and we use a liberal amount of roofing tar underneath the flashing. And for our wire penetrations we use a solodeck box (spelling?) which is installed in much the same way, just larger and is meant for electrical connections and wire changing. \n\nOn metal roofs I am less familiar with the specific products we use, it's the same L bracket as we use on shingle roofs, but with metal roofs we also use some sealant (the specifics of which is the part I forget)",

For that reason it HAS to be on a single meter.\nSolarEdge SE7600 can handle grid zero without a battery though it is far more efficient with a powerwall (can be added latter), or you could use Xantrex, or OutBack power inverters (both of these require batteries).  \nThese are the type of systems being installed in Hawaii all the time as the grid has saturated legs where net metering is not approved.   \nShort of that you can get a lawayer to render them a letter about theft of your property and improper taxation, as they would be charging and taxing your for your own property (the portion of the power that you self consume in a dual meter solution).",

"comment": "No, I interpreted it that you wanted to get the education. My suggestion is to work with someone who already has the experience. These types of arrays can be rather complex and costly. It's not that you're not capable (I don't know you), but most people have a budget of time and money, and to go from zero to designing, procuring, and installing your own system in 4 months could be an overwhelming challenge. \n\nIf you're dead set on doing it yourself, I'd check out your local community college or trade school and see if they have a \"solar installer\" class or set of courses. They are going to be very basic and really only cover the types of systems and the basics of designs/design elements, probably not much on designing the electrical side of the system in any great depth like an electrical engineer would. \n\nHow much solar experience do you have so far? That'd help guide some suggestions.",

They could modify the product and include a setback from the ridge and sides, but as demonstrated they don't meet the fire code. I'm not talking out of my ass, I deal with this every day. I personally built 85 residential and commercial solar power plants last year.\n\nWe saw the same thing when microinverters came out; The design of a new product like theirs will cause friction from the established codes, which are written with existing technology in mind. Ultimately, the code will probably be updated and revised to allow new products that can manage to dovetail with the existing rules for long enough.",

"comment": "&gt;or through electrolysis which is highly inefficient.  \n\nWe are entering an era where this efficiency matter is going to require new thinking, as Bjørn Simonsen, [NEL Hydrogen](http://nelhydrogen.com/) (the company that has built Denmark's nationwide network of renewable hydrogen stations) says in a recent article:  \n\n&gt;*The entire efficiency question loses importance with the energy regime we’re moving into.* We’re coming from a mentality where we are used to thinking about energy as a limited resource. If you have a barrel of oil, it’s extremely important to use it efficiently. However, you can use it across several days or years. Whatever you don’t use one day, you still have it for the next day. Whereas when we look at renewables, [you have to use them when they’re there.](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-electricity-solar/) We have to look at energy with new eyes. What matters is what does it cost? It’s not necessarily all about the total efficiency. Prices are low enough to make hydrogen and distribute it to fueling stations at costs that are comparable to what we’re used to today with gasoline and diesel.  \n\n&gt;If you charge your car from your rooftop solar at home, it’s obviously more efficient than converting it to hydrogen first, but you won’t see people driving their electric vehicles to a solar farm far from their homes to charge whenever it’s really nice and sunny outside. That is why the two technologies will live side by side and complement each other...FULL ARTICLE: https://www.pv-magazine.com/2017/08/30/future-pv-the-feasibility-of-solar-powered-hydrogen-production/\n\nWhy not both Hydrogen AND batteries? The basic efficiency argument was formed - and actually made sense- before the price of renewables plummeted. \n\nBy the way, this illustrates the problems with a Powerwall- you can buy one for $5,500 + tax and installation, so figure ~$7,000 + and you can store about $1.40 worth of energy in it (assuming 0.10 USD/kWh). This is about 1/2 day of power for an average US home.  \n\nA Powerwall is guaranteed 10 years (degradation not included) and if you cycle it a lot it may not last much longer. Then you'll have to replace it for ~$7,000, and throw the dead one in a landfill or take it to a recycler. All to store 1/2 days power. \n\nYou might find this study interesting:  \n\nTechno-economic analysis of the viability of residential photovoltaic systems using lithium-ion batteries for energy storage in the United Kingdom\n\n• More than fifty long-term ageing experiments on commercial batteries undertaken.  \n• Comprehensive battery degradation model based on long-term ageing data validated.  \n• PV-Battery system is shown to not be economically viable.\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626191731190X  \n\nA Game Changer- Hydrogen powered drones fly 4+ hours vs. 20 minutes with Li-ion batteries and can tolerate cold weather to -30C.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGpeLwBk43w\n\nA drone is a great way to illustrate the benefits of fuel cells and it would be surprising if H2 drones don't make today's Li-ion drones obsolete within a few years.",

Now with Diesel gate and EV popularity growing it might change quickly.\n\nIn Switzerland where I am, they are a little more popular and enough people can afford to have a charger and sometimes solar PV panel on their home so it is always somehow popular. Thus Tesla are still the EV I see the more often here.\n\nI guess than when Tesla model 3 will be available for order within short delivery, there might be a bunch of cheap Zoe, Leaf and i3 on the market, even some Ioniq, Kona and Soul EV probably.",

"comment": "That is the entire design that they sent? Is there another page with electrical diagrams?\n\nBasically, what Kendalf was getting at is seeing if their design has the batteries and solar feeding an emergency circuits with a solar inverter capable of operation during grid outage, or if it's just the batteries feeding the emergency circuits, or if they're both just on normal house load and go out when grid goes down.\n\nA typical solar install without any battery backup is designed to shut off when the grid goes down. This is a safety feature. When the rep said the panels were \"powered by the grid\" that's what he meant. They don't take power from the grid, but they sense grid operation in order to continue operating themselves.",

"comment": "You clearly missed the part where I said I have a PHEV. It has a 12kWh battery of which only 8kWh is useable (Volvo V60 D6).\n\nI get 3+miles/kWh on urban, and 2.5miles/kWh on highway. Nissan leaf drivers typically get 3 easy if not 4/5, I don't know what Tesla's get.\n\n840W at 8 hours makes 6.7kWh (I don't know the exact peak/rated numbers, I'm assuming the 840 was peak). Let's say after 10% charging loss and an arbitrary efficency loss as those 8 hours of solar won't be peak / average over the year as it's not always summer; of 4kWh usable.\n\nThat means, I could charge the battery in my car to 75% (6kWh) at home, drive to work by highway and when I leave work the battery be at 75%, again draining to 25%.\n\nAt present, I drive via town to and from work, leaving with 100% battery, getting home with 25%. (I no longer charge at work as I don't want to pay a subscription fee).\n\nSome EV's actively cool/heat the batteries when stationary (and on the go) to preserve them, again solar panels can be used to do this rather than draining the battery, further helping longer term battery health.\n\nSure an EV, even one with a crap battery could easily do my commute no worries, but if the battery is kept around 50% and has shallower discharge cycles (charging at work, theoretically could half the depth) this should also help preserve the battery.\n\nLooking at cost, no idea what that panel cost, my panels were £130 for 300W, probably more expensive as this tech is more niche. However, to charge my car the 8kWh it uses per typical day, will use 9kWh (ish) possibly 10. 9kWh in the UK costs 9x0.15=£1.35, or at night rates 9x0.07=£0.63\n\nSay the only charging is at work (ignore the extra hours at home) so instead of £0.63(1.35 day rate) to charge I'm looking at £0.32(£0.67 day rate). Let's say 5 days a week for 46 weeks a year (nice annual leave, work from home etc) that's would equal £73 a year. Over 5 years £350ish. Not much but it's a saving. Then factor in I've also managed to keep my battery in better condition. Then also factor in I can now commute on the highway rather than the shorter town route which is 20minutes quicker. That saves 40 minutes a day so in a year 153 hours, which at my hourly rate is a significant saving.\n\nWorth noting, we have Tesla and other EV drivers on our site where all parking is outside, and there are thousands of us on site, not everyone parks in a multi story.\n\nScenario 2, my wife, get commute is 33 miles each way. A second hand Nissan leaf 24kWh is £7k real world range of 60-70mikes second hand, the 30kWh model is £12k and will do 80ish miles.\n\nOnce heating/air con on, the 24kWh model might scrape her commute, the 30 kWh could, both would be doing very deep discharges. With an extra 4kWh from solar, it could provide more certainty from the 24kWh model, and reduce discharge depth in both. If cars like the light year can charge at 1.2kW you're looking at even more potential, and in a few years time who knows what the increases in solar will look like.\n\nScenario 3, local authority / business sites(my wife  works at one), they have a good amount of pool cars which cover very short distances and aren't used every day stored in an outside car park. The site I work on has a few vans that just transport goods around, again barely any miles covered. These vehicles self charging cloud save a tone of money by not needing to add charging infrastructure, it's easier to then justify fleet EVs on the books then.\n\nThis is very specific to my personal situation, I've tried to be conservative with the numbers, I do appreciate it is napkin math, but I think this application is great for many users; many people have far short commutes and/or more efficient cars than I.",

"comment": "&gt; Does Tesla Powerwall lose power through multiple conversions?\n\nYes.  The powerwall is designed to be AC coupled— but an AC coupled battery does not allow PV to function when the grid is down.  So to install it DC coupled means you are converting 3 separate times with loss occurring at each conversion. (As opposed to just one conversion with much less loss). \n\n&gt; Is Winaico, REC, or Silfab a better panel?\n\nI don’t know about Winaico but I hear REC is fine... my company installs mostly Silfab as they have less then 44 parts per million defect rate. But to be honest the panels really aren’t going to make that much of a diff.  You just want to make sure you install a good inverter.",

I do not advocate array DC equal inverter AC size but that a 3D simulation such as Aurorasolar, SolarDesigntool, Helioscope etc.   \n\n&gt; a clip ratio of 110%\n\nThat is not a CLIP ratio but an oversize ratio.  The clipping is much smaller in the example.\n\n&gt; Similarly, you can split a 7kWDC array between East- and West-facing roofs and have literally zero energy lost to clipping on a 5kW inverter\n\nI gave a similar example.   \n\n&gt; Especially in large commercial installations, where upsizing inverters also means upsizing overcurrent protection and lengthy AC conductors, clipping is a necessary and cost-effective part of the system design.\n\nPossibly, but that would be an outside consideration other than just DC to AC ratio.   Also there are different options like 3phase SolarEdge 100kW inverters etc.  \n\n&gt; Financial/cost-effectiveness question aside, I still don't recommend clipping on residential arrays because customers don't like to see their pretty curves plateau at the top.\n\nThis is a big concern yes.  Also many customers will expand in the future so skimping on the inverter now makes that future expansion difficult for a very modest savings today.  \n\nOur standard is generally &lt; 1% clipping estimate with a 3D simulation unless there is some other consideration like:\nnet metering restricted to X AC size  \navoid line side tap (not that big a deal but sometimes it is)  \netc.",

"comment": "If you can wait a bit longer, I really suggest you consider the Toyota RAV4 Prime (Plug-In Hybrid), supposed to be available Summer 2020, as the 2021 model year.\n\nCompared to the Escape, it has:\n\n* AWD\n\n* A larger battery (17.8kWh), and longer range (39mi estimated)\n\n* A longer battery/electric motor/EV components warranty (10 years/150k mi, vs 8 years/100k mi in the Escape) EDIT: since you're in California I believe you have longer warranties in general, but I would suggest thinking about what this increase in warranty for all Toyota Hybrids as of 2020 means about their reliability, such that Toyota is willing to put their money where their mouth is\n\n* I _think_ it has more passenger and cargo space while not being too much larger externally (it's in the same compact crossover class as the Escape, not the midsize category of the Santa Fe)\n\n* A more longstanding base vehicle, so hopefully you can be a bit more confident in build quality: the current generation RAV4 has been on sale since December 2018, the Escape since Fall 2019, almost a year later; while the PHEVs will both be new, the RAV4 Hybrid was on sale roughly at its December 2018 launch and the PHEV largely modifies the existing hybrid systems (larger battery, larger motors, adds a charging port) and the last generation RAV4 also had a hybrid, the Escape hybrid was not available the previous generation and is a generally untested design\n\n* Toyota's hybrids generally have an excellent track record for quality and reliability, now bolstered by the longer warranty they're adding for 2020. I don't think Ford necessarily has a bad rep, I've heard pretty good things about the Focus Electric and the C-Max and Fusion PHEVs, but I don't think their rep is nearly as solid as Toyota's.\n\n* Potentially better dealer support: Ford's website (at least here in Canada) has a checkbox when searching to select \"Plug-in hybrid certified dealers\", i.e. not all of their dealers are certified, Toyota has no such distinction; the Prius has been a major part of Toyota's lineup and supported at all of its dealers for over a decade, and the RAV4 hybrid in recent years has had a large sales share, Ford hasn't had as many hybrids selling as strongly so service techs capable of working on the battery, motors, etc. may be a bit more limited vs. Toyota, lengthening wait times and reducing available appointment dates/times\n\nAside from that, to your question:\n\n&gt;Since the battery will be on the \"smaller\" side than a straight forward EV (14.4 kWh) we were thinking that it's not worth it to install a charger in our garage. Are we right with this thinking? Can you charge via a standard outlet or should we get the outlet in the garage switched to the dryer type outlet? If you could charge via standard outlet, how long would it take to charge a 14.4 battery? We're fine charging overnight and we also have solar panels on the house, so we could do during the day. Our electrical panel is on the outside of our house - yes, every time the power goes out I think someone is here to kill me - right by the garage, so if anything new needed to be run it wouldn't take a lot of wiring.\n\nIt should take about 10 hours to charge empty to full on a standard outlet. I have a 2013 Volt with a 16.5kWh battery with 10.8kWh usable (some of the battery is reserved to ensure long term health, these margins were very high in my Volt, so despite the Escape having a smaller pack, it should be a similar usable amount). The RAV4 Prime may take more like 14 hours.\n\nWith a short run, IMO it can be worthwhile to install a 240V charging station. It makes it possible to, say, arrive home at 11PM and be fully charged by 7AM if you're out one night and have to work the next morning; or on the weekends you can go for morning errands and then evening dinner. Also, keep in mind it's possible that the wall outlet in your garage might not be in great shape to charge an EV, you really want a dedicated circuit, ideally it shouldn't have GFCI, and the wiring+receptacle need to be in good shape if they're going to handle 12A of draw for 10-14 hours at a time.\n\nException: if you drive VERY little, like 10 miles most days, then the wall outlet probably makes more sense, because recharging 10mi worth of range might only take 4 hours or so on a wall outlet, so a charging station that can do it in 1 hour is overkill.",

"comment": "Yeah there are a few options under Tou-domestic: prime, 5 to 8 and 4 to 9. It is because energy is most expensive in the evening and cheapest at noon when solar is producing the most. A bit of it will depend on when you use the most energy in relation to when your PV system is generating the most. Prime is the best if you are considering battery storage. Iirc.\n\nEdit: found the video I remember watching on prime being best for battery. Talks about solar and tou a lot. \n\nhttps://vimeo.com/351286257/comments",

"comment": "I disagree, while nuclear is much safer and cleaner than people think, it’s quite toxic for politicians, so it’s hard to get buy in. Two things that’ll help a ton without needing new power plants would be to incentivize solar roofs for homes, and adoption of large battery systems on the power grid. What most people forget is most power plants need to significantly dial things down at night, which is quite difficult, it’s why most power companies have lower rates at night. Charging EVs at night will just normalize usage throughout the day. Adding large batteries on the grid will allow for huge spikes to be absorbed and recharged whenever they can.",

You're not going to be able to bypass and traffic.\n\nYou might as well buy a bike. Stick some batteries on it and be $15k better off.\n\n\nI like the _idea_ of solar panels on cars, but it's just not practical. Spend that money on actual roof panels, they'll last longer.\n\n\nGood luck to this company, but it's definitely not mainstream.",

This will future proof your investment, since Enphase has been excellent at customer service and providing backwards compatible updates to customers. For instance, the ability to power your house even when the grid is offline (usually grid-tied solar stops producing when the power goes out). Also, Enphase solar arrays can be expanded later without resizing.",

What 85% of the home buyers are doing is having the seller pay off the lease in full before closing or with money held in escrow.  You do not want someone else’s lease especially if you are a PG&E customer. \n\nWhat you are not factoring in is the changes PG&E is making to rate plans.  The average price per kWhr is meaningless as PG&E has 5 different rate plans you can be on.  You also are on NEM 2 which you do not what to lose.  PG&E is making changes to the rate plans which make your calculates highly inaccurate.\n\nSince you are on a lease you won’t be able to make changes to the solar system based on your usage.  AND you lose out on the 30% tax credit.\n\nJust get the seller to pay off the system before closing.  Lot less headache for you.",

If anyone is considering solar, ask yourself if solar installers are truly so hard to find that it’s worth working with criminals to get a system installed. Just reach out to other installers instead and make sure their invoicing matches accounting and IRS standards.",

Brands like Neuman's Own and Yves are pretty okay, they do have stuff that isn't vegan, but they have a lot that is, and it seems to be in most mainstream chains (In canada at least).  Que Pasa chips are cheap and good and they make a killer salsa which makes a nice snack mixed in with some refried beans from a can.  Also, if you like junk food, Safeway's store brand has the cheapest soy ice cream around.",

I gain a large amount of enjoyment from yogurt, meat, cheese, etc.  I also feel that being an omnivore is a natural state of being (at least for me) and that my body responds well to a balanced diet that includes meat and dairy, eggs, etc and because of that I don't really have to worry about levels of nutrients and I can just eat and go on.  Also it is an issue with availability, it isnt easy for where I live to cook so the idea of cooking everything I eat isnt practical at all.  Also where I live there are not tons of vegetarian things to eat around here.  And most importantly I do not feel it is immoral to eat meat because I think meat is something we were designed to be able to eat.  If it wasn't something we were able to eat then we would look at meat like we look at cement or wood, just something in the environment but not food.\n\nEdit: a crap ton of words to fix a garbled sentence.",

If it's just a bit of gas or discomfort then by replacing those foods with animal products you're likely to feel worse anyway, most people are lactose intolerant (they only produce lactase during infancy just like other mammals).",

I can't really predict which approach will result in the least harm so I wouldn't condemn them for that personally.\n\n&gt; who actively try to portray shelters who take killing off the table as hoarders.\n\nThat does seem pretty biased. I suppose exposure to some of the worst cases could cause that sort of reaction, not that it is a legitimate defense.\n\n&gt; People who buy, particularly from pet stores are very often open to adoption if the option was put in front of them and there are a lot of animals killed because their humans were not located in time, etc.\n\nIt's not only no-kill shelters that can run adoption programs and such, so that doesn't seem like a specific benefit of no-kill shelters.\n\n&gt; And I think there is value in and need for no kill shelters even if most are closed admission.\n\nIs there really a substantial difference between a no-kill shelter that limits its admissions and one that kills? After all, the animals which are rejected by the no-kill shelter must be dealt with by others. It seems to me like they simply outsource the killing and keep their own hands clean.\n\n&gt;  If they can work hard to get animals adopted and come up with creative ways to get animals who aren't young or 'desirable' out the door.\n\nI think the most salient question would be whether they could have taken those same resources and reduced harm to a greater degree by allocating it to animals that would benefit more. If you adopt out one old dog and turn away two young adoptable ones that are then killed then that doesn't seem like a benefit.\n\nAnd by the way, I don't mean to imply I could make those sorts of decisions myself. I couldn't. In fact, I spent a truly ridiculous amount of money recently on a deaf/blind 13 1/2 year old dog, which is probably only briefly staving off the inevitable. That same money could almost certainly have done more good, so I realize that I'm not capable of practicing as I preach, at least as far as my own pets go. But I think it's important to try to determine what the correct course of action is, even if we can only approximate it, or to try to guide our actions in that direction.\n\n&gt; I've seen TNR work well for cats too. Last time we spoke of this, I had to admit it doesn't necessarily work well for birds.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't remember too well so hopefully I am not playing the part of stuck record.\n\nYou're right that I would tend to factor in the other animals that would be affected to keep a cat or dog (or other creature) alive. Going by the statistics in the study I quote [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1qb6cb/that_peta_kills_90_of_the_adoptable_animals_it/cdber91) it seems like quality of life (and length) are both pretty bleak for feral cats. \n\nGiven that those cats are going to be killing other animals (or fed other animals that have been killed) and live brief pretty tough lives, I am skeptical that it can be justified as an overall good.",

It's definitely going to limit your options when it comes to buying processed vegan foods but there are still plenty of damn tasty things you can make for yourself. Tonight (god and probably for the resto the week I made so much!) for example, I had a tasty slow cooked chili.\n\nI'd recommend looking at [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1c73eb/veganism_without_soy_or_faux_meat_products/), which is just from yesterday, as a starting point on your search since they answered a lot of this.\n\nIn terms of drinks, honestly, the best thing most of can drink and we all probably could drink more of is water. I'm not sure how limiting you are on you sugar intake, but pretty much every smoothie you can think of can be made vegan. All fruit and veggie smoothies are damn tasty. Almond milk substitutes for milk in smoothies damn well, I actually prefer it. Also, a lot of people like kombucha, which can be made at home if you're adventurous or frugal. Crystal light is probably vegan.",

If people post things we don't agree with we can down vote them if we want.\n\nBy the way, most of us feel that being a vegan is not about us, it's about the animals. If you want to be fighting for the animals you can be a vegan without hanging out with or having discussions with other vegans. (That kinda confuses me but you could do that). \n\nIf you don't care about the animals, why were you considering being a vegan.  I'm kinda confused here.",

Most super markets also start to include vegetarian and vegan products into their assortment (e.g. Edeka) or already had (e.g. Alnatura). You probably won't find many vegeterian or vegan restaurants in small cities and it is hard to find e.g. vegan shoes. One thing that really is better, compared to the rest of the world, at least where I have been, is bread!\n\nI would not really recommend moving to germany, especially lately, conservatives (Angela Merkel and CDU) have taken over the government.\n\nConsidering your german:\n\"Wart**e** mal, ist Deutschland wirklich günstig für Veganer?\" (*günstig* can also mean *cheap*, but in this context it means *convenient*.)\n\"Ich bin nur ein Amerikaner, der die Sprache lernt, aber wenn das stimmt, werde ich vielleicht bald umziehen\"\n\"(Könntest du mich bitte auch korrigieren, falls du Fehler findest?)\" (*falls* is the same as *wenn* and could be translated as *in case of*)",

But I do reddit as an \"out\" vegan, and every other sub that is not this one is usually pretty rough on vegans.\n\n\nSo I guess my next question would be what are the omni and vegetarians that frequent here doing in other subs to tell people to cool it on the vegan hate?  Or is it only an issue because for once it's directed at them?\n\n\nI'm guessing nothing, because it's a wasted venture and not the point of the sub it happens on.  Much like the purpose of this sub is to be a space for vegans to come together and interact.  I've been a member here a long time, and while I will admit there are a fair amount of jerks of all kinds, this sub is overwhelmingly positive, supportive, and helpful to people who are sincere in their questions and knowledge seeking.\n\n\n It is very easy to scroll past a meme, or even hide it from view.  We have complete freedom in what we choose to view while on this site, and if it's that big of an issue, maybe they shouldn't be on the internet.  There is always going to be something that upsets you.",

In terms of cost I have spent like 20 bucks on food in the last month which is pretty sweet. Also I don't know anyone who has ever (and some of them have been doing it for a long time) gotten sick or in trouble from dumpstering so I am not too worried about that.\n\nAnd yeah I do identify as vegan and only eat vegan food at home (unless I dumpstered it, but there isn't a huge amount, mostly cheese) and I never intentionally buy nonvegan food when eating out etc.",

"comment": "I've actually made the latter part of that argument quite a few times in the past, but that's because I don't think it's *ever* logical to gloss something over for the sake of tribalism or what \"seems\" true or moral. \n\n*(I'm just gonna pop back up here after writing most of this up. If you're just going to call me edgy or link me to /r/iamverysmart because I enjoy controversial moral discussion, you can just skip to making your comment. No need to waste your time reading the rest. Also, I'm 30 years old, and not a dank memeing teen.)*\n\nHuman existence is built on a very scary platform, and I think ignorance to what got us where we are is just a recipe for future cultural self-destructiveness. While I'm entirely prepared for the downvotes, it wouldn't be right to say all this without actually giving an example for how I would use the argument.\n\nThe survival of the human species is based on aeons of successful egg fertilization. Beyond that, we're based on mothers who are caring enough to raise the thing that eventually comes out of them. Before we were considered \"human,\" force would be one of the primary ways to successfully impregnate someone. Without language or advanced communication, all there could be is body language, and that just wouldn't be a successful tactic when one side of the equation has a constant desire to succeed. \n\nIn that situation, the polarity of the sexual dynamic actually creates a mutual blame for both parties. Men who are overly sexual and violent would spread their genes, while women—in the seemingly virtuous position—were often willing to care for the product of such a harmful person. That's how harmful genes spread, and it would often be under that guise of morality. While no person should be automatically labeled as being like their parents, spreading those genes also isn't limited to the single next generation. It's all about the generalized survival of those genes.\n\nRegardless of the emotions or judgments we could throw at men or women, this is the reality of how we got here. These might be outliers, but they're a strong enough trend that all of us will have the genes of these things in us. We obviously can't say it's moral, but I don't believe humans *are* naturally moral. \n\nIn fact, we're trapped in this situation of constant consumption that essentially puts us into a de facto position of harmfulness. I had a lot of nihilistic dread before I made the transition to veganism a few months back. I see human life and realize how truly *difficult* it would be—impossible, in fact—just to be neutral. \n\nPoint being, I think male nature is tied to a very strong and harmful sexual desire, and I also believe masculinity is being attacked and degraded at its very core, in modern culture. What if general males and masculinity *are* naturally harmful in certain ways? Do we continue to attack males and make them feel weak? Do we ignore the importance of male sexual self-actualization in the work force? \n\nWithout giving males the power over resources that leads to female attraction, I believe we'll continue to see shootings and suicides from males. And this idea is simply the truth of attraction, which I believe is not something we can even begin to fight with ideas of \"feminism\" or whatever else someone might say is the answer. Women are generally attracted to males that are higher than themselves on the dominance hierarchy, so where will imbalances like that lead us, especially when so many people would simply attack me, here, or dismiss my claims. Ignorance to growing harms isn't going to give us bliss.\n\nIn conclusion, literally fuck everything about me as a person. I don't even care that I exist. I never argue out of pride or a desire to appear smart or whatever people might think. I can't even talk to my own family without them putting me on blast because of every detail they dislike about me. None of that should matter. I argue because I value ideas, and as much as these things might seem like they don't matter, I believe they're a foundational problem we're seeing across the planet, and I don't believe it could be possible to counter flaws like these without actually understanding them in a very deep sense.\n\nOh, but referring back to your quote, obviously rape *is* abuse. I'm not arguing against that. It's a harm that shouldn't exist. I just think sexual self-actualization is a necessity for male contentment. My thinking could have many solutions, I'm sure. Under capitalism, prostitution could be legalized... of course, I also consider myself a communist because fuck commodification of life. My personal hope would be full labor liberation as well as full sexual liberation. Let men and women escape the judgment and coercion that capitalism places on us. Let men be valued without having to be labor drones, and let women be valued without commodifying terms like \"virginity\" to drag us into senseless judgments. Full bisexual, vegan space-communism.",

I've only ever had one brand of protein shake but I can vouch for [this one.](https://smile.amazon.com/Vegansmart-Protein-Powder-Naturade-Nutritional/dp/B00CWLA56O/)",

The past is in the past. Learn from it and move on. You are not a bad person for the things you did before you were educated. In fact, you deciding to change your lifestyle because of what you read makes you a good person.

I think it's best to focus on how to break the news! You are almost guaranteed to get the \"Why?!?!\" question in varying degrees of interest. Practice what you want to say, how can you effectively communicate how you feel and why you do what you do? If anyone makes fun of you or says things that anger you, laugh it off like it's nothing, say something witty back if you can but always with a smile. Watch some earthling ed if you need to :). \n\nThey could be less aggressive if you say you're trying your best to transition to vegan rather than say you're vegan. It's weird, I know, but then they'll feel like you're not on the other side, you're still on their side. But it's basically the same thing lol.\n\nGood luck, you got this!",

You realize not everyone cares about what some stupid teenager who believes in conspiracies would say about them, right?\nHe made that video and refused to correct it, It is not cherrypicking if the entire methodology of that video was pseudo-scientific and he presents itself as science-based\n\n\"What the Health\" is terrible. It can turn someone as illiterate as you vegan. And 6 months later when they see a documentary about why a carnivore diet should be followed by everyone, they'll ditch veganism and jump to the next fad.\n\nHere are qualified people criticizing that garbage of a documentary:\nhttps://sciencebasedmedicine.org/what-the-health-a-movie-with-an-agenda/\nhttps://www.vegan.com/vegan-dietitian-review-what-the-health/\n\n\"The fact that you are not able to debunk any of the shit\"\nYou defended conspiracy theorists and when I exposed them, you cried about \"but you are cherrypicking\". If someone is arrested because of fraud, should they go free because we are cherrypicking that particular instance of them committing fraud and not the time when they are asleep and not committing any crime?\n\nYou keep drowning me with conspiracy after conspiracy and refuse to go on discord. Are you worried that you won't be able to weasel your way out there?\n\n\" I don't get why are you being a bootlicker of non vegans, I am fucking done here.\"\nYou are dumber than I thought. YOU CAN be a vegan and not believe in conspiracies. \nYou keep blindly following these stupid internet personalities and then whine about \"ad hominem\".\nIt is not ad hominem that you are being a bottlicker of conspiracy theorists when that is WHAT YOU DO over and over.\n\nIn short, you dislike Unnatural Vegan because she doesn't follow hype and presents evidence-based information. Stop beating around the bush and admit it.\nIf \"What the Health\" has been criticized to death for being misleading, I am not gonna justify it because some teenager on reddit lacking basic literacy skills said otherwise.",

"comment": "There were design flaws. [https://youtu.be/9RULbeJnfIg](https://youtu.be/9RULbeJnfIg)\n\nHere's a summary:\n\nEven though they adjusted for confounding factors they did so in a way that set up for this result. They used stratification versus modeling (modeling would've been more appropriate).\n\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\n1. For BMI they used half of their strata to control for higher regions of BMI instead of focusing on lower regions which have been statistically shown to increase fracture risk whereas the higher regions to not. This means the relative risk has been shown to be non linear but they still used a linear approach... that does not make logical sense.\n\nBMI of 15 - 25 has shown exponential increase of relative risk of fracture (e.g. relative risk of over 4 with BMI of 15, and relative risk of 3 with BMI of 18 - 20, and relative risk of 2 with BMI of 20 - 22.5) and the risk drops as you go towards 25, which becomes normal relative risk. BMI of 25 to 40 has pretty much same fracture risk, therefore controlling for this region is pointless and takes away the accuracy you could have achieved from focusing to control more precisely at 15 - 25 BMI (specifically 15 - 22.5). This is called residual confounding (present bias within confounding factor control equaling in misleading results).\n\nThe omnivore group were also skewed towards higher BMI (higher than statistically expected, e.g. expected omnivore group BMI below 20 was 13%, but in this sample it was 8.3% - that's a heavy bias!, that's just under double the expectation) should've very clearly pointed to the importance of a control towards the lower region (it biases the sample towards less fracture risk for omnivores - if you control for BMI 18.5 and under and vegan group happens to have more people that have BMI towards 15 while omnivores a BMI of 18, what do you think you will find when it has been statistically shown to exponentially increase fracture risk at such a BMI? If you control for BMI of 20 - 22.5, what do you think happen if more vegans are towards 20 versus 22 for omnivores? again, think about what has statistically been shown previously and since the expected omnivore BMI of below 20 was very significantly off, that is to be expected - that there will be a heavy skew towards higher end of the controlled ranges/strata for omnivores.\n\nSo yes, while they have controlled for BMI of 18.5 and below, and 20 - 22.5, this is still not properly controlling for BMI. Imagine if they controlled for BMI of 15 - 16 (instead of using one strata for 30 - 32.5), then 16 - 17 (instead of using one strata for 27 - 29.5), and then moved that 18.5 and below to 18 - 19, and etc). They dedicated 4 strata to ranges of 25 and over where no significant increase/decrease is to be expected! it would be a much more accurate if they focused on 15 - 25, specifically lower ranges of 20 because of the exponential growth in relative risk.\n\nUnsurprisingly, above a certain BMI (22.5) there was no difference between groups (well, there was actually an insignificant DECREASE of risk of hip fracture for vegans above BMI of 22.5...\n\n* 2. Same for calcium intake control. The same non linear relative risk increase is controlled with a linear approach.\n\nThey ended their lowest end strata control at 525 mg of calcium intake whereas exponential increase in risk has been shown at levels below that, e.g. 200 - 300 mg with a relative risk of 2.0 and over. They again used their strata for the upper range where statistically there is no reason to do so, while not controlling for the lower range where there is an insanely significant statistical reason to do so (exponential growth in relative risk has been shown).\n\nSampling again showed skewing for vegans towards the lower end of the calcium intake (e.g. if you control for 525 mg and below and more vegans intake 300 mg while more omnivores intake 500mg, you already know what you'll find based on previous research - increased fracture risk).\n\n* 3. They also didn't control for vitamin D. I mean... what?\n* 4. To add to this, the vegans had an average fiber intake of 27g of fiber per day. Yes while reaching the recommended amount that's still extremely low for a vegan. I can eat more than that in a single meal without trying... How do you get less fiber in a day per 3 meals than I do in a single meal? even if I were to eat crap for the rest of the day I'd get double the fiber they do. Seriously, do their vegan meals consist of mainly french fries, crisps with coke and then a half can of beans? a little bit healthier than SAD vegan population was studied?\n\nSo to sum up: modeling versus stratification is what was required. Despite that, since they did stratification they should've at least done it logically rather than adjust for ranges where you wouldn't expect any significant difference and ignore the ranges where you would.\n\nAnd BTW, what they actually found wasn't VEGANS increased fracture risk, it was postmenopausal female VEGANS (I guess news headlines aren't as click baity with an accurate representation?). Male vegoons did not have a statistically significant increased fracture risk.\n\nThe worst part of this is, is that Dr. Grath Davis and Dr. Greger praised the study... I'm slowly beginning to lose trust in those doctors, as they seem to not be as objective as I previously thought. I'm slowly jumping on board on the Dr. Avi train. He has a much less BS tolerance approach. That's what matters to me in research. Objectivity.",

You can then lock down their position that they need to defend, and running NTT on someone honest about their position on dogs is trivial.\n\nBut if the conversation begins with the person stating an opinion on pigs or other animals exploited for food, I don't think you have an option but to defend the analogy with humans. To defend the initial claim, people will bite the bullet on eating dogs more than I would have expected.\n\nSo I say stand firm. Make the person explain why they're uncomfortable, and push through that discomfort. Even if the conversation ends with the person thinking they're uncomfortable talking to vegans about veganism instead of thinking it's fun to troll vegans, you've made progress.",

Easily, there's going to be backlash, because it's really difficult to tell people how bad what they're doing is when they tried so hard to get there. I don't know how to be better - the fakeness stems from me, so it's my responsibility to get it out. We must separate reducitarianism from veganism to survive. Reducitarianism has its place, but it's not with veganism (except for the 'possible' and 'practicable' parts). It's with carnists. Vegans can't be doing the work on behalf of carnists to relieve them of their duties. \n\nFar too long the pseudo vegan gatekeepers telling people how much or little vegan they can be have run wild, so I'm pushing the gates open back at them. They resist, but where there's 1 of them, there's at least 2 behind them asking for me. So I don't let those down. Once the floodgates open, it'll be upwards from there.\n\nI'm just 1 person.\n\nOf course there's needs to repeat. Environmentalism and health are ethical reasons, but those are just 2 pillars, there's many more that bring veganism together. Everyone would need to go on repeat for veganism lol.",
