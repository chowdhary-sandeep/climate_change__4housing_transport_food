{"transport":[{"comment_index":11300,"comment":"It's useful to compare the fuel costs of different size vehicles. If I implied otherwise, that was my mistake. But I think you missed *my point*, which is that if you're going to compare the fuel economy of an ICE vehicle to that of an EV in an EV forum, you ought to distinguish between the fuel savings attributable to electrification and the fuel savings attributable to other factors.\n\nI like the Chevy Volt. In fact, I like it a whole lot. Until we get much better battery energy density, I think the Volt's architecture is the best architecture for plug-in hybrids, because it reduces the redundancy of components and systems. \n\nNevertheless, a significant portion of the Volt's fuel cost savings are attributable to the Volt's efficiency as a *gasoline powered* vehicle, given that (according to the article that generated all these comments) its *gasoline fuel economy* is 36 MPG. That's a *very impressive* figure for a car that big. The Volt gets great mileage from both fuel sources. All I'm saying is that, for accuracy's sake, you should be comparing likes to likes. No need to drink the Kool-Aid. EVs are good enough without having to cook the numbers.\n\nBy the way, as a matter of conjecture, I think the Volt's superior gasoline fuel economy might be attributable to the role of the gas engine in its architecture. From my understanding, it exists purely to recharge the battery, and the car itself is always driven by the electric motor. I believe this greatly reduces the size of the Volt's engine, and takes advantage of electricity's efficiency. That much said, for purposes of these comments, I'm accepting the original author's numbers on the miles attributable to the gas engine and those attributable to pure electric operation, and the fuel economy figures he's given.\n\nEnjoy your Volt. I have nothing bad to say about it. If I were going to buy a hybrid, that's the one I'd want.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00021058283649229756,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2582651804495282,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1504216843247457,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33083575977086466,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26038199593868633,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16950094753511621,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10608385441688976,"ev_1":-0.16561903271327788,"ev_2":-0.23385661699681776,"ev_3":-0.19379306587223535,"ev_4":-0.004731341685934846,"ev_5":-0.02113189021353416,"ev_6":-0.24569650479376529},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Which, if anything, I think might be too high. I'd like to know how the EPA deals with the use of climate control, because it has a very different impact on an EV's mileage than it does on an ICE car's mileage.\n\nIn ICE cars, using the heater doesn't affect gas mileage because it runs on excess engine heat that otherwise goes off into the air. Using the A/C only has a slight impact on ICE mileage (I think about 4%, max), because its powered by the alternator, which gets its power from the car's kinetic energy. In an EV, both the heat and A/C run directly off the battery, and their use cuts fuel economy by 30% or so. Headlight use also drains EVs, but by how much I'm not sure.\n\nSo I've always been curious about EPA testing procedures for EVs.\n\np.s.: I started keeping tabs on my fuel economy this past January when I installed a Level 2 charger and an appliance meter. From what I can tell, the only things that have affected my numbers have been the weather and how flat the ground I drive on is.

I shopped for home chargers for my Think City earlier this year, and while you could get higher powered ones, the typical (and more reasonably priced) ones were designed for 20 amp, 240 volt circuits, i.e. the same as the ones that you use to hook up a clothes dryer. You hook to a 20 amp circuit; the charger is rated for 16 amps max; it uses about 14.5 amps. Electric appliance ratings, I've discovered, tend to be higher than what they actually draw from the plug.\n\nOn that \"20 amp\" (but really 14.5 amps) charger, the Spark and the LEAF will have the same charging times. If you use a public Blink charger that's running at 30 amps (but I bet closer to 27 or 28), then you'll get that double charging speed. But you'll pay a very large premium for doing it. Here in the Seattle area, Blink charged me $2 for 35 cents worth of electricity. I don't know if they charge more for 30 amp (6.6 kW/h) service, but even if they give a LEAF twice as much juice for the same price they'd charge you or me, it's still a big markup that pretty much negates your fuel savings relative to gasoline.\n\nBack to the home chargers. After all, this is where the vast majority of EV charging gets done. If you get a 30 amp charger you'll pay more for it, and you might need an upgrade to your electric service, and breaker box, depending on what's there. Maybe even a city inspection. But for a dryer circuit hook up? Almost never. I'm fine with a 7-hour charge at home, myself. And that's empty to full. My charges typically run five to six hours, because I hardly ever run it within shouting range of empty. And as soon as the summer ends, I'm going to go to \"20/80\" charges, which will mean that most of my charges will be 60% of the battery's capacity, or 15 kWh, which will be round-about 4 hours.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.01924442022573203,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20266114669405333,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17789064328971993,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18040952645242214,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.37744427172723743,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18521326324782308,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15885647020574348,"ev_1":-0.21340793359862195,"ev_2":-0.015659699756118545,"ev_3":-0.2384779084938156,"ev_4":-0.1661654903764429,"ev_5":-0.0008595713455482231,"ev_6":-0.059036359041783726},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I have a Genesis sedan that I'm leasing until August so I have to wait until then. I have done a ton of research on electric cars and I have decided I'm getting the e-Golf and even test drove one recently.\n\n1. Don't buy an electric car right now. It's stupid because if Tesla really does create a mass market $35,000 car with 200+ mile range then anything you buy today will be a piece of crap compared to the Tesla Model 3. That also means that your resale value will be incredibly low and you'll either be forced to drive a car with very little comparable range or lose a lot of money on a 3 year old car. Let the dealership absorb the depreciation and lease an e-Golf instead.\n\n2. The e-Golf is a great car, it feels like a real car and has more usable cargo space than the Leaf. It also isn't as ugly as a Leaf, which looks like someone ate, then vomited an escargot (it was designed by the French). There have been some issues with car as reported by the e-Golf owners' Facebook page. Issues regarding the 12 volt battery have come up as well as issues regarding the VW Car-Net app (kind of like VW's version of On-Star) where the app doesn't interface with the car properly to allow things like delayed charging (so that you can program the car to charge during off-peak hours). Mechanically however there hasn't been anything brought up by owners of the car. It's a very simple design with just a 1 speed direct gearbox. Aside from that, since the e-Golf is built on the same body as every other Golf there are a ton of after-market accessories and parts like hitches, bike racks etc. that will bolt on without an issue. Also, every e-Golf owner that encountered issues has said that VW's corporate customer care should always be contacted regarding any issues since even the best VW dealers are pretty clueless about how to fix e-Golf issues. If you open up a service ticket with VW Care they will interface with the dealer and tell them WTF is up. Otherwise you'll spend more time at the dealer than you have to.\n\n3. Do your research on charging at home. If you cannot charge your e-Golf at home you'll be giving up the biggest advantage of owning an EV - which is always having a full charge when leaving home. Also charging at public chargers can cost nearly as much as gasoline depending on where you're forced to charge. It's good that you can charge at your main office, but learn how much it will cost to set up a home charger before getting an EV. Also, don't bother spending big bucks on the Bosch charger that VW recommends. It's a hard-wired charger and it's more expensive than a simple and equally compatible Clipper Creek HCS 40P which you can unplug and take with you if you ever move.\n\nBTW, what state do you live in?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0027384865873803696,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23841652311340863,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21659938216830973,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.271258775098769,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15697413537006039,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3107294844468811,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0874091632431373,"ev_1":-0.13462488065942735,"ev_2":-0.07825842220336199,"ev_3":-0.2208699050067715,"ev_4":-0.021997849146525066,"ev_5":-0.025290389855702717,"ev_6":-0.12561716247970858},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

The first is range, and the second is the time it takes to charge. Since you use the term \"petrol\" I assume you are in the UK. These may not be as big of an issue with the distances you generally drive there. I'm in the US, and I have some good friends who live 380 miles away, considerably too far for an EV or even an ICE on one tank. With an ICE I can stop for 5 minutes, fill up the tank and I'm on my way. With an EV I have to stop and charge, which would take at least 40 minutes. That's an inconvenience most people (at least in America) won't endure. And assuming EVs become the standard, if everyone has to stop for 40 minutes to charge the infrastructure would be unsustainable. At this point I may not even be able to find charging stations at reasonable intervals between here and there.\n\nIf the road is charging my car as I drive, range and time to charge both become non-issues. I can drive as far as I want. I don't think these would be needed for residential streets or even major roads in urban areas, but when you get onto long stretches of road in rural areas, this technology would allow EVs to compete with ICEs.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.15770135756577197,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24720249324062687,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1560743019833271,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19806156290536361,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.04018498142249882,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21382521786730976,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21772078213204318,"ev_1":-0.13394954633715853,"ev_2":-0.06346581330702368,"ev_3":-0.16857122290336216,"ev_4":-0.18694256190272418,"ev_5":-0.030970890579434734,"ev_6":-0.10734654090556592},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes (injunctive: \"most people (at least in America) won't endure\" the inconvenience of charging EVs)","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

So from the point of view of backup power, it's a very convenient solution.\n\nAccording to that link, if you later get a solar system, you can go with a standard grid-tied solar install and just get it put in on the house-side of the Powerwall.  The grid-tied inverter thus becomes tied to the Powerwall's \"grid\", so when the real grid goes down, the solar panels will keep on generating power and will top up the Powerwall's batteries.  While the grid is up, the Powerwall will accept the extra power from the solar panel inverter and once it's fully charged, it will pass the excess back out to the grid like a normal grid-tied system.\n\nThis appears to be a very simple (if somewhat expensive) way to get the best of all worlds - backup power to ride out short blackouts, solar charged, grid feed-in, and working when the grid is down.\n\nNote that I'm not an expert with this and I'm basing all this on that one web page, so be sure to do your research thoroughly if this turns out to be the way you want to go!

The Bolt is an excellent example of just how ill-prepared legacy auto is for this challenge. They tried to go cheap-and-easy with large format pouch cells outsourced to LG. That choice is going to get magnified with larger vehicles like the Hummer when thermal runaway in the pouches looms large trying to move 9,000lbs. Ford's likely in for similar rough seas as evidence by the Mach-E GT limiting peak power to only 5s. Once again: large format pouch cells. It's no mistake that Tesla, Rivian and Lucid use smaller cylindrical cells. Tesla uses prismatic cells in some base Model 3s right now only because they're LPF and don't have the same thermal runaway problems.\n\nThis is going to be messy. I see mistakes being made right now by these big giants that are going to make for some really bad times.

Historically, power utilities made money by \"selling\" electricity.  In reality, they are also selling the infrastructure to deliver that electricity.  At the generation plant, the utility typically can produce electricity for between 2 and 4 cents per kilowatt hour.  They sell the electricity typically for about 4 times the cost of generation.  The difference between cost of generation and price to the customer pays for maintaining the distribution lines, services debt, and provides a regulated profit.  When a person puts solar panels on their roof, they are no longer paying more than a pittance of the amount they would previously have consumed.  This means that the utility still has to pay to maintain the infrastructure but no longer has the revenue from the home with solar panels.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have very little empathy for the utilities.

They are heavily funded, and granted, and with that much money on the table, it's more for profit then science now.

High pressure sales tactics exist for a reason... \n\nThe only way the local installers can afford to break even on a Sunrun install is to go as fast as possible and cheap out where they can. They only pay like $.50/watt to install, obtain a permit, and buy all of the BOS (electrical hardware not including the panels or inverter). \n\n2.9% is NOT your interest rate. Calculate the total of the payments you will make over the 20 years and you will reveal an implied interest rate of the PPA in the mid-teens. Your payments increase by 2.9% per year, that's not what interest is. As you state, a HELOC or PACE will be in the low single digits for an interest rate with **zero** escalation per year. That means your payment gets cheaper every year because of inflation, and you continue to save more money compared to SDG&amp;E.\n\nAs you state, you don't know if the specs are equivalent. That's OK. Let a local shop educate you on what matters. Personally I think Canadian Solar panels and Solar Edge inverters is the best deal and best value going right now. \n\nAs others have stated, a PPA complicates the sale of your home and gives you no tax credit or tax write off for interest. You're on the hook for all of the interest in a PPA. I don't mean to be combative or talk shit but I am ashamed of having conned a couple hundred people into solar leases in a previous life :/ They may be saving some money but they paid a **huge** premium because of using the company I used to work for. You can and should get a better deal - energy is a commodity why pay more?\n\nYou also state above that HELOC payments would be about the same as a PPA. That's a no brainer - if the payments are the same AND you get the tax credit AND get to write off the interest that's a huge savings compared to a PPA. Maintenance is a scare tactic to get you to pay a premium. There is little to no maintenance required on a typical a solar array.\n\nI'll share a little story here as well. I worked for a small local shop for the past couple of years before moving on recently for a host of reasons. One of my clients reached out to me on Facebook a couple of months ago to let me know how thankful he was for using our company instead of SolarCity (a much more major company than Sunrun). His neighbor got a system through SolarCity. The neighbors' house caught fire because of shoddy wiring of the inverter to the sub panel where the system was interconnected, and had a lot of damage. They were lucky to not lose the entire house.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.21477377474851286,"1.1.1_stance":-0.33429587831556773,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.29082173747819245,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22024611479630818,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.04021843187251761,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2463696848379348,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03239541037085777,"solar_1":-0.2838801070430095,"solar_2":-0.07711572920935925,"solar_3":-0.10337266150902175,"solar_4":-0.2547081940374465,"solar_5":-0.04315363779945377,"solar_6":-0.19497126533917952,"solar_7":-0.09501095366916464,"solar_8":-0.0337147763285975,"solar_9":-0.0182652955440048,"solar_10":-0.23759140780789162},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.

Prices are going to vary some by market. I also found some bidders pad their first offer and knocked off over $6k from first to BAFO. \n\nWhen comparing, I used the committed annual production rather than $/kw. (Just because you bought a 325w panel doesn’t mean it’s going to give you that much power and definitely not all day and all year.) The committed production takes into account clipping and seasonal variation so I personally found that the best measure. \n\nMy goal is 100% offset. Using the production method and net metering I estimated the offset value vs utility cost to generate an ROI.  (I ignored the bidders savings estimates because they’re all inflated.) Because different equipment and mounting techniques are used, different installations on the same house will yield different production. In simplest terms, some panels are physically bigger than others so you may not get the same production per sqft in your most optimum areas - so to me, a watt is not a watt. \n\nFinancing: I found each installer has their own financing partnerships. They’re pretty close overall. Depending on your credit situation it could be favorable to use their financing despite the hefty origination fees (ranged from 5-10%). Terms were up 20 years as low as 2.9%. So a comparable HELOC at 4.5% or more might not win after adding closing costs and subtracting possible tax deductions (and installer cash discount). It also doesn’t lock up equity if you want to tap it later for other home improvements. Definitely explore all options. Some credit unions offer solar loans as well. \n\nTechnology: what the top reply said. In my research, the SolarEdge optimizers option was my preference.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006481234740931541,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25171449258113193,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16943408105692015,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18148411934574446,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.0909290563173167,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3645150692850659,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.14280025952029973,"solar_1":-0.06296902731896352,"solar_2":-0.18538299309325781,"solar_3":-0.06793614645478858,"solar_4":-0.06652502367517306,"solar_5":-0.21363953646747783,"solar_6":-0.11066975012848464,"solar_7":-0.017160929327170987,"solar_8":-0.2572234048032745,"solar_9":-0.03513134279091901,"solar_10":-0.17975435096700842},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

I think your ROI period is quite large in this case considering that you have a house that requires a lot of work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy advice for you would be to first repair the roof before winter and make sure no one changes the orientation of the roof i.e. keep the high solar efficiency as it is for the future. Second, I would recommend you to renovate your old equipment that are using way too much electricity. Why I would recommend this over a solar plant for now is that roof is a necessity as you mentioned, but the home appliances may fail on you someday soon and you will have to change them regardless. So, again it might be an extra expense and you probably would end up not needing to invest in a large solar system because of the new appliances having better efficiency.\n\nAlso, please check for phantom loads or energy leaks in the system. It's very unusual but a good electrician should verify it for you assuming the house's wiring is quite old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, a 15.5KWp solar system installation should only cost you around 16-18k USD in Washington state, not taking the incentives or tax benefits into account. I am not talking about any cheap system here either, I usually charge that much for such a system along with free AMC until the system generates 50% of ROI. So, I am sorry to assume that your installer might be taking a huge profit margin on you. I am estimating this price on what it cost me for such a system but that needed more civil work and MMS structures (flat roof). For such a roof slope, the MMS prices should be non-existent comparatively speaking and would require next to no civil work.\n\nTake care man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.\n\nI am not marketing my company here, I can't install your system by any means.

It's not too common- the geographical features needed for it at scale are pretty rare.\n\nImplementation of this for energy storage at home would be troublesome. If you got everything set up they way you describe, you would still have issues due to the way solar panels react to load. \n\nA PV cell can support drawing some amount of current that varies continually as available light changes. Unfortunately, it does not self-regulate with a load- the voltage is more or less constant, until the current increases over whatever the cell can source right that second. Once that current is exceeded, voltage drops to almost nothing, even if current is reduced. For the cell voltage to recover, the load has to be removed entirely.\n\nIf you got a DC motor running off the PV string directly, it would stop as soon as a cloud went over, and not come back online. It probably would never start, even, due to the inrush current required to start a motor.\n\nWhat inverters do is have a microcontroller continually monitor voltage and current. It can sense the voltage starting to drop off (even though it is a very steep curve) and adjust the inverter power to keep production on top of the power peak. This is called MPPT. \n\nThe inverters you can buy with a batteryless backup do so by limiting power to much, much less than the STC power of the array, maybe a quarter of it. This way they have a pretty decent chance of operating under the point where voltage would collapse, and shutdowns won't happen too often, except maybe early morning and late evening when the sun is low.\n\nHere is a post with further reading:\n\nhttps://syonyk.blogspot.com/2018/05/why-typical-home-solar-setup-does-not-work-off-grid.html","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.011513534933328629,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12394543689365492,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17530626841015223,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23825793929846076,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20794920281867654,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18193962303245428,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12220263094786787,"solar_1":-0.12084447696234017,"solar_2":-0.1004631508070772,"solar_3":-0.29307817098559735,"solar_4":-0.07629991012034974,"solar_5":-0.09144855064007407,"solar_6":-0.024515675232881524,"solar_7":-0.0129141385332332,"solar_8":-0.013512130713327982,"solar_9":-0.03538527487266663,"solar_10":-0.26457796465908506},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

There are a million things to criticize China about, but their increasing focus on environmentalism is not one of them.

They pollute because it improves their bottom line. Quarterly profitability is the single most important responsibility of a company, and they will do *anything* to achieve it. It creates extremely short term planning that demands immediate results, so even though 'preventative measures' are obvious, it's not in the interests of the billionaire stakeholders because they only care about the next 3 months. Pollution occurs because it's cheaper to dispose of waste improperly than to recycle or reduce waste. If they had an opportunity to make money in other ways, i.e the multi-billion dollar waste recycling industry, they would pursue those avenues instead.

Also has the advantage that you can track the sun with it...","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00016162279886581624,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17881360545554797,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2582593194307382,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21198110406597456,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.38281293770495495,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22494703092491225,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04301249205309432,"solar_1":-0.005076951124162103,"solar_2":-0.02687282598344609,"solar_3":-0.0015391398228530306,"solar_4":-0.0007856964778814776,"solar_5":-0.0003592429420677945,"solar_6":-0.0002897376155791183,"solar_7":-0.0006468553619924933,"solar_8":-0.0004274799721315503,"solar_9":-0.02204298808646854,"solar_10":-0.003961497864414317},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

During the week I goto a potential house, look at attic structure for load, their MSP for the possible tie in, take laser tape measurements for either the LG Chem Or POWERWALL 2, and a drone flies over the exterior for pitch, shingle quality and obstructions.  All this can be done in less than 1hr, after I show them the proposed energy offset with their proposed array.\nThe boutique company can schedule the install within 3-5days once the ink is dry from the client. Sales, site audit and installation experience combines into one position. What took three or more employees to do, plus a month or two for install, I can do in an hour. Previous company “wanted” vertical integration, but each of these three components never “jived” the best way. Imagine three LeBrons running each phase….sales were incentivized by the number of PV mods they could place, regardless of array azimuth…..site audits couldnt discuss potential offset/roof conditions, and install got the brunt of these two steps.\n\nThe solar wave is only getting taller and stronger, as advancements in applied materials improve. Was looking at 450w mods last night and they cost as much as 285w mods in 2014! \n\nOn weekends/off days during the week, I use FLIR on my drone, to see thermal defects at large scale solar farms.

My biggest recommendation is to do all the research figure out how you would design the system if you were to do it yourself and then discuss that with your installer.

I'm sure they have shown you this:\n\nhttps://us.sunpower.com/sites/default/files/media-library/data-sheets/ds-e20-series-327-residential-solar-panels.pdf\n\nRead number 1 in the fine print. They are comparing their 327w panel with 20.4% efficiency to a 250w panel with 15.3% efficiency. Basically they are lying and hope nobody reads the fine print. \n\nAlso, their inverters are white label enphase inverters. I am not a fan of micro inverters. String inverters  are solid, time tested with lots of great, modern features.  I love knew technology but you have to step back and look at the big picture.  New doesn't necessarily mean better. \n\nEphase spent over $40 million on marketing in the first quarter of 2022. That is why you see micros everywhere. They spent more on marketing than R&amp;D.  Go look up their financials it's all there. \n\nAlso, enphase never covers labor on any of their products, ever. I'm not sure what their agreement with Sunpower is but I can't imagine it's much different. Any installer who wants to stay in business, Sunpower or otherwise, needs to account for that in pricing.

Our regional installer actually has their own school in cooperation with the community college, and they are always hiring. But we're in Maine, not Florida. BTW, there are lots of jobs for workers other than rooftop installers/electricians: sales and solar design (often combined to some extent), supply, accounting, marketing, HVAC (because heat pumps go well with solar), etc, &amp;c. For every electrician or other technician-level qualified person working for a rooftop installer, there can be as many as three or four other workers, most of whom are in-house trained or recycled from unrelated bachelors degrees, usually in the sciences. This recycling effect is particularly true for sales/solar design, where it helps to have good graduate math and computer skills, although there's usually no actual degree requirement for the job, just an understanding that having had undergraduate math and particularly computer math, helps a lot. The solar power station business has an additional demands for ground mount crews, engineers, and computer science types to manage the software side.

But it's not entirely unrelated, either.\n\nThe problem, as I see it, is that there are very few vegetarians (or vegans) who don't hold a couple of unscientific food-related beliefs not immediately related to vegetarianism. The vegetarian recipe book I have in front of me right now, for instance, claims that cinnamon damages your nerves, ketchup hurts your kidneys, vinegar troubles your stomach, and pepper increases your blood pressure. (Yes, these recipes are pretty bland!) Indian-inspired vegetarians often hold Ayurvedic ideas about what you should or shouldn't eat, and Rudolf Steiner's vegetarian followers believe that tomato is poisonous and potato makes you stupid. \n\n(I'm not denying that lots of omnivores hold strange food-related beliefs, btw. It's just that it's less likely to leave us malnourished.)\n\nMore alarmingly, I sometimes see claims in vegetarian circles that things aren't so serious as all that, you can easily get all the vitamin B12 you need from mushrooms, etc. I think it is because ethical vegetarians - reasonably, in a sense - distrust information originating from animal-killing society, and correspondingly place more faith in what their vegetarian circle of friends believe. I hope that you as responsible vegans take especially care to confront such beliefs, and maybe even discourage lacto/ovo-vegetarians from going vegan \"on their own\" without contact with the wider vegan community.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3178333835917518,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18466696619033768,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19724884451717475,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.266646396303238,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18114615020631392,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16985216152876276,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16731844365055273,"diet_1":-0.26743143791371293,"diet_2":-0.4608881062425401,"diet_3":-0.24741350957268313,"diet_4":-0.01717226814859411,"diet_5":-0.012349959174268102,"diet_6":-0.06264996005605401,"diet_8":-0.00405139965005219,"diet_9":-0.022531617313992076,"diet_10":-0.08622224075588747,"diet_11":-0.009480065091338474,"diet_13":-0.22479294248235723,"diet_14":-0.10027368326353464,"diet_17":-0.15856113167214167},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

You're still new in a world where you're not a psychopath and it feels like everyone else are, including the people you love the most. You get used to it.\n\nBeing a vegan in this world can be incredibly depressing, but there are good things too, even besides not supporting animal cruelty.\n\n&gt; If one of my omni friends told me they were eating a burrito made of dog meat...I wouldn't think any less of them at all.\n\nThat is one of them. Before I would get so sad to hear someone had hurt their pets. I couldn't deal with living in a world where people would torture a puppy or light a kitten on fire. But now? It's a small thing compared to the billions of animals we harm and kill every single year. That doesn't make it OK, of course, but when I got used to the farm practices, I got used to the casual animal abuse by \"normal\" people too. I even got used to people harming children. I believe a life is a life, at least when that life has the ability to feel pain and we have no reason to believe it's not sentient like us. If a black child or a dog is tortured, that is every bit as bad to me as a white child being tortured, since I'm not a racist or a speciesist. When I learned billions of farm animals are being harmed every day, I became incredibly depressed, then went numb, because, I assume, my body figured out that caring less was the only way to stop me from jumping off a bridge.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.265638357976768,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19809901203136956,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1898693419417148,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2905761076369147,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2063548343809925,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29015412088180237,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05665752299440404,"diet_1":-0.02926274454027104,"diet_2":-0.14668241339578003,"diet_3":-0.07400273699749722,"diet_4":-0.02539366915152641,"diet_5":-0.012590954584690431,"diet_6":-0.02620443594059907,"diet_8":-0.007802803464680134,"diet_9":-0.0035686518410026715,"diet_10":-0.012775225104026807,"diet_11":-0.005563209303848756,"diet_13":-0.020677678869105875,"diet_14":-0.15172238789091352,"diet_17":-0.004334929069348921},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Sorry, but I think you've got that exactly wrong. Both historically and presently, the consumption of animal products is the privilege of the rich and powerful. The poorest nations tend to be the most plant-based, while the richest have the highest level of animal consumption (often to grotesque proportions).\n\nWithal, suggesting that the adoption of a plant-based diet is the purview of the affluent seems... inaccurate. Making such an assertion is somewhat like claiming that _\"we in the first world, unlike poor nations, have a choice in our spending habits and we should be thankful that we can choose to live the simple lives of hermits\"_, you know?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&gt;It's like if the #metoo movement was about convincing people not to engage in sexual assault or harassment, rather than about bringing the reality of it to light and creating a shift to a culture that doesn't tolerate exploitation and sexual assault in the workplace.\n\n---\n\nRight?

Ok so the part that convinced him (not necessarily my mom bc she’s pretty jaded when it comes to “diets”) was the blood centrifuge test thing. He didn’t flip a switch but he wants to work his way up so he ate plant based yesterday and tried a vegan burger and loved it! \n\nI was so shook bc we’re from Tx and over the summer I had been eating a lot of plant based foods-I’m also working my way to full plant-based but I’m much farther than them as I sometimes go full weeks of pure plant based. Over the summer my dad would kind of poke fun at my meals saying he liked his food w a little more meat (not mean spirited but joking dumb dad jokes lol). So as you can imagine I was shooketh when I got that text haha.\n\nAnyways I’m going to continue to encourage them to eat plant based and try other foods. Advent is coming up for us (we Catholic) and sometimes people do “resolutions” so I may suggest that they go plant based for Advent!

I had to add in some eggs to my diet because I no longer can process fiber very well as I developed severe gastroparesis, and getting protein from vegan sources without a lot of fiber is limited and also rather difficult. Also, really expensive and to be frank, I can’t afford fake meat or vegan protein powder for every meal. Even with working with a dietitian for almost 6 months, I ended up nearly needing a feeding tube because my kidneys and liver started struggling due to the protein malnutrition and the massive weight loss. \n\nI don’t know if I can call myself vegan still, but even though I have a medical reason to eat some animal products, I try to limit my intake to the minimum needed, as well as limit my harm in other areas (no zoos, only getting CF and vegan body care products, no leather or wool, etc…) \n\nI hope one day that my body will allow me to be able to sustain itself on a vegan diet, and until then, I’ll do my best everywhere else I can. There’s more industries that use animal exploitation and cause harm to them than just the food industry, so those are areas that I can focus on trying to make an impact on what I do and don’t consume.\n\nETA: I was vegan for nearly 5 years with very few issues before my gastroparesis went from mild to severe almost overnight.

It's already difficult for people with IBS to handle diets high in insoluble fiber, and you should have your partner checked for IBD, in which case, she could be actively triggering her immune system to attack her digesting system, which can cause permanent scarring, strictures, and the need for intestinal resections. Take if from someone who has Crohn's Disease and has not followed his doctors' orders to stick to a simple carb and animal product diet, minimizing fruits and vegetables (especially green leafy vegetables), and who has, as a result, required 12 feet of intestines to be removed and an ileostomy. If I require one more resection, I will either die, or be put on a feeding tube, and my research says that there is no such thing as a vegan feeding tube. A feeding tube also substantially decreases life expectancy, not to mention quality of life.\n\nThe fact that she appears to be tolerating a vegetarian diet that is not **raw** is already a lucky turn of events for her. When someone has IBD / IBS, cooking foods at least breaks down some of the fiber. If you go raw, you will not be breaking down the fiber, and there is a risk that she could end up quite sick with permanent damage.\n\nGo get your partner to a gastroenterologist to see what is going on with her. \"We suspect\" is not a good enough answer: you need to know what her condition is.
