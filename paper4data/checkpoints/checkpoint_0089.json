"comment": "Here's a good one:\nhttp://evmc2.wordpress.com/2010/08/22/glossary-of-ev-battery-motor-and-general-electrical-terms/\n\nHappy to clarify any terms if I know what they mean!\n\nHere are two commonly misused terms:\n\n\"charger\" - the charger is the power electronics that converts AC power input into the appropriate DC voltage / current levels to charge your battery safely. A J1772 EVSE (EV supply equipment) is not a charger - it supplies AC grid power to the car's onboard charger.\n\nA CHAdeMO quick charge station is an offboard charger - offboard meaning that it is not installed on the vehicle. Because it is not stored on the vehicle it can be much larger and much more powerful, which is why a Nissan LEAF (for example) can charge 80% in about 30 minutes with CHAdeMO off board charger (50 kW) or in about 3.5 hours with the onboard charger (6.6 kW).\n\n\"battery\" - a battery is an assembly of cells, comes from the term artillery battery. It is usually incorrect to refer to an EV's \"batteries\" unless you mean the 12V lead acid battery (typically six 1.5V cells) as well as the traction pack battery (cell configuration varies from car to car).",

"comment": "The blue batteries are CALB LiFePO4 cells. Each one is 3.2v and 100ah.  The total capacity is 16kwh at 48v.  They have 2000+ cycle life and are safer (less likely to burn) then some other lithium chemistries. But the voltage per cell is a little lower. It takes 16 lifepo4 to make a 48v pack but only 14 Li-ion cells. \n\nThe blocks of black batteries are around 4 kwh each. I use those for various EV projects.  The lead batteries on the rack are 12v 75ah AGM in theory 15kwh but realistically half that.\n\nSo everything pictured in total is about 35kwh, about half a Tesla",

"comment": "In general, you can't do that. The J1772 gives you two hot lines and a ground. There is no neutral with which you could derive 120V, as you typically would with North American split-phase power. And you can't treat the ground as a neutral, since EVSEs have built-in RCDs and will detect any ground fault and turn the power off.\n\nYou could use a step-down transformer, but it's going to have to be sized for the amount of current your battery charger takes.\n\nBetter would be to get a battery charger that can take 120V, 208V or 240V.\n\nNow, you *could* just use an 882 ohm resistor and a 1N4148 diode from the pilot to ground to force the EVSE to supply power, but that's crude and not very standards compliant.",

All the brash, \"Tesla should be shaking in their boots\" statements seemed odd until I remembered it was Motor Trend. \n\nEven though it was an article designed to showcase the best car (in their opinion) for 2017, ~~I was disappointed to that self-driving hardware was really only mentioned in veiled terms:~~ *It's interesting that a non-production competitor would get so many words without mentioning the real difference in hardware between the two*\n&gt;The Bolt EV comes standard with a lane departure warning system that despite some self-steering capability is really only to assist drivers\n\nI say this, of course, because a car that was not even in the tests (Model 3, *because it's not available) was the most often cited as the Bolt's biggest competitor and is [known](http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-announces-new-autopilot-self-driving-2016-10) to be equipped with self-driving hardware. \n\nedit* This the tone of this article makes a little more sense considering Elon was awarded Motor Trend's [Person of the Year.](http://www.motortrend.com/news/2017-power-list-and-the-person-of-the-year/) They seem to be poking the bear a little because they're excited about what comes next.\n\nedit2* this has been a fun endeavor in trying to make myself clear.",

"comment": "Ok. But there were no misconceptions spread by climate activists in this article. The opposite is true and that is all I am talking about. \n\nYes everything is biased. Some articles are more biased than others. This is a good example of a very biased article for all the reasons I previously mentioned.  Again, I am not reading anything into the author or their motives. This is just a factually one sided article with a good example of cherry picking that we’ve been discussing. \n\nIt’s not a strange statement for all the reasons mentioned. You yourself admitted that the comparison of the Tesla to the mirage was misleading. The author didn’t lie outright about numbers but presented them with false equivalence as if those vehicles were comparable, for instance.  The title is distracting clickbait. The article is misleading even if it isn’t filled with falsehoods exactly as I said. \n\nBy what authority does the author get to present a blatantly biased article and get it automatically propagated throughout the blogosphere?  I am a human and I feel the need to act ethically. I am presenting nothing other than facts and balancing arguments for a biased source of information.  It is all right here in front of you, or anyone else, for all to see. \n\nIf you are asking why people make simplifying assumptions about the world and rely on specialized experts for advice on complex topics then I can’t help you. People just will take away a negative impression of EVs from this article and the way it is framed. I have nothing to do with it. The best I can do is hope others will read through this very discussion. Is it too much to ask that articles present issues is a balanced way?  What authority would you have to take that away from me (by endorsing articles like this?)  The information people see is “curated” no matter how you feel about it. The best we can hope for is that more biased interpretations are identified as such and less biased themes (such as EVs are good for environment) are instead promoted.",

I'm guessing the inaccurate number originated from the Bloomberg tracker which is very inaccurate of late.\n\nThey produced 80,000 vehicles in Q3, that's an average of 6153 per week for the quarter. They have produced as high as 5000 model 3 in one week in June and dropped back in the 4000-5000 range until recently when they made 5300 in one week at the end of September. What per month rate that is we don't know but it's definitely well above 16k.\n\nIf you want to know more give it a few days for the Q3 earnings call and quarterly update letter and it'll become more clear how many they produced vs sold.\n\n&gt;* 53,239 Model 3 vehicles, which was in line with our guidance and almost double the volume of Q2. During Q3, we transitioned Model 3 production from entirely rear wheel drive at the beginning of the quarter to almost entirely dual motor during the last few weeks of the quarter. This added significant complexity, but we successfully executed this transition and ultimately produced more dual motor than rear wheel drive cars in Q3. In the last week of the quarter, we produced over 5,300 Model 3 vehicles, almost all of which were dual motor, meaning that we achieved a production rate of more than 10,000 drive units per week. \n\n&gt;* Q3 deliveries totaled 83,500 vehicles: 55,840 Model 3, 14,470 Model S, and 13,190 Model X.\n\n&gt;* 8,048 Model 3 vehicles and 3,776 Model S and X vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of Q3, and will be delivered in early Q4\n\n&gt;* Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5%. \n\nfrom http://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q3-2018-vehicle-production-and-deliveries",

So they choose an engine big enough to output the required KW efficiently, which means the efficiency at lower speeds is horrible.\n\nEVs *are* efficient at HW speeds, but HW speeds require more kw, as the resistance losses are proportional to the square of the speed. A different gear would not affect the resistance losses.",

The 5 cars listed weren't ranked so we don't know if the prius is #1, it might be #3 or #5. A honda accord is about 30 mpg, a honda civic about 32, bmw 3 series about 30 too. If you wanted to compare to say, an m3, which the model 3 performance compares with, then you're looking at 20 mpg. It's a mix. Some priuses, some sports cars etc. 30 mpg is about right, and 22 mpg is way too low.\n\nI'm sure a lot of leafs were bought as temporary cars while people waited for the \"real\" electric cars to come out (but still wanted to reduce their carbon footprint).\n\nThey did a study on this for tesla cars (before the model 3) and the results were as you might expect, lots of luxury cars and (likely) prius.\n\n[https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c\\_fit,fl\\_progressive,q\\_80,w\\_470/kfp2psc4v34vuwx3foq9.jpg](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_470/kfp2psc4v34vuwx3foq9.jpg)\n\n**Despite what people might suggest, the majority of people buying teslas are not buying them because it's green.** They're buying them because they're cool and sporty. At least, that's what the data shows.\n\n**After all, if you want an electric car for environmental reasons it's not like there aren't (far cheaper) alternatives like the leaf, kona, niro, soul, ioniq, e-golf, fiat 500e blah blah blah.**\n\nDespite being far more expensive than the leaf, and having half the federal rebate, the model 3 outsells the leaf 10 to 1. They're just good cars (although I'm in no hurry to upgrade, my ultra cheap compliance EV is doing just fine for now).",

"comment": "All these responses about being vegan is bunk. The truth is, those animals are part of a biologic trophic level, that if left alone, their populations would run rampant, as we are their \"alpha predator\" at this point in history. Instead, buy from local, free grazing, and humane ranches. No matter what, these grazing animals will exist and their populations prehistorically are very similar to today's, but consisted of wild species such as water buffalo, American bison, and even mammoth. (see Ethiopian war elephants during and before the Roman Empire)\n\nThe biggest way to reduce carbon, pesticide, and sulphur emissions is to check EROI websites for every product you purchase. Support the transition to solar and wind energy in regions that these power sources are not detrimental. (ie no migrating birds and in regions you don't have to clear land like deserts like the Atacama and Nevada)\n\nThis means that in some regions, petroleum may help reduce your EROI, while in others electric cars and natural gas will bring you to your minimum. \n\nPlant organic gardens at home or in sharecropping plots. \n\nDrive less, especially when it is for recreation and  work/school commuting. \n\nBe aware of the metals used in products and avoid buying too much electronics due to the sulfur output of copper smelting plants. Remember that the permanent neodymium magnets in many turbines are produced from copper smelting as well. \n\nPlant trees in regions with water problems, grow native shrubbery rather than grass, and above all never let the water used to irrigate anything overflow and run down sewage drains. \n\nLimit your chemical solvent and cleaner use. Instead utilize natural plant enzymes and oils.\n\nStudy environmental and geologic sciences and never hold back the scientific truth of these studies. You do have avoid arguing semantics however, and base your knowledge on cold, hard, data.",

However the Niro was my second choice, and one of the major reasons why I didn't buy one was because it isn't sold in my state and I didn't want to mess with the hassle of an interstate transfer. I don't think you would be unhappy with either one, if both are available to you.\n\nBolt advantages:\n- Greater range and slightly higher efficiency (though anecdotally Niros can exceed their rated range pretty easily)\n- Better one-pedal driving experience\n- Slightly larger cargo capacity, both with and without the rear seats folder down\n- Cheaper, even including larger tax credit available on the Niro\n- 360 degree top-down view option\n\n\nNiro advantages:\n- Heat pump for better winter range when you want or need to use cabin heat instead of heated seats\n- DC fast charging is a bit faster\n- Adaptive cruise control option\n- Power seat option\n- Large or tall people seem to think it has better seats than the Bolt\n\nOther differences like interior trim, control layout, infotainment etc are probably too subjective to put in the pro or con category.",

The 2022 Tesla Model 3 SR+ is an example of a car with this sort of battery.\n\nIf you have a nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) lithium battery (the most common), you should not allow the car to remain at charge above 90% for prolonged periods. It's best to charge to less than 90% most of the time, and only to 100% immediately prior to a long trip, or on a long-distance journey. Keeping it charged so high is going to cause a bit more wear, but really isn't too bad unless you leave it for a prolonged time at above 90%. The battery will have the longest service life if it spends most of its time in the mid-charge range (close to 50%). Most EV users with NCA batteries set a charge limit of 80% to 90% for regular charging.",

The highway range number might scare people off though. Of course exactly how you calculate that is up for debate as well. I usually drive my Lightning at 69mph and that gets me about 2.2 m/kWh where a lot of people do 75-80 and report 1.8-1.9 that is a 30 to 40 percent difference. Really maybe the window sticker should just say \"It depends\" For most people I think highway range is really what matters because home charging makes range for most commutes irrelevant.",

On those cheap packs, there is like 10 different ways a fire could start\n\nThey are designed without any consideration for the operating environment, almost all cheap pack have no consideration for the vibration they experience, and that will short things, not a matter of if, a matter of when\n\nAnd the worst part is that designing a good pack, while requires someone that knows what they are doing, there is barely additional time on the design and almost zero additional cost, you just need to do things smartly, but guess that is too much\n\nThere was a project that I was lazy and didn’t care since it was just a prototype I needed a pack to power it, if it went up in flames wouldn’t damage property or people, so I got a hoverboard replacement pack\n\nGuess what? After a single test, that barely stressed this of exposed to vibration I put it aside, 2 weeks later, without it even having been moved it went up in flames out of the blue, wasn’t even plugged in anywhere",

Which is kind of a shame, I think it's a solid, practical car for a place where range doesn't matter.",

My worry about inverters was the inconsistent current coming from the solar panels, I am no electrician but I have a feeling the panels might not be too happy with the inverter trying to draw 10a when they're only putting out 5a (made up numbers)\n\nI've heard heaters on msw tend to 'sing' a bit but that can be solved with a few caps for some smoothing. Or just transform up the DC output? A resistive load doesn't care either way about AC or DC.",

Since you're capped by usage, the higher efficiency doesn't give you any benefit. \n\nThe warranty is worth something but I've generally felt that between \"Tier 1\" suppliers, the relative added value to the offtaker is fairly small. Hanwha, Canadian/Sunpower/LG are all reliable, established and relatively solvent. \n\nSure it's \"only\" $2k, but that's ~15% of your total system cost. And it becomes a lot more over a loan period. All else being equal I'd pick Sunpower, but to me it's not worth the added cost. Hanwha is an entirely reputable company as well.",

If I am understanding correctly, on a day such as this there would be lots of excess power generated and \"sold back\" to Green Mountain/Texas New Mexico Power. My current question is how to calculate how much excess power (in dollars) is generated on a day like this given a 23 kW solar panel installation?",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Three Republican governors recently strengthened the renewable portfolio standards in their states in a sign that the link between job growth and renewable energy incentives may be trumping traditional partisan affiliations.\n\n&gt; In Ohio Gov. John Kasich went against Republican opponents of the state&amp;#039;s RPS - Sen. Bill Seitz and Rep. Ron Amstutz - when he vetoed a bill that would have effectively extended a freeze on the state&amp;#039;s RPS. Ohio is a state hard hit by the loss of jobs from closed coal plants as Kasich noted when signing the veto, the state has also benefited from the job growth associated with renewable energy.\n\n&gt; While Republican governors in some states are breaking with national interests and going in the opposite direction when it comes to renewables, Varadarajan says there is still a lot of hostility toward renewables, especially in states where mining is a mainstay of the economy.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/5opdan/as_trump_takes_office_job_growth_is_pushing_gop/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~49678 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **state**^#1 **energy**^#2 **RPS**^#3 **renewable**^#4 **power**^#5",

Specifically, the event was that for the first time ever, the lowest demand **on the transmission network** occurred during the afternoon rather than overnight.\n\nThe body of the article explains it reasonably well:\n\n&gt; The company sees the solar power generated on the distribution networks – or local roads of the system – as reduced electricity demand.\n\nAnd let's remember that there are several different types of supply on the distribution grid, not just solar. That afternoon, solar would have been the largest type, but there would also have been wind and some small fossil-fuel plants too, all reducing the effective net demand that National Grid sees.\n\nIt might also be the case that fossil production was lower during the afternoon than during the night; that may or may not have been the first time it happened, though. I'm not sure if anyone's checked that.",

"comment": "[Solar Power Rocks](https://solarpowerrocks.com/maryland/) is an excellent resource for people who don't know much about solar. \n\nTo simplify things, I would analyze your solar investment in two steps: (1) the cost to purchase the system and (2) the terms of a loan to cover the cost of that purchase.\n\n**Step 1: Purchase Price**\n\nBased upon [Solar Power Rocks,](https://solarpowerrocks.com/maryland/)  a system in Maryland has a payback period of 10 years, which can be translated to mean the system, after the various incentives, should cost about ten times your annual electricity bill savings, maybe slightly more.  Any company with a quote that is far above that ten times number is trying to gouge you.\n\nAlso, based upon [Solar Power Rocks,](https://solarpowerrocks.com/maryland/)  a system in Maryland has an internal rate of return of 10.3%.  Plug in the cost of the system after applying the incentives, the annual savings, and any other incentives (SACP's), and see if you get an IRR of around 10%.  Here's how to calculate internal rate of return using excel or google sheets https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-an-IRR-in-Excel  If the IRR is way below 10%, then the price is too high.\n\n**Step 2: Loan**\n\nYou mentioned that the loan payments are \"close to our average electrical usage.\" Does that mean above or below?  The loan payments should be less than your electricity bills.  Figure out the loan interest rate and then go to your bank to see if you can get a loan at a lower interest rate. \n\nIf you need help calculating with actual numbers, just post them here or pm me.",

Early 2017 panel pricing was around $0.35/W for utility scale orders. A 30% tariff brings that price to $0.455 (more than a $0.10/W) addition. I think the end result is a minimum of of 10 cent effective increase to installed costs. \n\n&gt;The administration can say they did something \"pro america\" and simultaneously fuck solar installers\n\nI agree that administration will spin it as a pro america decision, but the real irony behind all this is that Suniva, the group spurring all this, was actually owned by a Chinese holdings company.

Already existing chargers don't have to do anything since they've been built under a different law.  \nSince Tesla didn't want to make new or updated chargers available for everyone which would help the EV adoption they had to gate them in order to declare them not public.  \n\n&gt;It's not even a long range EV\n\nIt is long range enough for Germany and probably most parts of Europe. And it reduces the emmisions of the most driven miles which usually are done by commuting.  \nAnd what manufacturer has produced millions of EVs per year?   \n\n&gt;How does this invalidate the way it was attacked twice already through legislation?\n\nSorry I was talking about battery storage which wasn't \"attacked\" through legislation.  \n\nBut you're right Tesla didn't have much competition if you define it precisely enough.

"comment": "SolarWorld's are made in US, I believe. Their parent company in Europe went bankrupt and there was talk of the US company going bankrupt, I believe. I know they were one of the two companies involved in the solar tariff that happened in January. They do have a 3rd-party back their warranty claims, due to potential of going bankrupt. That way, if they go out of business you still have a warranty. \nI got 5 quotes in December 2017. All between ~$2.30 and ~$2.70 Price Per Watt (before tax credit). Some started out higher (Panasonics, LGs, SunPowers) but all installers seemed to be able to negotiate down to the higher end of that range. I was quoted SolarWorld's or Hyundai's at the lower end of that range. But, there are a lot of variables (and now a tariff on foreign made panels) so not saying your quotes will or should fall in that range.",

There has to be a catch.... \n\n&gt;Who will be responsible for warranty issues and maintenance of my Powerwall?\n\n&gt;As owner of Powerwall, GMP will be responsible.\n\nOh.... so you're not really owning the powerwall. GMP owns and operates it. You get to house the unit, and pay them for the privlidge. GMP gets to buy power off-peak, sell it back on-peak and pockets all the profits....\n\nSure, you get to buy the power stored in the battery should the area lose power, but that's a pretty small benefit for taking all the risks associated with housing a huge battery in your house. \n\n&gt;As a participant in the program, GMP will bill you for your net energy usage.  Any energy metered when you charge the battery will be subtracted out of your metered total when it is discharged back on to the grid.  GMP will be paying attention to how often Powerwall is charged and discharged and they will credit your bill for the electricity that is lost.\n\nSo how does GMP deal with the issue of knowing exactly how much power the powerwall takes in vs puts out? IE who pays for the loss associated with charging/discharging the battery? oh... homeowner does. You don't put 5kWh on the grid during peak and then refill it with 5kWh off peak, but they say they only credit your bill for what they put back in the grid.....\n\nThat's not exactly the same as them selling you a powerwall, fully installed with callout service for $1500.",

You still have a nice system that cranks out a lot of power every year. It's not uncommon for salespeople's projections to be very optimistic and I think that was the case here. I think the easiest way out of this dilemma is to simply readjust your expectations based on the real-world data you have now. But yes, you could try to max out the south-facing roof faces with high efficiency modules like LGs or Sunpowers to get a little more annual production. \n\nYou should be able to see what power each panel is making on the layout playback view. That should also show you the effect of the shade pretty clearly. Your northwest panels will never get up to full power... but they'll still probably make more power annually than some south-facing panels in VT!\n\nedit: I took a look at your PVOutput link and see that it peaks above 9kW on good days which is honestly pretty good for an array pointing all different directions. So I think the system is performing well given the design; you just got some misleading projections prior to the sale.",

If you get small blimps and brownouts then batteries would work well, but if there is a possibility for a multi-day outage a generator may be a better solution. \n\nFor me, I am still weighing those options because I plan on including a large reef tank down the road so power availability is important to me.",

"comment": "I think this is the part a lot of people miss.  When you finance solar through the solar installer, the finance company is getting a large chunk of the interest up front you can't get out of in the future.  You can't just refinance/roll into any other loan vehicle to save on interest or pay it off early and save money because that buydown is now part of the principal.  That is a sunk cost you have lost and you are still going to pay .99% to 3% ongoing over 10-30 years.\n\nA normal no-buydown rate for a solar loan is probably somewhere between 3-4%.  What is happening is they increase the price of the overall system to absorb 2-3% of that percentage and give it to the finance company as a \"fee\".  Then they give you a 1-3% interest rate on paper for the loan.  You are basically paying interest on interest.\n\nSolar loans in my opinion are about as bad as leasing a system.  They have the same sales strategy.  \"You are paying $150 per month, we can cut your power bill by 30%, just sign up with us for 10 years\".",

"comment": "Are you aware that solar panels create toxic waste that at this time has no safe disposal method? When a panel is done, it can't be recycled or re-purposed. It can only be thrown away, and it puts out radiation.\n\n\nhttps://www.cfact.org/2019/09/15/the-solar-panel-toxic-waste-problem/\n\n\nhttps://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/solar/the-mounting-solar-panel-waste-problem/\n\nThen there is the consideration that solar panels radiate homes with dirty power, but on that count, I'm not 100%.\n\n\nThe only energy that is consistent and long term environmentally friendly that we have access to right now is nuclear.\n\n\nSounds crazy right? Well, it's true. People are just scared of it because of the incredibly unstable nightmare facility in Chernobyl.\n\n\nThe US has them now, and they supply 20% of all electricity in the country with as little 60 total power plants, and it has only gotten more efficient with time.\n\n\nPenn and Teller did a great segment on this on their show Bullshit. It's on Hulu, so check it out. The whole show is great.",

"comment": "I think it's important to understand that it's actually not a lot of power when looking at grid scale. People regularly overestimate the effort needed to build the charging infrastructure.\n\nA typical European medium voltage line can deliver up to about 60 megawatts, so even a charging park with several charging points would not need a dedicated medium voltage line if there is an existing medium voltage line that isn't already fully utilized.\n\nYou can also compare it to the adaption of renewables to the grid, because the requirements for the infrastructure are very similar. Germany for example built about 60 GW of wind  and solar power in just 10 years. That would translate to 60.000 megawatt-chargers.",

"comment": "Please read this:  I want to talk about CCAs too.  CCAs may affect your billing and not in your favor.\n\nBut first, that True Up big bill, at least here on SDGE would be something I would see coming.  As both of our electrical providers (if we were on a CCA, this gets uncertain) use a yearly True-Up system, we see months in advance that we are not accumulating enough credits.  So there should never be a surprise unless folk stick it on auto-pay and never look.   \n\nFor example, here's a peek at a bill from well before the True-Up: [https://imgur.com/H4bSbkX](https://imgur.com/H4bSbkX)  For me it never looked to be an issue. \n\nFor those that offset at 100 or less percent, the yearly true up often has a payment due.  Mostly because when folk get solar, consumption appears to go up by 20%.\n\nNOW ABOUT THOSE CCAs.  CCA is Community Choice Aggregation.  For us it's SDCP or San Diego Community Power.\n\nThis entity was unfriendly to rooftop solar.  \n\n1. Opaque about effects on the bill.  Finger pointing from both SDCP and SDGE.\n2. Would have converted from yearly True Up to Monthly.  No rollover of credits.\n3. Auto opt-in or  enrollment.  Boo, hiss!  By the way, all legal.  See California bill AB 117.  Which I did read after they opted me in even when I opted out.\n4. For me I opted out yet they still enrolled me.  I was told I was stuck with them for the month.  No.  Just no.  I contacted every SDCP board member and was ready to pay the CPUC instead of SDCP and SDGE over this.  SDCP relented and  removed me from their program.\n\nLet me write that CCAs may or may not be a good thing for non-solar customers.  And as always there's more shenanigan's in the industry.  Read [https://voiceofsandiego.org/2022/08/15/community-power-leaders-steaming-about-sdge-price-cut-right-before-consumers-compare-rates/](https://voiceofsandiego.org/2022/08/15/community-power-leaders-steaming-about-sdge-price-cut-right-before-consumers-compare-rates/)\n\nThe CEO of SDCP was rather snarky about my problems with SDCP.  There's more to my story but my message is this:  If you are on a CCA, ask a lot of questions.  Monthly True-Up for us that overproduce is not a good thing.",

I imagine it could be configured in such a way where a roller for reapplying an elastomeric coating could pass under the panels no problem. I’d talk to a solar installer about this application.\n\nAnother thing with the chemlink - while I don’t think it’ll be a problem for you, make sure that the adhesives will bond with your roof coating. I have a special silicon coating on my roof and the standard adhesives with the Chem curb were not recommended for the application - had to get a special silicon based adhesive.",

"comment": "To date I have not heard of any warranty escrow for solar installers as you mentioned above. Instead I think it is important to do some careful research on both your installer as well as the manufacturer of the equipment they choose to install.\n\nCalifornia provides a [Solar Consumer Protection Guide](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/demand-side-management/customer-generation/california-solar-consumer-protection-guide) that has a lot of good and relevant information including questions to ask your potential solar installer. Even if you don't live in CA, it might be worth a look in regards to what questions to ask and what to look out for.\n\nRegarding the installer, if they go out of business during your install you might be stuck with an incomplete job as well as sub-contractors possibly trying to go after you for payment depending on how the job was set up.\n\nIf the installer goes out of business after your install, then any workmanship warranty they would have provided would not be valid anymore. You would generally not be able to pursue any repairs to your roof or equipment as a result of faulty installation.\n\nIf your equipment manufacturer goes out of business, you are generally SOL in terms of trying to get any type of warranty replacement for faulty equipment.\n\nLast, as a personal story of a good installer. My parents' solar panel manufacturer went out of business, but their installer had bulk purchased discontinued panels to provide free replacement panels, even though they didn't have to.",

"comment": "I agree, but it's must cheaper to do spray blown-in insulation if you do it yourself.  I bought 90 bags of the Green Fiber for total of about $800 or so.   I had my brother in lawn help me and went overkill in most areas.  I have about 18\" throughout the whole house because I didn't want to return any.    Some insulation is better than none, but yea, I'll agree with you if money isn't an option that spray foam up against the deck is the best option.\n\nSolar still makes sense here because over 3 years rates for 1kWh of power has went from $99 to $162.  Some months we are using near 2kWh of power, so our bill would have been $324 just for that and it doesn't include all the other fees they have.  Our bills would easily be $400-$450 a month right now if it wasn't for solar.  Instead we pretty much pay about $275, and that's only because I got Powerwalls, otherwise it'd be $200.   I don't regret getting them one bit, but solar does save money if you don't spend more than $2.50 per watt, have a newer roof, lots of south facing roof, and no trees around your house.   \n\n\nElectric rates continue to rise and over the past 3 years I have not noticed one bit.   Everyone I know that doesn't have solar complains about the electric rates.  Luckily I bought solar in 2018, so I timed it perfect.",

"comment": "Looks like it was financed from my quick glance. Like most solar loans, they have a teaser rate 0.99%. Normally their is a fee to buy down the interest rate. However that seems to just be added to the total cost of the system, because $5.52/watt is high. However, as you can see there is a ballon payment due at month 18, to keep the payment the same. The theory is by now, you will have received your solar tax credit, and can apply that to the loan.\n\nWhat it looks like, is the original buyers  are going to take the 30% solar tax credit, which they are entitled to. However, won't be making the ballon payment, which it would be yours then. \n\nHowever, on the federal tax credit that is $12,600. I would at a minimum, ask the sellers for a credit equal to that ballon payment ($11k). A realistic price for solar, is $3.50/w, a good purchaser would have paid $26,600 cash for the system, which with their financing magic has added $16k onto the cost.\n\nThe biggest thing is to determine what the value of the power it will generate. On the paper work it says no interest buy down was",

"comment": "I am not attorney, nor do I play one on TV, but the following language taken from Docket 114 of the SunPower Bankruptcy proceedings indicates to me that SunPower would like to transition service of their systems to Enphase and others.  Please don't take this as a final decision of the court based on my reading as I don't believe the court has decide this as of today (Sept. 10).  But it does seem as if SunPower is attempting to find a service and monitoring solution for its existing (soon to be former) customers.\n\nI see no indication yet about what will become of existing SunPower Warranties outside of Maxeon panels and Enphase micro inverters - which these two respective companies have already promised publicly to honor.\n\nFrom docket 114:\n\n\"As part of their business, the Debtors provide maintenance and support services, billing and collection services, and asset management services (collectively, the “Services”) to a broad portfolio of already-installed solar panel projects. Through the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by the Definitive Documents (the “Transactions”), the Debtors seek to facilitate the transition of the Services to Enphase, Launch Servicing, LLC (“Launch”), SunStrong, and HASI as successor service providers (the “Successor Servicers”).3 Specifically, the Debtors will (a) enter into the APA to govern the Sale of the Assets, used as part of the Services, to Enphase, as well as a license back of the sold Assets to the Debtors and SunStrong, (b) continue providing the Services until the Successor Servicers can take over pursuant to new management services agreements (such period, the “Interim Period”), and (c) provide transition services to the Successor Servicers under the TSAs to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances of these chapter 11 cases.\"\n\n  \nSpruce Power has also asked the court to give 2-3 additional weeks to decide if it too wants to bid on SunPower's service, operations, maintenance and intellectual property. \n\nFrom docket 191:\n\n\"A delay of a mere 2-3 weeks of the transition of the O&M Services should not harm the Debtors and would allow the Debtors to determine if they would instead maximize the value they may obtain for the Joint Venture Interests by making the O&M Services available to potential bidders of the Joint Venture Interests. There should be no additional costs associated with denying or delaying the Debtors’ authority to transition the O&M Services at this juncture because the Bidding Procedures Motion contemplates an efficient sale process, including an Auction (if necessary) that Enphase and other proposed Successor Servicers can also participate in. Therefore, the Debtors will not incur additional charges or delays in the Chapter 11 Cases by including the O&M Services as part of the sale for the Joint Venture Interests.\"",

"comment": "Before you install a wind generator, install a wind meter / data logger at exactly the place you intend to install the generator and then log the data for 2 years.\nIn my case, it became clear within 3 months that the intended location was shit because of whirling winds caused by surrounding hills. Then I found the optimum location and got the data for 2 years. \nThen, you can make a simple spreadsheet simulator to see how much power I would have generated (using 5 minutes data) and it appeared that I better install a few extra solar panels (cheap) without increasing battery capacity (expensive) and make a plan what to do if there is no sun for more than 3 full days.\nAfter making plans for installing a 3.5m diameter wind generator and working on those plans for 5 years, it was a disappointment to drop those plans and go for a far simpler solution, but life moves on.\nThe wind in my place in Asia is very peculiar: There is either too much -OR- there is too little. The average (funny enough) looks OK, but the produced power would have been disappointing.\nThat Davies wind meter /data logger saved me a lot of frustration and expenses, even when it was blown apart in a typhoon ( 250 km/h and more, how much more I don't know because it totally burst).",

Giving awards to a slaughterhouse designer, applauding the gassing of chickens, promoting cage free eggs, etc. It feels to me like that kind of inclusiveness is actually watering down the message.

I believe that it's our place as vegans to help people to understand, especially when they're asking, as unfortunate (and, perhaps, as unfair) as that responsibility might be.  If we choose to become vegan and then dismiss people out of hand when they ask questions we don't like, we're not really helping ourselves or our cause...\n\nI do also agree that just asking questions for the sake of arguing them down is silly, but I think the OP was asking in good faith!\n\n(I think this comment sounds a little snarky; that wasn't what I intended, honest!)",

In fact, look at all of the suppliments added to the meat-based cat food. Think about this for a second. If \"meat\" is what cats need for proper nutrition, why do the manufacturers feel compelled add so many vitamins and minerals? These are the same exact vitamins and minerals added to vegan cat food. To state that one is \"more natural\" than the other is just plain silly.\n\nThe fact is that it is not \"meat\" that cats need, but the *individual nutritional components* that are found in meat. Vegan cat foods have been formulated to include all the nutrition that your cat needs to survive. The only complication that occurs at times is with crystals forming in the urine. This only usually happens with male cats, and it happens rarely. Even so, you should monitor the pH of your male feline's urine after transitioning them to a plant-based diet. Additional supplements can be used to counteract this effect. Some people consider this to be too much of a hassle, but I think it's worth the effort considering the fact that the average cat can consume several hundred slaughterhouse animals and fish over her lifetime.",

Telling vegans that they have a moral obligation to be fit is pretty shitty, in my opinion, when you don't know their situation and should be pleased that they are already recognizing a moral obligation to reduce animal suffering. There are many good reasons to exercise, but condemning someone for not doing so isn't helpful. Especially when you don't know their situation: how much free time they have, how much money they have, if they have physical disabilities, if they just simply don't want to attain a certain level of \"fitness.\"\n\nAlso, I have to second what someone else said about paleness. There is nothing wrong with being pale. I spent a good part of my childhood being bullied for being pale, so I get grumpy when people act like it's a moral failing or an aesthetic affront. Me, I am genetically incapable of not being pale. I go into the sun, my freckles get darker and I get a sunburn. I would drastically increase my risk for skin cancer. Look up \"tan redheads\"; they don't exist, and if you find one who has a spray tan or who just has dyed hair, you will agree that they look fucking ridiculous. Not that I was under any obligation not to be pale if I had the ability to tan. If someone thinks that pale=unhealthy, then that is their bigotry and ignorance, not mine, and I have no moral obligation to indulge it.",

I didn't expect to be able to eat at our family's big Sunday dinner (I was anticipating bringing my own food) but my mom has made a meatless option available for me every time (without me ever asking her to) -and she usually eats it herself, just to try it out.  I know for a fact that most of them don't understand any advantages to being vegan (for themselves or others), so it makes me happy that they are willing to respect my decisions.  I've also had a friend decide to at least go dairy free after hearing the advantages, so at least it is a step in the vegan direction.",

However if you work a short way away and could walk or ride a bike to work, you *should* do that instead of driving.\n\nIt sounds like you are asking yourself the right questions. Do the best you can with the knowledge you have. Do not take it over the edge.",

"comment": "For baking, traditional egg substitutes work fine, and I already happily eat egg-free cakes and what not (my partner is \"fully\" vegan and enjoys baking).\n\nIn the UK, during the second world war, there was a massive egg shortage (among the many shortages). The bakers of that era put a lot of work into egg replacers for baking, and there are many that work very well. Recipes can be found all over that use one of the egg substitutes of that era. They all seem to rely on some sort of grain extract that is starchy, yet glutinous in texture (but not necessarily containing gluten in the sense of wheat gluten). Processed tapioca is one such substance.\n\nWe just use Orgran \"No Egg\", a commercially sold egg replacer which works 100% as well as real chicken eggs for cake making. It really is a great product. It keeps in a cupboard and you can buy the equivalent of dozens of eggs in one go for much less than the price of real eggs. As such, non-vegans should buy it, just for being more convenient, cheaper and easier to store.\n\nhttp://www.orgran.com/products/no-egg-egg-replacer/\n\nThis makes life easier. However, it does nothing beneficial for my colon, so I view it as a culinary ingredient only, quite a separate matter from that originally posted. I do indeed eat eggs in the context of medicine.",

Asking questions is always good, so don't worry. \n\nMy example is I ordered a vegan meal at a BBQ joint, the server said the fries were fried in the same oil as meat. I had to decide if that was beyond my realm - it was not (and the fries were good). Vegan items made in the same place as milk/egg is used are vegan; if the item contains milk/egg protein on purpose, it's not vegan (my opinion, ymmv). I feel that wine filtered with gelatin was done so on purpose, and therefore I feel it's not vegan. \n\nI try very hard to get vegan wine or beer, sometimes I make a mistake, but I try to get it right next time.

In fact, it's the byproduct of bacterial fermentation. The Institute of Medicine recommends that all adults over the age of 50 supplement B12, whether vegan or not.\n* The subject about B12 is complicated, but it's not true that you can only get it from eating animals. Many plant-based foods are fortified with B12, and there are natural sources too.\n* These links might be of interest: [Dr. Thomas Campbell's discussion on B12](http://nutritionstudies.org/12-questions-answered-regarding-vitamin-b12/), [Vegan Health &amp; Fitness article](http://www.veganhealthandfitnessmag.com/b-12/) and [YVFI article on B12](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/vegans-cannot-get-enough-b12)\n\n\nAlways read the links in the sidebar ---------&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n^^Bloop ^^Bleep! ^^I'm ^^Gary ^^the ^^/r/vegan ^^helper ^^bot. ^^Comments ^^and ^^suggestions ^^to ^^/u/pizza_phoenix.

He cheers me on and has been nothing but great about it.\n\nI described my relationship because it sounds like your wife is being the complete opposite. It's one thing not to join in on becoming vegan, but it's another to be disrespectful and act like it's ruining your lives.

My gf told me how important it was to her that i turned vegan and explained the reasons why she was vegan. A couple of months later i was fully vegan as well. Idk i just kinda got her point and loved the food. \n\nSo i think you just have to find a guy who isn’t too manly to understand.

Like it's hip right now to have a reusable straw to \"save the sea turtles!\" and they hook you (pun intended) that way. If you care about plastic litter and plastic in the oceans and stuff, it's easy to sit there nodding along about how important it is to deal with plastic waste. \n\nAnd then they go, \"Oh wait, why are we losing our collective minds about plastic straw wrappers when a huge amount of plastic in the oceans is from fishing! And if you care about sea turtles, do you know how many of those are bycatch from fishing? And if you care about carbon emissions, trawling the ocean floor kills a bunch of plants that suck up carbon! And if you care about people, there's all kinds of labor abuses and even slavery in the fishing industry, plus big companies are catching all the fish from areas where people still need them for subsistence!\"\n\nAnd so forth. I don't remember much talk about the sentience and cruelty aspects, but there was certainly graphic footage of charismatic sea life (dolphins and whales) being slaughtered, and I think most people recognize that as suffering even if they don't normally think about suffering in the context of marine life. \n\nFWIW (I'm not male), my progression was almost exactly the same. Seaspiracy, Earthling Ed, Earthlings (and then Dominion), and that was it. It helped that I'd been dabbling in vegan recipes for a while before that though. If I hadn't already proven to myself that vegan food can taste good and not consume all of my free time to prepare, my morals might not have won.",

Whereas your attempts to shame me as an ethical cat owner are just aggressive and dogmatic. \n\nThe fact that you just resorted to arguing syntax instead of semantics is kind of telling. The big elephant here in the room is the question \"what is the ethical thing to do\". And you are so butt hurt about someone arguing as aggressively as you do, that you completely loose track and argue on the basis of \"to quoque\" instead of actually attacking what is relevant intellectually.\n\nAre you still convinced that sustaining a cat on vegan cat food is torture?

I'm living my day to day life as aligned with my beliefs as I possibly can now.\n\nLooking back on my youth, I'm kind of surprised I didn't adopt a vegan lifestyle much earlier.  I grew up in the southern California punk scene and in the 80s a lot of my friends and people I aligned with politically were vegan.  Maybe the straight edge part of their choices kept me from committing unfortunately but I'm there now 30 years later and as a bonus my health is getting much better because of this change. \n\nDunno why I shared all of this instead of just agreeing with op but if you read this thanks for listening I guess.",

It's very interesting **I swear.**\n\nOn the negative end, it could be that you're not supplementing B12, or missing out on something else : https://www.diversehealthhub.org/programs/are-deficiencies-seen-in-blood-tests-of-those-on-vegan-diets-e7trs\n\nThe important thing is to listen to your doctor and be firm about working within a vegan diet. You are probably much healthier than the average omnivorous population in many ways, so if this does turn out to be something bad, keep in mind that an omnivore might have it much, much worse.",

The second best being Hamilton, surprisingly enough.\n\nI’ve been in Hamilton the last decade or so and just recently moved to Burlington. I’ve gone from something like 15 vegan spots including an all plant based grocery store to 2 restaurants 🙃\n\nLuckily it’s just a short drive back to the hammer",
