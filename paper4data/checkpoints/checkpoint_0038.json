A Volt could be used on 100% petrol, matching the experience of the Lexus hybrids.\r\rNote that I am not disparaging the Volt, merely questioning its use as a counterexample. A full EV without \"range extender\" would be a more complete rebuttal.",

Through federal tax credits, loan guarantees, grants and other subsidies, billions of taxpayer dollars have been squandered on an industry that relentlessly seeks additional special interest carve-outs. A nearly identical tax credit to the one proposed by the president – the “Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit” – has been available to gasoline stations dispensing 85 percent ethanol. It expired last year but has a history of being renewed in “tax extenders” packages. A federal Renewable Fuel Standard also mandates the use of 15 billion gallons of corn ethanol by 2015. While the biofuels industry as a whole was intended to help achieve American energy independence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and spur rural economic development, the corn ethanol industry has fallen short of achieving these goals while spurring numerous unintended consequences and long-term liabilities that have resulted in more harm than good.",

It makes the vehicle more expensive, takes longer to charge (at least in the general public's eyes), and might complicate other things.\n\n300 miles is a sweet spot, at least until we have completely new battery chemistry.\n\nOf course, this is all IMO, but even Elon has said there is a point where it doesn't make sense to keep increasing the battery size.",

They were a niche product, a fad that no one took serious until Big Blue entered the game. \n\nChevy will get people in EV's that otherwise would never see them due to arcane laws or under exposure. Plus, this will force the other manufacturers to up their battery range. Who is going to buy an i3 for $45,000 and 85 miles of range when the Chevy Bolt can do 200 miles for $37,000?",

Even for a $100k car, they provide great service to their customers and don't hide behind legal bullshit to avoid fixing problems. \n\nHonestly, it feels like a conspiracy to rub some of the shine off of a company that is leading the way in EVs, in an attempt to give other manufacturers a chance to catch up (using Tesla's patents, BTW).",

I think you have to research the total cost of ownership (TCO) for this thing, compare it to the TCO of electric cars if you want to, and give yourself reasons whether or not this makes sense in your life.\n\nAsk yourself for instance:\n\n- Can this Hoverboard replace a car for me? If you live in the centre of a big city, you might not even have a car. So... what do you have then? Take a bicycle everywhere?\n\n- Following above, does this have some advantages over the bicycle you take everywhere? Can you imagine a situation where the Hoverboard comes in handy more than a bicycle? (Perhaps legal, like driving over the sidewalk. Perhaps as an indoor vehicle.) \n\n- Is it worth the price considering all factors? (practical cost of use, feeling like an early adopter, fancy some unique design, range and speed, charging possibilities, time saved compared to other ways of transport -- including walking -- , etc...)\n\nFor instance, if you would only use it while going from your work pc to the copy machine and back, would you pay 3k to save those ample seconds of time? For some people, it would be worth. For others, it does not compare to common sense.\n\nFor instance, if you use this to drive to work from home, this would mean no traffic (unless foot traffic), which means less stress and less time to get to work. In this case, if you would buy a bicycle, are there bicycle lanes where you are?\n\nFor instance, if you work in a circus. You might break a leg while on that unicycle juggling some balls. With this, you can, though not comfortably, keep juggling some balls on a one-wheeled vehicle. You're just cheating because the vehicle does the balancing. But the peeps in the public don't know that. :)\n\nWell, that is my reasoning. In short, compare what you need, what you want, and what other possibilities fill this space.",

Most of them are awful webview-wrappers around poorly designed websites with little to no integration with my phone.\nSo I actually decided to sit down, learn Swift and Xcode and make my own. The result of that effort is SparkMap. It uses MapKit to provide a smooth map experience and the app offers plenty of cool features.\nOne-top navigation to a given charging station\nRead/post comments, ratings, photos\nCharging station filtering options\n3D touch support\nResponsive map experience\nAll network traffic is SSL encrypted.\nI live in Norway so the app is probably fine tuned for Norwegian conditions. I'd love to get some feedback and suggestions from users outside Norway so that I can improve the experience for users everywhere.\nThe app is open source but I've decided to charge a small amount for the app through the App Store simply because the Apple developer license costs me quite a few bucks annually.\nThanks all and drive safe :)",

Zero's $1000 April promo is almost over, but at least for a little while the Zero S effectively starts at $10k. \n\nThe Zero is also basically as quick as the Empulse, both to 60 and through the quarter mile.\n\nThe largest battery Zero S has about 60% more mixed-riding range than the Empulse, and still weighs a little less.\n\nThe Empulse does have a big advantage in the faster onboard charger. Zero offers a similar L2 onboard charger, which costs an extra $2k (before 30% federal tax credit). The faster onboard charger replaces the built-in storage, but charges the bike almost 50% faster (in terms of miles charged per hour).\n\nZero has improved substantially since 2013.

Speaking in Hong Kong, he said the electric vehicle market in China was just beginning to grow but moving in the right direction.\n\n&gt; Government policies in China, the world&amp;#039;s largest polluter, are inevitably moving toward reducing emissions, favoring electric vehicles, he said.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/42mi3k/electric_car_industry_to_suffer_from_cheap_oil/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.6, ~30124 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PMs and comment replies are read by the bot admin, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **electric**^#1 **China**^#2 **market**^#3 **vehicle**^#4 **Musk**^#5",

I do like the fact that if you roll up on a Green 3, you'll know right off the bat that it's not a Green 6 and you can set your expectations accordingly, knowing that it's going that slow by design, and not that it's your car's fault for some reason.",

They claim it's to recoup grid maintenance costs but it's clearly intended to squash independent power generation and allow them to build a solar monopoly. This is evidenced by the fact it has nothing to do with how much power you draw from the grid. Even with the solar system I've planned, I'll still be using more grid power than most customers due to my electric car. /rant  \n\n\nAnyway, customer-generators are defined, in part, as those who have a system that \"is interconnected and operates in a parallel phase and synchronization with an affected utility and is in compliance with the safety standards established by the affected utility;\".  Is it possible to build a system that does \\*not\\* meet this criterion? Specifically, if a battery sits in between the panels and the rest of the house wiring (and I have a perfectly normal meter and never send power out to the grid), would I \\*not\\* be a \"customer-generator\"?   \n\n\nFull rate details here: [https://www.westarenergy.com/Portals/0/Resources/Documents/Tariffs/0617\\_Resident\\_Standard\\_Distributed\\_Generation.pdf](https://www.westarenergy.com/Portals/0/Resources/Documents/Tariffs/0617_Resident_Standard_Distributed_Generation.pdf)",

It's an abuse of the intended purpose (to promote car sharing and alleviate congestion in the cities) to help promote switching to EVs.\n\nThe problem is that an EV takes about as much space as an ICE and the more cars you have in the HOV lane, the less attractive it becomes to use it. Also, at a certain point EVs will start selling themselves without the need for extra benefits attached - some would say that's already happening.",

"comment": "Not 10 items necessarily, but I give you Will_Power's *Plan to Replace All Fossil Fuels by 2076*™. As the plan is long and time is short, here are some key elements in bullet form:\n\n- The cornerstone is advanced nuclear power. This begins with a focus on removing restrictions to R&amp;D by revamping the NRC, plus spending public funds to match private investment funds. \n\n- Fission is the focus for the first phase, particularly breeders reactors that can consume existing nuclear waste stockpiles. \n\n- Brayton Cycle research receives funding as well in order to allow advanced reactors to operate at higher temperatures (this is a good thing from a thermodynamics perspective) in order to massively reduce water requirements.\n\nAs these plants become commercialized:\n\n- Desalination plants are built near coastal cities. As their water needs are met with desalinated sea water, upstream water can be returned to previous uses, including growing forests.\n\n- Some surplus nighttime power charges EVs.\n\n- Other surplus nighttime heat and power is used to synthesize hydrocarbons as the US Navy has demonstrated (and as was done with the Fischer-Tropsch process clear back in WWII).\n\n- Waste heat runs steam plants for centralized heating of cities and towns.\n\n- PRT systems like /r/SkyTran start to replace personal vehicles.\n\n- Existing hydropower plants become huge energy storage systems as advanced nuclear displaces them for baseload. This aids intermittent sources like solar and wind.\n\nOther:\n\n- Solar and wind are built in areas of high insolation and stable winds, respectively,  *and where embraced by local residents*.\n\n- Mob grazing is used to enrich topsoil, which also sequesters carbon.\n\n- /r/Biochar is produced and used to sequester carbon in topsoil.\n\n- Fusion research is pursued at a later date.\n\nThose are the highlights.",

I think that will happen in the next couple years. I don't know how much the charging itself costs but a lot of cheaper cars (like the bolt or kona) are sub-100 kw charging which is a shame. I guess if you got up to 300 miles range you could slow charge, but I think realistically a 200 mile range + fast-charging would be preferable from a cost standpoint (and efficiency standpoint, as you would save \\~330lb weight).\n\nThe other possibility could be battery renting. Psychologically consumers are terrible at long-term savings. Renting a battery could bring down the cost below gas, and then you would still save monthly vs gas.\n\nEx. 40 kwh pack at \\~200 dollars per kwh = 8k at 3% 8 year loan = 94 a month. Gas prices are \\~3 a gallon, likely need about 500 gallons a year, 1500 vs 1,128 for battery loan. Then factor electricity costs in and likely about even. But, you get to drop the price of the leaf down to \\~22k. Factor in incentives and it would be the cheapest starting price for any new car on the market.\n\nIn \\~3 years years battery cost should be \\~131 a kwh, making payments more like 70 a month. Eventually it won't be needed, but I think it is a demand lever that could be pulled if needed.",

"comment": "Exactly, it's like NIH funding in the US. Trump might say whatever, but the bottom line is both parties support the NIH and fund it regardless. I also think people overestimate how aggressive a 2040 ban on NEW gas cars is. Functionally this means no more consumer gas cars on the road by 2060. Hardly a particularly aggressive stance given how things are advancing on the electric car front. While solid state is uncertain in the next 5 years, I expect it will be here in 10, and I'd be shocked if it (or some other technology offering similar improvements) wasn't here within 20. EVs will be simply cheaper than gas cars well before then. I expect the crossover would occur (naturally) by 2035, and gas car sales would be a very small % by 2040.",

A significant number of people's commute is even less.\n\nIf putting a load of solar panels on the roof means my commute is covered or partially covered, the battery can be charged to 50% and just hover around there without ever needing to plug in and keeps the battery in good health and costs even less.\n\nObviously it's peak time in the UK at the moment but the car can charge at the 8 hours in at work but also the early hours prior to leaving my house, and the hours once I'm home.\n\nThe solar can also be used to maintain a more optimum battery temperature at rest rather than using the battery itself.\n\nI think it's a great idea, might as well use the otherwise wasted space.\n\nI'm sure if you look back when the leaf was first released with 80mile range people said it was a gimmick, 10+ years on its a very sensible car people are a lot more open to EV's and a new wave of even better EVs has now been released making people even more open to the idea.

"comment": "I’ve driven my Bolt over 70,000 miles since I got it. I’m averaging 31.6 kWh per 100 miles lifetime, so I’ve used about 22,100 kWh to power my car. My local electric utility charges about 7.5 cents per kWh, so I’ve spent about $1,630 on powering my car over its lifetime.\n\nIf I instead owned and drove the most efficient non-electric car that far (I’m guessing that’s the Prius), I would be driving a car that gets roughly  55 mpg, meaning I would have used about 1,270 gallons of gasoline to power it. I’m not sure what the true average price of gas in my area was, but I think $2.50 is a reasonable number to use in lieu of knowing the truth. That gasoline would have cost me about $3,180, or roughly double what my electricity cost to power my Bolt.\n\nIt’s even more drastic when you look at gas-hungry vehicles. The Corvette averages 19 mpg, so driving it 70,000 miles would take about 3,680 gallons of gas, and at $2.50 per gallon would cost about $9,210.",

Are there third-party licensing concerns?\n\nDoes the 'software' require authentication with a proprietary or otherwise closed api/service? Who runs the servers, and how are those contracts managed? If cross-network payments will be enabled, how will that work, since Tesla doesn't have any of that now?\n\nYou're suggesting this will all be super easy and Tesla will simply 'share' some vague package of software that just works, but all of these details are incredibly important. You can't just hot-plug one codebase into another and see everything work like magic. Software doesn't work that way.",

Some use a lot of extra battery when the car is parked like the sentry mode. Autopilot is crap, and most other cars can do better. Tesla has a lot of stupid gimmicks too, and the UX is not great if you like more controls and buttons instead of fiddling around on a screen to customize your UI. Most people won't figure out how to customize the car so you can set up a custom function on the scroll wheel, or add shortcuts on the menu screen. It's too much hassle. I'm a techy guy myself and I hated it. My wife hated it more.\n\nCharge routing works really well with Google maps and Android Auto in cars I have tested. \n\nThe Teslas are efficient, mostly due to weight and Aero dynamics, but other EV's have enough range too, and charging networks are available for all EV's except a few chademo cars.",

Someone like Tesla is taking profits and building out new service centers etc.   \nTo be fair, giving money to the dealership means they may also build a new dealership too.   \n\n> Not limiting yourself with the same care brand means it benefits you even less.   \n\nYou directly? Yeah.  But that's true with any brand. You're not going to a Toyota dealership when you have a Ford.  \n\n>  I just know nothings going to change except service level will diminish.   \n\nI'm not saying there isn't issues with mobile service and obviously mobile service won't fix MAJOR issues, but I don't think it will diminish. \nIt also depends on how far the nearest physical service center is.  \nSome people are still hundreds of miles away from any service center so yeah they'd have more issues than someone like me that could literally walk to mine.",

Much like the other comment, I wanted to make it clear that I was considering the suns position as it moves across the sky daily, from dawn to dusk, rather than its gradual change in Y position over the year. I know a man who changes the tilt of his solar panels 3 or 4 times per day to follow the sun (granted he doesn't have much else to do). I was just trying to think of a way to automate this process in a simple mechanical way.",

"comment": "Sunpower is the market leader, with the highest efficiencies, but they also have the highest cost.  The cost is usually not considered worth it unless you are space constrained.  After Sunpower, there are a number of tier 1 providers, both North American (Solarworld, REC Solar, Candian Solar) and Chinese (Yingli Energy, Trina Sola, Renesola Jiangsu).  After that, there are lots of other, smaller producers.\n\nDepending on shading, some companies still prefer single inverters over micro-inverters, so you will see that.  Most micro-inverters warranties don't cover labor on the replacement, so that can be an unexpected cost to warranty replacements.",

Who's to blame ? Just about everyone in the developed World.. \n\nIf you're in a hole, with no way out, the first thing to do is stop digging. STOP EMITTING.\n\nAnyone who thinks nuclear is the answer, doesn't understand the question.  We have some 15 years or so before we blow through a chance of staying under 2C, after that's all bets are off.\n\nhttp://kevinanderson.info/blog/full-global-decarbonisation-of-energy-by-2034-and-probably-before/\n\nYes, we are completely off the grid on solar power, cycle, don't drive, grow much of our own produce and don't fly for holidays, that is, we stopped emitting and I only vote for politicians that have emissions mitigation as primary policy.",

If the temp drops to a -.45 degrees over 15 years from 5 years ago, what will they say caused it?  And how will the coal industry sue for all the lost they had.  Or all the americans that lost thier coal jobs??  And what are we going to do with all the dusty solar panels, and broken windmills??",

"comment": "So FPL is playing it safe with their paper trail (as they should). All-in-all, this seems like a pretty clear cut issue. There is no REC transfer. The rebate is a rebate. OP needs to take the 30% tax credit on the reduced amount and not should not need to pay federal income tax on the utility rebate. The only complication is whether or not the rebate is subject to state income tax, but Florida does not have state income tax, so it's not an issue.\n\nWhy someone would spend thirty thousand dollars on a solar array, but uses turbo tax instead of a CPA to file their taxes is beyond me. Get a tax professional OP!",

LOL.\n\nYou make all kinds of estimates (hopes?) when you go solar.  You even convince yourself your A/C usage will drop because the roof is now half covered with solar panels!\n\nTry to keep your estimates realistic.  You know what the panels will deliver, and you should also know what loads you have to cover.  It's not magic, but still people come up disappointed.\n\nWatch solar installations in your area... a while later they will be installing just a few more.",

Would also like to add that sunpower panels really are very productive and are among the most efficient. The installer knows this thus is able to give you the guarantee with a little tilt towards them in their favor. House always wins and all that.

"comment": "My opinion is that solar is not the cost-savings unless you can get a 10 year simple payback on the array. If that's the case, simple payback = installed cost x 70% / generation rate / annual kwh production. I'm assuming you currently have an unlimited net-metering policy. \n\nAesthetic issues aside (it's possible to make solar pretty), you will also have to transfer the interconnection agreement to the new home buyer, and that alone may be more hassle than its worth if you only plan to stay onsite for a few years. How will net-metering factor in a few years from now when you have a new system owner? Their economics may not look like your economics, which could impact resale value of the array. \n\nHowever, your wife is correct: a solar array will add value to the home. Berkeley Labs has shown that small arrays add a larger \"per watt\" value than large arrays, so even if the home doesn't do 100%, you're likely to recapture your investment in resale value. A small, aesthetically pleasing array is more risk-mitigated than a larger, ugly array.\n\nIf you don't plan to stay in your home long, but you want to do solar and are within the simple payback margin, I suggest adding a 4kW solar array landing on a 200A distribution panel connected via \"supply side\" interconnection. This would mitigate your future home buyer against antagonistic solar policies (smaller arrays result in more electricity being consumed on site). But also the design would allow easy expansion of the array - not just for more solar but other energy management devices such as back-up battery power in the future.\n\nIn short, if you're burning to do some solar and have the simple payback, but you don't have the money out of pocket and are planning to move, the most I'd recommend is a small array with some thought put into future-proofing the interconnection for future expansion.",

Which is why Tesla [uses NMC chemistries for the Powerwall](http://fortune.com/2015/05/18/tesla-grid-batteries-chemistry/) instead of NCA.",

"comment": "I would love one, and am waiting for a chance to buy a system, however, it's not their yet.\n\nI live in an area with occasional power outages (central Florida).  On days when we don't run the air conditioner (rare), we average about 30 kWh.  During the summer, 80kWh is not unheard of.\n\nSo, for about $12,600, I can install 2 Tesla Powerwall 2's, with 27kWh, which will get me through a day with no AC, about 8ish hours with AC.  If I use it only for outages, it will probably still be at 70-80% capacity in 15 years, with some luck.\n\nOr, instead I got a high end 20kW propane generator for about $7500.  a $300 gallon tank of propane will run my whole house for about 3-4 days non-stop.  Should last for 15-20 years, again with luck.\n\nCurrently I pay $0.12 per kWh electricity, same day or night.  There's no break even point for me outages.\n\nAgain, a battery that just switches on would be so much easier and cleaner.  But until I can get a 40kW system that lasts for 15 years or so installed for 10k, its just too expensive.  Our last power outage was from a storm, and lasted 26 hours, in the middle of summer.",

I've since changed my comments to ~250  I also said \"(~June)\" was the anticipated delivery date/arrival date, but now it seems closer to September.  Things change.  \n\nAnd Oct 1 my current lease is up so hopefully the planets will align and I'll have a car to drive instead of taking the bus/train for a week/month!\n\nWith the Tesla, I'd still be waiting for delivery till 2019.  (*Depending on my choice of options.*)\n\n&gt;Furthermore, the first year build plan for the Kona is 20,000 units globally.\n\nI'm first in line at my local Hyundai dealer which means first right of refusal, and the US gets the 64 kWh battery so I'm happy enough.  Not gloating, just glad I plopped the $1000 down when I did.  When I got my Fiat 500 eRocket, I didn't put the $1000 down until July and didn't actually get the car until late Sept.\n\nI think you are a Tesla worker as indicated by your non-stop posting of Tesla and Tesla related (SpaceX, Powerwall) subreddits.  While I do like the Tesla X, and the Tesla Y intrigues me, the Model ≡ seems too far away at the moment (for me).  I'm all about Tesla, I am not bad mouthing Tesla, but the Sedan is not my ?style?  It just hasn't captured me, but that doesn't mean I won't buy a Tesla *after* my /r/KonaEV lease is up.  It just means I'm not the demographic for this model.",

"comment": "&gt; I don't know how to convince you that the greenhouse effect is the dominant driver for climate change\n\nI'm not sure that you need to convince me of that. I do understand the mechanism involved very well. As I probably said earlier, when I had questions about it a few years ago, I actually went out and bought a text book on the physics of radiative transfer of energy in the atmosphere.\n\nI read about the mechanism of photon capture in a GHG molecule, why certain molecules are better at capturing such energy than others because of their shape.  What happens when a photon interacts with such molecules, moving them into higher energy states.  I studied the \"relaxation period\" of CO2 and H2O, the period in which one of these molecules would naturally allow itself to drop back to a lower energy state and release a photon of radiation in some random direction.  I learned that the amount of time it takes for the average CO2 molecule to release captured energy naturally is a lot longer than the average time it takes for the molecule to impact some other molecule in the atmosphere, typically a nitrogen or oxygen molecule, because those two make up over 98% of the molecules in the atmosphere.  And, when the higher energy CO2 or H2O molecule does have a collision with something else, the impact often will trigger the release of the photon, lowering the energy state.\n\nI also know that impacts with other molecules can induce a higher energy state in a GHG without needing an IR photon striking the molecule first.  So, warm air that contains water vapor and CO2 will emit IR in all directions even if it did not capture that IR from the ground.  The word \"warm\" in the preceding sentence should be taken very liberally.\n\nI did some of the math on IR leaving the middle of the troposphere, heading both upwards and downwards, and assuming that the air above the mid-troposphere is both thinner and less humid than the air below the middle of the troposphere. I found that the completely normally accepted IR leaving a captured CO2 molecule has a 50% chance of going up to space and a 50% chance of impacting the surface again is absolutely not true.  That would be true if the atmosphere was at a homogeneous pressure throughout the column from the surface to the edge of space, and if the humidity was the same throughout, etc. but... these things are not correct.\n\nOh, sure, at 10 meters off the ground, it's easily 50% as likely that an IR photon impacts the ground again or moves on to space more than 10 meters above the ground, but at larger scales, the numbers stray away from 50/50.  But, when you say, \"IR is returned to the surface from the entire column of atmosphere,\" the statement is true, but very misleading.  There is a MUCH higher chance that an IR photon emitted from the middle of the troposphere to exit the troposphere from the top than impact the surface.\n\nI am not saying that the greenhouse effect doesn't happen, or even that CO2 doesn't contribute to it.  I am saying that the explanations given to the public from the scientific community on Climate Change seem to be tailor made to exaggerate the effects of an increase of CO2, while downplaying any and every other possible factor.  Is this because the leaders of the Climate Change movement were pretty much all anti-fossil fuel from day one? That they find the explanation they are looking for because they are only interested in that explanation and don't really want to believe any other?\n\nDon't tell me that scientists are not susceptible to confirmation bias, or that Peer Review somehow weeds out wrong conclusions. \n\nOn the other hand, I don't care if we shut down all of the fossil fuel suppliers in the world, and go with nothing but wind and solar. In fact, I'd love it. I'm certainly not in the pocket of the oil industry.  My belief in science isn't connected to any industry payouts. Nor, unfortunately, am I likely to be paid by any green industry advocacy group, even though I want to build sustainably, have an all-electric house and want to use solar panels on my home, and drive an electric car.  \n\nI just want the science to be sound, and I keep feeling like I'm being lied to by the Climate Change crowd. We were supposed to have a totally ice-free arctic like five years ago, Polar Bears should be extinct and half the tiny Pacific Islands were supposed to be gone already (okay not half, but Tuvalu and Mali and a host of others). We're \"on pace\" to see 1, no 2, no, 4 or 6 meters of sea level rise by 2100, which means that we should have seen an increase to something like 6mm of yearly SLR by now. Shouldn't we be evacuating Miami this year, because in a couple of years it will be completely uninhabitable?\n\nI guess you take claims of dire emergency due to climate change as Gospel, simply resetting the doomsday clock each time the time when catastrophe is due to strike every time the deadline comes and goes without the ecosystem having actually collapsed, and when I come on and say, \"maybe this is a bit exaggerated, it could be that the effect of extra CO2 isn't as strong as they are suggesting,\" I'm spreading misinformation on the Internet.\n\nCall me when Greenland has lost all of it's ice.  Oh, no, don't, because my house will be underwater by then.  Send a boat for me, I suppose. I'll donate to your windmill project.",

This is a universal feeling from a meat processing company to an oil company to a solar power company.\n\n&gt;You are not getting a more efficient source when you eat it through animals\n\nyou say I need to do research. I think this is something you should look into.\n\n&gt;lower cholesterol, lower rates of high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity\n\nThis is speculation.\n\n&gt;There is no evidence to support that they feel guilty about it... They brains are not developed the way ours are\n\nThanks. Exactly.\n\n&gt;You know nothing about the environment or sustainability \n\nYou understand fossil fuel emissions is more than transportation, right? God you're so pretentious.  Do some of your own research, it takes one google search to see you've been fed propaganda.\nhttps://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\n\n&gt;It is not possible\n\nThis is your opinion.\n\n&gt;That's what you and everyone else supports when you buy meat\n\nYes, that's how you process meat.  I don't want to bite into my chicken and eat beak.",

I recently recieved a letter stating that my house was eligible to participate in a community solar farm thing.....  they are offering 5% off of my energy costs. \n\nHere's the catch. My house is over 130 years old and hasn't got much insulation. My heat bills over the winter are outragious. Like 400 bucks for a 1000 sq ft house. Any way I can get more than 5%? I'm seriously considering joining in but don't know much about it. Any point in the right direction is appreciated!",

Removing subsidies for bicycles using the road is just making them pay their fair share. \n\nIn all seriousness, it doesn’t matter AT ALL what we do in isolation. If all of America just offed ourselves we would reduce emissions by 15% or so, and the world would still be fucked. \n\nWhat matters far more about reducing our footprint is making sure that we pay extra to drive down the costs of electric vehicles for the 1+ billion Indians/Chinese that will buy a vehicle in the next 20 years are buying electric. \n\nSimilarly using less power is worse for the global environment than paying extra to use renewable power so that it’s cheaper than conventional power eventually (and we are getting there). **One requires people to have your same set of values and have the same ideas about conservation. The other requires people to simply chose the cheapest option (which happens to be cleanest).**\n\nLiving in a yurt does far more ecological damage on the world stage than living in a 5,000 square foot mansion that is blanketed in solar panels and batteries to more than offset your emissions. Getting to 0 isn’t enough. We need to get to negative, and also bankroll the widespread adoption of electric vehicles and renewables so that the 3.5 billion or so people that haven’t yet but will soon, (regardless of what you would prefer) be buying cars, air conditioning units, refrigerators etc. be using renewable energy, not fossil fuels.",

"comment": "Grid scale, energy doesn’t NEED to be stored, it CAN be, as a resource for supplying extra power, day to day though, even nuclear plants dont require storage, only grids that do are based upon 100% renewables( or are shit, like California or Australia)since renewables have major downtime for a significant part of the time in most places. Theres a push for EVs and home battery systems to be used as load balancers for existing infrastructure, hence technology such as V2G is a thing thats growing. \n\nYour point about solar just makes my last post more apparent, renewables are relatively low on the efficiency scale for power captured vs power usable, so is burning hydrocarbons, and so is using a FC. So when you combine the low energy capture rate of renewables with the poor resulting energy density of hydrogen after its created, packaged shipped and stored at specified distribution points. Meanwhile EVs are ~80% efficient from power source to battery. FCEVs as they are currently are are 2 extra steps in the process, the transport of the fuel, and the energy losses associated with converting stored liquid to energy via FC, with heavy potential energy losses from waste heat in the FC. \n\nCall me when FCs match EV motor efficiencies of 96% and hydrogen is made 100% onsite, which reduces energy losses.",

(And 10 Powerwalls would be 50 kW continuous...)\n\nA lot of installers don't like Powerwalls because the installers have to compete with Tesla.  And Tesla sells Powerwalls to installers at close to the same price that Tesla sells Powerwalls to consumers.  But Tesla's customer service is generally lacking, so if you want service, you should consider a 3rd party installer.  And in California with the SGIP incentive on 3 or more Powerwalls, the pricing is not that much different after the rebate (since Tesla won't apply/doesn't qualify for those rebates anymore).",

China and India are the major coal consumption countries. India get their coal from Australia. The only way to get out of this mess is to use spent rod nuclear power plant technology. Spent fuel rod are plentiful, supply lasting hundreds of years. An average nuclear plant generates a gigawatt and 8 terawatt-hours a year. Wind power is efficient and profitable in only certain places. The biggest wind farm generates 20,000 MW or 20 GW with 7000 wind turbines. Not all countries can devote that much of space for wind farm.  Broken or Used solar panels are not easily recyclable, as well as the wind blades from wind farms.  I don't know what exactly can we do to advocating for this new technology when every one is scared of the Fukushima accident.",

"comment": "And all the profit will land in Tesla's pockets, not the car/battery owners.\n\nTesla will profit off all the batteries, you will only get a fraction of the returns of your battery. A battery that will make you pennies but cost you thousands of dollars. And it will degrade with each cycle. You're basically throwing money at the company.\n\nIt also makes no sense as you can already sell electricity to the grid without the middleman. No need to split the \"profit\". Lookup metering agreements (USA). In some european countries utilities even have to buy your solar power.",

This is the manufacturer. \nVivant is an installer not a system manufacturer \n\nEnphase charges a 200.00 fee to transfer ownership.\nMy solar company was a dumpster fire leaking garbage juice, which recently merged with vivant. \nLook up the envoy model and serial number located inside the cover of the envoy and go to the emphases website and down load the manual. \nUnplug the cellular dialer.\nFollow the instructions to log into your envoy with your cell phone via wifi(using your cell phone, might have to turn off cell data) you can see equipment status. \nEmail or chat online with enphase when you have more info about you equipment. (Status of panels array map production etc.)\nThey are super helpful and knowledgeable.\nIf the title transfered to your name there is no liein on your property. In the state I live in there is a 90 day window for contractors to file a lein. After that statue of limitations expires to file a mechanichs lein. \n\nHowever a defaulted loan is between the lender and the previous owner. Vivant has been paid by the original loan company. The original loan may be in default, bankruptcy, or they might have died. In any case vivant has beennpaid and you owe nothing to them. Deal with the manufacturer.\n\nEffectively you own this equipment.\nYou may have to show enphase proof of ownership as the original installer likely registered them selves as owner with enphase.\n\nMy shitty solar installer registered me as a lease holder. I sent enphase a copy of my purchase agreement and paid nothing for ownership transfer.\n\nIf all goes well they will turn on your equipment and then you have to get  NEM AGREEMENT going with your utility. A whole separate can of worms depending on your state.\n\n\nGood luck\n\nP.S. sunrun is a garbage company that made me wait 6 months for a system I should have bought directly from enpase. They are assholes about warranties that are actually honored by enphase. FUCK SUNRUN THEY ARE GARBAGE.",

It's a PR game. \n\nFun fact, with the market energy rates yesterday, it would have cost $900 to charge a tesla. If we were relying on windmills and solar panels, that would be the norm. We can't subsidize these forever. \n\nWho said fossil fuels aren't cheap? Who said they are dwindling? They are far cheaper than windmills. Recent shortages are due to windmill-huggers pushing to limit the production and storage of natural gas. And raising hell any time anyone wants to update the system. \n\nNuclear gets the same pushback.\n\nI, as a conservative Texan who went 3 days without power in the cold, blame the libs for beating down the power, oil and gas industries for years.

"comment": ">How is excess currently stored right now?\n\nMostly it's not. Typically you'll sell the excess capacity, store the resulting currency, and then purchase energy off of a dirty grid if you need it. It's less of an issue with hydro, because that's kind of an always-on solution, but hydro is (for obvious reasons) very location-dependent and causes significant other environmental damage. You also can't \"ship\" that energy super far because of transmission loses. So that's one of the current solutions: store excess capacity as dollars. \n\nThe other major solution for more transient power generation is dirty power fallbacks. So you'll have a gas or coal plant that's on standby while the sun is out, and then when the sun sets you spin up the old dirty turbines and fill in gaps that way. It's still a net reduction in emissions, so it's better than all-gas, but not as good as full renewable.\n\n>I thought one of the problems with hydrogen storage is that it is impossible to build something that doesn’t need to be replaced in a relatively short lifespan (10-15 years?).\n\nThat's true, but building storage vessels is a lot cheaper than building solar panels, even accounting for their lifespan which is typically about 2x as long (20-30 years.) Same with batteries, which also have a shelf-life (and a cycle-life.) All energy production and storage options have consumable components, and hydrogen isn't significantly different. \n\nIt does make it horribly impractical for consumer applications, which is why I'm always on the side of \"hydrogen cars are a stupid idea,\" but for commercial applications it's actually pretty comparable to alternatives.",

It's disingenuous to talk about the challenges of recycling end-of-lifed solar and wind hardware without comparing them with the much greater challenges in recycling end-of-life nuclear plants.  I suspect solar panel recycling can be automated since they're deployed in the thousands and use comparatively non toxic materials. I don't know if there's much of value outside the aluminium.  Most PV panels still produce useful power well beyond their official expiry date, so it could be better to ship them to places that have desperate needs for PV energy.\n\nSpeaking favourably about small modular reactors is a red flag; there are numerous problems with those.  I think Cleantechnica had a good article.\n\nThere are alternative reactor designs which haven't been adequately explored, possibly because you can't make bombs with their byproducts.",

I already have 28 panels from another company and was looking to add 6 more, so I decided to hear them out. Big mistake...  \nThey only sell a minimum of 12 panels and offer no options to pay cash. They provided two financing options, both 25 years long, with a significant price difference:  \n1. $82 a month at 3.99%, totaling $21,654 without interest  \n2. $99 a month at 10%, totaling $14,400  without interest  \nI questioned the disparity in base prices depending on the loan and the potential kickbacks for these unfavorable terms. The representative claimed that's how financing works and denied any kickbacks, which I find hard to believe. It's absurd to think that the price of a product could jump by $8K based on the chosen loan, plus interest.  \nHe even suggested signing up for the 10% loan and paying it off early if I wanted to pay cash, like a stereotypical used car salesman. On top of all this, the quoted monthly price apparently includes the 30% tax credit.",

You could probably buy some low watt crap locally but it’ll be hard to generate enough electricity to pay for itself.   Like someone else already said, you ain’t gonna get clear sunlight all day so the output is nothing",

And how is it not a douche-nozzle thing to do to describe yourself as a vegan when you know you aren't. The way I see it, there's a sense of responsibility involved in choosing this lifestyle, and to those of us who take it seriously, it's very annoying to encounter these hypocrits. Some of them DO claim vegan for bragging rights, I mean let's face it, we have shitty mainstream media promoting veganism, which is great, but it also brings along groupies who claim vegan to follow a trend, but can conveniently avoid scrutiny by saying \"oh its okay I eat meat sometimes, so I'm not one of THEM.\" Sorry, but I think that's bullshit.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh and by mainstream media, I'm mainly talking music, emo bands promoting veganism. Don't get me wrong, I'm okay with whoever wants to get the message out there, just sayin that it causes trends.",

The PPK forums are all people under the influence of the author(s) of those books/blog. Meaning that the weight loss side of things is around there and encouraged by most of them. That doesn't mean that every vegan is a low fat cook.\nIf you add too much oil to a dish, its going to taste too oily, yes. You can't really add fat to recipes unless they want low fat alternatives to regular products. Are you able to give examples of what kind of things you want to cook but haven't found recipes for?",

"comment": "This is fantastic, r/vegan are your friends if you get stuck along the way. \n\nHere's a little humour to help you on your way:  http://vegsoc.org.au/forum_messages.asp?Thread_ID=8428&amp;Topic_ID=1\n\n\nSome friends did a vegan-for-a-month \"challenge\" for the month of September.  I threw together some thoughts, comments tips and resources for such a \"challenge\". They did it mostly to lose weight so teh focus is a bit different, and also i refer to some local websites etc. Forgive formatting - its C&amp;P from a facebook note. \n\nI've copied and pasted here for you, in case you need it: \n\nBeing vegan is not a challenge. Its a lifestyle that one gets used to overtime. I'm more than used to it, I love it (surprise surprise). The only part that remains a challenge is the going-out-without-ever-not-having-to-talk-about-veganism part - the fending off of questions, jokes, pokes and puffs of meat-eaters around me. Sometimes I enjoy a good discussion about it, but mostly, I just want to socialise, and you know, be. Politics, religion and food - sometimes it is best not to discuss these things.\n\nBeing vegan for a month, however, is a challenge. its the first few weeks of being vegan that are the hardest. So here are some tips of what to expect:\n\n**Challenge number one: What can I eat?**\n\n When you're accostomed to your fridge being chock-full of milk, cream, cheese(s), mayo, yogurt, ham, eggs, leftover chicken and chocolate cake, you're surely going to wonder WTF are you meant to be eating.\n\nSo you go shopping and buy crackers and breads and chips and salad stuff. Then you read the labels and realise half the chips and crackers have milk in them. Scrap that. You eat your salad that consists of tomato, lettuce and cucumber and think \"OMF what have I done?\" and go to sleep craving that burger with an extra dollop of mayo.\n\nIt need not be this way. The Vegan Society and numerous other websites will help you find the products that you can buy. And fantastic recipes for vegan food abound.\n\nDedicate some time to learning these products, and getting recipe-inspiration and by the end of week one you should be aware that you can indeed eat a full-fried breakfast, nutritionally diverse lunch and a filling and satisfying dinner.\n\nVegan Blogs Directory: http://www.veganblogs.com/\n\n  My favourite vegan cooking blog is The Post Punk Kitchen: http://www.theppk.com/ (YES! Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World!)\n\n  This one is also quite yummy: http://www.veganmenu.blogspot.com/\n\n For the more Gourmet cooks amongst us, two great ones are:http://www.veganculinaryexperience.com/ http://gtagged.gliving.com/, specifically: http://gliving.com/category/greenchefs/\n\n http://www.chefchloe.com/blog.html\n\n http://chefchloeblog.weebly.com/\n\nhttp://blog.miss-best.com/\n\nhttp://www.veganmonth.com/\n\n**continued in reply to this comment - too many characters**",

But I will share that I think the shift from \"killing animals and using their dead body parts is a part of how we live\" towards a respect for all life is the biggest shift we make when we go vegan. \n\nIt was a huge shift in perspective and perception for me that I never expected and did not realize would be such a big deal. When this shift happens you become acutely aware of how pervasive our use of animal body parts is and how disconnected and apathetic people are to the reality of what that means for the animals who died for their food, clothing, and furniture. \n\nAs a society we are raised to be somewhat neutral to animals dying. If we weren't, wearing their skin and eating their flesh would be a rare occurrence instead of a multiple-times-a-day event. Becoming vegan means stepping outside of that culture and looking in on its views from an objective perspective. It means realizing that the differences in how we relate to companion animals vs. food animals is entirely arbitrary. It means understanding the psychological disconnect that is necessary in order for this hypocritical system to continue where the innocent suffer and the guilty are justified.\n\nDisconnecting from and being able to recognize the faults/inconsistencies of the majority culture is not something everyone will be able to do. As activists, voices for the animals, and ambassadors for a consistent and cruelty-free lifestyle, we need to realize that our time is best used on opening the minds of those who are most likely to have the capacity to reject the majority view. As our numbers grow, the people who more strongly buy into majority culture will be more willing to open their minds as well.",

If you are not doing that then i am not talking to you. I am just voicing my beliefs. If you dont agree with them thats fine. And even if you were using the methods which i believe are wrong i am not alienating you, i am just saying that i think it is destructive for our cause. I am sorry if you feel offended by my beliefs, but it is not my job to make you feel loved. I want veganism to be promoted in what i think is the best way and i do think i bring some valid points to the table. \nI dont feel alienated by getting downvoted into oblivion. Why are you allowed to voice your opinions and i am not?",

"comment": "Most vegans will not lose weight if they try and keep or improve their muscle mass though because of the protein to calorie ratio. It is way harder to cut and build without a good protein source, those protein sources are just way easier if you eat chicken, lean meat and eggs.\n\nSure eggs are high in calories (350) but it also contains 31 grams of protein, now that is massive. In practice a normal person only needs 2 eggs to get basic protein covered for the day and can fill the other 1300 calories up with good nutrition, vitmains and good fiber calories.\n\nTurning down cakes at work is just a weird argument as is discussing raw food. That is a whole different subject.\n\nNow I don't know if you work out, but as Vegan that does, my experience is that you have to pay much more attention to what you eat to retain muscle mass or improve it. You also have to pay more attention to calories since otherwise you don't get as \"full\" in each meal to satisfy your body, when it is just screaming for more protein. In fact I have read plenty of body builder forums on this matter and I think the jury pretty much agrees that it takes more effort as a vegan to build.",

It really is not more effort, at least not for me.\n\n2. Not really anything I can think of. Well... maybe if I am stranded in the middle of nowhere in the bleakest winter with absolutely no provisions and no way of reaching civilization at all. But in all honesty, when the hell would that happen? \n\n3. Blanketed answer? No. I used to. That used to be my main source of food as a child before I went pescetarian and later vegetarian. My father was a moose hunter. He hung up his rifle when the wolf population recovered.

Last night we had Food Truck (or trailers) Tuesday and there were almost no vegan options out of almost 10 food trucks.  There were a few vegan ice cream flavors at one truck and a vegan acai bowl at anther, that was about it.  Very disappointing and even Whole Foods had a food truck that was just meat and fucking meat after fucking meat.  Austin is still pretty vegan friendly and I believe maybe one day it could be the most friendly, but who cares maybe its something people won't discuss because over time every city should become exceptionally vegan friendly.",

Veganism is \"a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.\" It has nothing to do with dietary purity.\n\nDo you use vaccines that were developed on animals? Oh oops! What, you're saying your medical need trumps veganism? Of course not. It means that some limited use of products produced through animal oppression and suffering is necessary even for a vegan, and that we will work (either personally or through influencing society towards the goal) to eliminate that need in the future. \n\nIf someone has the exact same mindset as you, doesn't buy leather, doesn't eat meat (in general), doesn't eat eggs, doesn't drink milk, doesn't go to circuses, and does all of this out of ethical concerns for vegan, but is different from you in exactly one way-- they need, say, an enzyme that we have not yet found how to synthesize which is only found in the pancreas of a mammal-- he can't call himself vegan?\n\nDoes it make you feel better if animal products that people need to survive are in pill form, instead of as a whole organ or bit of flesh? Can that person be vegan again if he takes the pill instead of eating the pancreas on a salad?\n\nYour vision of veganism is exclusionary and privileged. You are talking about a club which many people cannot join. This is a huge thorn in the side of the vegan movement, and I urge you to reconsider your attitude.\n\nYes, as you correctly pointed out, the number of people actually affected by this is small. But so what? \n\nNot only that, but the people whom (I suspect) your anger is targeting are actually more likely to respond positively to my vision of veganism than yours. Think about it-- if someone has a namby pamby poorly-defined \"allergy\" to certain foods that make it \"impossible to be vegan\" then what is more likely to get them to think about their diet and eliminate animal products as much as possible? Your method: \"fuck you then you can't be vegan\"  or alternately \"prove it! You dont' really have an allergy! Liar! Tell me your allergy!\".. or my method, \"well an allergy can't prevent someone from being vegan, as long as you seek expert guidance on how do your best to avoid consuming animal products, eating only the minimum necessary to be healthy, then you can be a vegan?\" It's not like I'm being taken advantage of when I present this argument; it still clearly calls them out and shows the flaw in their argument-- having an allergy doesn't excuse you from doing your best. They have to either admit they simply don't want to be vegan, while you hold that label out as a viable option, or they would have to rationalize (providing you the opportunity to criticize) everything they eat in light of their allergies.\n\nI present them with a choice: live in a way to reduce harm to animals in all way possible, or don't. If they honestly believe they are doing that, and they honestly have a medical condition that precludes a 100% plant-based diet, and they want to apply the label of veganism to themselves, why would I want to interfere with that? Calling themselves that, identifying with that term, seeking to earn that label from others who use it, will provide a strong motivation to actually avoid all unnecessary harm. Rejecting them serves no useful purpose.",

What is more confusing in this situation is that I see you post one of these wildlife articles at least ever week lately, and I barely see anyone agree with you, but still you don't respond. I'm just confused because indeed you have to admit it is a rather odd position to hold, even for vegans, so it seems like if it's so important to you to keep sharing articles on it, that you'd respond to some of the thoughts. That's all I really meant. Does that make sense?\n\nI too have a job and social obligations, so I totally understand that reddit is an afterthought with regards to other areas of your life.",

I think I STILL have some dairy butter floating around in the freezer, and if I was in a pinch and ran out of Earth Balance I'd use it. I'm vegan for the animals, not because the products themselves gross me out, and finding a food bank that would want two random opened butter sticks is not a real thing. As far as the health argument, drinking one extra pint of milk after a lifetime of dairy consumption isn't going to make a difference one way or the other. Don't feel guilty -- you're doing a great thing! Congrats and welcome.",

I’d be talking to them before walking out in embarrassment. \n\nIdk I’m sceptical but I think people lie about things to get dates/social credit or uniqueness a lot and veganism seems to be on the list of things that people think make them ‘interesting’.\n\nI’ve met people who say ‘I’m a vegan at heart’, which is suppose to mean what exactly? I don’t care for faux empathy tactics. \n\nRather than thinking about it over and over I’d chalk it down to: she’s a liar and embarrassed unless some new info comes to light.\n\nEdit: I also don’t think it’s out of order that you smirked whether it was intentional or not, someone has lied whether it’s her or the restaurant for not being clear. I’d be the same, it literally looks like she lied about being vegan then tried to eat meat in front of you 😂 if that isn’t smirk worthy then what is? Sounds like she’s a liar tbh. \n\nAccording to your version of events I don’t think yta.",

"comment": "7 months is a very short time. You don’t have to put the burden on yourself to be able to communicate why he should be vegan either. There are amazing vegan advocates who communicate the message way better and with more resources to be effective. Earthling Ed is incredible at debating, and Joey Carbstrong has done some investigations that will leave anyone with a conscience broken. \n\nCould set yourself a game where you get him to find the best arguments/video essays for why not to be vegan, while you give the other side. That way you’re both prepared and it’s not down to your communication skills, but more so about effort. For example if he doesn’t provide much on his end, or doesn’t want to participate then it shows his lack of interest in something that is very important to you, and i think by that point you will have a better feeling of whether that is someone you can live with going forward.",

That said, you're both wrong. Black people practically invented and culturally jumpstarted veganism in America. Rastafarian and adjacent religions have the concept of Ital which is cruelty-free food and dates back thousands of years. The first vegan restaurants in America served Rastafari food. Most vegans are in low and middle classes, and we both know about the connections between economic class and race.\n\nThe next time someone tries to tell you that animal suffering should not be compared to human suffering, just send them this Wikipedia article. People who have experienced the absolute pinnacle of human suffering in its most hideous and depraved forms are *active* about comparing it to animal suffering.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights_and_the_Holocaust",

"comment": "The movie is set to come out in the US this spring AFAIK. Went to see it last week, and it's extremely good. I'm posting this to r/vegan because this movie shows well that veganism must be more than a plant based diet – almost all large-scale agricultural products in the US are pollinated by bees that are transported across the US for a profit, bringing great stress and disease to the hives. I, for one, have stopped buying californian almonds (which make up 90% of world production) after seeing the movie.",

They might be intrigued why the top comment is anti-vegan and stick around to explore more. They might get a laugh.\n\nEither way it's all positives!",
