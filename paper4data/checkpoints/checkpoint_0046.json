What we have, though, is strangulation wearing a regulation costume.  The executive order banning breeder reactors is a prime example.\n\n&gt;I just have a tough time imagining that it can outcompete solar if we're not socializing the cost of its risk. Solar is just so much simpler by comparison - throw a bunch of mirrors out in the desert and we're set.\n\nSorry, but solar only provides power for maybe 1/3rd of the day.  To make solar competitive with nuclear requires a secondary energy storage system that is far more expensive than the solar panels themselves.\n\n&gt;Electrified roads would be great, but tremendously expensive, and we'll need EVs that can use them before they make sense.\n\nThe prototypes being built use induction, IIRC.  It is true that they would be expensive, but they may be able to function as distribution lines as well.\n\n&gt;SkyTran or similar sounds great too, but convincing Americans to abandon their cars and use public transportation of any kind will always be a big challenge.\n\nAll it would take is one major city to deploy it.  The speed of getting to one's destination compared to cars would go a very long way to ending that American love affair with cars.\n\n&gt;I don't know why the Civic CNG remains the only production car out there available to go that route.\n\nI'm confused by this as well.\n\n&gt;It's cheap and plentiful now, but eventually it'll have its supply problems too, so it can't be a long term solution like EVs can.\n\nIt will outlast oil by a couple of decades, so considering the longevity of cars, that is really not much of an issue.  One thing to consider with EVs is that they require a very petroleum intensive road system, just like other cars.\n\n&gt;Whoever said anything about doing that?\n\nWhat almost always follows talk of the negative externalities of oil: taxation.\n\n&gt;...and EVs allow for access to this cheaper form of transportation energy.\n\nYet the price premium of the vehicles negates the cost of cheaper fuel.  This is even more true in the secondary (used) market.\n\n&gt;Phasing out per manufacturer effectively puts those companies who assumed the risk to invest in EVs early on at a huge competitive disadvantage should another company decide to jump in later.\n\nThey should have first mover advantage and various intellectual property from related R&amp;D, though.

It's already depreciated in a massive way, so you'll be looking at owning a car that's pretty close to the same functionality at about half the price, and in a year or two, you can probably sell it or trade it in for most of what you paid for it. \n\nDo the math on your charging situation. If you can get access to a standard 110v plug, you can charge the car overnight with the trickle charger to recover about 40 miles of range in 10 hours. Same goes for plugging in at work. If you can do it, then you don't have to worry about charging at home. Those public Level 2 chargers can get expensive if you have those at work since they charge by the hour that you're connected, and not actual charging time. When you're full, you're still paying if you forget to go move your car. \n\nDefinitely make sure it has a quick charge port. Level 3 charging is where it's at if you need a quick fill. Keep in mind, that you don't need to \"fill the tank\" on an EV as much as just get enough in there to get to your next charger. If you have one at home or work, then you can just quick charge for a few minutes to get the mileage you need to get where you're going since your car will be sitting there all night plugged in anyway.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0018724973682158936,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18812715133960972,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26219646297091603,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.22546948836090627,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.14148294312851178,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15620503503871422,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11877340379093464,"ev_1":-0.12665688711484455,"ev_2":-0.2605148851661005,"ev_3":-0.173806360274189,"ev_4":-0.1428332441338277,"ev_5":-0.024627231624132644,"ev_6":-0.2264660880408872},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

If you simply deleted the gas tank, it would be a pure BEV with no compromise in performance.\n* It *can* run as a series hybrid like a BMW i3, but it usually doesn't.  Why? because it is *more efficient to transfer power mechanically*.  \n* There is an SAE paper where GM engineers demonstrate that, in terms of power transmission efficiency, fixed-ratio &gt; eCVT &gt; motor-generator.  In fact, when designing an eCVT, engineers try to optimize things so that as little power as possible goes through the electric path (but some power always has to be converted to electricity and back in a pure eCVT).\n* In the Gen 2 Volt transmission, they added a mode with a single fixed-ratio that is even more efficient (for the speeds and engine loads where it is appropriate).  In that mode, 100% of power is transmitted mechanically.\n\nHaving owned a Gen 1 Volt, I think GM did a really good job--the engineering is really solid.

While I agree with the sentiment to plan how you'll charge before buying an EV, the extent of that planning other comments are describing is wild. \n\nWhen someone is choosing their next ICE car, do they think about downloading 5 apps and staking out charging stations at various times of day for 3 months before buying? Heck no. What person, who is wholly unfamiliar with EVs and how they work, is going to go to all that effort? If they don't realize they should? It's hard enough just trying to figure out how long different cars take to charge.\n\nI own my home, I live in a multifamily building, in a city, and have neighbors in my building with chargers installed in their parking spaces, so I assumed I'd be able to do that also. I also checked all the charging stations near me to find out how many were withing walking distance and their pricing. I didn't consider availability (most are constantly in use) or hours of operation (most close by midnight). So, thinking I'd be able to charge at home soon, and in the meantime use public chargers, I went ahead and bought my car. I thought I was being a little neurotic with the amount of planning I was already doing. 😂\n\nThen once I bought my car, I learned it would cost $7k to install my own charger at home, plus about $100/mo for electricity with vendor markup. Versus walking a few blocks away to charge for $30/mo and zero installation costs. It's annoying and I regret not knowing this before getting into it.\n\nThere are about 50 EVs for every 1 public charger in my city. That tells me the vast majority of people aren't using public chargers as their sole method of charging. We need L2 curbside charging, subsidies to install chargers in existing multifamily buildings, and building codes that require 100% of new of parking spots to have charging infrastructure in place.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.007877964526414871,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3091711965788297,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1653023823473456,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23416979678789943,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2081161830574274,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18454314361654195,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1077183752010266,"ev_1":-0.2509161049227981,"ev_2":-0.13605366570037933,"ev_3":-0.2876445043300843,"ev_4":-0.20960280681062735,"ev_5":-0.14883416704833508,"ev_6":-0.11302584189852742},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

Recycling a post from another thread regarding the same car. \n\nThere has been a lot of discussion regarding the efficiency of this car and its cost but I think those discussions run counter to what Toyota is trying to achieve by developing this car. Furthermore, cost-wise, it seems to me to be about right for an extremely limited \"beta-type\" introduction of a new vehicle. Frankly, I'm kinda' surprised that it's not more expensive! Remember when the original [Tesla Roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster) was sold in 2008? It was a tiny two seater with a base price of $109,000 and only had a 200 mile range. How far they've come along! \n\nAt any rate, I think that the point of this car today is to test the ability to operate Hydrogen Fuel Cell batteries in the proverbial \"real world\" as a means of demonstrating and developing this new way for an EV to get its electricity. \nThe reason that I think this car has such a heavy “power-autonomy” angle to it, is because the distribution of electricity is already a major growth impediment for the growth of EVs in a large number of cities and countries. Globally, there are significant capacity problems for distributing larger amounts of electricity and this restricts what we can ever achieve with electric cars. While problems exist both in terms of the transmission as well as the generation of power, the problem is far, far greater on the transmission side of things.\n\n\nThere are only so many amps that can be put “into” and pulled “from” an existing infrastructure that has been built upon a standard 3 phase, 600 volt service model. That describes almost every modern city today. Just think about what happens every time temperatures start to consistently reach 100 degrees in most major cities. We run into transmission over-capacity problems due to the increase in A/C demand. Note, during these brown-out / black-out situations, it's almost never a problem on the generation side, it's a problem with the distribution/transmission of power. Where A/C demand is typically 110/120 Volt and only 10- 15 amps, most EVs rely on 240 volt, 30 – 40 amp service, so there is an absolute limit to how many could ever be installed in our current world. We'd bring down the entire system if a large number of people were to suddenly start driving electric cars within our current infrastructure. \n\nHaving said all of that, an overall goal of switching to EVs is to of course to eliminate fossil fuel usage remains a key focus area for us. To achieve the goal we need to build new kinds of infrastructure to replace fossil fuel distribution for ICEs with something that energizes EVs. If we were to look only at electricity management in its current form, it's a huge problem to overcome. There are massive restrictions that prevent us from just adding thousands of additional power lines and building thousands more transformer sub-stations or Power Plants, Solar Arrays, Wind Farms etc. \n\n\nTo illustrate the scope of the problem, just think for a moment about how excited we get in this subreddit about the success of Tesla. Even though we want to see everybody driving one, [Tesla “hopes” to sell 52,000 cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors) this year, while the country overall will purchase [18,240,000 ICE vehicles in just this year alone](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/total-vehicle-sales). We barely have the infrastructure to energize beyond a few percent of the overall quantity and that's just looking at \"new\" vehicles. Today, we have [254,000,000 ICE Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States) and approximately [373,000 EVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_the_United_States) vehicles currently operating in the US. So, 0.0014% of the current registered vehicles today are EVs.\n \nSo, *THIS* is the underlying reason that I welcome the exploration and development of alternative methods of energizing EVs. Toyota is testing a bold idea here. Maybe it will work and maybe it won't? Maybe it will work in Europe, but not here? Who knows? Regardless, I believe that they are addressing an important and often overlooked problem. We MUST figure out new methods of getting power to EVs if we ever hope to make more significant inroads into the broader passenger vehicle market.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012280064014097054,"1.1.1_stance":-0.31001686025215225,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21685451009234205,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2705202243788823,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.42885653576397526,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22661948480011648,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2286802523303777,"solar_1":-0.38785727754293475,"solar_2":-0.1767451699345869,"solar_3":-0.11196886491448924,"solar_4":-0.03285020332380858,"solar_5":-0.2549386416285415,"solar_6":-0.006206869886227651,"solar_7":-0.01246289573221778,"solar_8":-0.005758879630472317,"solar_9":-0.03277888062668666,"solar_10":-0.09992791252283068},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I worked for five years to try to bring solar power plus storage to an off grid community.  In the end, it just wouldn't pencil (this was last year).  We bought diesel generators instead.  Even before the price of oil dropped, it was the cheaper route.\n\n&gt;How economical is it to set up a nuclear power plants for villages and small towns to use.\n\nAt this point, not very.  The goal is to build out infrastructure, so smaller scale generation is where we should start.\n\n&gt;First to lay the structure out to the villages and secondly for the villages to be able to afford the power. These places would benefit much better from solar or wind even if the power is intermittent.\n\nSome power, even intermittent power, is better than no power.  Intermittent power allows for charging cell phones and water to be pumped for storage, and even septic systems.  That's huge.  However, that won't allow for household refrigeration, washing machines, lighting, or reliable cooking.  In the poorest areas, the majority of disease still comes from cooking indoors over open fires.  Thus, these places need some stable energy.  Mini-grid infrastructure is a requirement.  From there, small-ish diesel, natural gas, or propane generators are the easiest and cheapest methods to produce the kinds of power these places need.

You took what one person said and generalized it to all skeptics.  Score one logical fallacy for you.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, you don't seem to be getting the clue. I'm waiting for you to provide a bloody reference.\n\nI'm sure you can ask your pal John for a paper he co-authored that cites it.  I'm not going to dig it up because, as I already said twice, it's irrelevant to this discussion.  I'm accepting your position on that item for the sake of argument.\n\n&gt;That is an incredibly bold statement...\n\nHere we go.  You can't defend your claim that mitigation is cheaper, so you say, \"Nuh, uh.  You are.\"  Try this.  Cite something that shows that mitigation is undisputably cheaper than adaptation.\n\n&gt;What do you mean by \"settled\" here? How can a future cost ever be settled?\n\nExactly, so how can you make the unequivocal statement that mitigation is absolutely, positively cheaper than adaptation.\n\n&gt;That's simply not true. Go have a look at the Stern review and you will see.\n\nYou are saying the Stern review is gospel?  When was it written?  2005?  What has happened to estimates of ECS and TCR in the literature since then?  Since I'm sure you'll lie again, I'll tell you.  Estimates of both have decreased since that review was written, both in AR5 and subsequent literature.  You know it's true, so don't bother disputing it.\n\n&gt;That's complete nonsense. \n\nDo yourself a favor and read what economists have written on the subject.  It's widely acknowledged as a regressive tax.  \n\n&gt;Every tax can be implemented in such a way that it doesn't increase the income gap.\n\nNo.  Just no.  A rebate is an attempt to mitigate the regressive tax.  That doesn't make the tax *not* regressive.\n\n&gt;No, I haven't. The average citizien doesn't even know what \"intermittent\" means.\n\nAre we talking about skeptics or the masses?  You know very well that skeptics know the meaning of intermittency.  \n\n&gt;Nonsense. Renewables are competitive entirely without subsidies as soon as they are rolled out sufficiently.\n\nYou are so deluded:\n\n[Total federal subsidies in fiscal year 2007 were $24.34 per megawatt hour for solar-generated electricity and $23.37 per megawatt hour for wind, compared with $1.59 for nuclear, $0.67 for hydroelectric power, $0.44 for conventional coal, and $0.25 for natural gas and petroleum liquids.  **In fiscal year 2010, the subsidies were even higher.

It would be expensive, but I mean I hear building stuff on the Moon is easier so if there are trips there maybe building the solar panels on the Moon would be the best idea and after that all that’d have to be worked on is transferring the energy back to earth.

However, the tree is down now, although we didn't take it down because of the solar panels - the cost to take an oak down would never make up for what little more we would need- it was just old and snapped during a spring storm this year. That said, I expect that if I was to post this again next year there would be a lot less of a dip, and maybe I would not have a bill during the winter at all.

So your ramblings about money are a non sequitir, because again, WE MADE MONEY ON THE PROGRAM OVERALL. \n\nHere’s the thing about research. It’s really hard to do in the private sector. Not saying it can’t be done. Perkins and Will for example is a private firm that does research on sustainable tech. But overall it is a risky and hard business. So there is a push and pull with the government playing a role. I’m more than okay with government funded research, especially if it’s turning a profit for the government. If some of it fails that’s okay too. That’s the nature of research. \n\n&gt; the cheapest electric car costing $25k\n\nI’m in agreement that EV’s continue to be a difficult roll out. That said, in five minutes I was able to find a used Leaf for $10k. So you are overstating cost a bit here by not taking the used market into consideration.\n\nI believe the tech for EV’s to be totally viable is about 10 years away. However if you live on the right land, you could install solar panels on your roof today and they’d pay for themselves within 10 years. That’s the other part of the equation you miss. The upfront cost is high, no doubt there. But the long term cost actually comes in lower. And then when you start adding in tax breaks, it becomes more affordable. \n\n&gt; if we had reliable battery tech that could power a home for a month \n\nI have personally met engineers who have built closed solar systems for small (mostly private) islands that run entirely off solar energy. There is no back up. The battery technology is there today if you have the space to put them somewhere. The capability is not the problem; the space is the problem. The space issue gets better every year. The next ten years we are going to see a lot of maturation of this technology and I expect the costs will continue to drop as they have been for some time now.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.16874945557425058,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2835157394587412,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2262399759301214,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2411872387927068,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26112941169046844,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29096106205446,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2441749978277332,"solar_1":-0.16075456628223098,"solar_2":-0.19183377462843693,"solar_3":-0.09940749848126194,"solar_4":-0.023665403787788364,"solar_5":-0.08909260408606337,"solar_6":-0.031571530186071235,"solar_7":-0.11191044902564802,"solar_8":-0.024488451581814646,"solar_9":-0.007688107748080597,"solar_10":-0.09560069566020957},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

I also have solar so I can charge any time of the days because I am on NEM2.  All those other companies in the state are trying to go to NEM3 which is very bad for solar owners. If you think that we will have more of renewable energy soon, think again. It has been decades since people started installing solar panels. My solar was installed 8 years ago. So how far we have progressed? Not far at all. Solar still cost outrageous amount of money homeowners can't afford. A decent solar system still cost $30-40K and you have to have newer roof.  \n\nSolar farms are very few compare to consumption. You would think California would have by now cover the Mohave desert in solar panels since the land is basically free. But not so. Solar panels are still costly and don't produce as much power as you think. There are maybe a thousand of solar farms in California but less than 20% of energy is produced. Plus someone has to maintain the panels. They get covered by dust very quickly thus reducing production. Wind power is also not very reliable. I drive by wind farms very often and I see only 50% of them spinning. Wind turbines are usually installed in the high wind areas. The only good thing about wind power is that electricity can be produced day or night if there is wind. The negative is the cost. 2-4 million per turbine and $50K maintenance per year.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004954500000167172,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23617747668756753,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2520951622815597,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14023629513879618,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2441934234645151,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.01767127914354205,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.013320975980604999,"solar_1":-0.16503076540053976,"solar_2":-0.015729895574622788,"solar_3":-0.1150069476182883,"solar_4":-0.2552856993061141,"solar_5":-0.13608072946468988,"solar_6":-0.02418220701656537,"solar_7":-0.037007936523878016,"solar_8":-0.05010997704205996,"solar_9":-0.044492230922763554,"solar_10":-0.07386730265958856},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options.

Now it's 10-11 years following net metering plan changes. That's with relatively cheap electricity that's been pretty stable in cost. \n\nIn my area, realtors I know see solar as value neutral. Doesn't add to the price of the home for most buyers. Doesn't subtract from it either for most buyers. There is a subset of people that it would add or subtract for, but as crazy as the housing market is, you're more likely to get a cash offer from someone who doesn't care and it's worth the simplified sale quickly.

They don't euthanize humans so I won't suggest that to them. There are many problems that someone could have with this other than the indignity. I only gave you three. This method is only used on **piglets.** If I'm terminally ill and can decide on my own method of euthanasia, I'm too old for this method. I would not be smashed repeatedly either. It's one quick blow to the head. In the video you'll see piglets moving after the slam, but that is just muscle spasms. They are dead I promise you.\n\nVeterinarians don't use this method because most people don't have piglets with congenital defects. An old cat or dog has developed past the point where this method is acceptable.\n\n[The fact is that manually applied blunt force trauma to the head, either with an implement or by striking the head against a surface, has been shown to cause immediate unconsciousness and rapid death when performed correctly on **young** piglets.](http://atwork.avma.org/2012/07/21/hot-on-facebook-euthanasia-of-suckling-pigs-using-blunt-force-trauma/)\n\nFrom the same source.\n\n&gt;Physical methods of euthanasia (e.g., blunt force trauma, gunshot, decapitation) can be disturbing to observers, even when expertly performed. Because of this, it makes sense to consider alternatives if observers are unprepared or may be distressed by witnessing this type of euthanasia.\n\nThat is another reason vets would opt to use other means of euthanasia.\n\nWhat \"ridiculous statement\" are you talking about? I don't say these things to be a troll. I believe these things, but I'll admit that unfortunately the discussions often devolve into arguments over semantics. I had an interesting conversation that didn't. Did you see that one? \n\nI don't mind vegans so long as they don't mind me.

I decided to use this account to try and be the other side so that discussions like those don't end up one-sided. \n\nI didn't make a ridiculous post here to bother people.

So I figured I'd come back to this and explain that post a bit more since its clear you're actually rational.\n\nI didn't mean philosophy as if I thought there was some kind of theological background to a paleo diet. I'm currently studying nutrition because of doing crossfit and wanting to get the most out of it while remaining vegan. Anyways, in the class each diet is represented with a food pyramid and a list of facts.\n\nSo vegan says \"no animal products including those for insects (ie. milk, eggs, honey)\"\nAnd gluten free might say something like \"avoids wheat, rye, barley, and oats (note: oats are gluten free but are grown in the same fields as wheat, rye, and barley so cross contamination is high)\"\n\nEach of these are called a \"dietary philosophy\" to help everyone learn the fundamentals of every kind of diet. Everything I said was based on comparing a healthy vegan diet to a healthy paleo diet while avoiding all my bias as a vegan, because I don't think my personal beliefs about how wrong it is to take an animal's life for food will suddenly sway their opinion... But maybe showing the similarities between the two from a dietary standpoint would? A guy can dream I suppose...\n\nAbout the processed food I didn't mean for it to sound like I meant all vegans avoid processed foods because I would never take it upon myself to speak for all vegans. I was only talking about healthy diets which should all avoid heavily processed foods as much as they can. Even now I have a block of cheddar daiya in my fridge so I'm not saying it's the basis of veganism. I won't buy any more of it because of the palm oil, I've also started making my own cheese from homemade yogurt (cashew with a coconut milk starter) which makes me rely less on the store bought stuff :)\n\nBut again, just thought I'd reply since I consider you one of the more interesting and rational posters on here.

But I'm not going to accuse someone of not being vegan just because they occasionally eat lean meat, especially when they know they shouldn't. That's splitting hairs in my book as well. \n\nIt would be kind of like accusing my dad of being a smoker because he'll have a cigar at events from time to time. The reality is that he used to actually be a pack a day smoker and quit. Trying to say that an occasional cigar makes him a smoker would be splitting hairs. I view veganism in a similar light, it involves trying to quit something that can be hard to avoid at times, often due in large part by social situations. I don't expect perfection, especially not with veganism, as avoiding every instance of animal exploitation would be virtually impossible. Drawing a line for the vegan label over the occasional slip when we live in a society that's constantly pushing it in your face seems a tad anal.

At least that's what my experience has been with my family.  Actually my sister became a vegan after I was vegetarian for over 8 years, my ways rubbed off on her!  I no longer live with my parents whom both still eat meat, but they always respected my choice to go vegetarian greatly and loved when I cooked meals for them, they would also eat veg several times a week (I'm currently trying to quit cheese and whey protein! although I've been vegan for a number of years before).  \n\nAs for friends, I don't keep too many meat eating close friends simply because killing is something I avoid on a deeply personal level.  That's not to say I don't respect omnivores and am not friendly with co-workers and family who eat meat, but when it comes to whom I spend my time with and confide in, they are vegetarian and vegan because they have a heart humane enough not to kill, indirect or direct.  \n\nIt's my resolve deep within my heart that makes people naturally respect the way I eat and feel more than comfortable being around me eating meals.  They can see it's not some passing phase or that I feel undecided or awkward that I'm not eating animal products like they are.  \n\nThis does not mean I have always been shown respect for how I eat, no I've had my challenges.  In fact one time at a job I was working someone took deep offense when he found out I was a vegetarian.  I quickly learned how to explain the reason for not eating meat so as not to offend certain people.\n\nAnyways just thought I'd share my own experience.  But I will say you reach a point where this doesn't even phase you, if one even encounters this negative support at all.  \n\nIt sounds like it's coming from right in your household and is going to be a challenge.  You will also come to learn who truly respects you regardless of how or what you choose to eat.  You also have to have understanding and patience, some people may respect you but simply struggle personally to understand why someone wouldn't eat like them, the most important thing is not to make people feel like you look down on how they eat, everyone deserves respect.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004991945965836446,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2744357935963551,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17876002812457029,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2520443613436328,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3589569451287389,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.29053605771952895,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.28969915383753836,"diet_1":-0.06265780756560464,"diet_2":-0.15756103961134632,"diet_3":-0.12119493874282246,"diet_4":-0.14503704470310672,"diet_5":-0.11633583856989087,"diet_6":-0.1604052283570733,"diet_8":-0.008853237423257573,"diet_9":-0.006777879204795075,"diet_10":-0.11280585294298362,"diet_11":-0.0034956275970519832,"diet_13":-0.16939507751779043,"diet_14":-0.023452974196212988,"diet_17":-0.3680588673132444},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

I ate ramen noodles (ones which were devoid of chicken or beef stock ext), rice with soy sauce and pasta as my staples. I lived on a shoe-string budget because I'm not a very wealthy individual. I'm pretty lucky that I don't have excessive needs. Sweet foods like chocolate and other dairy confectionery were never things that I liked to eat.\n\nGradually, I came to realize that my diet was actually vegan. My realization came at a time when I moved into an apartment without refrigeration. I couldn't keep milk or dairy products which I seldom purchased prior to living in my new apartment.\n\nI really changed when I decided to make the switch to actual and conscious veganism. It came at the same time that I started running, exercising, studying and reading better material. \n\nI'd never felt healthier than when when I made the switch to a vegan diet which featured soy milk, tofu, supplements, fresh and canned fruit, fresh vegetables ext. \n\nI've been fully and actively vegan for around 5 years. The total time of veganism and vegetarianism is about 15 years. I don't think that I can ever look back from veganism. Having a healthy diet has given me a healthy body.

Anyone with these issues shouldn't be held to the standards of those who don't.

And if you aren't careful with it then you can have less than ideal levels.\n\nHowever, I don't see how this would lead to you being more likely to get ill with, say, a common cold. B12 relates to nerves and brain function, Omega 3 relates to heart health and blood pressure, Iron relates to your ability to carry oxygen in the blood. I guess Iron could be relatable, as fewer healthy red blood cells might make fighting illnesses more difficult; though I'm no doctor. \n\nHope that makes sense where I'm coming from.
