"comment": "OP, you need to apply for the state tax credit and begin planning for a 2015 project (as the funds are fully reserved for 2014).\n\nThe most cost effective system will be one which costs the lesser of $30k or 14x your annual state income tax liability. \n\nAt which point you will get roughly 65% of the system cost back on your taxes over the next 5 years. Turnkey solar costs in 2015 will likely be $3/W if you price it out, so at GA electricity prices you'll receive around a 5% return per year. \n\nSo you'll be looking at a 7 year payback or so, sooner if you understand value the salvage/property value increase.",

What this means, is that just because you always get a refund, it shouldn't stop you from putting in for the $7500 credit. \n\nWhat kind of sucks about the tax break is, if you paid say, $5000 in tax, and take the $7500 tax credit for an EV, the remaining $2500 tax credit is effectively lost.

My house is completely electric (HVAC/HWH/etc) and on average about 1/3 of my usage goes to my car, 1/3 goes to my HVAC, and then then rest is \"everything else\". Specifics below:\n\nI currently have a 19.52kW installation on my house in Maryland (so pretty close!). Roof is very suboptimal, EW orientation, with a little shading in the back. Last year I produced around 21 MWh.\n\nI have a Tesla P85D, which I use to commute to work (20 miles each way), and drive pretty aggressively. Last year it consumed around 8 MWh.\n\nI have a 3000 sqft house that is reasonably well insulated and kept at 69 degrees year long. It is heated/cooled by an electric GSHP (geothermal system). Last year it consumed around 9 MWh.\n\nThe rest of my home consumes somewhere in the range of 8MWh/year, so I'm currently a little shy on production (25 MWh consumed vs 21 MWh produced). Next month I'm having an additional 10.05 kW of panels installed on my roof. This will cover the 4 MWh I'm missing, plus give me some breathing roof for some installs down the road.\n\nLet me know if you have other questions! All of this data was collected using Curb, which I highly recommend.",

Offering the same on ICE would reduce sales, but in EV market the price expectations are higher.",

There are other supply-constrained cars fairly commonly that hold their value for a few years until a new model comes out or they make enough to meet demand. The model 3 isn't as special as people make it out to be. It's just in high demand and production hasn't caught up to demand. That won't be the case forever. There has never been a good reason to buy a used model 3 over a new one if you could get the new one quickly. Tesla's model that takes weeks to get you a car even if they aren't short on supply may help keep it up some even once orders aren't backed up, but it won't stay how it is now forever by any means. I think buying a 2017 or 2018 model 3 right now is an extremely stupid purchase. Depreciation will come and it will hit the early cars the hardest.",

"comment": "I recently spoke with a Tesla Model 3 owner, who is kind of obnoxious with his love of his car, but was actually outspokenly envious of our LEAF, because the only way he has one pedal is to use the screen to turn it on and off.  With the LEAF it is literally just a flick of the finger, so it can be used as an active part of normal driving, like stepping on the brake pedal.  The LEAF has always had a little bit of a video game feel to it. It can be very interactive if you want it to be. The regen \"shifter\" allows you 1) Coast/neutral 2) \"D\" drive with mild regen, \"B\" with stronger regen, and then the One Pedal switch for strong regen that literally brings you to a complete stop.  I very seldom touch the brake pedal.  This way we can both avoid using the friction brakes at all (except in emergencies when the car beeps at you then emergency stops itself, if you don't) and allows you to easily adjust your regen braking so that you can avoid over-charging beyond what the battery can take in at whatever its current level of charge is.  It makes driving a lot more interesting and actually fun.  We average 4.5miles/kWh (30-35% above spec economy and range) because of it, though we actually averaged 5.3 in our 2015 LEAF that had the same regen shifter but no One Pedal. I will definitely miss that aspect of driving a LEAF when we eventually move on to an electric van (Canoo hopefully)",

Of course should Tesla close up shop and leave the union employees wouldn't get that same deal, they'd get around 80-90% of their salary for up to a year at a time from their unions \"akassa\" as long as they meet certain requirements, which is mostly that they have to be actively looking for a job.\n\n>Oh, and if Tesla were to 'pack up and leave', it wouldn't just be the mechanics without a job. It would be ALL / EVERYONE.\n\nNon-union members who also aren't part of an \"akassa\" can get the equivalent of around $1100 a month for up to a year at a time, again, as long as they meet certain requirements, which is mostly that they have to be actively looking for a job.\n\nBut I wouldn't be too worried about them not finding a job. There's a big need in this country for mechanics, technicians, accountants, managers, bookkeepers, etc. They'd get picked up by other companies in due time. Especially the mechanics. Because Tesla might've left the country, but their already sold cars haven't and they'd still need to be serviced. Other shops would be glad to pick up those customers and the mechanics needed to help those customers.",

"comment": "Your best bet is to use a hybrid ICE car.\n\nThat's amusing. Here, it's the opposite at the moment: gas being unstable and electricity being stable.\n\nThe other issue you may run into is certain towns or cities may not have many fast charging. Then, you have to plan how you travel based on that one charger that may work or not or have a line of cars waiting.\n\nFor example, I did a trip to a national park and they had 1 charging station location that was I think 45 minutes away to the national park. So I charged to 99%. When we got to the park, we had 76% left.\n\nSo we could drive around a little to sight see, but I was already planning that at 50%, we needed to leave regardless of what fun my we were having, since you don't want to drain below 20% and I wanted to keep the 20% as a safety buffer because there was a time I spent 10% battery driving from one charging location to the next because the chargers were broken or charged too slow.\n\nIf I were you and you don't have access to an ice, I'd calculate how much you'd spend renting a small ICE plus gas VS how much EV will cost you.\n\nWhen we were in Frankfurt and I munich, we rented a small compact BMW; however, Hertz gave is a Ford Focus.\n\nI guess they same my US passport and thought I preferred a Ford, when really, we wanted the BMW. We even begged them to give it to us. Haha.\n\nI may be American, but I'm not one of those super proud ones going around boasting about made in America and blah blah. \n\nFrom what I remember of Germany and other parts of Europe is the infrastructure is still kind of old fashioned, which I love and appreciate, so maybe one day, they'll figure out how to lower the electricity rate.",

"comment": "GTELs or Gas turbine electric locomotives are from time to time built and employed usually targeted to specific applications where high power needs and / or reduced mass needs out weigh the fuel economy needs of the prime mover or generator unit of an electric traction locomotive.  In such specific cases it proves a better choice than the much more common diesel engine as prime unit generator for a electric traction locomotive.  The gas turbine provided the necessary high power electrical output required for the electric traction motors to very effectively pull large loads up steep grades.  The Union Pacific GTE Locomotives of the 60s where an example of this.   \n\nA large reason for the poor fuel economy of GTELs is because they have typically operated on electric platforms that are just electric drive trains and no significant energy storage (batteries) to compliment the gas turbine as we find in vehicles with series hybrid and range extender designs.  The gas turbine had to throttle up and down to constantly meet the changing output / load needs.   In such an electric drive train with minimal energy storage designs, the diesel engine is generally a more economical fit and thus very common today as the power generator of choice for electric traction locomotives as well as large earth movers.  \n\nBut the game is very different in a BEV with ER, battery (electric vehicle with range extender).  Note: these are also known as an in series hybrid electric vehicle where the engine provides entirely or most of the long range needs and where the batteries handle the bulk of the average driving cycle.   \n\nAs a range extender for a BEV, a gas turbine is able to operate at its most efficient when ever called upon to provide the additional power.  A gas turbine excels in the hybrid electric environment because it is the one engine that can operate at full rpm / peak load without seeing self destruction that we see in the reciprocating and constant volume engines (rotary - Wankel included).  All other engines considered for range extension cannot operate long peak power or as mechanics would call it \"their sweet spot\".   And operating at their design point is very important when employed as a range extender because an engine that can do so will offer the most power per mass.  Indeed a gas turbine is healthiest when operating at its design point / peak power / \"sweet spot\".  Thus it can achieve an even higher value than its already high value of KW / KWG.  No other energy generator can touch this.  \n\n The gas turbine further returns the favor.  It allows the batteries to do what they do best and removes the problems of over heating, over charging (beyond 80 percent for LI ion), cold ambient effect on battery chemistry, under charging issues, battery safety concerns and etc.  Most importantly, the much lighter MGT (micro gas turbine) plus fuel tank replaces the much greater battery weight that would be required to meet that occasional long range need.  This extra battery weight is a weight penalty carried around for occasional need for most of the average driving cycle.  And it still does not get close to removing the range anxiety when driving in those charging deserts, that a GT range extender can achieve.  In fact a GT does not even need a gas station as they have been run on whiskey and perfume in a pinch.\n\nGas turbines are much more fuel flexible than their reciprocating intermittent combustion isometric counterparts.    And that brings me back to those GTE Locomotives.  One of the motivations for the Union Pacific creating its GTEL fleet was that those trains could run on bunker fuel which at the time was dirt cheap.  This was a substantial cost savings at least until the arrival of the mid seventies energy crisis which drove up the price of even a once  throwaway fuel.  \n\nToday, this feature of gas turbines and especially when packaged with a BEV can very effectively run on carbon neutral fuels.  That combined with the low emissions at exhaust make for a very clean engine.  Cleaner by far than a non hybrid BEV when using the more accurate well to wheel analysis.  \n\nBecause of their relatively low pressure ratio, modern KW (or micro) gas turbines can also make use of heat recovery components (recuperators or regenerators) that dramatically improve a micro gas turbine's fuel economy.  Such add in components are relatively easy to do with adiabatic isobaric Brayton cycle engines but very difficult with the conventional isometric engines.  Such heat recovery components further improve an engine's fuel economy while reducing exhaust temperatures and dampening sound.  \n\nThis adding in (within the T cycle to enhance the T cycle) of components is not at all possible in the isometric engines (SI, - gasoline PI diesel and SI rotary).    It is a rare and valuable feature available to the GT engineer that allows them to literally alter the cycle to improve performance and efficiency.  For example - a gas turbine can be so altered as to convert it from a Brayton T cycle to an Ericson T cycle engine.  This type of advancement becomes even more possible when the GT is part of an electric power and drive train.  \n\nYour BMW i3 would be well served with a small micro turbine range extender.  An already nice car made better with that swap from that little scooter engine to a small MGT that packs a lot more power for that range extender duty.  As I write this I am of the understanding that the BMW i3 is being discontinued.  How about bring it back with a TRE or turbine range extender.  That would be one hot little car.",

"comment": "Good piece.  It is interesting how the UK has agreed to pay £17.6B in state aid, to quite a degree by agreeing to pay twice the market rate for electricity at £92.50 per mega watt hour.  Then to get past the state aid rules, the EU changed said rules in October 2014.  Looks to me that Cameron has already had his favours off the EU.  \n\nIt would appear that the main lessons learned from the nuclear power dance around future reactors in Europe and globally is that they come in years late (if at all) [9 years late for the French EPR] and billions over budget (2x for French EPR €3.3B -&gt; €8B).  And the technical problems that have to be solved to provide safety look pretty hard to do with tight constraints on time and money.\n\nWhy not use on-shore wind and solar panels?  Much safer, faster and cheaper, especially if state subsidised.  You could also get that much power off a Severn Barrage, for which modern designs exist which do not require mountain top removal.",

Assuming over 250 Ah batteries and proper high quality deep cycle batteries.\n\nThey are all rated for 700-1200 discharges at 20% discharge rates. And general consensus is never to discharge them over %50.\n\nThis means you need a huge array of batteries if you only want to discharge 20% per day and have them working for 5-10 years.\n\nThe Nife Batteries, are from 400 Ah to 1000 Ah, and you can discharge them up to 80%. Even if you do 100% you don't actually kill them. You can't kill them. They seem to be rated for 10,000 cycles and then you can just replace the electrolyte fluid and again they are as new.\n\nWhat you invest in more panels you save in batteries. Seems like a no brainier to me if you have the solar space. I tend to use more energy at night, so the storage part would be by far more important for me than energy production.",

I live in Sweden and only in the last year or so have I started to see solar panels go up on some government funded buildings, which makes me *very* happy to see. But I feel like a lot of people still have the general attitude of \"What a waste, we (Sweden) don't even get sun during almost the entire winter, so what's the point?\" when they see it. Do you guys get a lot of similar response or questions being asked about the feasibility of solar power in countries where there isn't as much sunlight year round? How are you handling that?",

You think if it takes 1MWH to make a 300W panel, on paper that gives you a lifetime return of 1.4...how much of that theoretical margin is consumed in the manufacture of all the ancillary gear like inverters, wires, racks, BATTERIES? Let's be real here, this is just a vehicle for externalization of emissions. I do, however consider solar a good transition technology for small offgrid apps, but to replace our gluttonous consumption with anything new would cost so much and emit so much carbon that it's self defeating.",

"comment": "Yea, I think it's totally fair to evaluate solar based solely on its financial merits.  So let's do the numbers:\n\nBased on my 11 year break even point and a minimum 25 year lifespan, that gives me a ROI of around 122% for my 11 years of sunk capital.  To match that in the market would require about 8% compounding annually, over and above inflation.  That's certainly possible, but probably not in what I would consider \"low risk\" investments, whereas I consider solar very low risk.  Also, for all practical purposes energy is not an optional purchase.  You're going to buy electricity no matter what price it's at.  So If you make 10% in the stock market, but have to pay 11% higher energy costs, you've actually net lost money.  Solar is a hedge against that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way I think of it, if the power company sent you a flyer tomorrow that said, \"Prepay for 10 years of electricity and get an additional 15 years free\", my guess is a lot of financially reasonable people would take that option.  But when you stamp the word \"Solar\" on that offer, people seem to hesitate.\n\nLastly, regulatory uncertainty is a fair point.  However, there have been some states that have amended or abolished net metering, and as far as I know, they have all grandfathered in existing customers.  Michigan's net metering law actually states that they only have to offer it for a maximum of 1% of retail customers.  Last I heard, Michigan is nowhere near 1% solar.",

"comment": "&gt;..direct subsidies to Tesla for Powerwalls\n\nThat would be hard to break out because it's part of the product line that Tesla Inc. manufactures. To my knowledge, subsidies for individual products aren't broken out. As of 2015 Tesla itself has been subsidized to the tune of [4.9 billion dollars](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html) \n\n&gt;How big are the subsidies to the fossil companies\n\nTricky question. It depends on who you ask and what they count as a 'subsidy'. Some even count Gross Income minus Net Income as a subsidy.\n\n&gt;How big are the externalized costs of air and water pollution caused by fossil industry?\n\nIt's a fair question if you also ask Tesla the same question.\n\n&gt;How big are the cost of building roads to support the auto..\n\nTesla automobiles also use roads. If you ordered the Tesla Powerwall, most likely it would arrive at your door delivered by a diesel powered truck. No roads, no 'fossil' fueled trucks, no Tesla Powerwall cookie for you.",

For example, Solar power has exceeded expectations, it's now far more efficient and economical than appeared likely a decade ago. There is also a great deal of scope for us to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nSadly, the bottom line is that while worthwhile action is being taken it's not proportionate to the scale of the problem.

Embodied carbon is one input into that. He doesn't state where the panels come from (this can double the embodied carbon in a panel), what the assumptions are in terms of panel longevity, nor address variation in output based on siting. What he gives is a derived value from someone else's paper, but the doesn't give the assumptions themselves. \n&gt;\n\nSo he can't build on someone else's research? \n\n&gt;&gt;He uses non-US nuclear plants in his analysis of construction delay timelines.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, he does. I need to correct that. He cherry picks the worst examples around the world. \n\nDon't have data on this readily available, so I suppose you may be correct. Do you have a good example of a nuclear plant going up quickly?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;And intermittency doesn't need to be addressed when the metric is cost per killowatt-hour, since intermittency is accounted for in the cost metric.\n&gt;\n&gt;Bullshit. Intermittency most certainly isn't address in the cost metric. The only occurrences of the word only occur in the footnotes, and all of them in titles of papers he himself has written.\n\nHis cost metric is dollar per killowatt-hour. How do you capture intermittency in that unit?\n\nYou can't, because it is implicitly captured. The solar panels don't produce energy when it is dark, but that doesn't matter because this paper is concerned with the total energy output by the end of life. Whether it's constantly producing electricity like nuclear or is idle at night like solar _is irrelevant_ when your metric is total energy output.",

Most of the US is far better from solar standpoint than munich. I'm seeing \\~40-50% more solar power in a large portion of the US.  [https://globalsolaratlas.info/?c=43.881991,-56.54779,3&amp;s=37.396089,-122.022937](https://globalsolaratlas.info/?c=43.881991,-56.54779,3&amp;s=37.396089,-122.022937) could be useful for those that park their car in a parking lot before going into work. 90% of the cost of solar isn't the actual panel itself, how they reduce those components will be key. I don't have those numbers, and neither do you, so it's fine to wish them the best, right?\n\nI also don't know why you're assuming you have to get all your power (or even half) your power from it. It's just a way for people that can't install solar on their apartment for ex. and park on the street to drive a greener vehicle, no?\n\nIf all you wanted to do was save as much money as possible you wouldn't be driving an EV in the first place.",

As of last Friday they've updated to 340w QCells.",

We can do hydrogen to electricity conversion at relatively high efficiency as well nowadays, much more favorable than fossil fuel conversion to electricity.\n\nHave you tried pricing out battery storage for a household to operate for 2+ days? It’s pretty horrid if you want to run a dryer and stove. The solar is much, much cheaper than the battery capacity, so one might go with a limited battery bank and then a large, long-term hydride fuel cache that could store weeks of full operating power, stuff that could cost hundred of thousands of dollars in conventional battery storage.",

Here is an installation manual with wiring diagrams in back showing various ways that can be hooked up:\n\n[https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/Powerwall\\_2\\_AC\\_GW2\\_NA\\_EN\\_Installation\\_Manual.pdf](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/Powerwall_2_AC_GW2_NA_EN_Installation_Manual.pdf)\n\nI understand that the transfer time from on-grid to standalone operation is rather slow, though, compared to a typical UPS - some threads at [teslamotorsclub.com](https://teslamotorsclub.com) state 200-500ms, slow enough to crash most computers, so unfortunately you'd probably still need a small UPS on those. It may be good enough to not bother your HVAC system much during the transition, though some may shut down briefly to protect against compressor short-cycling.\n\nDoes anyone have a current, official transfer-time spec? Hopefully this is something they can improve via software updates? The huge 200A contactor in the Backup Gateway will impose a certain minimum time, but should still be capable of better than 200ms.\n\nMy Outback inverter will switch in about 32ms (2 60Hz cycles), more than a typical UPS but good enough to keep all the computers &amp; electronics happy. Faster is possible if I were willing to waste \\~20W 24/7 to keep the inverter on \"hot standby\", and its transformer relay always closed. It was nice to get rid of all those little desk-side units with their short-lived batteries.  The Outback's transfer relay is only 60A-rated, though, which helps for speed.",

"comment": "It’s supposed to be better in terms of recycling long term because it doesn’t have cobalt in it but obviously that’s pretty far down the road. Cobalt is a conflict mineral mined in Africa so it’s expensive and has lots of other complicated implications in terms of supply chain and impact on humans so the fact it’s not used is beneficial to some folks. \n\nIt hasn’t been out in the wild for very long at all but it’s a 10 year warranty that includes service so at least you know you are covered if anything happens. It’s quite frankly gigantic in terms of physical size and currently has a 7,680 AC limit (same a Powerwall) so if the solar system is larger than that you have to divert some power from the battery which is a bummer. There’s supposed to be updates to that soon. Currently only works with newer Sunpower micros but should integrate with older SunPower systems and other manufacturers in the future. You can get 13kWh or 2 units to make 26kWh but it doesn’t scale up the continuos/max power output when you get 2 like the powerwall. Power is very slightly higher than the powerwall. \n\nThey are more expensive than both LG Chem and Pwalls at around 16k starting but the warranty is better since service is included. Honestly not sure about round trip efficiency comparisons off the top of my head.",

"comment": "While I can't tell you what to ultimately do, I will tell you what I an in the process of doing.  I am building a house right now and wanted to add solar.  Where I am in Wisconsin, being grid tied has no money making aspects ( poor net metering).  So instead of integrating to the grid and paying a transmission fee just for being connected (un-avoidable fee), we opted to just be off-grid with whole house battery. same store as you panel warranty are 25 years and battery warranty is considered 6000 cycles or so.  (Lithium deep cycle batteries).  This doesnt mean they are done after that warranted amount, but depending on how the parts are used they may or may not last much longer.  Lithium Batteries will last much long as long as the charge is never depleted below 80% depth of discharge (below 20% battery life remaining).  That wears a battery out much quicker.  So I plan on taking good care of my equipment to get the best life out of them.\n\nYour AC situation is of course different than mine.  Batteries may need to be sizes larger which is much more costly.  My total off grid system cost was about $44,000.  Half of that was for the batteries.  I am installing this system myself.  Hope this helps. -Wisconsin",

"comment": "There is no Time of Use in Massachusetts.  If you are worried about outages, a portable generator is $500-$800 plus $350 for a generator breaker panel, amd $500 for an electrician to install.  A single battery is $15,000 with installation, plus they will require a subpanel for an extra $1700.  A generator can be filled with unlimited gasoline, even siphon from your car if needed.  A battery can only store what a generator can output every 2 hours, and can only be charged if there isn't snow on your solar panels, and those panels don't produce much during the winter even without snow. So during an outage, there may not be enough solar to power your home during the day much less charge the battery for night.",

I have heard of some countries that have \"recharged\" the rods but not many do it and I don't know the process but I can assume it's intensive.\n\nI went on a tour of nuclear power plant years ago, it was an informative tour. That said, I would like many energy options instead of relying on one form or another. I have always like the idea of replacing windows on sky scrapers with solar panels. Make the buildings in our cities put energy into the grid. Perhaps even have some vertical farming in skyscrapers. Anyway, no one idea/source will provide for our needs and it should vary from place to place given the environmental constraints of the area.",

"comment": "Your solar installer can work with the roofer to keep the warranty intact. We do it on occasion for customers who don’t want to void their roofers workmanship warranty . Roofer tears off roof to sheathing, solar installer comes out and does some work (installs posts) roofer finishes roofing around posts and voila. No roof penetrations through the shingles. \n\nAlso, a good solar installer will offer 10 year leak protection on their install even if it’s done directly through the shingles into the joists. Most roofers only offer like 1-10 years on their workmanship warranty (leak protection) anyway so even if you void the roofers workmanship warranty the solar installer might be offering better leak protection on a retrofit solar install anyhow (and it’s cheaper) cuz it’s less trips to your house.",

I haven't done much research on the batteries, so I'm not sure what kind of space I would need to allocate for that.\n\nI also run into the issue of only being able to haul 3500 pounds on my jeep Wrangler, so a light trailer is needed. The one I'm planning to get, is right under 2000 pounds. So I don't have too much room for heavy cargo. I know that lithium batteries weigh less than lead, but I'm not sure by how much honestly.\n\nThere's so many things to take Into account.\n\nI was really just trying to get a material list and go from there.\n\nPropane may be my best option, but I was attempting to do the math and see how long it would take solar to pay off in the end. And since propane's price fluctuates, it's a bit hard to tell.",

You will pay an insane amount of money to someone else to come and go up on the roof to get the job done. \n\nEnphase will release new versions of micro inverters in future which won’t be backward compatible. So 15 years later when one fails you would need to replace the entire set and also the gateway.

"comment": ">Nobody is making an environmental argument based on market decisions\n\nHere is the news for you: maybe we should already?\n\nAlthough, no, subsidies and funding are pretty much interventions and tools to regulate the market, so we are actively making 'the market' to take such decisions and alter it. \n\n>The issue is economic. We're making an economic argument.\n\nThe issue is surely economic, but it's also economic as in not taking the said decisions and not further introducing anything possible would mean an economic mini-catastrophy at best, on top of everything.\n\nAnd no, it's not just an economic argument. It's a policy decision issue, where somehow many are tying to stupid short-term profit-driven decisions of market across and the market fundamentalist arguments. \n\n>But if you wanna talk environmental issues and externalities\n\nSurely, let's talk about making the bloody emissions and harms due to it, including the production and transfer, included into the price so that the market actors can sink to the bottom as they would need to pay the price if they are into polluting things or into enjoying things from the pollution havens. \n\n>nuclear takes big issues with it's 500k years of fuel storage problem\n\nOkay, hear me out: I'd rather deal with the nuclear waste issue or downsides of the battery production and the solar panel production and hazardous solid waste that'll rise from it than furthering the global warming to the point of altering the climate change to an irreversible level, killing out tons of species, destroying the arable land and causing grave displacements, starvation, and chaos. \n\n>national security risk\n\nHeck, energy dependency and dependency on gas and oil supplies is the very national security risk instead. Not to mention, tolerating climate change resulting in grave national security risks by itself. \n\n>and future possible uninhabitable metropolitan areas.\n\nAgain, I'd rather deal with the issues rising from hazardous solid waste from solar panels, storage of the nuclear waste, battery production related issues etc. than literally bringing on mini-catastrophies onto the said metropolitan areas, including climate refugees, resource wars, water scarcity, unbearable heat waves, and killing the nature on the side. \n\n>Trying to build nuclear in spite of the economics\n\nStupid neo-liberal paradigm and the comical kind of market fundamentalist economic models' failed axioms =/= economics. It's not some typical Murican mainstream economy department where we'd be blabbering von Mises and kumbaya the status quo. If you're so for it, in a system where externalities aren't counted and the state or global institutions won't be regulating and limiting things would be the one where we'd be burning all the coal and gas, as it'd be way cheaper. Then we can enjoy some idiots making short-term profits when watching the whole world crumble... The very environmental economy and environmental movement, minus the eco-modernist kumbaya, is about going against the status quo and the existing market paradigm & production and consumption patterns.",

Banning gas for heating and cooking just hurts poor people. Subsidizing solar panels on rich people's roofs to create often-useless power is bad for poor people. \n\nIf we get to 2030, and we CANNOT get rid of all ICE vehicles, we will look like idiots. I am a parent and I have one guiding priciple - \"Don't make promises you can't keep and don't make threats you won't follow through on.\"\n\nNo one has made great plans yet for how to decarbonize trucking, mining, steel, concrete, or plastics. No one has sourced all the lithium and copper needed to get that many EV cars built. No one has the public buy-in yet to do all that mining and industry either. \n\nThey took a laudable goal, a shoot-for-the-stars goal, and they made it sound super-easy! And if this rubs you the wrong way, dear reader, ask yourself this - How did/do you feel about Trump promising they'd be back on the moon in two years? Pretty stupid right?",

If he feels that strongly about eating animals, then he a) needs to get rid of this \"part time vegan\" nonsense, clearly he doesn't have a problem with hurting animals if he just \"indulges\" guiltlessly every 60 days b) needs to find a relationship where he can either behave responsibly (i.e in accordance with the expectations that he's established with his girlfriend) or where she's a fellow omni. \n\nI also don't think he has the best of intentions at heart if he would be that cavalier about using \"fuck her.\" Not that he needs to turn it into a Harlequin novel, but it does seem a pretty negative way to phrase it. \n\nSavage obviously went off in typical omni fashion, where your ethical choice is basically the same level as deciding to wear bright fuschia t-shirts the rest of your life. Just really really hateful, and over nothing more than being more compassionate than he is. He called it controlling, but we're dealing with ethics here, it's reasonable to assume at least our SO's will adhere to some fundamental tenet that we value. Would expecting your SO to not go through GTA-style mass killing be \"controlling.\" He tried to paint the withholding of sex as being manipulative, and maybe it was, but maybe that's all she felt she could do short of breaking up with him.\n\n**tl;dr:** They're incompatible, apparently.

It is important to get her therapy started, because this disease has long term consequences, like cardiac and bone problems.\nThis disease has nothing to do with vegetarianism. I have never been a vegetarian. About 10% of women can develop it. It is a chronic, serious disease, of which most people are not aware.\"",

"comment": "&gt;how come veg/vegans still get shit for wanting to help the planet, be healthier and save some animals? I just don't get it....\n\nBecause other people don't want to be veg/vegan and our very existence shows many self-proclaimed \"animal lovers\" that their exploitation and killing of animals is very unnecessary and hard to justify. \n\n&gt;BUT the factory farming industry should be reason enough for human CONSCIOUSNESS to rise above our cravings for dead flesh/puss filled cow milk... right??\n\nI'd think that animal farming period should be reason enough. I hope so. Otherwise people are just going to pay more for stupid crap like \"free range\" eggs that are still awful and unnecessary. \n\n&gt;Anyone else get these damn comments about how god made animals for us to eat?\n\nYep, from my mom. And I've gotten worse from that, I assure you. Ironically, I've gotten some of the craziest shit from people I really try *not* to talk to about veganism (or at least in the situations that I'm around them for). I'm not one to back down from a good debate, but even I have my limits and I do have some sense. \n\nIn any case, Facebook sucks. Seriously, when I was on it I started liking people I had friended less and less because there is crap you just don't want to know about people and vice versa (including them just acting dumb). I feel like I'm actually closer to people -- in a good way -- now that I'm off. If I have exciting stuff to share then I can pick up the phone and actually have a real conversation and there's more to talk about because not everyone has heard all the details of my life and vice versa.",

This is weird because people in countries with harsh winters tend to eat a lot of potatoes since you can store them in the basement throughout the entire winter. So if they didn't even have potatoes available...What did they eat?\n\nThat potato comment makes me think that it's either someone who's messing with you  or someone who's old enough to have gone through famine.\n\nAnd to answer your question, I'm on a tight budget right now, so I eat a lot of rice +vegetables + cucumber or potatoes + vegetables + cucumbers, if I'd be in my cold home country right now,  I'd eat the same way, just with more soups and stews.\n\nOf course, I tend to stay in the cities, it might be different in villages, though in my country you can get vegetables everywhere, so it's doable.\n\nAlso I'm pretty sure that although being 100% vegan might be difficult due to the limited food choices, being 100% vegetarian is probably much cheaper than being an omnivore, and from what I understand back in the day people in villages ate meat only on special occasions (because, you know, you had to actually slaughter a pig, and then pig was gone).\n\nP.S. B12 might be an issue, so probably if someone can't get supplements, then some eggs and/or dairy here and there would be the way to go for our poor rural vegan.\n\nP.P.S. Did that person tell you which exact region of Russia he was from?",

My market does occasionally have good sales on meat and dairy but for the most part, that shit is just way too expensive for what you get. I've almost cut my grocery bill in half since going vegan and I'm eating more varied and nutritionally rich foods than ever, getting all the calories I need, and just loving life right now. \n\nIt's almost annoying. Because I want to tell everyone how great this feels and how completely eye-opening it has been, I feel like I'm free of an addiction, basically. But I get that not everyone feels the same way about it and veganism is still stigmatized somewhat. But man. I swear, if more people tried it out. And I mean, really gave it a sincere effort with a rich and complete diet. It's amazing.",

Add to pasta with baby spinach and some olives or fresh tomatoes.\n\nHope these help! One thing I do to save time, I will cook up a whole bunch of lentils (whole red lentils) with garlic and sweet potato, then freeze them in meal size containers. Then it makes it way easier when I want to make a quick &amp; filling pasta or curry. Lentils are really filling and cheap, especially if you have any Indian, Asian or bulk food grocery nearby.",

For all the commenters going on about how it’s okay this one time but don’t do it again: had OP gave the person a gift card or change, is there any guarantee the purchase would have been vegan? Food, beverage, or drug wise? No. Exactly ! \n\nOne can argue that purchasing from any fast food place or store that sells meat with limited vegan options is not ethical. Only you can make that determination as an individual if your support for a beyond meat at X franchise is in support of a demand or of a cruel industry.",

"comment": "Okay but I don't condone the breeding of animals for food, as I've stated already.\nAnd killing an animal for food is not cruel. Theres a meaning to that. And an understanding of what you're doing depending on how. And if it is done in a way where you yourself have an understanding and appreciation for what's being done, and an understanding for what you're taking away and you do it in a way that causes as little suffering as possible, as other animals typically do, then you're not being cruel. Being cruel is willfully causing pain and suffering and having NO CONCERN about it. Again, language is deliberate. You can't just go aaaah this fits my view so I'm going to say it's cruel and just preach that to everyone, because that's not true. In fact, it is essentially a lie. And is extreme.\n\nAnd science states that there are essential nutrients we need from animals that we literally cant get from anywhere else. So that's not a fact. Can we live without them? Yea. But were not perfectly healthy and at optimal levels without them. Now with that being said, we're really only.supposed to est like 4oz of meat with 1 meal like twice a week if you're trying to live as long as possible. And you can see this in the history of the way different regions live and eat and average life expectancy for those regions. \n\nVeganism has been taken to huge extremes recently that were never even apart of it before simply because it's a trend and now a bunch of you are uneducated and just spewing whatever bs you \"feel is right\" and you're spreading misinformation. Animal derived materials and foods from.animals that dont harm the animal for instance, were never apart of veganism until recent years. But now it's all anyone can do to say don't eat honey because that's not vegan which is false. There's a lot of ways to be vegan. And just because someone's view is different from yours in how they practice veganism doesn't mean they're not vegan. It just means there not as over the top for veganism as you are. Just saying. Look up the history and come correct or don't come at all. Please.",

Presumably as a vegan they dont serve you animal products and if your boyfriend consistently turns down animal products witu enough of a firm stance, it'll change even if they grumble. The other alternative is them trying to starve your boyfriend which most parents won't do.\n\nAs to the cow situation, personally I would say that the moment they start on that path, I'd not eat or associate with them as much as possible and attempt to move out as quickly as feasible. \n\nIf they ask why, you can be honest and say you don't want to be around that type of behaviour where it can be avoided. It might cause initial tension but in the long term, honesty is better than simmering resentment.",

There have been times where I’ve had to attend work functions and I’ve been explicitly told not to bring my own food, so I have to trust that the staff at whatever venue are going to accommodate my needs to the best of their ability. \n\nI guess my deontic (thank you for the new word!) moral framework in regards to, for example, the fish and chips thing comes down to this - we all went vegan because we care for animals and want to advocate for their right to live freely. We know that their flesh isn’t our food. Regardless of whether or not any cruelty could be directly attributed to our decision to make the purchase, why would we actively choose to put them in our stomachs?",

"comment": "I don't think you can draw that conclusion. Here's why:\n\nChanging someone's mind doesn't just happen in a handful of interactions. You can see going vegan as installing anti-carnist software. It requires hundreds of steps, thousands of seperate ideas. If you were to put all the necessary ideas in a single conversation it would literally be a day long. (The average audiobook of a 200-300 page intro to veganism book is something like 10-15 hours of monologue audio so two way is probably at least double that, and a full vegan worldview probably requires more than just 200-300 pages). Even merely recognising that *maybe* this is something you need to worry about takes a lot of updating your worldview already.\n\nActivists generally have two approaches to get a person from A to B:\n\n* Directly communicate a single step (works whether a person want to listen or not)\n\n* Get a person intrinsically motivated to investigate the entire topic thoroughly\n\nYou and I will almost certainly agree the second option is ultimately the best because short of teaching a compulsory class on veganism this is the only way to actually get a person from A to B.\n\nHowever the problem is for a topic to be investigated through intrinsic motivation you have to *know it exists* in the first place.\n\nThis teachers is great at the first method. I am sure close to all students will leave that school knowing that veganism exists and have a rough idea of what it is about. They'll have negative attitudes about it sure. But if someone with more tact comes along who also happens to be vegan these students'll now have some background knowledge and this second person may get them started on method 2.\n\nIn short I think true change requires us to 1) make noise, 2) make people investigate once we've got their attention. For both steps (in what is ultimately a gradual process) different levels of tact work best. Imo being a bit forward/abbrasive as often as possible gets as as many people as possible to the starting line of method two while reducing the likelihood of method 2 working. More passive approaches make metgod two more likely to work but reduce the number of people getting to the starting line of method 2.\n\nSo imo, if it weren't for the loud and out annoying vegans the more reasonable activists wouldn't have many people to work with.\n\nGetting people to listen and getting them motivated to know more require opposing levels of tact.\n\nJust my 2 cents on this endless debate.",

"comment": "Yes. But I was referring to a specific discourse from what you most commonly find now as \"regenerative grazing fans\". They have an entire [pseudoscience](https://tabledebates.org/publication/grazed-and-confused) relating to the environment, it's akin to flatearther pseudoscience.\n\nOne of their myths is that the soy grown in the world isn't mostly raised for animal feed. They do this by calling it a byproduct, a waste of making soybean oil. This isn't as much pseudoscience as it is disinformation, as the soybean meal and cakes are coproducts, not waste. But this is the kind of shit I have to deal with just on reddit.\n\nAnother myth is that herding/ranching doesn't impact the water cycle (consume extra water leading to no water) because cows urinate. \n\nAnother myth, aside from the carbon storage one, is that grasses and trees are friends. No, really.\n\nThere are many myths. It's basically like trying to talk to a creationist about science.  \n\n And they have decent funding and make up lots of documentaries. Obviously, they're supported by [Big Meat](https://jacobinmag.com/2022/03/big-agriculture-funding-regenerative-ranching-amp-grazing-soil-carbon/) as they serve the role of a greenwashing front, but they also represent the settler-colonial \"Beef Lebensraum\" tradition. One of their heroes, [Savory, is such a piece of shit](https://web.archive.org/web/20210619043046/https://theecologist.org/2021/jun/14/regenerative-ranching-racket-0). \n\nhttps://www.rangemagazine.com/archives/stories/fall99/allan_savory.htm\n\nhttps://freefromharm.org/agriculture-environment/saving-the-world-with-livestock-the-allan-savory-approach-examined/\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/163735/myth-regenerative-ranching\n\n\n\nI have more links here: https://www.reddit.com/user/dumnezero/comments/ozqqey/from_cattle_to_capital_how_agriculture_bred/ and https://www.reddit.com/user/dumnezero/comments/q22d0w/why_scientists_believe_meat_has_dire_consequences/ \n\n(see comments on all)\n\nThe evil-stupid binary in this case is formed of evil capitalists and stupid fascists. The /r/carnivore crowd is also contributing to it.\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-nazis-tried-bring-animals-back-extinction-180962739/\n\n\nAnd, yes, the \"red meat to white meat\" transition is a known phenomenon, even in developed countries. On the other hand, the \"beef only\" crowd and industry try to make it look like that luxury is actually ESSENTIAL, as early as possible (they're trying to get parents to feed beef to babies). This also reflects that supremacism culture tied to pastoralist cultures, European and non-European, in which consuming red meat especially from \"grass fed free range\" and, if that fails, from CAFOs, is an essential part of the identity. \n\nDairy distribution is somewhat limited by lactose intolerance and casein allergy. It's true that it's an important aspect, but the Diary sector is the Meat sector. \n\n\n> when reactionaries started screaming that leftists wanted to ban burgers, i knew that it was economics that will make beef prohibitively expensive for working class before anything else. \n\nTo put it simply, the beef eating fascists want more for them, at whatever the costs to everyone else. Raising cows in any system is terrible (which is what the pseudosciences are for), but the very extensive system which they claim \"ideal\" is incompatible with reality. It has to lead to taking lands in order to convert them to pastures. This is obvious with the ongoing Amazon genocide where the ranchers are at the \"frontier\" of converting Amazonians' forests into beef. This is less obvious with the Sudan genocide going on now, as the RSF are part of herder mafias trying to, among other things, clear land (of people) in order [to raise cows to sell to the bourgeois classes](https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/ex-un-official-control-livestock-trade-with-the-gulf-to-halt-sudan-war) in the petrostates of the Middle East, especially the [UAE](https://suna-sd.net/posts/sudan-uae-to-strengthen-cooperation-in-livestock-sector).\n\nIn the literature, this one is called \"the farmer herder conflict\". There's lots to read. Example https://documents.sfcg.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pastoralism_and_Conflict_in_the_Sudano-Sahel_Jul_2020.pdf",

I got out of a lot of vegan (Aussie)groups from 2009- 2015 and now just don't bother with any of them cause it's either an outrage competition that really does seems to make the SJW stereotypes seem based on a reality or it's a different kind of competition to out misanthrope each other by cheering about fatalities upon people fishing, on animal farms , using leather Or fur etc. \nI just find that shit totally emotionally draining, veganism can't be mixed with contempt at least not the way I do it. \n\nLife is hard enough without us trying to understand each other and bring people along to what we feel is the right way by example and explanations rather than vitriol :)",

They even ridiculed it, which was a reason I quit. I don't want to work to help animals, while this organizations pays companies to abuse even more animals. Look, animals have to die regardless! And not just die, but some animals need to be killed and it's either the one cat or a lot of others. And those others will be created especially for the cat, and they will have bad lives.\n\nI tried to talk to my dad about this, but yeah he isn't vegan and he reacted just like you guys are reacting now.",
