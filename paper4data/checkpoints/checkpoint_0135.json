Based on your back of the napkin calculation Miami will be fine, but we don't base global decisions on back of the napkin calculations. The people who do real scientific studies of this stuff say the melting won't be linear, so I'm curious why you do.\n\nAs far as what do do about our energy issues, you seem to have a fatalist view. You don't have an idea for how we would solve it... So we just shouldn't try? You didn't say that exactly, but it sounded like you didn't think it was worth trying.\n\nI do think it's worth trying. I disagree that solar and wind won't cut it - solar energy is a long proven technology and prices have been steadily going down year after year. It is already cost competitive with coal even without subsidies, and is still going down in price. We consume most of our energy during the day, so right off the bat we see that we could cut carbon emissions by more than half if we phase in solar. Meanwhile, it's either Wyoming or Montana that has enough wind to power the country, we just need transmission lines (not 100% ideal because of losses, but it helps). They are already building the country's largest wind farm up there and are building transmission lines to Nevada. Wind can provide a portion of the electricity at night, and the variability of wind is something for the power plant people to handle. They already manage this where it is installed by using data from the turbines themselves to predict weather in the future.\n\nIf every home and business had solar on its roof we'd have more energy than we need during the day. Wind can help provide energy at night and might even provide all we need. I'd assume it won't though, so then yes we'd have nuclear as a baseline energy source. We also still have a lot of hydroelectric power in this country which we would keep for baseline energy, and other renewables such as biomass or tidal energy could further provide energy for us at night.\n\nWe can easily nudge the market away from carbon emission in a technology agnostic way with a carbon tax, which would provide incentives to move towards carbon neutral energy sources. This would not drastically raise energy prices and would in relatively short order move us towards lower cost energy. Once we have a solid install base of solar, energy will be cheap and abundant. Then we use electric cars with a tesla-style rapid charging system (which they have shared the patents for) and we're all golden. \n\nSo... What's the issue?

He pointed out that today's wired soldier carries on average 22 pounds of batteries for all the devices they use, and he showed a camo cloth that was both a solar cell/fabric integration and a storage device.  I would't take Shultz for a fool on any level at all.  Green energy is good for many more things than merely saving the planet... for example, when solar plus battery storage plus electric car charging from this home system are just a little bit cheaper than today, we ALL go into the business of optimizing our wallets by turning each of our homes into a microgrid: When the price is highest, we sell our excess into the grid, and when the price is lowest (only if we need to top off) we buy our shortage from the grid.  And all this is managed by superb softwares on a learning thermostat like that made by Google's recent acquisition Nest, that not only manage your home's energy and water use (including optimizing price on your buys/sells), they will also provide your perimeter security and home entertainment.  Those functions are actually not all that hard, if you think about it your smart phone already has easily that computational power and more... the Internet of Things will optimize your wallet and help our national security, even if you don't believe in global warming.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.25748899176244305,"1.1.1_stance":-0.31519020445486895,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24901113763315438,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25317299160400647,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26986376112016236,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.015997060749214143,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11099168832879514,"ev_1":-0.22649302934986942,"ev_2":-0.20125168443251237,"ev_3":-0.19142127485626736,"ev_4":-0.14228981746748204,"ev_5":-0.3443468010421687,"ev_6":-0.17701176871205637},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

We are HUGE Golf fans, own a GTI and just adore it, so the e-Golf was high on the list. The fact that it is \"just a car that happens to be electric\" was a huge win for us compared to the Leaf or BMW i3's \"I'm wierd, look at me\" styling. Sadly it is only sold in some states though - we had to drive 3 hours to an out-of-state dealer to test-drive it. We generally liked it: it drives like a regular Golf, maybe a little heavier feel/more body roll compared to our GTI, but overall a decent ride. The torque from EVs kind of compensates for the overall slowness, so I think around town it would feel somewhat \"nippy\" to drive as long as you're willing to mash the throttle and recharge daily. The biggest downside was the car feels heavy, but unlike in the Tesla and Mercedes B, the weight is up high enough to work against the car in corners, not with the car. In the end we decided against the car primarily because even with calling all over the area we live in, NONE of the VW dealers would service the car since they were not yet trained on e-Golf. Owning a car and needing to car-transport it to another state for maintenance wasn't on my list of things to do for 2015.\n\nTried out the Leaf, it was OK but had *horrible* frontal impact crash test ratings so we ruled that out. Consumer Reports went so far as to retract their \"Recommended\" status on the Leaf - see [here](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/07/mazda5-and-nissan-leaf-lose-their-consumer-reports-recommendation-iihs-crash-test/index.htm).\n\nIn the end we settled on the [Mercedes Benz B-class](http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/class/class-B/bodystyle-EDV). Like the e-Golf, the B-class is \"just a car that happens to be electric\". It's quicker than the e-Golf (0-60 about 2 seconds faster), more luxuriously appointed, and looks just like a normal car. Also the weight feels better placed, cornering with quite a bit less roll than the e-Golf. The other wonderful thing about the B-class is that unlike VW, I can get it serviced locally even though MB doesn't sell it in my state yet. Amazing, a company whose dealers actually honor the USA-wide warranty that the parent company sells!

I've tracked BMWs and Minis that couldn't handle it stock. The first reply in that thread is a guy who says \"Even my dodge viper SRT 10 needed improvements to handle hard track use.\"\n\nI have SIGNIFICANTLY more experience tracking cars than towing heavy loads, but have enough with to confidently state that tracking and towing are two different beasts.\n\nFact of the matter is the Model S was *not* remotely designed for tracking, nor was it designed for towing. The motor can take it as-is, but the battery cooling needs some beefing up. Take the fundamentals and actually design a vehicle for towing (like the Model X or the skunkworks truck) then Bob's your uncle.\n\n&gt; Again, the battery tech to support use in that role simply doesn't exist.\n\nThe motors can already put out the power without overheating. The batteries can provide the amperage for short periods.\n\nThat already exists today, until the batteries get too hot. The problem is keeping the batteries from overheating. \n\n\"The battery tech to support (that)\" is spending some engineering time on battery cooling, both hardware and software. It's a problem that hasn't been solved before, but it's a problem that could be solved imminently. It's not like an elusive battery chemistry breakthrough is necessary (though such a breakthrough would obviously revolutionize the EV industry as a whole)\n\n&gt; But the Roadster was a pretty good sports car and the Model S is also a pretty darn good GT car, a BEV truck would be a pretty sorry example of a truck.\n\nTo this day there's plenty of people who say the Roadster is a terrible sports car.

Im not trying to say GM single handedly does anything, what I'm saying is they hucked everything and gave up on electric cars until tesla did any work. If tesla didn't do what they did, I seriosly doubt we would be discussing EV checvys today. If it was a safety or technology issue, don't you think they would have developed something better and released it a few years later? There was no profit for them in EVs. EV1 for the majority of models was lead acid but also had NiMH they could have developed further. They didn't have to drive the cost of lithium ion anywhere. \nI think it was a decently good car even by todays standards (price aside) considering it was an 8 second car with 80mph and 90miles of range, a lot of homebrew evs can't hit that. and this was when it came out. as far as breakdowns go, I don't have many anecdotal evidence apart from the roadside assistance was free and good, but I am open to hearing your take and your experience with it. \nAs far as price, Tesla roadster. yes it was half the cost of an ev1 but its still fairly unobtainably pricey   but it also cost a pretty penny to develop. basically what i'm saying is a new technology will cost a lot to really push into the market. Sure tesla has the benefit of laptop  to make it more viable and be cheaper relative to the GM offering, Ev1 had NiMH which aren't bad either. Too bad it was sold off to a gas company.\nAs far as finding a boogyman, if the shoe fits. Sure they are in their right to pull the car from the market and I get not wanting a science experiment on the road. but the ev1 was a concept in '90 and went to market in 96, so i would really call it a science project at that point. \n\nBasically its cool GM is working on EVs again and all, I won't really trust them until I'm more convinced. Its not just the EV1, Ovonics, the government bailouts that make me dislike them but they are big factors. I will say that their market presence is great for Evs right now, it will hopefully encourage other makers to put forward an entry.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20691197248983306,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12135645891469267,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19701298446426474,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28875951390361215,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2395418900499635,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26677083440361077,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04946212486053506,"ev_1":-0.10769301295085683,"ev_2":-0.13162924061771636,"ev_3":-0.1797944208859311,"ev_4":-0.12196026934543625,"ev_5":-0.08589993528827715,"ev_6":-0.14462138955704743},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Whenever logging companies cut down a tree, they are required to plant 2-3 trees in it's place. So if you really want to save trees, the best course of action is to use as much paper as possible.\n\n\n\nTree plantations are not forests. A forest is an ecosystem. Paper bags have to be made out of old-growth timber. Plantation timber is not suitable. (SOURCE: greenbag.com.au) Therefore paperbag use destroys old-growth forest ecosystems, replacing them with essentially monoculture tree plantations.\n\n\n\nPoint 2: \n\n\n\n&gt; There are actually more trees now then there was 100 or 200 years ago. Shortage of trees is not an issue at all.\n\n\n\nAn assertion that seems on the face of it to be obviously wildly untrue, and more so if you have travelled extensively and/or lived a long time. This is an assertion that is screaming out for a source or citation. Here's a couple of sources which illustrate why I find your assertion unlikely. \n\n\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/forest-cover/  \n\n\n\nand \n\n\n\nhttp://www.earth-policy.org/indicators/C56/forests_2012 which states, \"According to data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, deforestation was at its highest rate in the 1990s, when each year the world lost on average 16 million hectares of forest—roughly the size of the state of Michigan. At the same time, forest area expanded in some places, either through planting or natural processes, bringing the global net loss of forest to 8.3 million hectares per year.  In the first decade of this century, the rate of deforestation was slightly lower, but still, a disturbingly high 13 million hectares were destroyed annually. As forest expansion remained stable, the global net forest loss between 2000 and 2010 was 5.2 million hectares per year.  (See data.)\".\n\n\n\n&gt;.\n\n\n\nPoint 3, I don't have an objection. \n\n\n\nPoint 4, I could discuss it but I don't really care, coal or low-quality tissue paper made from recycled materials or plantation timber. \n\n\n\nPoint 5. \n\n\n\n&gt; Electric cars are not any better for the environment. You charge them with electricity that comes from a coal power plant.\n\n\n\nYou might be right, but you might be wrong. You provide no evidence for your assertion. You make no distinction between electric cars which rely solely on the grid, and electric cars which generate some of their own electricity. The superior efficiency of the electric motor over the internal combustion engine at converting stored energy to propulsion is one factor in the equation, but other factors include the relative advantage or disadvantage in environmental terms of fossil fuel pollution vs the pollution from battery manufacture and disposal.\n\n\n\nIt's not as simple as you make out; there is more to the equation than coal vs petrol.\n\n\n\nPoint 6. \n\n\n\n&gt; Every living thing and everything that was ever living is a GMO. We have modified all of our crops in order to receive more yield and to make them easier to harvest. Farm animals have been modified to carry more meat. The GMO label means absolutely nothing.\n\n\n\nWhile I am not against GMO, again your assertion is wrong and betrays a simplistic understanding of the topic, or presents a misleadingly simple assertion. Is there no difference at all between GM and artificial selection? Of course there is. Artificial selection selects for traits already present in a species, whereas genetic engineering creates new traits. Artificial selection selects the offspring with desirable traits and breeds from them and repeats down through many generations, whereas GM can directly manipulate the genome, and insert genes from other organisms.\n\n\n\n\nPoint 7, I have no objection.\n\n\n\nPoint 8. \n\n\n\n&gt; There is no such thing as \"wasting water\"...\n\n\n\nYour point is just a silly semantic argument. You are merely shifting the frame of reference. \n\n\n\nWhen you're walking with your companion in the sandy desert, two baking days in the full sun away from the next water source, and you pour your last remaining supply of drinking water over your head to cool yourself down, try telling your travelling companion, \"There is no such thing as wasting water!

GM limped across the finish line for several reasons.\n\n1) DCFC capabilities is far lower than one would have expected for a game changing long distance BEV. It appears that the first generation Bolt can charge at roughly a 45 kW peak and takes more than 1.5 hours to charge from near zero to less than 90%. Your typical 80% charge for long distance trips will take just over an hour which means 2.5 hours of driving, 1.1 hours of charging. That's not tolerable for many.\n\n2) DCFC network is not built at all for SAE L3 charging, and when it is, the first generation Bolt likely can't charge at those rates and so it can't actually take advantage of it. The existing CCS DCFC network is not set up to handle any real volume of long distance traveling. It is usually expensive and not very reliable. And the most reliable units tend to have asinine limitations like 30 minute charge session timeouts. GM has not taken leadership of the overall charging experience.\n\n3) Anemic 32A J1772 charging. The on-board AC charging should have started at 40A. Now, too many people will go out and buy 32A J1772's. 40-48A is the long term answer with near 100 kWh battery packs.\n\n4) unknown cell degradation - the closest NMC chemistry with the specific energy close to the Bolt's is the Kia Soul EV's battery, and the cell degradation testing at INL AVT is not encouraging at all.\n\n5) low volume production - the cost of bringing a new platform to market is quite high, so GM worked extensively with LG. And yet, the first year's production is likely no more than 30k, and LG's current cell production capacity likely limits the next year's to around 50k. GM has not yet committed enough investment to ensure 100,000's of Bolt's worth of cell production. The fear with low production levels it that the Bolt isn't gross margin positive, or just slightly so, with all sorts of follow on effects. Will GM build much more than they need to satisfy their ZEV credit mandates, or other regulatory compliance measures? Is it really that each Bolt built really helps GM build fossil fuel thirsty SUVs/trucks? Certainly the low initial volumes doesn't help separate the issues and make a clear statement.\n\nAfter the Volt Gen 1's initial and ongoing volume disappointment, GM was likely cautious with the Bolt's initial production volumes. But leaders lead and doing a tepid product with a tepid release isn't really leading. And hence, they limped across the finish line. Yay, they got across the finish line. But it didn't really feel like a big win. The Bolt EV is a landmark, sure, but it isn't really the product that will cross the chasm and bring in the mainstream. It is still an enthusiast/early adopter product, and the first couple of years of low production volumes pretty much guarantees it to be so.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00013731297318978855,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26280595914370036,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2290896080534688,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1766033029804627,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.349073584159972,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19807413745121644,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1666258535551397,"ev_1":-0.15876979066629554,"ev_2":-0.14117135190948224,"ev_3":-0.06454290574765764,"ev_4":-0.1734952029383196,"ev_5":-0.006710170205527295,"ev_6":-0.18138298983681592},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

There are plenty of cars in Europe (where city bans for petrol cars are most likely to kick in soon) that achieve similar MPG to the Prius without all that extra gubbins but even ignoring that, the amount of pollution in cities is so high that even halving the amount of pollution from cars isn't going to make enough of an impact and you have to go full ZEV. That said, I personally think any car in a city is pretty dumb because the infrastructure to support them (parking, roads and so on) is so wasteful of space and time. Better to get people out of cars and into other forms of transport even if it turns out to be taxis, driverless cars, car share schemes or similar if buses, trams and trains aren't good enough.\n\nThe PHEV is a very short term solution anyway as batteries are getting cheaper all the time and the point at which a full BEV is cheaper to make than a PHEV is quickly approaching. The current plug-in prius isn't intended to be a real EV either. It simply had a plug added to allow them into the HOV lanes in California again after the regular Prius was kicked out. A car that can barely do 11 miles on electricity isn't really any help and actually makes things worse because they end up sitting plugged into the scarce chargers that real BEVs could be using. I'm seeing it more and more as I frequently try and find a charging spot only to find one of these PHEVs sitting on it because their range is so limited and they have to plug in all the time to get any advantage out of their electric only mode. If you have to have a PHEV, it should at least be capable of 50 miles (80km) full electric.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00033817543832507607,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2610999035274493,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20611303095174582,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33337918358628915,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13209870047967343,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23519369906621607,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.010357615382721027,"ev_1":-0.23538784637275897,"ev_2":-0.005120696612721076,"ev_3":-0.007366232285373068,"ev_4":-0.003446777923575913,"ev_5":-0.002706095835795471,"ev_6":-0.011969988054867523},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro.

It's also incredibly safe, and hugely expensive. any ICE car could do that, but they don't.\n\nBMW built a really cool frame using carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the i3 and i8, and are now starting to use it in their gas cars, too, staring with the 7-series. It's much lighter, but you don't see chevy or ford even trying.\n\nLighter would help. Aerodynamics would help. Any car, regardless of engine, can cut these corners. But the elevtric will always have an efficiency advantage of the motor itself.\n\nThe disadvantage of EVs has always been batteries. They are heavy (making a lighter and stronger frame necessary), and their energy density is lower than gasoline, so you can't store as much energy in a car.\n\nICE cars could easily be lighter than EVs, with the same frame but no batteries, and they could be equally streamlined, but you're still not going to see 100mpg. \n\nThere are academic competitions to design ultra-efficient gas vehicles. Look them up, see what a lab-built, cutting-edge-everything 1000+mpg car looks like. Not useful in real life.\n\nEdit: this outlines how to get 100mpg.

I just happen to chat about it because it is a fundamental thing, in my mind, driving a career choice. If I am doing something that must be abandoned for the species to move forward then I need to refocus myself. I chose solar power because I want to invest myself for the long game. With that...\n\n[Here is a cool image](http://energyskeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/societys-hierarchy-of-energetic-needs-eroi-12-14.jpg). Basically, the concept is, for us to have enough free time to do these types of things we need to get a lot more out of things than we put into them. For instance, humans evolved from chimps because we were able to cook food, pre-digest it, evolve a smaller jaw and grow a big brain. Then, with all those excess calories available, we were able to build tools - weapons, the wheel, the yoke - and the rest is history. The basic concept is - we need to be HIGHLY profitable with our energy investments in order to do the things that seem fundamental to human species. Arts, research into far away concepts, leisure.\n\nAnd we're not talking $ into energy. Money, while highly representative is not the philosophical ends of this conversation. We are talking **energy** returned on **energy** invested. If it takes one barrel of oil to get a barrel of oil out of the ground, we're gonna have some issues. We'll never be able to refine that oil, let alone use it to power buses or airplanes.\n\nNot all energy is equal and this is why this article was posted. [This image](http://energytransition.de/files/2014/09/eroiranking.png) shows solar way at the bottom and other sources way up higher. The reason I have started paying attention to this subject is because the nuke heads in /r/energy constantly harp that solar power is not a long term viable source of energy, but is a toy for kids. I want to know the truth.\n\nAnd yes, different modules have a different ratio. Thin film use less material, but also less energy - but still a higher ratio. It also depends on where they are installed of course. In Germany the ratio is lower than the US desert because the US desert will produce more energy per module.\n\nSome argue that society cannot get that much more efficient because of basic physics - with that they argue we need to be as energy dense as possible. Others argue that things like graphene and room temperature super conducting might move us closer to capturing all lost energy, and a holy grail of near perfectly efficient.\n\n\nIt truly is a straight up philosophical discussion at this stage...but one that matters to me since I am trying to choose a career (eight years in now) that lets me sleep well.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.22048898113315282,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26863079302590026,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.28011537931801117,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21476693640105493,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3413694537580608,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23479681879218198,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18001795716312094,"solar_1":-0.17264449676358026,"solar_2":-0.16673863493879934,"solar_3":-0.09840091250939527,"solar_4":-0.040595981340492714,"solar_5":-0.08334813566346795,"solar_6":-0.18440838640162838,"solar_7":-0.029835287969035562,"solar_8":-0.08107041308176122,"solar_9":-0.02710782882135021,"solar_10":-0.1403106774192161},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

So if the 440kwh is delivered from the utility and the 74kwh is received by the utility (as you have noted), then the utility is charging you for their received electricity vs. crediting you.\n\nThe compensation rate you are entitled to is likely RETAIL at ~$0.15/kwh and not their STANDARD OFFER rate. @ $0.077/kwh. The only way they shoud be compensating you at the standard offer rate is if they are not subject to RI's net metering law. For example, Block Island Power Company and Pascoag Utility District might be able to exempt themselves is they are at 3% solar saturation during peak. But even in that case, you would be entitled to the standard offer rate.\n\nI've seen your issue before, when the customer has not notified the utility that you in fact have interconnected the PV array. You might need to notify them even if you have pulled the permit and signed an interconnection agreement, because they need to change your account within their software to subtract that excess rather than add it.\n\nWell that sounds silly doesn't it? Why would they ever need to ADD electricity delivered to them vs SUBTRACT it? Well, their default policy is a pretty good safety policy to prevent people from hooking up any kind of interconnected generator to their grid without their knowledge. It's not a policy that helps you in your particular case, but it is good overarching policy.\n\nNow, I suspect that neither you nor your installer followed the project all the way through to notify the utility to switch over your account to a net metered account. But if you did, then you certainly deserve your due compensation. If 0kwh was the starting point for your reverse meter, than it looks like you have delivered 7237 kwh to their grid x $~0.15/kwh =~ $1080.   If you did not, than you still might be entitled to 7237 x $0.077/kwh = $560, but the utility might also have a counter-argument about you not following their obtuse procedure.\n\nRegardless, the next step is to call your power provider, get in touch with their distributed generation department, explain that you are being charged for your backfed energy rather than credited, and make sure your account is corrected. Find out what the exact error was, and then consider asking for compensation at that point. While they might tell you that you waited too long to identify the problem, just keep in mind that if I don't pay my power bill for 4 years because my utility company made a mistake, I still owe that money. So it's not unreasonable to expect the same courtesy in return.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-6.18653333125015e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09393419503571607,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1982143826743661,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19281953719275274,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2313782253354475,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16715286037607985,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21953982316578427,"solar_1":-0.2003499520135827,"solar_2":-0.05461997229091745,"solar_3":-0.011301496915014772,"solar_4":-0.15040755322060023,"solar_5":-0.0009630983283083575,"solar_6":-0.03525077177619096,"solar_7":-0.022268991723346215,"solar_8":-0.014398750538627306,"solar_9":-0.15629720929729712,"solar_10":-0.20485530753504103},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

If you want the 24/7 reliability of the grid then expect to pay something for it.  Take a green solar home owner who magically produces just as much power and he uses each month.  So at the end of the month they pay zero for the electricity.    Now for about half the time they were selling power to the grid and half the time they were buying power from the grid.  Because of the way net metering works the grid gets nothing.   Net metering is in effect a wealth transfer from those who can't afford a roof with solar panels to those who can.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to change money from Dollars to Euros one has to pay a small fee.   You can see what that fee is by looking at the difference between the rate depending on whether on is buying or selling.  Stocks have the same principal only it's called the bid spread or the bid price versus the ask price.  The bid spread for electricity is fairly high because there are a lot of fixed charges that get added to the price per kWh.  ($0.0354 wholesale to $0.1132 retail)  Those fixed charges pay for transmission lines, line repairmen, ...  Most utilities are regulated monopolies so they have to get permission for the rates they charge from a state government commission(profits are limited to 6-7%).\n\nI can think of another commodity that can be bought and sold on the same day with out any transaction charge.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005518171431807181,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3425114766388791,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18766925729006678,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12264397740364075,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23875152586327072,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15408317263548574,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.011771437821153086,"solar_1":-0.02180936327689172,"solar_2":-0.008176288079994265,"solar_3":-0.011718903287449697,"solar_4":-0.015719852947465068,"solar_5":-0.003513542436849093,"solar_6":-0.00296762431995982,"solar_7":-0.002285946172681482,"solar_8":-0.016466329370814492,"solar_9":-0.02915735913362975,"solar_10":-0.03287057705165353,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.03726507703904645},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against\n\n(Note: The author's stance is against net metering and solar in this context, even though they express some appreciation for the concept of solar energy.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Both charge the same battery bank.\n\nIn this particular spot, i've gathered cumulative data for the last 2 years on the output of both.  Turns out, the Solar has output about 5-6x the total watt-hours of the wind generator.\n\nBoth cost around the same amount of money to install (about 5 years ago).\n\nWhat isnt captured is that they contribute power to the battery bank largely at different times.  (and the solar panels have a slight advantage in that the way the wind generators charger works, it will idle the wind generator if the battery voltage is above a certain point). so even if its windy mid-day the wind generator will be idled (whereas at night and in the mornings the wind generator generally charges unrestricted)\n\nAlso the wind generator charges a lot more in the winter (which is windier) than in the summer, since this location is high latitude and gets almost 11 hours of sunlight in summer but only 3-4 hours in winter.  (batteries are usually fully charged by 10 or 11 am June-&gt;September)\n\nSo moral of the story: it depends on your location.  If you live in a location where you can get wind power at times you *cant* get solar power, then a wind generator is a great backup to solar, but thats the way i think about it: use wind to compensate for low solar times because solar is generally significantly cheaper for a given output.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.010434378792221347,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12424356819008088,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19180349308849798,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3424163690424205,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2213185207856165,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1728978096901964,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05418519196852382,"solar_1":-0.1166229049537472,"solar_2":-0.26864891717497535,"solar_3":-0.0838307783013745,"solar_4":-0.04982622116028779,"solar_5":-0.21629395633462928,"solar_6":-0.023036819552847494,"solar_7":-0.050849923694234654,"solar_8":-0.09581806230926304,"solar_9":-0.21862158537863327,"solar_10":-0.15960433332205906},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Each solar module is a grouping of several solar cells.\n\nPanasonic, which had more than 300 people working at the factory by the end of last year, said most of the new hires will be for production workers for its solar cell manufacturing operations.\n\n\"We will have some machine technician positions and a few engineers in there as well,\" said Terry VanEpps, Panasonic's talent acquisition manager in Buffalo.\n\nTo find workers for its growing operations, Panasonic is holding a career fair from 5 to 8 p.m. on June 13 in the Buffalo Niagara Convention Center.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThe job fair, which follows similar sessions that drew long lines of applicants this summer and dozens more candidates in December, will include a company presentation and interviews during sessions that will begin every 30 minutes, starting at 5:30 p.m.\n\nPanasonic, which has openings listed for eight types of jobs on its website, said it is seeking production and manufacturing operators for its solar cell and solar panel production lines, along with electrical and mechanical technicians and process engineers.\n\nCandidates can register for the job fair and upload a resume in advance.\n\nThe Panasonic job fair follows a series of information sessions that Tesla held last month as it starts making its solar roofing panels at the Buffalo factory. The solar roof, which looks like a conventional roof but has solar cells inside, is expected to be Tesla's main product at its portion of the RiverBend factory, which was built and equipped by the state with $750 million in taxpayer money as the centerpiece project of the Buffalo Billion.\n\nWhile Tesla said it has started making its solar roof in Buffalo, it has not provided any details on how many have been produced. The company, in a letter to shareholders earlier this month, said it expects production of its new solar roofing panels at its Buffalo gigafactory to “accelerate significantly” during the second half of the year.\n\nThe company views the solar roof as a key product that will help increase its solar installations and open the door to a new group of potential customers.\n\nTesla previously has said total employment at the Buffalo factory now exceeds 500 people, but most of that is from Panasonic.\n\nThe ramp of the solar roof comes as Tesla’s solar energy installations dropped to their lowest level in more than four years during the first quarter. It installed 76 megawatts of solar energy generating capacity – a little more than half of the 150 megawatts of generating capacity it installed during the first quarter of last year.\n\nTesla said the decline, which has been going on ever since the company acquired SolarCity in November 2016, is part of a “strategic decision” to move away from door-to-door sales, de-emphasize less profitable commercial solar projects and put more of a focus on cash sales to consumers, rather than the no-money-down leasing models that SolarCity used.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006101965632600089,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2201675921678543,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2777447318979765,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.03371335007250309,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15057001620001448,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2888551951068423,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.027073971888360877,"solar_1":-0.026844719536408473,"solar_2":-0.16259122198937995,"solar_3":-0.007408580962267782,"solar_4":-0.004655760658958267,"solar_5":-0.0022577800858319583,"solar_6":-0.010342837369535118,"solar_7":-0.001438429605817267,"solar_8":-0.0007153365380266526,"solar_9":-0.006608287073807635,"solar_10":-0.008321752599537527},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It's best to have solar panels on a roof facing south to have the best performance. Otherwise, the side of the roof that gets most light from 9am to 3pm. \n2. I did the research myself at the beginning but it was too time consuming. Then bumped into this website that got me 4 quotes: [https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/solar-energy/solar-panels](https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/solar-energy/solar-panels). I ended up selecting one of the quotes they proposed.\n3. The Feed In Tariff scheme in the UK amounts to an average of £400 a year for an average 3kW solar panel, so you can save around £570 a year if you are eligible for that. It lasts for 20 years and it's tax free.\n4. I would not recommend doing it yourself. Solar panels are something that can yield you a high benefit if well installed, but if you don't have specific knowledge in the field you can easily do a mistake.

On the fiscal side, tax breaks and a HELOC should come into planning thoughts. A HELOC is a 2nd mortgage BUT the interest is tax-deductible. So instead of taking a loan out with the installer or using your cash consider if you have the means to take a HELOC its a loan against yourself with a multi-year tax deduction. Install Fed tax break is 26% I believe now and check to see if your state has any that useful.

And yes, there plans HAVE changed since October. That’s why I’ve spent so much time looking into all this. I started the process in November. Back then, net metering and buy back worked (as I was told) on a debit/credit system where each kWh I used was a debit and each one I generated was a credit. Each month I’d pay the base fee and at the end of the year the debits and credits would be resolved. If I had more debits, I’d owe a final bill. If I had more credits, I’d get a check, which I planned on putting toward my loan to pay it off faster. We designed my whole system around this concept. Based on historical usage, the system would have me covered every month except July-September, but since months like April would generate so much excess, I’d be covered. \n\nFor numerous reasons, my system was t ready to turn in until the end of March. By then, the plans had changed to what I previously described. So now, in months like April, they get my extra power for free, and in months like August, I’ll actually owe a bill. \n\nI’m not crazy about giving power away for free, so I’m building a crypto mining rig to mine Vertcoin with my excess power. Since crypto mining’s profitability is usually limited by the cost of power, I’ll be able to turn my extra power generation into Vertcoin, which I can then turn into dollars. I’ll have to turn it off a few months of the year, but for the rest I’ll be making money instead of giving the electric company free power. \n\nAlso, I’m not sure where you are, but in East Texas, the power is delivered by Oncor, so that might also be a contributing factor. We have Centerpoint here too, but it’s for gas.

The more people who get solar in my area, the higher electric rates get.  We just experienced a 195% increase in the cost of our electric supply (yes, nearly triple!).  I'm glad to have the solar. My solar panels provide me all the solar I need in summers and help to stabilize my winter rate (due to net metering, I have to pay the difference between the summer and winter rate, this winter 25.5¢ per kwh that I make in summer and use in winter).  The cost I paid per kwh for the panels is frozen over the 25 warranted years, about 13.9¢ per kwh for the production.  This summer, my rate was 26¢, so I save half.  In a few years, that summer rate could easily be 40¢, so my panels would have only cost me a third for the production of energy as buying for the grid.  In 25 years, its an even greater savings.  Personally, I wouldn't have leased or PPA'd because I want that fixed cost, not really a rider that keeps increasing the electricity cost.\n\nIn addition, I doubt future grid stability.  My state has passed the \"only evs in 2035\" law, and has heavy rebates on switching from oil and gas heating to heat pumps.  At the same time, they are opposing new electric production plants.  I can add things in my head, lol, more electricity use while opposing electric plants means we may be headed for shortages.  So, I have two tesla batteries to accompany my 15kw pv system.  I've been off-grid for 3 days now for fun, using electric heat, electric dryer, dishwasher, microwave, my 4' florescent lights in the basement (they were installed for a TV room in the 70s, not for what you are thinking, lol!).  Even charged my PHEV car and my electric lawnmower.  And we had two days of clouds, and I'm still running strong off-grid with my batteries.  So, long answer to say, personal energy security in addition to savings is why I got solar.  Honestly, grid security was really more important.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3016480532840706,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22368916910577816,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.202151584305666,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20401070974529745,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23846891071125326,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3553953931320343,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3232510594096992,"solar_1":-0.2877158844057261,"solar_2":-0.12770020273928703,"solar_3":-0.22228304717129455,"solar_4":-0.3111033724046992,"solar_5":-0.06581989500601605,"solar_6":-0.03510496162683315,"solar_7":-0.058416810667646736,"solar_8":-0.029379114874410993,"solar_9":-0.1788253870200409,"solar_10":-0.2834652891751331},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

PA also recognizes SREC's and I used current SREC rates $0.04/kWh. I used an Excel spreadsheet to calculate key financial measures. I estimate breakeven at 9 years, IRR of 11%, a NPV of $66K and an estimated cost of solar production of $0.057/kWh.

A few of the newer solar systems can power you in a grid down situation.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0024626803739617267,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1271474140478844,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.25240671047876734,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26722675127287704,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2864890523970768,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18550631897474545,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06049116737752532,"solar_1":-0.017860441827603307,"solar_2":-0.0014236254889207582,"solar_3":-0.00100340199120789,"solar_4":-0.03195919577289411,"solar_5":-0.0008875188796082512,"solar_6":-0.0008138538881515464,"solar_7":-0.0014264270260658425,"solar_8":-0.0004474422797405471,"solar_9":-0.18924068914687572,"solar_10":-0.009736446663737297},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

This kind of lease should be explained by both a solar accountant and a solar lawyer. Why? Because it is impossible for a layman to understand both the accounting terms and the legal terms on this lease. However, the solar leasing company allow ordinary salesmen mostly from a solar installer company to sale them to unsuspected consumers. After spending so much time with the accountants and lawyers I finally figured out the \"SCHEME\" of this kind of lease. This lease is designed so that it does not matter if you the consumer want to quit the lease usually after 5 year (when they breakeven), they will be making the same exact profit from you at the end of the \"25th YEAR\". So, what the writing on the lease is saying is basically, \"WE WILL TAKE THE SAME $15,000 FROM YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO STAY WITH US AFTER THE 5TH YEAR\".  In other words, by you signing the lease you agree for them to rob you of your hard earned money in case you end the lease before the 25th year. In this country, as long you agree to be rob, then it is all legal. So you cannot to be sued. Both the judicial and legislative bodies of this country should implement some laws to prevent this kind of consumer fraud practices. \n\nHowever, there is also a way for you to gamble and maybe they will cut you a good deal.\n\nAfter they break-even at the 5th year mark, you default on the lease. Don't worry about all the things they said about suing you and bring your credit score down. Why? It is because it does not make sense for them to do all that from a business standpoint. First, they already break-even, meaning they already recoup all the incomes to pay for all the expenses. Even thought they are not making a profit yet.  So after 5 years, the net income on their balance sheet is finally no longer a negative for this lease. In the eyes of their shareholders, this is a major milestone for them. Therefore, they would not risk this just for bringing you out to court. It is because it could cost them up to $100,000 to sue you in court, and they might not win. So, if you default at this point, they will first try to cut a deal with you. Most likely they will give you a discount buyout. Instead of making you pay the full buyout price they will probably give it to you for half price. With this deal at least they don't have to put a negative $100,000 layer fees onto their net income.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0009571056580170989,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1853931708898912,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2411932237705966,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24701783177949954,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2499681731234637,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.194656065655492,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2594047091648869,"solar_1":-0.18249156565789346,"solar_2":-0.05592636234966145,"solar_3":-0.12187793444334882,"solar_4":-0.26156105208109376,"solar_5":-0.002794657313643256,"solar_6":-0.09766465764550958,"solar_7":-0.11309497450565686,"solar_8":-0.05365130578483895,"solar_9":-0.04160122440784875,"solar_10":-0.24241343956180827},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

If not, you are without any power until the sun rises again.\n\nI think what your installer is referring to is that a powerwall can only back up a limited number of circuits.\n\nYou would usually need multiple powerwalls installed to back up most or all of your home's circuits.\n\nThe backed up circuits are usually isolated from the main panel in a separate subpanel.\n\nMine, for example, will power the refrigerator, the air handlers in my HVAC system (but not the a/c compressors), the electric oven, and some lights and some electric plugs  throughout the house. The subpanel also contains breakers for the Tesla inverter and Powerwalls.\n\nIt is my understanding that you can discuss with your powerwall's installer what circuits you want to backup with it.\n\nThe previous owner of my home was a quadriplegic with some serious medical issues who needed to have medical devices powered at all times, so my subpanel arrangement reflects her backup priorities.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008916843507904559,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1937882567327298,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1517622359061302,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.29554558245299956,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2943745598136047,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24855667154146452,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12730795600994801,"solar_1":-0.12735895252020177,"solar_2":-0.14678534847310706,"solar_3":-0.015188070597408418,"solar_4":-0.02488257980318546,"solar_5":-0.0033988199757004622,"solar_6":-0.004587607564947878,"solar_7":-0.012538147823458226,"solar_8":-0.016927432217926253,"solar_9":-0.03308397653728434,"solar_10":-0.27574497409861465},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

If you eat fish, you are not a vegetarian, period, end of story. &lt;/rant&gt;\n\nSome of the information is patently false. The levels of murcury in tuna and calcium in salmon are not what are concerning for cats. Mercury is found in high levels in most kinds of fish, but the real concern with tuna and salmon is the high level of ash. It can cause the pH level in their urine to become more basic than acidic, which can lead to problems like FLUTD and stones.\n\nB-12 *can* be vegan. All B-12, even that found in animal products, comes from micro-organisms which can easily be used to fortify vegan-friendly foods. As for taurine, it can easily be synthesized and has been for nearly the past 80 years. In fact, most meat and animal products have added synthetic taurine in order to meet nutritional requirements. A lot of taurine is removed in the rendering processes utilized by slaughterhouses, so even commercial non-vegan cat food will probably include some of the synthetic variety.\n\nWhat it boils down to, in the end, is that this article was not written by a veterinarian. As someone who has worked in the field of veterinary medicine for 10 years, I can say that I would hesitate to trust anyone writing an article on animal health who had no apparent background in the subject. I, myself, am not a vet (I'm a veterinary technician), but I can say that I have seen healthy vegan cats in the practices I've worked for. That being said, though, there are definitely cats out there who would *not* do well on a vegan diet, and anyone considering changing their pets over to a meatless food should first consult with a veterinarian to decide whether or not it is right for that animal in particular. I would suggest finding one that is more open-minded to holistic pet care and alternative diets, however, since some conventional veterinarians can be biased against the vegan lifestyle in the same way that conventional human doctors sometimes are.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.18480022063157156,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2519514730164246,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2668330436239926,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26568508273075786,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11357917767596035,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23563228598335434,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1931987790994707,"diet_1":-0.0961912971318668,"diet_2":-0.38415288683609106,"diet_3":-0.11507205769436268,"diet_4":-0.06843346964302426,"diet_5":-0.06173312904310219,"diet_6":-0.03570167733119195,"diet_8":-0.10603856043811295,"diet_9":-0.01640701725167067,"diet_10":-0.1862827119572709,"diet_11":-0.10545702744154066,"diet_13":-0.053298262297175825,"diet_14":-0.2641079974564491,"diet_17":-0.025082001423773665},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Stick with it. You're doing the best thing, so just carry on with it. It's the best thing for the environment, &amp; the agricultural animals too, &amp; possibly your health. You can drive a car &amp; still be vegan, if driving becomes necessary. There is no point at which eating non-vegan food will be necessary unless maybe you're in some kind of emergency situation... driving on the other hand can be necessary in everyday situations, but if you can do without, hey, that's good. \n\nSo, I guess that's an ok analogy with the European trip &amp; meat. I'll put it this way: imagine some people raised a retarded person, who has child-like intelligence, like this person is as smart as a 4 year old kid (&amp; that's about how smart an adult pig is by the way.) Then they kill him for the meat. They butcher him &amp; cook the meat. Imagine smelling that, when you know full well what is going on. You may have that superficial feeling like, \"Ok, I can see the attraction\" but you're not going to be like oh I can hardly hold myself back... I mean, most people wouldn't have trouble holding themselves back anyway. That's exactly how I feel about being around animal foods; it's ethically repugnant, not superficially repugnant. Cooked human flesh is probably delicious, but the fact of the abuse is going to make me say no, &amp; the same goes for cow, pig, chicken, or fish flesh. \n\nThanks for what you're doing, &amp; again, please stick with it.

No one would think of animals as something to consume, either as food, clothing or decoration if you need to harm them.\n\n\nSince almost everyone in the world today is cool with using animals, I think a vegan makes a stronger point by not using any animal products. Bivalves don't have a CNS? Don't eat 'em, it muddies the point for most people. Shed antlers are natural and don't harm the animal? Don't display them as it echoes trophy hunters and implies support.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23935797934730849,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16586482142029582,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15372407794824644,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28646302648156446,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22943539151940837,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18302371939384246,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.015643983458479244,"diet_1":-0.0004084918631027297,"diet_2":-0.004485495948756579,"diet_3":-0.0007680472093246257,"diet_4":-0.001090811047712729,"diet_5":-0.0020002677313944637,"diet_6":-0.00104231827329689,"diet_8":-0.00029761570719225955,"diet_9":-0.00018790745768152797,"diet_10":-0.0004179107466673789,"diet_11":-0.0005436081664811354,"diet_13":-0.0017522814450785518,"diet_14":-0.012200922409344154,"diet_17":-0.0004406373445817735},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (implies opposition to using animal products for decoration while supporting the concept of veganism)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

But then, what causes plaques?  It is still strongly related to excess fat (and calories) in diet, among other factors, because plaque formation is caused by hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia (particularly, high levels of LDL).  Hyperlipidemia is not caused strictly by diet alone, but diets high in saturated and trans fats contribute to it, and many animal products (red meat, chicken skin, full fat dairy products, etc.) are significant sources of saturated fats.  So butter is not the thing that literally directly ends up in arteries, but it can still contribute to hyperlipidemia, plaque formation, and cause heart attacks or strokes.  Essentially, the video is making a difference without a distinction.  \n\nIf a person wanted to eat a healthy plant-based diet, there are vegan sources of these harmful fats as well (such as the saturated fat in palm oil, or the trans fats in fried food and many cheap highly processed junk foods).

I was talking more about evolutionary passing and like frequencies in the next generation based on extra addition under the assumption that all other variables stay the same; because the person that takes part in activism does it regardless of children; so that's a constant factor. But, if the concept of not reproducing because it was not vegan was passed on, even through activism, it would eventually be selected against because it would either cause ultimate extinction or only those who won't listen to the activism will reproduce until the only new ones left are strictly unwilling to listen to that activism.

If there is good tasting plant based food, then it would already be regularly eaten by people with no dietary restriction (like fries). With a restricted diet, the tastiest food you can eat is from what you allow yourself to eat rather than the tastiest food in general.\n\nNot liking any fruit or veg is really weird though and that should concern you since it means that you're very low on fiber. Not being used to fiber will make you feel terrible for a few days when switching to a high fiber diet until your body adapts.\n\nMy advice is to avoid advice about what tastes good and what doesn't and to just experiment with food yourself. There are very different tastes out there and also vegans who outright lie about how food tastes just to make veganism more attractive. You'll get used to it and start discovering food that, while not as good as you're used to, will still be good enough to make you happy.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012506482501824696,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13028947158491064,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19217801335162127,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19369592512767825,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.29715423181708256,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26760740020821017,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2019427613898491,"diet_1":-0.08106883137710004,"diet_2":-0.0006726333219072936,"diet_3":-0.002673999564043091,"diet_4":-0.010457094652034963,"diet_5":-0.0017572458297460496,"diet_6":-0.014468197647753792,"diet_8":-0.0008879615803986477,"diet_9":-0.03948844943079166,"diet_10":-0.004981601231217307,"diet_11":-0.0023464786190743325,"diet_13":-0.0032290160543198,"diet_14":-0.047521312512496174,"diet_17":-0.0006918170362647894},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I think that a good general guideline is that all animal products are based on animal exploitation. Lacto-ovo vegetarians may think that eating eggs and dairy is not animal exploitation, especially if they are labeled as free-range/organic/etc. I believe it is just a slippery slope.

I prefer not to have eggs in my food, but I also think that we should be supporting companies that are switching to vegan products, even if they have traces of eggs. \n\nWhat kind of animal products you think are not animal exploitation besides products with possible cross-contamination?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005354469176381826,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20900793386313177,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21294436147598342,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2788767258094064,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.425356759706804,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06875074026992915,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.044375498024843786,"diet_1":-0.1681111473542103,"diet_2":-0.2453547283706333,"diet_3":-0.1266310020026348,"diet_4":-0.029083763069744844,"diet_5":-0.008839010336184097,"diet_6":-0.03573434774565006,"diet_8":-0.0069168208653233405,"diet_9":-0.006085505709052086,"diet_10":-0.02169631825139125,"diet_11":-0.010765133202464009,"diet_13":-0.002676394593436271,"diet_14":-0.13665079475322273,"diet_17":-0.006787330354806424},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.
