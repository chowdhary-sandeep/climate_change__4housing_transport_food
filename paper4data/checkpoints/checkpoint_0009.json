But GM's Andy Card had been fighting Electric cars for years, and GM's true intention became apparent when on Oct. 10, 2000, GM agreed to sell their control of the EV batteries to Texaco. Less than a week later, on Oct. 16, 2000, only days after Texaco acquired control of the batteries, Chevron agreed to purchase Texaco in a $100 billion merger. Chevron announced the merger even though the GM sale of the batteries to what would become Chevron did not close until July 17, 2000. Perhaps Chevron wanted this sale to be announced prior to the merger so it would not look like Chevron (formerly Standard Oil of California) worked directly with GM.\n\n\n\nGM and Chevron collaborated with Toyota-Panasonic in such a way that these batteries were killed, and no such NiMH batteries are available for EVs. Chevron, awash in oil profits, assets and cash reserves, claims that \"it's a chicken and egg problem\" of \"no demand\", but that does not explain why they sued Panasonic, extracting $30,000,000. Shortly thereafter, the EV-95 line of proven, NiMH batteries still running in the RAV4-EV was shut down and killed, and the batteries cannot be sold or imported into the USA, according to one Toyota spokesperson. Only a few used EV-95, salvaged from crushed vehicles, are available, and those only for warranty replacement on existing RAV4-EV. Toyota won't sell even these used batteries to EV converters, who need long-lasting, reliable batteries and can't get them. \n\n\n[Take it how you want.](http://www.ev1.org/chevron.htm)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00015311839767188454,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06480660662055016,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21183259763929446,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04070218776663145,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10056873349083831,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.006481749005615711,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0026883683943500123,"ev_1":-0.011772959061393825,"ev_2":-0.009987766291790953,"ev_3":-0.0035864054904474565,"ev_4":-0.0019437765125379276,"ev_5":-0.001118590999491668,"ev_6":-0.17004153096154961,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.047169730821769916},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The next problem is of course getting approval for having the circuit run to your spot, and finding out how much it will cost. There have been some laws discussed and/or passed recently that disallow HOAs or complex owners from stopping you from installing a charging station, but the cost might be steep.\n\nI would get a few quotes from electricians before you do anything else. Just tell them you want to run a 50 amp circuit to your parking spot. The actual installation of the charging station is a snap once you have the circuit installed, so you don't even need to bother mentioning that. It could be that your electrical service can't handle 50 amps, so you could get by with a 40 amp or 30 amp circuit if need be - that'll just limit your options when it comes time to pick a charging station and cause charges to take a bit longer, but that's no big deal.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-9.22217247231553e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12279681034009915,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1898313929376289,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.08682854908208053,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26974386722438864,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.16843212664948568,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.16857664688723162,"ev_1":-0.007083047546378414,"ev_2":-0.10956781792143981,"ev_3":-0.004881599423242733,"ev_4":-0.006478196844303359,"ev_5":-0.0003843449958367273,"ev_6":-0.01131876077367148},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

But the idea is to improve upon the status quo. There are lots of scenarios other than your typical weekend or week-long getaway where it'd be much preferable to have your own car, and especially to have an electric car over a gas one.\n\nFirst off, assume the destination is somewhere with charging available, so clearly as a trip becomes longer it becomes more and more preferable to have your own car. It would also make the trailer option much cheaper if it could be rented and returned for one-way trips rather than kept for the whole trip.\n\nOther non-vacation scenarios where such a thing would be great would be things like going away to college, or going between summer/winter homes, etc.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and as far as the i3, of course you're right that it's a silly example of EVs to picture with the trailer, as it has an available on-board generator. That generator is just an option, however; I've no idea what proportion of i3 buyers opted (or will opt) for it.

But it WILL be low enough for mass adoption once the Gigafactory comes online.\n\nSomebody else also pointed out that the difficulty of installing home charging in some areas is a barrier, which I agree with.\n\nThere's also a ton of small things that could help increase adoption: better cooling systems for AC motors, lighter cooling and safety systems for batteries, more high-speed public charging stations, etc.\n\nBut honestly I don't think any of those things are holding back electric cars. I think expensive batteries are. In fact, I think that's the ONLY thing holding back electric cars right now.\n\nEverything is going to change in 2017. As soon as the big car companies see how well the Model 3 sells, they're all going to start construction on their own battery factories. We're going to see a massive shift in the auto industry.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.005471155978739262,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15034597782008718,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.178644048098602,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2421336441856458,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11269068008925244,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14221800971003717,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11011866445278695,"ev_1":-0.1310269202490682,"ev_2":-0.1191418620264848,"ev_3":-0.10705191758688021,"ev_4":-0.1791595678252751,"ev_5":-0.0036037071270887586,"ev_6":-0.1876818290346171},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (due to high battery costs)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

That's 20 weekday charge events at home, 20 weekday charge events at work, and 10 weekend charge events at home.\n\nIt also delivers most of the performance of the Panamera 4S for close to the price of the Panamera 4, after the US tax credit.

So the Galaxy had a *bigger* screen, a *better* camera, etc. It’s not surprising that new EVs receive the same scrutiny. After all, Jaguar and Audi are going *directly* after Tesla customers, setting up tents in front of Tesla stores and sending direct mailers comparing the I pace to the Model X.

Now if consumers accept literal egg- or pod-shaped vehicles, especially SUVs and pickups, then we can get a lot more efficient. In fact, we could have gotten 90 mpg cars 30 years ago if people were OK with weird egg shaped cars --> https://www.aerocivic.com/\n\nBut that's unlikely to happen. \n\nRolling resistance is affected by vehicle weight, and coefficient of rolling resistance (Crr) . Some tires are designed to have less Crr, about 30% less than normal tires, but they have less grip in the winter. Vehicle weight linearly affects RR. So theoretically, an EV SUV with ultra-lightweight batteries and ultra-low Crr tires can be up to 2x more efficient in terms of rolling resistance.\n\nNevertheless, this matters less than you think. The reason is that most of the efficiency loss at highway speed (which is where efficiency matters the most) is due to aero loss rather than RR loss. There are also some pretty hard techno--economic limits to how much lighter we can make our cars, and even harder limits to how much we can reduce Crr. \n\nPowertrain efficiencies for already EVs are close to 90%. Even if you somehow built a physics-defying powertrain with 100% efficiency, it won't be a massive improvement. \n\nI would say, if we improved on all the above things by a good extent, we can build EVs that are about 20%-30% more efficient than now. The biggest leaps could be in aero (by building egg cars) and reducing vehicle weight (mainly by reducing battery weight and replacing steel bodies with aluminium/carbon-fiber). SUVs and pickups are where the biggest leaps could be made, whereas you can't wring much more out of something like a Tesla or BYD sedan.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.011189753344903389,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24485433712138657,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1832262947173146,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2552140788045815,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2623592246836429,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2649595414034332,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.202501744799353,"ev_1":-0.20415353158870325,"ev_2":-0.2013481257793804,"ev_3":null,"ev_4":-0.09860411267194043,"ev_5":-0.2688718821470199,"ev_6":-0.16400489982633615},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I make about $50k CAD after taxes if that's relevant, which is around $4000/mo.

I've previously worked in a consulting role for a major international engineering consultancy which advised developers of large scale systems (50MW+, or approx 200,000 panels).  From my experience I can say that solar panels are most definitely NOT all the same.  Below is essentially how we approached assessing PV panels on behalf of banks and insurance firms - the guys who don't care about marketing and only want to know the facts about the products.\n\nThis became a lot longer than I initially expected, so here's a TL;DR.  Feel free to ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Generally, you will want to aim for return on investment, not necessarily the highest efficiency or performance.\n* Efficiency isn't a great indicator of quality or performance - look for real-world performance testing with public results.\n* How do you know your manufacturer will be here in 25 years to honour the warranty or handle any widespread product issues?  Look for financial backing from companies not completely exposed to the volatilities of the PV industry.\n* What do the warranties actually include?  And more importantly, what do they **exclude**?\n* Look for independent testing programs like VDE Quality Tested and ATLAS 25+ - these require ongoing random repeat testing of mass produced panels, unlike the IEC certifications.  Just because a product complies with IEC does not make it a good product.\n\n**&lt;/TL;DR&gt;**\n\n\nWhat do you actually want when you're purchasing a system?  Generally, it is a return on your investment - you want the system to pay itself off as quickly as possible, and then generate as much positive revenue as possible past the payback point.  So how do you achieve that?  Is high efficiency the best path to take?  And what about these 25-year warranties?\n\nLike others have said, if you have limited roof space AND a high daily energy demand, then high efficiency panels (like Sunpower, LG, or the monocrystalline products from other manufacturers) may be the way to go.  If you have plenty of roof space, or lower energy demand, the higher price of a Sunpower or LG product will generally not repay itself.  So where to next?\n\nThere are a few overarching considerations - the **manufacturer** and their warranty, the **product** - design, quality control, and the proven performance.  \n\n\n**The Warranty and the Manufacturer**\n\nThese two seem to go hand-in-hand.  25 years is a very long time for something to be guaranteed.  Will the company be around in 25 years' time to service your warranty claim?  And what if it's a widespread problem requiring a recall - will the company have the financial strength to be able to handle that?  The solar PV manufacturing industry is a volatile place - companies have been established, ridden to the top of the wave and crashed within a roughly 10 year period.  Interestingly enough, two of these companies have now been taken over by much larger parent companies, and are now considered to be the financially strongest manufacturers in the industry - Hanwha Q CELLS and Suntech. They sit alongside LG as the only PV module manufacturers (so far as I'm aware - happy to be corrected) to have a level of business diversification that insulates and protects them from the volatility of the PV industry.\n\nThen, what are the actual terms of the warranty?  With your solar panels, you actually get TWO very separate warranties - the Product Warranty (typically 10 years) and the Performance Warranty (typically 25 years).  Some warranties are better than others.  Most warranties don't provide the installation costs for a warranty replacement.  Some exclude installations near the coast or on farms (where ammonia can be present).  Most of them don't guarantee the marketing claims they make (I'm looking at you, Potential Induced Degradation).  So it's important to consider these terms carefully.\n\n\n**The Product**\n\nEfficiency is NOT the be all and end all.  In fact, it's a pretty horrible guide for comparing panels.  The efficiency is based on very precise, laboratory-based conditions, called Standard Testing Conditions, or STC.  These conditions are so precise (1000W/m2, cell temperature of 25 degrees, with the sunlight passing through 1.5 times the thickness of the atmosphere - called AM1.5) that they are rarely actually met in real conditions.  I can't speak for the rest of the world, but analysis we've done of long-term hourly weather data recordings has shown us that these conditions are met for 3-4% of daylight hours in Sydney, Australia.  The California Energy Commission's PTC (Pacific Test Conditions) have the same limitations as STC.\n\nA far better guide is ongoing outdoor performance testing.  This is done publicly by Photon Laboratories, which operates a large outdoor test field in Germany and publishes the results annually.  Then there is also [Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre!](www.dkasolarcentre.com.au) in Alice Springs, where you can view the live data online.  Just don't forget to select \"Normalised Data\" so you're comparing apples to apples.\n\nThen there are all the certifications, manufacturing processes, quality controls.  I'll be honest, a lot of the IEC certifications are meaningless unless they're being supported by randomised testing of mass produced products.  The certifications can legitimately be achieved using laboratory made prototype panels - this has to be noted on the certificate, but let's be honest, who has actually looked at one of the certificates?  Just because a product complies with IEC does not make it a good product.  So the best way to be confident that the panels match the certifications is to look for manufacturers using independent quality assurance programs like VDE Quality Tested, ATLAS 25+ and other similar schemes.\n\nAsk whether the manufacturer makes its own cells - you'd be surprised how many simply assemble the individual components into the panel.  And ask whether they have a significant R&amp;D capability - if not, how can you know whether they're at the forefront of the industry's capabilities?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.02111928939120844,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2230473156074941,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19271757152878663,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.03522594226524234,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.25687775455558687,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21680588959972827,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13365305540274453,"solar_1":-0.19893730658883946,"solar_2":-0.3011767650257268,"solar_3":-0.33949776126246434,"solar_4":-0.19456673375690564,"solar_5":-0.05009500665498005,"solar_6":-0.20437269675889672,"solar_7":-0.047764310341638826,"solar_8":-0.04058604628759591,"solar_9":-0.08452919069410807,"solar_10":-0.21517438573452333},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Probably, though how much of the warming since ~1900 is due to mankind is still not known. Why is 1.5°C necessarily a bad thing? Fossil fuel extraction constraints will very like keep us from going much beyond 2°C, even if policy is very lax.\n\n2. The more warming that is attributable to agriculture, the less can be blamed on fossil fuels. If cattle are a larger cause of warming, efforts to reduce fossil fuel use will necessarily be less effective.\n\n3. Forecasts are all over the place. Such a claim would have a very low level of scientific understanding (LOSU) given how primitive models are.\n\n4. Not an effect of climate change. \n\n5. Fossil fuels are cheaper and produce power on demand. When alternatives are cheaper and produce power on demand, people will stop using fossil fuels. Note that the cost of fossil fuel extraction grows with time. The lowest hanging fruit are \"harvested\" first, then more and more marginal resources. The more marginal the resource, the more costly to extract. But there are also no clean sources of energy, renewables or otherwise. The byproducts of making solar panels in China are sickening (literally and figuratively). Wind turbines are pure expressions of fossil fuels. Nuclear power, as much as I love it, has radioactive waste to deal with.\n\n6. So? Should all of humanity live in energy poverty, or should we seek to lift the poor out of energy poverty by providing clean power at affordable prices in the future?\n\n7. Great argument against cutting down forests in the southern U.S. to burn as biofuel in Europe. But again, clearing forests for agriculture as a contributor to climate change suggests that less blame can be laid on fossil fuels.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00011963276726116116,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09252290697158827,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16005891375243664,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.31199390441179276,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31404890730943863,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24985125410057474,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.20925444985429445,"solar_1":-0.08766311244646503,"solar_2":-0.10373992984134538,"solar_3":-0.060792351540537005,"solar_4":-0.0823979476402504,"solar_5":-0.02249727486438739,"solar_6":-0.006726645791786723,"solar_7":-0.08091337325216348,"solar_8":-0.020208837999841005,"solar_9":-0.03149599756604715,"solar_10":-0.19401450903509007},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (the author refers to 'people' and 'they' throughout the text, not a specific personal reference group)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

One of my two bosses is vegan. &gt;60% of our costumers are vegan (we did a poll on this, but I don't remember the exact number). None of them know what they are talking about. All they do is repeat whatever they read on (vegan) Facebook groups, what they heard on (vegan) get togethers, where (vegan) self-proclaimed dietary experts (which isn't a protected title in my country) tell them what they want to hear. They only listen to what supports their narrative. As soon as a scientist tells them that they can't use an argument because it isn't scientifically sound, he's been \"bought out by the meat industry\". They are no better than the anti-vegan circle jerk. Half the people that visit our farm think eating meat is unnatural, ffs.  \n\nI agree that eating meat every day is unnecessary. I agree that we should treat animals with more respect. But here is an unpopular opinion for you, and this will prove the point I made in my first post: we have a right to keep animals for meat, just because we can.

One is that you can add on if you underbuy, but if you overbuy then things are a bit different.\n\nYou can do things to increase your efficiency to maybe squeeze the difference between production and utilization.\n\nSome years are better than others.  For example this summer was pretty good for me, while last summer there were an awful lot of days that got rainy and cloudy in the afternoon during my peak production time.\n\nBut most importantly, what are the current net metering laws, and what happens if they change?  The laws in my state are that if I over-produce past usage then it gets banked, if that lasts for more than a year then I get paid cash at wholesale, not retail.  Because if this, the payback period is absolutely terrible if I over-produce.\n\nMy usage regular pricing is tiered where it gets more expensive per kWh after I go past more than 1000 kWh in a month.  Any production goes directly against the most expensive power first, but from there it chews into the cheaper power.  And of course after that it goes to the wholesale rate.\n\nSo it gets down to first asking what you can do about efficiency (conservation is cheaper than production), and then what are your payback periods at various assumed production levels.\n\nPersonally, mine was sized at about 90%.  It leaves some room with conservation as a goal, plus hey maybe a little shading from the panels will help the A/C.  Meanwhile that leaves me so they I'm pretty sure I'm not going to over-produce as doing so is a fairly lousy investment given my rate situation.\n\nNow, if my retail rate was paid regardless of how much I produce then I'd put solar on my cat and everything else.  Even then that's risky because laws can easily change and quickly stretch your planned payback period far far out into the future.\n\ntldr; unless you have a Tesla 3 on preorder, don't over-produce.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00025838054716587067,"1.1.1_stance":-0.189460715035323,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.151047237246597,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.33225657684118914,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.0747801208379392,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1323828429515609,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10871032965224003,"solar_1":-0.28338489929835003,"solar_2":-0.007164669380775497,"solar_3":-0.06813305235603669,"solar_4":-0.13129974177525128,"solar_5":-0.20870320002237955,"solar_6":-0.002541845167191544,"solar_7":-0.005048970708836957,"solar_8":-0.0026234973605217724,"solar_9":-0.15770411168707454,"solar_10":-0.11930086308469375},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Batteries are expensive compared to solar panels so if you put up a larger solar array and have less batteries and then run any heavy loads possible during the day. For instance I went with a 86gallon water pressure tank so that I can run my water pump when the sun is up and unless several people have showers the pump shouldn't have to run overnight at all.\nOther load shifting things can be easier such as laundry, dishwasher etc if you have, most of them have timers built in already for people who are on grid that load shift to the night when power is cheaper, you can run them mid afternoon when the solar panels have the batteries mostly full but are still putting out lots of power.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.22892887892158761,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16437581702133944,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.25276965973799664,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.31235447351647416,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23630786246021193,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23753963568057374,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2807976542972028,"solar_1":-0.27532520750139056,"solar_2":-0.16882423209798011,"solar_3":-0.036266619831925105,"solar_4":-0.21834274113886445,"solar_5":-0.26213310016949737,"solar_6":-0.0048718982240340365,"solar_7":-0.09489591679933558,"solar_8":-0.041080591067535956,"solar_9":-0.03932037854815462,"solar_10":-0.12047820576952499},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

You sound like you have a pretty low opinion of the inspectors and code requirements.\n\nYou also seem to have an insanely optimistic opinion of winter production numbers.  I have 2850W of panel hung for my main office array.  On a cloudy winter day, I don't get 1000W out of it.  I don't get 500W out of it.  I get 50-200W, peak, and a bad winter day will get me about 300-500Wh, all day long.  I can't heat a small office on the solar output from my array in the winter (I burn propane), and you're planning to heat a house on it?  I know San Diego is sunny, but it's not *that* sunny.\n\nAnd with your DIY PowerWall of junk batteries, I'm out.  Good luck.  Try not to burn down your parents house, because I'm almost certain insurance won't pay for it if it's caused by something like that.\n\nI try to avoid building dangerous junk, and used lithium cells of unknown history, globbed together, qualify (as far as I'm concerned).  I rebuild lithium packs professionally, and I don't use scrap cells, because I don't know the history on them - and the tests I've seen in common use don't tell you if they've taken damage either.  They'll just let go one day if they've been badly stressed, and a lithium pack runaway is not something I want anywhere near me, my structures, or my family.\n\nHave you included the costs for mounting the panels?  And I still don't think you're going to get away without code inspections for a roof mount system, one way or another.  Even if it's off grid.\n\nI have no clue who you are, so I can't say I've looked at your patents, but what you describe building here is not something I would recommend putting on someone else's house.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004587225664484625,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3817031532526016,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15936798668778984,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.316276164577275,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3313595882897045,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.022749033523723483,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08269370417110622,"solar_1":-0.01024473579794479,"solar_2":-0.015442230503443474,"solar_3":-0.03808204897116715,"solar_4":-0.01350321219676213,"solar_5":-0.002760858027613722,"solar_6":-0.27814262388514416,"solar_7":-0.0009028890344779938,"solar_8":-0.002056007518452437,"solar_9":-0.02792149477560694,"solar_10":-0.13110315054655075,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.020954996485670563},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I don't think we'll see any movement on SMART until the energy storage issues are fully dealt with. Expect 2+ months after the energy storage docket is dealt with before smart hits the ground. \n\nThe original purpose of the energy storage docket actually had no relation at all to the current \"PV + Storage\" discussions. The main issue was based around the fact that the utilities own the capacity rights to net metered projects for the purposed of bidding their capacity in the ISO-NE forward capacity market (FCM) in order to offset the costs of net metering. Neither NGRID or Eversource bothered to bid any capacity but still wanted to retain the capacity rights, preventing project owners from monetizing this potential revenue from their existing projects. \n\nThe main issues with the energy storage portion, as it stands today, relate to the capacity rights of solar projects when they are paired with energy storage projects. The utilities original interpretation was that when the PV is paired with storage, because of the language of the existing net metering laws, that they would be able to claim capacity rights for both the PV and the storage. The agreement at this point seems to be that the utilities will retain the rights to capacity, but that project owners will be able to buy the capacity rights from the utility. \n\nThe reason that this relates to the Smart docket is because the language (and DOERs original intent) in the smart program, describes the \"storage adder\" as an additional revenue to offset some of the costs of energy storage, and assumes that developers will be monetizing the capacity in other ways to offset the remaining costs.

I think this is a fantastic area to research!\n\nFirst I would take a look at some of your assumptions. Solar is actually extremely cost effective with only nuclear and offshore wind being cheaper per kWh but running into distribution issues because no one wants a nuclear plant in their town and offshore wind is a long way from AZ. \n\nNow for the land use issue. Combining solar with existing commercial/industrial buildings, homes, and parking lots can generate power locally without restricting land use. Also I’m not familiar with how much farming is done in AZ but agrivoltaics is becoming a popular way for farmers to make money selling power and plant crops that require partial shade under the panels. \n\nFinally, where your thesis comes in. Look at the duck curve problem of solar power generation. There is a huge spike during the day when solar panels are producing. But what happens at night, when it’s cloudy, dusty, or when the days are shorter in the winter?\n\nBatteries are great and they can charge during those peak times of cheap and abundant power and then power the grid from dusk to dawn. You should also look at kinetic storage, biofuel storage, and compressed air storage that allow for long term (seasonal) storage to power up during the summer and keep things running during the short winter days. \n\nAlso as an aside, look into EV charging and how adding or enabling bidirectional charging could completely change the utility industry. Most Tesla’s are driving around with 75-100 kWh batteries that could power a home for nearly a week! They will soon be able to charge and discharge power into the grid while also getting you around town!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.07851290454467137,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2964643854259553,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22940324471613224,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3460305170390046,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.04014301073812021,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2679745263484272,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3874183063550542,"solar_1":-0.21235186744715986,"solar_2":-0.17872430094374853,"solar_3":-0.09700859075531475,"solar_4":-0.04864932000629431,"solar_5":-0.11809421338969112,"solar_6":-0.009634486552386079,"solar_7":-0.08042424857558217,"solar_8":-0.09536381543875905,"solar_9":-0.02284798122289544,"solar_10":-0.22963427365043504},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (in regards to batteries and other storage solutions) mentioned in the text.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I didnt see too much tile over skip in the bay area mostly down in San Diego/LA when I worked for a nationwide solar installer. Whether you opt for getting the whole house sheathed or just the areas under the solar will be up to you but it is definitely necessary at the arrays. Without getting on your roof I cant judge whether or not your tiles will work for a solar install.

That assumes you don’t take into consideration the fact that solar panels and wind turbines are incredibly environmentally destructive in their manufacturing and don’t create as much energy as they take to build in the first place. The whole idea of sustainable green energy is a sham. Politicians are using this ruse to stick it to the fossil fuel energy industry and to the most vulnerable among us.\n\nRenewable energy isn’t as reliable as traditional fossil fuel energy. Additionally, there isn’t enough solar power farms and wind farms to give energy to all humans in North America. In 2018 solar and wind contributed just 7% of the world’s electricity. Compared to building out enough solar and wind farms to supply electricity to the world, fossil fuels are incredibly inexpensive. Energy prices would rise astronomically if we only had wind or solar and the poor among us would have difficulty accessing this energy. Since solar and wind produce such a small percentage of global electricity, the rest is made up of fossil fuels such as coal, diesel, natural gas, and nuclear energy.\n\n\nSo even if we do build electric cars and we do build charging stations, those electric cars will still run-on fossil fuels indirectly. What will be the purpose of this again? How does this save the environment? It’s just using gasoline with extra steps, which anytime you make a process more complex it becomes more fragile. \n\n[Electric Car: A Rube Goldberg Machine, Named After American Cartoonist Rube Goldberg — A Chain Reaction-type Machine or Contraption Intentionally Designed to Perform a Simple Task in an Indirect and Overly Complicated Way](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/sbttsi/electric_car_a_rube_goldberg_machine_named_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nThe transportation sector is the lifeblood of this country. We shouldn’t do anything that would make it more fragile.

Look at your usage of kWh of electricity from your utility bills for the past year. If you want to cover 100% or close to it get a system large enough to cover your usage. See what your rates are and if you have net metering. You can figure all this out on your own so that your not dependent on a solar sales person to tell you whether it’s worth it or not. Personally I’d buy/own a system and finance it or even better pay cash. If you don’t like sales tactics then avoid the lease or PPAs.\n\nAs long as your not getting ripped off like more than $4.00/watt then owning a solar system does make sense in many parts of the US. Know that a lot of people are posting quotes at under $3.00/watt. Depends on your market, but clearly a red flag of over $4.00/watt. E.g. 5000 watt (5.0 kw) system at $20,000 = $4.00/watt. Sunny and high rates it makes more sense. If you live somewhere where the utility rates are very low and low hours of sun production then it may not pay off.\n\nBest to contact the companies you’ve looked up and researched yourself. Personally I’d skip all of the door to door salesman. I decided I wanted my equipment to be Enphase Micro-inverters so I just went to Enphase website and looked up installers and researched their company and checked Yelp and Google and few others and then contacted the ones I wanted for a quote. Enphase also list whether the installer is a Platinum, Gold, etc installer.

I love it-we need more people like you. \n\nI think the two other responses here show what is wrong with it. The message isn't really clear. Someone who isn't familiar with standard factory farming practices would probably not understand your point from this and just be confused instead of absorbing your message. So you need a clearer text that directly relates to your message, that is still catchy and an image that reinforces the message. \n\nYou have to work with both the frame of reference and basic understandings of your audience to provoke discussion in a constructive manner. For example, maybe a still of a worker throwing five of these cute chicks into what is unmistakably a trash can (or a giant blender)-not this linen/cotton thing here- would give your audience a clearer depiction of the absolutely brutal and barbaric industry practices you are taking a stand against (which I assume is your message). \n\nI really respect that you chose not to use a gory image-increasing the chances of both vegans and non-vegans absorbing this message, but its very important to clarify the message with text and pictures that directly communicate what you are trying to say in a way that most people will not misunderstand.\n\nVery best wishes and I hope you go on to do more work like this.

In today's society a smart phone or some kind of technology is essential and it's very difficult and expensive to have a wardrobe entirely made of fairtrade clothing. Being a vegan is easy and requires hardly any sacrifice but avoiding other things is so difficult that it's impractical. Just because we can't avoid all suffering from our consumption doesn't mean we shouldn't try to reduce it.\n\nYou've just stated the obvious, but that doesn't justify continuing to use animals.

Here are the recipes used\n\n\nGreen Bean Casserole\nAdapted using ideas from both recipes below. I believe the slight difference is one calls for veggie broth which added great flavor. Otherwise both did inspire what I put together. This is what I ended up with: \n\n* 1 pound green beans (rinsed, trimmed and cut in half)\nTopping \n* 1 1/2 cups crispy fried onions (I had found some Denmark imported brand) \n\n\nSOUP: estimated. I may have increased the milk to 2 cups. \n* 3 Tbsp olive oil\n* 1/2 onion (minced)\n* 1 lb chopped mushrooms\n* 1 cup vegetable broth \n* 1  1/2 cup soy milk\n* 1/2 cup Chickpea/Garbanzo Flour (add more or less depending on desired thickness) \n* 1 container Tofutti Better than Sour Cream \n* Salt and Pepper to taste\n\nStarted by chopping the onion and slicing/dicing mushroom to my liking for the casserole. Sautéd in olive oil until cooked, about 5-7 minutes. Added veggie broth and simmered for another 5 minutes before adding in the soy milk. Picked up the chickpea flour from Kroger (bobs red mill) and first time using. It’s a must for this soup! Liked this way better than flour or corn starch. Gave perfect thickness to the mix. Started whisking this in as I increased the temperature to a medium high and watched it turn into a nice soup. Then I added the sour cream for extra creaminess and flavor :) \n\nPrepped the fresh green beans by cutting them up and steaming the until they were tender. \n\nCombined with soup, 1/2 cup of the fried onions and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes. 30 minutes in oven, 10 minutes adding the rest of the crispy on top. \n\nMy soup surprisingly came out a beautiful cream color instead of brown so I was happy with it. The taste exceeded my expectations. I have to make again to have by itself. \n\nrecipe links: \n\nhttps://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-green-bean-casserole/\n\nhttps://thekitchengirl.com/i-cant-believe-its-vegan-cream-of-mushroom-soup/\n\n\nMac and Cheese:\n\nI bought 3/4 lb “raw” cashews. Soaked in water overnight in the fridge. You want enough water to be able to blend nicely. Basically completely cover the cashews, and then a few inches on top. Next day blended with 1-2 tablespoons of turmeric (for color) and salt and pepper. I used my ninja to get this to a creamy texture. Poured this mixture into a large pot, turned the heat to medium low. Added 1 1/2 cups grated cheese. Got everything melted together. This was a mild cheddar from a local store. 1 block white and 1 sharp cheddar. Basically add how much you like! I stirred in 1 lb al dente elbows and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Blended cashews are perfect for Mac because it gives it the thick, rich cream sauce. \n\nCandies Yams: I used Dandies (in place of marshmallows which contain gelatin) \n\n6 large yams- peeled\n1/3 cup vegan butter\n1 cup brown sugar\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract \n1 teaspoon allspice \n\nBaked at 350, took about 60 minutes to get these soft. Added dandies on top after cooking. \n\n\n\nCorn Pudding: \nMine set great. I was a little worried it’d be soupy but it firmed up after extra cook time and after it cooled out of the oven. Recipe here: https://thesouthernvegan.wordpress.com/recipes/corn-pudding/\n\nI added about 4 tablespoons Ener-G egg replacer, dry. (Instead of mixing with water like usual) \n\nMini Cheesecake\n\nI used Tofutti cream cheese. \nMix together 2 8 oz packages with 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 2 tablespoons vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons (dry) Ener-G egg replacer.\nBaked at 350 for 20 minutes and set overnight in the fridge. \n\nPumpkin Pie:\n\n1 can pumpkin purée \n3/4 cup coconut milk (can and full fat/ shaken) \n3/4 cup brown sugar \n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1 teaspoon allspice\n\nBaked at 350 for 55 minutes. \n\n\nThe roast used was the TOFURKY brand and after checking the ingredients, DOES contain tofu!

I dont really know who to talk to about this, so im just gonna drop it here. Im a relatively new vegan of 6 months, but so far I have had a terrible time in this community. \n\nEvery group has the positive members, its negative members, its blunt members, its hard-line members. Welcome to life. I am a blunt person myself so if you are the more positive kind, things I say may come across as negative. Perspective. First all, good to hear you're vegan. Second, sorry you feel you've been given a hard time and I'm wording the apology that way because I haven't heard the other side of the story and I suspect there might be some truth in the other side that is hurting your feelings such that you might possess some denial. I'm reserve judgement for now. \n\n>I feel like I am constantly being looked down upon by long-time vegans, seemingly because I am new? \n\nI doubt that it's specifically because your new and more likely because at 6 months, they might have higher expectations of where they think you should be at by now. Yes that is unfair of them to do so and get upset at you for not living up to their imposed expectations, but it is possible their views aren't with merit due to their experience. It is easier now more than ever to be vegan and it's only getting easier as time goes on, so perhaps there are a few things you are unaware of that you probably should be. You do have to understand you have accountability and responsibility for yourself and your actions as much as they do. \n\n> encountered so many people who claim moral high ground over me, \n\nOK. Did you not think there might be a reason why and bother to investigate a such to disprove or confirm those claims? Even as a 4yr vegan, I find myself still learning and having to admit when I'm wrong. Less so now than when I was 6 months vegan but it still happens and even in other forms of activism for human rights where I am less informed. \n\n>and also over people who arent vegan/plant based and it really confuses me. \n\nWell yeah, in regard to animal rights, a person who chooses to cause unnecessary suffering to animals isn't as morally good as the person who chooses not to cause the same unnecessary suffering. If I kicked puppies and you didn't, would you be morally superior to me in regard to dog rights? And by virtue of the slippery slope, if I'm willing to kick puppies, what other immoralities am I capable of? Am I racist too? Do I beat up my partner if they disobey me? What are you confused about? \n\n>I dont understand how its helpful to spread so much negativity when it comes to a lifestyle choice. \n\nWell, do you know for a fact your are living as ethically as you can be within your current knowledge base and striving to learn more so that you can improve further? (Like the difference between a vegan who doesn't know about chimpanzee harvested coconuts and one who does). \n\n>I think the hardest part for me is that im still learning so much, and I keep being accused of \"not being vegan\" by some bigger vegan influencers on tiktok. \n\nThen let me congratulate you on your open mindedness and willingness to learn. It's a rare trait these days and even rarer still that such engagement is backed by genuine effort and improvement goals. \n\n2nd it's tiktok honey. Of course there's going to be ego, agenda and showboating for their followers. They're not always there to help those that need it. Some are there for the debate me bro activism, some are there for recipes, some are there for social validation. My form of activism/ online presence isn't particularly common or helpful to you either. My tactics aren't to convince our convert people, it's to thoroughly engage with someone and rip their entire position to shreds for all their fellow like minded people to see the flaws in their own reasoning, the misinformation they've been force fed,  the misuse of factual information and how irrelevant it is in the grand scheme of things. \n\nAs you said, you've still got a lot to learn. \n\n>I honestly have no idea why, because I agree with them and their words and beliefs, but I disagreed with their habit of fear-mongering and shaming when it came to spreading veganism, so they accused me of not being vegan?? \n\nWell what are you telling them that garners such a response?\n\n>I chose to follow a plant based diet 6 months ago\n\nOnly a plant based diet? If so, that might be why you're getting criticised. Veganism isn't a diet. We fight for all exploited animals and their rights. \n\n>but i have always held the beliefs and values, and ive tried my whole life to measure up to animal and natural preservation. \n\nWell you can take pride in that you were more ethically developed than me before I went vegan. I was unaware/ didn't care about any of that prior to changing. \n\n>I just feel so lost and lonely, and I keep feeling like im some sort of imposter, and its so disheartening. \n\nThen let's do some reflection and analysis. \n\n>I am just looking for a community more sane than the one on tiktok, so if anyone has any advice, id really love to hear it.\n\nHere might not be much better. Opinions here are just as diverse. I recently had an argument with someone who believed we should exclude a clause of the vegan philosophy in favour of ableistic and classist exclusion. You'll find a (disappointing) amount of vegans here who are pro pets despite that being an unnecessary form of exploitation and cruelty and against the core ideal of veganism. There's even disparity on potentially intersectional philosophies like anti natalism. \n\nFor now my advice to you is developing a deeper understanding of veganism and then expanding on your knowledge base surrounding that understanding. I would suggest a visit to r/debateavegan to see what I mean.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2607528062395027,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06809693548329818,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26310963033162776,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.028405163747568924,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.33510805672946076,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.08042695993844855,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.08392133144661784,"diet_1":-0.013617620456576182,"diet_2":-0.030854644253831037,"diet_3":-0.03431457275108111,"diet_4":-0.003087945076304758,"diet_5":-0.0018055792340116266,"diet_6":-0.003109681635881619,"diet_8":-0.0009311213974190954,"diet_9":-0.0011092160566477105,"diet_10":-0.002272019301007807,"diet_11":-0.008803324642938056,"diet_13":-0.0026834002540733573,"diet_14":-0.013853714646150669,"diet_17":-0.0015889151472923875},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Among other offerings, we offered various store-bought vegan cheeses on relatively cheap crackers - a typical cheese-eating experience. \n\nMost people (overwhelmingly non-vegan) found at least one cheese that they liked, and often I would hear comments such as “surprisingly good” and “I would buy this,,” and “try this” to their friend or partner. And trust me, they had no qualms expressing their dislike or ambivalence, etc. if they didn’t like it.\n\nSo in my tests, the generally non-vegan public gave the cheese a much better rating  than the OP writer. Granted, it takes more than “this isn’t bad” to induce a sea change in the public’s eating habits. Other foods (e.g., Field Roast sausage) got about 99% good ratings, but have barely made a dent in non-vegans’ shopping carts.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23082418366993807,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10578919555389206,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2319503302794219,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21163239046183654,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16804164838047003,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20985469268140658,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2458161461787919,"diet_1":-0.03358673934417311,"diet_2":-0.0404615797281925,"diet_3":-0.18586464692028434,"diet_4":-0.18889268822236188,"diet_5":-0.011798010413864782,"diet_6":-0.036442421123259315,"diet_8":-0.009338685522986149,"diet_9":-0.18791227405275482,"diet_10":-0.25508117374556605,"diet_11":-0.10924805166238609,"diet_13":-0.14240248971347114,"diet_14":-0.09290867960003071,"diet_17":-0.0075352610704915906},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present (the text describes the behavior of the non-vegan public towards the vegan cheeses)","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

Not just the binary genders.\n\nMRA movement actively leans neoconservative. So think \"traditional family values or traditional religious values\" a dog whistle for power over others. Men's rights Activists will also fall in common and identify with people like Tate. Which we know to be awful and hurt and a sexual abuser.\n\nNeoconservatives and Mens rights Activists will reiterate commentary like, \"Men should be the top of the house/wives live to serve men.\" Which is not true. No one loves to serve anyone, a common truth in veganism. And ideology like this leaves out and actively dismissed the existence of non nuclear families, people of color, queer people, the climate, obviously animals, poor people, disabled people etc\n\nThe continuation of feminism has included people \"in the margin.\" (Crenshaw)\n\nTW sexual abuse \nWhen feminist say \"stop rape culture\" they don't insinuate to continue to rape men just because they didnt say it in a chant. It's a terrible thing that happens. 1 in 4 women report rape. A small percentage of men report rape. There is A LOT of socialization that young boys experience to prevent the reports. Fear of being made vulnerable (which is toxic masculinity perpeting that vulnerable is bad), embarrassed that it happened (people under the impression of toxic masculinity saying that men can't be raped because they are stronger etc ignoring that men can rape men), or that they wouldn't be supported by other men. This last example happened to a family member of mine when he was a teen, because he saw media of people shaming the women in the Brock Turner case. And we see the fear of shame with every gender.\nAs a final note on that feminism acknowledges the sexual abuse of not only gay men survivors but also trans men. (MRAs dont believe transmen are men. So how can they advocate for men's rights, but not all men.)\n\nTW END\n\n\nThe mentality of \"well they didn't say boys/men's so clearly they want that to happen\" is used by men's rights activists to create a separation and to create a mistrust in feminist based movements. Feminist frequently advocate against food deserts by trying to raise awareness, build community gardens, and do grassroots movements and orgs to bring more vegetables to disenfranchised communities. (Not just the women in these communities). \n\nI hope to believe that most people in this subreddit don't subscribe to the ideology of MRA and can instead research and read feminist literature and movements. As feminism genuinely works to uplift people that are again, left behind. I can promise you, if a media outlet like Fox News says an equal rights movement is bad, it's probably not. A few people at the top have a lot more to lose than many people at the bottom.\n\nIve extensive research on different aspects of feminist study for university. But am not an expert on every individual movement. But MRA much like All Lives Matter was never about inclusion but the ostracization of equity movements.\n\n\nLast comment... Animals don't have a concept of gender in the same way we do. Gender, as society generally conceptualize, is a socialization based on concepts of expectations and roles :)\nCows are both good boys, good girls, and good beans.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2577984956909859,"1.1.1_stance":-0.266900523465087,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1982611786519317,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13159977489461502,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22430422933121277,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.30276232438820483,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10846512434848894,"diet_1":-0.037001011095000536,"diet_2":-0.10067339272548755,"diet_3":-0.08078929582285733,"diet_4":-0.05052079910066283,"diet_5":-0.08188570479008679,"diet_6":-0.0911079046818486,"diet_8":-0.026703300357136566,"diet_9":-0.0466430558153661,"diet_10":-0.22305561993077086,"diet_11":-0.13225748010881944,"diet_13":-0.03078657031437615,"diet_14":-0.22368228405806198,"diet_17":-0.09322578538800978},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
