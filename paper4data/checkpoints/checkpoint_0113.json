The design is based on the [2006 Honda FCX Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_FCX#2006_FCX_concept). The FCX Clarity demonstrates electric car qualities such as zero emissions while offering 5 minute refueling times and long range in a full function large sedan. It first went on sale as a 2008 model year vehicle.\n\n&gt;Since the vehicle's unveiling in November 2007, there were nearly 80,000 people around the world who expressed interest, according to Honda.  Production was reported to begin in June 2008.  The first five customers of the [fuel cell vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle) were announced on June 19, 2008, and delivery of the first vehicle in the United States around July. It was introduced in Japan in November 2008. One of the first FCX Clarity customers was a return customer of a first-generation [Honda FCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_FCX) who has leased that vehicle since 2005. According to Honda, he previously was the first retail customer of a hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicle in the world.  Current lessees may be offered a renewal when the current leases expire, though the renewal period is not yet decided. \n\n&gt;There were reports that previous generation fuel-cell cars from Honda cost more than $1 million to build in 2005. Some estimated that Honda had cut its production costs to between $120,000 and $140,000 per vehicle. \n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Honda ^FCX ^Clarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_FCX_Clarity) ^| [^Honda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda) ^| [^Honda ^FCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_FCX) ^| [^Hydrogen ^vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle) ^| [^Fuel ^cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+chlb02o) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+chlb02o)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002969011499468858,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25770512242579,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.022536009841047644,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.01235720639427503,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11352144367992878,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21253045449938313,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.007032169072772376,"ev_1":-0.25349371065976367,"ev_2":-0.12641987472920813,"ev_3":-0.001249143382665352,"ev_4":-0.00020279504193846756,"ev_5":-0.0006264274846519887,"ev_6":-0.0006296230058069341},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed (The text is primarily informational and does not express a clear stance for or against EVs)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.

For example, if you live in CA, you could claim the $7,500 federal income tax credit, and the $2,500 rebate the state offers (if it is still available) with the purchase of a qualifying EV. Here is the Nissan website for finding incentives (every manufacturer has a similar page):\n\nhttp://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/ev-incentives\n\nThe Leaf S starts at about $30,000, so even with just the federal incentive, it would be in your price range. I don't own a Leaf, so I can't say how quickly the range drops, but it has an \"EPA average\" range of 84 miles. That's enough for your commute when new, but as the battery capacity drops, it will start to get tight. if you had a way to charge in the middle of your trip (even 110v), it would be helpful. \n\nAnother option is to get an EV with an ICE built-in for charging, like the Chevy Volt. Actually I believe the Volt's ICE can also be used for drive train power in addition to charging the battery.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.001081608885821576,"1.1.1_stance":-0.47074175360445614,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2234038900792559,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.30529900653709774,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3363823016292315,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3029352238497989,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21928215835941955,"ev_1":-0.1912440337856649,"ev_2":-0.11316550589004146,"ev_3":-0.1906921002446848,"ev_4":-0.2261535442806969,"ev_5":-0.009378854951743657,"ev_6":-0.16578655814131102},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (mentions EVs multiple times and provides information on incentives and alternatives, but also acknowledges range anxiety and suggests hybrid as an alternative)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Leaders of the project, code-named Titan , have been given permission to triple the 600-person team, the people familiar with the matter said.\n&gt;\n&gt;Apple has hired experts in driverless cars, but the people familiar with Apple’s plans said the Cupertino, Calif., company doesn’t currently plan to make its first electric vehicle fully autonomous. That capability is part of the product’s long-term plans, the people familiar with the matter said.\n&gt;\n&gt;Apple’s commitment is a sign that the company sees an opportunity to become a player in the automotive industry by applying expertise that it has honed in developing iPhones—in areas such as batteries, sensors and hardware-software integration—to the next generation of cars.\n&gt;\n&gt;There are many unanswered questions about Apple’s automotive foray. It isn’t clear whether Apple has a manufacturing partner to become the car equivalent of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that builds most iPhones and is known by the trade name Foxconn. Most major auto makers build and run their own factories, but that hasn’t been Apple’s strategy with iPhones or iPads. Contract manufacturing in the auto industry usually is limited to a few niche models.\n&gt;\n&gt;The 2019 target is ambitious. Building a car is a complex endeavor, even more so for a company without any experience. Once Apple completes its designs and prototypes, a vehicle would still need to undergo a litany of tests before it could clear regulatory hurdles.\n&gt;\n&gt;In Apple’s parlance, a “ship date” doesn’t necessarily mean the date that customers receive a new product; it can also mean the date that engineers sign off on the product’s main features.\n&gt;\n&gt;It isn’t uncommon for a project of this size and complexity to miss ship-date deadlines. People familiar with the project said there is skepticism within the team that the 2019 target is achievable.\n&gt;\n&gt;The global market for electric cars has been weak because of low gas prices and concerns about vehicle price and battery range. To date, Tesla Motors Inc. and Nissan Motor Co. sell two of the best-known and highest-volume battery-powered vehicles, but volumes are only a sliver of the industry’s 85 million annual vehicle sales.\n&gt;\n&gt;Emissions standards are tightening around the world, however, leading most major car companies to invest billions of dollars in plans to launch electric cars between now and the end of the decade. By the time an Apple car would make its debut, brands spanning General Motors Co.’s Chevrolet to Volkswagen AG’s Audi and Porsche will have long-range electric vehicles aimed at the mass market.\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had several hundred people investigating an electric vehicle with an initial design resembling a minivan.\n&gt;\n&gt;‘We look at a number of things along the way, and we decided to really put out energies in a few of them.’\n&gt;—Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO\n&gt;Apple has ramped up hiring since then, pulling in veterans from the auto industry as well as battery and machine-vision experts. People inside Apple said employees from across the company have been reassigned to Titan, similar to how Apple assembled a team for the Apple Watch.\n&gt;\n&gt;Those involved include DJ Novotney, an Apple veteran with a history of successfully shipping products. Mr. Novotney, one of the first hires to the program last year, is a vice president of program management, overseeing a growing team of managers who coordinate activities among various teams. He didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n&gt;\n&gt;Asked last week by late-night talk-show host Stephen Colbert about Apple’s interest in a driverless car, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said: “We look at a number of things along the way, and we decide to really put our energies in a few of them.”\n&gt;\n&gt;Gene Munster, an equity analyst with Piper Jaffray, in a Sept. 1 research note estimated Apple’s chances of making a car at between 50% and 60%. He said he expects any Apple car to have three distinctive features: a unique design; the ability to work with other Apple devices; and some autonomous capability.\n&gt;\n&gt;As Apple pushes forward, the company is finding it difficult to keep its automobile interest under wraps.\n&gt;\n&gt;In May, Apple employees met with officials from GoMentum Station, a 5,000–acre former Navy weapons station east of San Francisco that is now a secure testing facility for autonomous and connected vehicles. In emails obtained through a public-records request, Apple expressed interest in scheduling time at the facility.\n&gt;\n&gt;Then in August, an Apple lawyer met with officials from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.

You'd just need an inverter to convert your massive solar array to 120V or 240V AC or whatever the DC fast chargers use.\n\nI don't think such equipment exists, but I haven't looked.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002554796034625421,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09421148583039667,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2357641152306781,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2528422952530696,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24641575835733553,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25056067398422005,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2029890843453662,"ev_1":-0.13979622870585023,"ev_2":-0.3550268778926693,"ev_3":-0.25958081111020176,"ev_4":-0.024421122383500915,"ev_5":-0.00042257472038424265,"ev_6":-0.1321617325009331},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

That’s about $750 at spot prices, up from about $300, but Sumitomo has very long term supply contracts. It isn’t sold at spot prices as the demand has not been sufficient for it to be sold in that fashion.\n\nAbout 10% of the world’s cobalt supply is artisanal out of DRC. That has child labor problems. But the increased demand and price for cobalt actually increases the the search for supply elsewhere, including the Philippines, Canada, Australia, and at smaller scale, the US. The increase in prices will allow many more mines to start up or start back up.\n\nThis is a problem that needs to be solved at many different levels. It is unclear how much of the artisanal supply ends up in the supply chain for smartphones and EVs for the west. Most of the artisanal supply ends up in China and in Chinese made batteries for a variety of products. Congo Dongfang Mining has been specifically implicated. Tesla sources through Sumitomo, not CDM. Your smartphone or tablet made with a Chinese battery, or the EV sold in China with NMC may very well have CDM supplied cobalt. The EV makers that plan on using Chinese made cells will have a much harder time staying out of the supply chain problems with child labor. Fundamentally, the DRC has to put a stop to the practice and address why this practice happens at all.\n\nLong term, the recycling of cobalt is important. Again, the price increase helps that effort.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003623314357052247,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2782641877661394,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18341716561237598,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25060308339802345,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15833597607082628,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2623051250052114,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1163051654972757,"ev_1":-0.1451867219105927,"ev_2":-0.09105376380466623,"ev_3":-0.020323255042361172,"ev_4":-0.00890508719991582,"ev_5":-0.004382739927677903,"ev_6":-0.06999270037340466},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

By keeping some portion of the capacity \"in reserve\" and not using it to report range estimates or SoC%, it means the driver can treat the battery meter like one might treat a gas gauge.  You can thus drive the car all the way to zero before you should expect an imminent shutdown.\n\nThis makes the range estimate more realistic.  It's not \"250 miles (but you have to charge after every 200 miles)\" or \"250 miles (but the car might go into limp-home mode after 225 miles)\" or worse, \"250 miles (but the car will shutdown when it gets to 5% SoC)\".  Avoiding that caveat means I don't have to make \"judgements\" about SoC% and range as I drive.  And that makes me more relaxed.\n\nAnd to be honest, I will never, EVER notice the difference between 350 miles of range vs 200 miles of range, for 95% of the driving that I do.  I charge overnight at 9.6kW at home for my normal commutes, so the ONLY time it will make a difference is on a road trip that takes more than a couple hours, which I only do like 2-3 times a year at most.  And there are sufficient 150kW+ CCS fast-charging stations along the highways these days that the only real impact of 200 vs 350 mile range is that I might have to stop to charge a couple more times on a day-long trip.

EVs already work just fine today, with batteries having ~1/80th the energy density of fuel. Even just doubling energy density would be a radical improvement, so expecting it to ever get to x80 is just ridiculous.\n\n&gt; And I also mean recharge time. Until then many people have no use for a less convenient mode of transportation. \n\nRecharge time is already down to 18 minutes for ~220 miles in the most modern EVs, and those don't even make use of the full charging speed available at *today's* DC fast chargers. And *tomorrow's* fast-chargers are going to be even faster.\n\nPlus, a 15 minute break every 3-4 hours is nothing. You're going to eat a meal/snack about that often *anyway*, *and* it's good for you to get out of the car and stretch your legs for a bit every so often. You get to your destination feeling a *lot* more ready to actually have fun there if you don't drain yourself by staying behind the wheel for 8+ hours at a stretch. \n\nAs someone who has road-tripped in a 2018 Model 3 for several thousand miles, I can tell you that the EVs of *4 years ago* are already equally as convenient for road tripping as gas cars are. So EVs made 4 years from *now* are going to be at least as good, if not *better*.\n\n&gt; I think you are forgetting machinery and equipment that uses fuel as well. \n\nNo I'm not. I'm just not talking about it. This entire conversation has been exclusively about *cars*, because this thread is about *car loans*, not heavy equipment loans.\n\n&gt; I also don't see the world's demand slowing enough for the supply to keep up.\n\nWatch The Limiting Factor's videos about this. Specifically, the chart at 7:00 into [this video](https://youtu.be/5GYobz2NSc4?t=419). The full height of the bar is predicted demand for battery raw materials, and the blue part is predicted supply. It's going to take a while for supply to catch up because demand is growing so explosively, while it takes a very long time to open a new mine to start supplying that enormous demand. But the mining companies know that demand is certain to follow this trend, so they now know that it'll be worth the time and expense to open all these new mines.\n\n&gt;  I honestly think the things that slams the breaks on EVs will be the environmental disasters the mining is causing.\n\nI hate to say it, but local environmental damage is going to simply *have* to take a back seat in our priorities list vs global climate change, in the coming decades. That sucks, but it's just reality. We've fucked ourselves too much already to do anything *except* go full-steam ahead on ending the burning of fossil fuels and moving to a fully sustainable future.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.09776216306878875,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17426043562591076,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.247728666969707,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12336193056156237,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19797227197783285,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32971900480655636,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10287010651033295,"ev_1":-0.09981565183878759,"ev_2":-0.0691126182609878,"ev_3":-0.04961857320934845,"ev_4":-0.12656081530682664,"ev_5":-0.07245669938856736,"ev_6":-0.16588707233447014},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Back then people were always interested in EVs and often had questions. Charging was hard to find but I could always rely on the chargers around campus. As evs slowly became more popular, people were just happy to see others driving around efficient non polluting transport. \n\nI’d say over the years charging has become better. More locations and way more reliable. However *some people* now like to use EV charging as EV parking and not plug in. Which makes us all look bad, and makes living with one just a little more difficult. \n\nI think there’s a lot of negativity between brands these days. Well, *that one brand* and everyone else. There’s certainly reasons for it, but it’s very much so one sided. \n\nI also think EVs are getting to…techy. I don’t really need screens for everything.

Most solar systems offer a 20-year warranty, but if a company folds in 5 years, that sort of defeats the purpose of warranty.  Yes, big companies do shut down, but generally, bigger companies that have been around a while are more likely to be around in 20 years than a small company that started a year ago.  Solar is going to get really big in the next 5 years and lots of companies are going to spring up.  When the maximum number of roofs have panels, those companies will start folding.  This is already happening in Hawaii.  \n* Check your utility company's rules.  These set the rules of how solar systems will work with the grid and how the customer's bill is affected.  For example, does your state allow net metering? What happens to excess electricity? Also check to see if people are having difficulties getting permits. \n* Check the various state and federal tax incentives (credits and deductions).  \n* I think the typical cost of a system is $3 per installed watt before the various tax incentives.  So a 5000 watt system should cost about $15,000.  This is obviously just a very general estimate. \n* Don't put panels on an old roof.

By charging your car with solar, you're directly *not* giving that solar energy to the utility and being paid for it, so it's quite literally costing you money right there.  \n\nAs I said, divide the total cost of your panels ($5000) by the total amount of energy they generate over their entire lifetime.  $5000 will get you about a 3 kW system installed.  Let's say it lasts 30 years.  Hard to guess, because most panel manufacturers today haven't even been around for 30 years.  But 30 years is longer than the typical warranty that you'd get (25 years).  Depending on where you live, you might get 20 kW-hr per day out of that 3 kW system.  So 20 * 365 * 30 = 219 MW-hr total.  $5000/219000 kW-hr = 2.3 cents per kW-hr.  The average cost of electricity that most people pay is 12 cents per kW-hr.  So a 3 kW system solar panels over a 30 year lifetime will cost you about 18% of what it would if you just pulled from the grid.  Much cheaper, but never \"free\".  Note this assumes you're only using the electricity to charge your car.  Obviously if you have panels on your roof, you're also using the electricity to power your home and do everything else, with whatever is left over being sold back to the utility (at a much lower rate than what you pay to receive it), so you'd have to do a much more detailed calculation to figure out the true cost of electricity via solar panels.  This will depend on the net metering rules in your area, time of day of generation versus demand, etc. etc.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007814066666469444,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20658224195950248,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18181000274851994,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2221252283000768,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.241972784954003,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22484624581751825,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19139002422161866,"solar_1":-0.19453200097567666,"solar_2":-0.12478781892092845,"solar_3":-0.22794663888028785,"solar_4":-0.10302157269073157,"solar_5":-0.03265223610893978,"solar_6":-0.030022221165078616,"solar_7":-0.02951474724977743,"solar_8":-0.038907361221429834,"solar_9":-0.03070933616688265,"solar_10":-0.14129532392304528},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I have learned a tremendous amount this last week since being interested in solar,  and the installation is actually pretty easy.  There is some math and electricity knowledge involved but the systems usually have accepted designs to begin with that you don't even really need to modify.  The wiring is simple for even a non electrician (although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it).\n\nAn Enphase Microinverter solar panel system for example is pretty much \"plug and play\".  Its most challenging aspect,  doing some basic electrical math to make sure the length of the wire from your roof to the breaker is not too long.  Making sure you use the correct wires.  Making sure the connections are all done properly. And that is everything is grounded.   Sure that is a simplified overview but the rest of the installation is basically applying for the permit and bolting the panel railing system into your roof correctly (which means connecting it to the rafters and sealing it).\n\nIts honestly not a lot of physical labor.  Its not a lot of running wires.  Its not a lot of technical designing.  \n\nYou throw a disconnect on it to meet code,  plaster some warning stickers on the wire's,  have it inspected,  get a two way meter and a net metering agreement in place, and you are good to go.\n\nI have no problem with a contractor doing it,  but I do have a problem of them wanting to charge me 10,000$+ for the installation (which doesn't even include the actual hardware components of the system).\n\nI guarantee I can install my system over the course of a couple of weekends.

PPA needs to be paid, but there is an schedule for payment. PGE will bill on NEM, so any power generated by PV is credited, regardless if from PPA or from addition. \n\n&gt; The PPA is PG&amp;E's customer for the electrical connection to the home and deals with PG&amp;E\n\nThis does not make any sense.

PGE credits HO for net metering. \n\n&gt;  If you install a system, that totally upsets billing and tracking of which solar panels produced how much power and when\n\nNo, it doesnt. Just needs to be separate from the PPA system. PPA will not take credit for addition production.

PPA needs to be paid off either in installments or prepayment. Buyer can negotiate with Seller about who pays what. Buyer can add to system if he wants to offset bill higher.\n\n&gt; Did the homeowner just get taken for a ride by the PPA and got solar because it sounded environmentally cool without understanding what a terrible deal he was getting? And, one that has now encumbered his property.\n\nYES. Major financial fuckup. \n\n&gt; I'd make the seller buy out the PPA contract as condition of sale. You'd have to negotiate a new selling price. But, you'd get the house free from the PPA and can expand the system and replace the inverter with considerably more freedom.\n\nI would not expand the system on PPA's inverter.

I have PV on my roof and I love electricity but there is plenty of room for photovoltaics and wind and geothermal and solar thermal and on and on.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010352112294640392,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18701678835879706,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20971315980947858,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1046689140299956,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.11330086680886779,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.008784793550148606,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18155459741440913,"solar_1":-0.11470281361140476,"solar_2":-0.1929470978756626,"solar_3":-0.0065820595588472015,"solar_4":-0.005561999246007569,"solar_5":-0.011781763240530077,"solar_6":-0.0007047211620374583,"solar_7":-0.002576201528427191,"solar_8":-0.001827376194948253,"solar_9":-0.0455936982628676,"solar_10":-0.010197332042177246},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

That's OK, though. You are willing to engage in conversation with someone you disagree with and that's pretty rare, so I'm happy to clarify.\n\n&gt; I'm not sure what you're actually saying about environmental issues though, except that nuclear energy is the bees knees.\n\nThen allow me to expand! Frankly stated, our environmental public policy sucks in many ways. In many cases it caused more harm than good. I've spent over a decade in government and could probably write a book about what I've observed in terms of poor environmental policy, sometimes in regard to climate change policy, sometimes not. The crazy thing, though, is that most of these policies were put in place in response to environmentalists' demands and with their counsel.\n\n&gt;You say solar energy is bad because manufacturing harms the environment, \n\nManufacturing doesn't harm the environment per se. The problem is that when panels are made in countries with poor environmental standards, the toxic waste kills people. China in particular has an horrific environmental record when it comes to how they handle manufacturing and industrial waste.\n\nBut even if it weren't for these issues, the net benefit to *climate change avoidance* is very small when solar panels made in China are used. You've stated that you are quite young, but you seem very capable of understanding some of the nuance associated with these topics, so I won't hold back. \n\nIf you aren't familiar with the concept already, you might look into what is called \"embodied CO2.\" This is the amount of CO2 released to construct something. When we look at solar panels made in China, the amount of CO2 released per panel constructed is much higher than those made in the U.S. or Europe. So much so that if a panel is made in China and installed in places in the U.S. or Europe that don't receive much sunlight (aka \"low insolation areas\"), then that solar panel probably won't generate enough low-carbon electricity in its lifetime to offset the CO2 released during its manufacture. \n\nDoes current energy policy distinguish between embodied CO2 in solar panels or windmills? No. That's a policy failure of the type I am talking about.\n\n&gt;but nuclear energy requires manufacturing too. \n\nSure, but as I said, manufacturing can be done responsibly.\n\n&gt;Not just that, it requires mining for the fuel, which is pretty bad for the environment. \n\nNuclear fuel is *six orders of magnitude* more energy dense than chemical fuel. Again, I know you are young, but I trust you've had enough math to understand the implications of that. What's more, some nuclear fuel (like thorium) is in fact a byproduct of mining rare earth elements. In other words, it's free in terms of marginal environmental impact. \n\nWhat's more, every proposed energy plan requires substantial amounts of mining. Like electric cars? I hope you don't mind that dry lake beds in Bolivia are mined for lithium.\n\n&gt;I think in general it's best to have diverse energy sources and we're better off with anything that can replace fossil fuels.\n\nIt is here that you need to think in terms of macroeconomics. What if the cost of a diverse pool of resources was significantly costlier than a less diverse policy? I recommend this video that compares two proposed plans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O7bB1ghqvU\n\n&gt;If you've got issues with the way environmentalism is now, I think it would be better to post in environmentalist communities if we've got more in common than not on environmental concerns.\n\nI have called out the hypocrisy of anti-nuclear environmentalists everywhere I  go. I actually don't post much to Reddit anymore. I'm quite choosy about who I reply to. That doesn't mean I don't express my views elsewhere.\n\n&gt;Do you believe in anthropogenic climate change? \n\nSure. I think there are a great number of things that affect the climate and humans are near the top of the list. I think it's quite clear that CO2 is a greenhouse gas (GHG) and that we emit lots of it. I think there's general agreement among scientists that the *direct effect* of doubling atmospheric CO2 would be a theoretical increase of about 1°C. Where I see much less agreement is in consideration of feedback effects. Since about 2013 (when AR5 was released) there seems to have been a real reconsideration of feedbacks, with more and more general agreement that feedbacks were not as strong as previously believed.\n\n&gt;Do you think biodiversity is a priority? \n\nSure. You should know, though, that biodiversity has been most impacted in isolated ecosystems like islands. There is less threat to biodiversity in most regions of the planet than most people believe: https://aeon.co/essays/we-are-not-edging-up-to-a-mass-extinction\n\nWhat you should understand about my perspective, though, is that I see a great many things out there to worry about. There are a great many things we can fear if we so choose. A supervolcano deciding now would be a great time to wake up. Cosmic ray burst. Rogue asteroid. Carrington event. Nuclear war (this one was a daily fear when I was growing up; it's hard to describe to someone who didn't live through it). Terrorism. Trump being elected. Hillary being elected. Drug resistant bacteria. Grey goo. AI becoming sentient and deciding we would make better batteries than overlords. The list goes on and on. Most of the time, the chances of something going really bad are very slim. Sometimes something really bad does happen, like the Black Plague, the Mongol hordes, or much further back, the Toba Catastrophe (which nearly killed us off). The important thing to remember, if I may be so bold as to offer advice, is that fear paralyzes us, where reason let's us look at problems and work towards solutions. That's why I support development of Gen IV nuclear reactors, SkyTran, Biochar, indoor farming, and a bunch of other things. Our problems are myriad, but so are our current solutions, and our ingenuity, I believe, is greater still.\n\n&gt;Is there something environmentalists today have wrong or just \"old folks\" with anti-nuclear ideas? \n\nYes, many things. When I was growing up, the backbone of our local economy was the timber industry. The local timber company was incredibly responsible and planted two trees for each one they harvested. But environmentalists got it in their head that cutting down trees was bad for some reason, so they would litigate every time the USFS contracted a timber sale. Eventually, all but two small sawmills in my half of a very large state went away. Take a moment and guess what might have happened next.\n\nHave you taken your moment? OK. Fuel started to accumulate in the forests, so the federal agencies started burning areas to reduce fuels. That's right, they started *paying* to reduce fuels instead of being *paid* to have those fuels removed. Of course their efforts were insufficient and many regions have experienced catastrophic wildfire as a result.\n\nOr there's the Pine Beetle. This little critter was contained, but environmentalists made sure that no cutting could take place in the nearby forest, so the things spread throughout millions of acres of forests across several western states. Some of my favorite forests of my youth are ugly stands of dead trees today.\n\nThen there are sage grouse. Or prairie dogs. Or the Mexican spotted owl. Each of these have caused millions of dollars to be spent on preservation efforts that generally backfired. In the end, the best results in helping these species were spearheaded by local governments, despite environmentalists protests. \n\nThen there's the whole push from environmentalists to encourage and/or compell veganism among society at large, even though ruminants do more to improve and rehabilitate the environment than any other policy: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP_19aj4-3A\n\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change\n\nFinally, there's just the general misanthropy of the old school environmentalists. The whole \"humans are a cancer\" propaganda they push is simply disgusting. Those people are cultists, nothing more.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.24136991210538586,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1624414254687496,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23101752303441683,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.023478216491639614,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24472702244505148,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22452988153750855,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23448852326248826,"solar_1":-0.10257693915991695,"solar_2":-0.21917399941697555,"solar_3":-0.11995711563688205,"solar_4":-0.046974918640263666,"solar_5":-0.2789993932431874,"solar_6":-0.10558904672507197,"solar_7":-0.08959017454859956,"solar_8":-0.07166002817393746,"solar_9":-0.018094850600988366,"solar_10":-0.1295865843223712},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Depending on the meter model you may find what you need here: \nhttps://www.pge.com/en_US/residential/save-energy-money/analyze-your-usage/your-usage/view-and-share-your-data-with-smartmeter/reading-the-smartmeter.page","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005914838014480969,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1092873308201888,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2128481238315218,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2214402494331201,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2513249628013368,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23965517662930638,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12602633812154332,"solar_1":-0.18009264891346297,"solar_2":-0.08530581020750105,"solar_3":-0.007495472440496087,"solar_4":-0.009745554901504269,"solar_5":-0.0003660165724189331,"solar_6":-0.00038610743649769574,"solar_7":-0.013245010438064734,"solar_8":-0.0020284567726776004,"solar_9":-0.13400947488844395,"solar_10":-0.2380004578761215},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Assuming that you could fit 1kW of solar panels onto a car, which is a stretch, and if we assume that they operate at half of capacity (because flat, shaded, etc.) for 6 hours a day on average, that means that after one day of driving the panels have extended the range of the vehicle by about 0.5% - in other words, it would take a little over half a year for the panels to generate the equivalent energy of one tank of gas.\n\nSo, no, putting a reasonable number of panels on your car would not extend the range of a roadtrip.  \n\nIn an extreme sense, you could make an expanding platform to double or triple the available area for the panels, that is tilted to increase gain, and you parked the vehicle in the sun, you could maybe generate a full tank of gas worth of travel distance in a month.

Deadline to  walk away from the home is Wednesday.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.546009878317515,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15139818462167795,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16008136404421042,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1836004859077058,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2257423292814767,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2260821863550216,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.32213703409539673,"solar_1":-0.07384169335625757,"solar_2":-0.035927323772321364,"solar_3":-0.09798974170968186,"solar_4":-0.024463693012065465,"solar_5":-0.08108373450037713,"solar_6":-0.0740698293675549,"solar_7":-0.017831969085988202,"solar_8":-0.01834435671418788,"solar_9":-0.05442939219744147,"solar_10":-0.14725656893760394},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

But there are answers as you might expect, after all how could the UK commit to carbon zero by 2050 if there isn't an answer? It was not just political wishfulness. It was based on a detailed analysis that they commissioned to see if it is possible. Our emissions are already decreasing on line with an 80% reduction by 2050 and this report showed it is possible to tip that down so that we reach zero emissions by 2050. The UK is now committed to that as a matter of policy.\n\nFor renewables, by far the best way to deal with the intermittency is to use hydro. You get a particularly good synergy with solar power floating on the water held back in hydro projects. The hydro power can be doubled using the solar power with the hydro used to store the excess power at night and produce it in daytime.\n\nThere is plenty of hydro storage capacity in most countries. The UK in its plan for carbon zero by 2050 relies extensively on hydro storage. A detailed analysis for Australia found that there is plenty by way of hydro storage to supply all the peaking power it needs. This is far less expensive than batteries. It's not just dams above the ground. One project in Australia is using a disused mine and pumping water between lower and higher levels of the mine and then letting it flow back down again for its peaking power. \n\nThere are many other solutions. Once electric cars are commonplace, which will be needed for a total transition to zero emissions, then the car owners can use the batteries to earn money for as long as the car is parked, using just a fraction of the battery storage, buying electricity at times of the day when it is low cost because the renewables produce too much and selling it back to the grid when it is higher cost because it is in short supply. It would cost a huge amount to install so many batteries for peaking power but if you have them there already for electric cars it can make a big difference. Also you can use molten salt which is already used for solar thermal plants in deserts.\n\nBut hydro is likely to be the most cost effective solution in the near term for most projects.\n\nYou also have some renewables that naturally complement each other, for instance onshore wind in the US is strongest at night, offshore wind is strongest in the daytime when energy use is higher.\n\nFor more about all this see:\n\n [Do renewables for power generation take up more land area than fossil fuels?

So let’s say you’re year year 2 out of 20 year contract and the company decides to sell or go under. At that point, your account is an asset that every year they make money from. Your account essentially gets sold to another company that you don’t get to choose so that they can recoup their investment and make a little profit from that account. That new company has to honor your warranties. The thing is, your warranty is always through the manufacture and not all manufactures are great about honoring the warranty. Depending on the company, they’ll really drag their feet. That’s why I like Sunrun and a couple others that have something called a “production guarantee”. In the paperwork it says that if the system underproduces then the company will pay for the remaining power and bill you at the lower rate. For instance let’s say there’s vivint and sunrun. I work with both:\n\nWith both your system is supposed to produce 10,000kwh a year. Something goes wrong and they produce 9,000kwh. Your yearly bill would look like this if you used 10,000kwh:\n\nVivint: 9,000kwh*lower solar rate + 1000kwh*local utility rate = higher bill\n\nSunrun: 9000kwh*lower solar rate + 1000kwh*still lower solar rate that sunrun buys from the utility and sell to you at the lower rate. = lower bill\n\nI hope I explained that well.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006982789370037304,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1392487997038753,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2021815865427836,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26014705376996144,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.12720372606861474,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17882403732238483,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11820063069656801,"solar_1":-0.3440216038530151,"solar_2":-0.01929001735455434,"solar_3":-0.08994996543575932,"solar_4":-0.21284331983453444,"solar_5":-0.0017033900536868412,"solar_6":-0.23176687888674982,"solar_7":-0.2289664845221904,"solar_8":-0.1850494067776178,"solar_9":-0.03902261486187797,"solar_10":-0.3370176189770731},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Once we sell the ICE car, we'll be a decarbonized-mobility household for good!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.026197959668934345,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12843565689399838,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22708586300453082,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1545445565134287,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16744433401618153,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.030061005149036646,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04156580093937615,"solar_1":-0.18306511135882958,"solar_2":-0.2072059415546001,"solar_3":-0.0017749921971699223,"solar_4":-0.010136567851683745,"solar_5":-0.0005880429331834117,"solar_6":-0.0002005064622305023,"solar_7":-0.003328012113342993,"solar_8":-0.0006013454864538895,"solar_9":-0.009123001480475068,"solar_10":-0.012897484169419235},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.

My reaction to someone who says, “I’m vegan, but I eat honey” is similar to my reaction to someone who says, “I’m vegetarian, but I eat chicken/fish.”\n\n\nSome of the common practices I object to in the honey industry are: unnaturally crowded living conditions, crushing of the male bee’s head and thorax (effectively turning him inside out) to collect sperm, artificial insemination of the queen bee with a syringe, genetic manipulation, use of chemical smoke to subdue bees, wing clipping, burning of hives, burning/gassing of diseased bees, artificial shelters, artificial and unhealthy diets, and intentional starvation.

I know it was kind of a harsh way to put it (hence a couple of downvotes), but I've found that it's so much more rewarding to live by a personal code of \"make the most compassionate choice I can\" rather than trying to give everything a designation of right and wrong. The latter tends to feel heavy and puts me at odds with a lot of people who are also trying to do the best they can. I saved that spider because I felt an intense urge to protect it, but I don't chide others for thinking they are disgusting, and I'm willing to listen to your argument about why they don't have feelings because I haven't hung my personal value system on the current findings of science (as some current beliefs are subject to change with follow up studies). \n\nThink about it this way.. When the first study showed that fish didn't have feelings, were people wrong to use that as evidence, or did it only become wrong when the follow up study showed that they actually do feel a lot more than we previously thought? Vegans who cite the new study were probably going to be vegan even before the old argument was disproven, but the new study is a helpful justification. I think the science is secondary (I say this as a practicing scientist working in a lab) to one's internal value system.

Followed by you giving what that opinion would be.\n\nI in turn commented on that opinion. The opinion basis is incorrect. With the blanket statement inferring that vegans would make a choice that was physiologically unhealthy. I have neither denied that humans are capable of eating meat nor that they have done so in length. They can also drink beer too.\n\nAbstaining is not incompatible. It in fact reverts to something more compatible with our physiology. As massive meat consumption strains your body and doesn't fulfill your daily nutrient deficiencies. \n\nHaving primarily the physiology of herbivores with the ability to consume meat. Does not argue against being an omnivore but neither does it argue against being vegan.\nBears who primarily have the physiology of carnivores but are classified rather aptly as omnivores, have a largely plant based diet.\nSo it would suffice to say... it isn't incompatible with either version of omnivore.\n\nIn case that was missed, there are different classifications of omnivores based on... physiology.\n\nNo I would not like the conversation to degenerate into feces, it certainly isn't a necessity but on that topic. Cellulose is a fiber integral to the digestive process of the exceptionally (but apparently not as exceptional as others) long intestines. Without which our food waste would find it rather hard to make it's way out rapidly enough to ensure optimum health.\n\nAs far as the other erroneous claims you made I will dignify them with an answer briefly\n\n\n&gt;Hydrochloric acid in our stomachs, NOT found in herbivores\n\nHorses produce Hydrochloric acid\n\n&gt;canines, NOT found in herbivores\n\nGorillas and hippos have canines (vastly larger than our own) both herbivores\n\n&gt;pancreas designed to break down meat, NOT found in herbivores\n\nall animals have pancreases. Sweetbread is a dish made from those extra parts. If you are interested.\n\n&gt;vegan diets require supplements, especially when child birth is involved\n\nall women take prenatal vitamins, since their body increases use of certain dietary vitamins. Vegans do not need to take supplements, save for b12...which is from bacteria. The result of being too clean.\n.\n\nIn summation my point was simply to point out the nonfactual information being attributed to veganism. And make a request that you not assume that vegans aren't well, if not more so in some cases, informed or educated on the physiology of the body. And were they to at one point to not be knowledgeable, insufficient information is often presented by omnivores (to prove veganism wrong) that is easily given a rebuttal by those who are knowledgeable. And educating all.\n\nTo which, I would rather educate than argue.\n\n\nEdit- FYI and just because I can't stop shaking my head... the pancreas enzymes break down macro-nutrients. Carbs, proteins, fats. Which are not meat specific.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012639224684486787,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27754531392807597,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23546019200293108,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17904939732957245,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.24290306475530302,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20912923882013082,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23010981549790208,"diet_1":-0.16932224729680456,"diet_2":-0.2510609435088603,"diet_3":-0.09613451877305579,"diet_4":-0.03209744202489304,"diet_5":-0.21257614866044605,"diet_6":-0.1570436351951988,"diet_8":-0.028656594137525342,"diet_9":-0.01809620837351152,"diet_10":-0.022108189135906287,"diet_11":-0.08294970872035871,"diet_13":-0.010127061880969753,"diet_14":-0.0598790584820866,"diet_17":-0.04724330791214015},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

The fact your eating the flesh of an animal that is now dead but could've been alive had you not eaten it is much more immediate.\n\nIf you go vegan I guarantee you that you will start seeing it another way. The reason you're not seeing anything wrong with it now is that you're doing it, and you have to rationalize that somehow. You know it's impossible to rationalize, so you say it's not fundamentally wrong. But, if you don't have to rationalize it (because you're not doing it) then you will see how wrong it is. At least it requires less effort, even though it will still require some inspection. When you go vegan, make the inspection. \n\n&gt; Do you really believe I won't stay a vegan for 5+ years because my convictions are not strong enough?\n\nIt's not about convictions, it's about how long term the consequences are. Whether you stay vegan for 5 years or not is not place to say. In my experience, this is what happens: either people realize the ethical reasons to be vegan or they don't stay vegan. The reason for this is simple: we are terrible at judging long term consequences over the long term.\n\nI for one feel that there is nothing more than the environment, after all it doesn't matter who you save if there is no one left to save. I also feel that my well begin is more important than anyone else's. As such, rationally, in terms of reasons for being vegan I would rate environment first, health second and ethics third. But it is so much easier to think about the ethical reasons when I would otherwise fail to stay vegan, because the effects are immediate and immediately relatable.  It might be slightly different for someone who was cured of their T2 diabetes, but yeah. It's not about how strong your convictions are. Drug addicted are almost always convinced that they have to stop, yet they don't. The reasons are pretty simple, their reasons to do drugs are more immediate than their reasons to continue. Doesn't make them bad people, just makes them addicts.\n\nBut I should stress that I don't (and indeed cannot) know how it is for you, this is just what I have seen with my friends and strangers online. Ethical veganism seems to be a requirement for long term veganism, in some form, but vegans very often get there regardless of the initial intent. It's just so obvious when you don't have to close your eyes anymore. I think you should think about using that power.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2675752402636225,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27079222292748506,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2662980414070437,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2609641180565485,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.36579200664009376,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2679935797766202,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.012501729341844717,"diet_1":-0.05746272908678899,"diet_2":-0.02065003392260678,"diet_3":-0.16207312788345973,"diet_4":-0.014070582338414775,"diet_5":-0.030125941334214684,"diet_6":-0.058940596262497515,"diet_8":-0.0018346544984524371,"diet_9":-0.0004911221731163096,"diet_10":-0.008564750372897834,"diet_11":-0.0012497591160354204,"diet_13":-0.006639173254370689,"diet_14":-0.035936957249456704,"diet_17":-0.04863839937994877},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Another thing that you can do, is ONE day a week do a lot of pre-cooking  with burgers! You can do your own high protein burgers all in one day and then freeze them! There are a lot of recipes on the internet. (Sorry for my english). But i repeat to you, DONT be so hard on yourself! If you are struggling, just stop. Or like eat meat outside and not inside. Or wathever keeps you healthy. Yes i know that every one of us makes a difference, but its not worth sacrifice your mental health for something that will not save the animals right away.

Found exactly one such comment. Not surprised to learn that they're not even vegan. That fact speaks a lot in itself, doesn't it? (Even if they were, it's not a valid argument to begin with.)\n\n&gt;“Isn’t it disturbing how the arguments are similar for enslaved Black ppl and abused animals” Is equal to: “Isn’t it disturbing animals and Black ppl experienced the same treatment?”\n\nThat's literally a non-sequitur. And once again, you completely ignored the point I made about being vegan, that is, you see what unites us. Also, I want to ask, do you agree with the first statement or not?\n\n&gt;Also OP literally said comparing slavery and animal abuse is “a valid comparison” in another comment, so yea, we all see through the semantics BS, OP literally compared Black ppl to animals.\n\nSomething really important you seem to be completely missing continuously is that it has nothing to do with black people in particular. The institutionalized human slavery of the past is being compared to present institutionalized animal agriculture. There are victims other than blacks, although they are among the most affected. As others have pointed out, the comparison itself is objective and just calling it \"racist\" won't make it racist.\n\n[Another comment from here which essentially answers everything you've said.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/qx0m3v/isnt_it_disturbing_that_a_lot_of_the_same/hl90imr/)\n\nAnd here you respond with:\n\n&gt;Why is it so important to you to be free to compare slavery to animal abuse?\n\nIt's as if you really don't have any actual point to make, which would make your entire argument a bad faith response.\n\nTo answer your question, because that's one of the ways for non-vegans to rationalize animal abuse they cause. As Jewish Nobel laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer said:\n\n**“Human beings see oppression vividly when they're the victims. Otherwise they victimize blindly and without a thought.”**","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006575441317788014,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19859415251485232,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18969585633197897,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.36887297096346355,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3662864580037902,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.314571401162436,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.34573012962922434,"diet_1":-0.026371671507755916,"diet_2":-0.20385363201300302,"diet_3":-0.06576017719150211,"diet_4":-0.15823768961126916,"diet_5":-0.08589105028659105,"diet_6":-0.023517691462378327,"diet_8":-0.12915135450505963,"diet_9":-0.004971649808188279,"diet_10":-0.009266584490736326,"diet_11":-0.006706082882980506,"diet_13":-0.00863527157343924,"diet_14":-0.0384197011590004,"diet_17":-0.06338990603884061},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

Popular animal-derived fining agents used in the production of wine include blood and bone marrow, casein (milk protein), chitin (fiber from crustacean shells), egg albumen (derived from egg whites), fish oil, gelatin (protein from boiling animal parts), and isinglass (gelatin from fish bladder membranes).\n\nThankfully, there are several common fining agents that are animal-friendly and used to make vegan wine. Carbon, bentonite clay, limestone, kaolin clay, plant casein, silica gel, and vegetable plaques are all suitable alternatives. You can check your local organic or health food stores, local organic winemakers, and co-op’s, and most regular wine/liquor stores will order vegan wines upon request.\"","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"yes","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0415662191808129,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20186154833858938,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18628444740287464,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11016950942162598,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28556130123439344,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26185938555850496,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15485917610256936,"diet_1":-0.13298348485151754,"diet_2":-0.3371107163926188,"diet_3":-0.17263747656214146,"diet_4":-0.22675271134701078,"diet_5":-0.17484102510273875,"diet_6":-0.16521124067646675,"diet_8":-0.02298553283981164,"diet_9":-0.22637420358525748,"diet_10":-0.21495169500257813,"diet_11":-0.2003177458570327,"diet_13":-0.11668796213431977,"diet_14":-0.15780364535751856,"diet_17":-0.20266375592951028},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Leaving aside for the moment that I'm a vegan and don't care to profit off the killing of animals, I'd love to see our US Agricultural dept. subsidize algae production for agar and a whole host of products.

Basically, anything that we now are using fossil fuels and animal murder to provide.  \n\nFYI - the Agricultural dept is the second largest taxpayer suck in the USA.  \"Defense\" is number one.\n\nAs long as the governments of the world insist on subsiding the fossil fuel/agricultural industrial complex, animal products will be cheaper - because we all pay for them with our tax dollars.\n\n:bit of rant here: As a vegan, IMO, the best thing we can do politically in the USA is to end the enormous cattle subsidies that I am expected to provide via my tax dollars.  The land we own as citizens is rented out for pennies on the dollar to ranchers who then ship their products with subsidized gas or diesel to kill camps, AKA \"slaughterhouses\" with workers who are treated by \"food processors\" as little better than the animals they kill.  Those worker's lifelong injuries are usually cared for by the taxpayers.  The dead animals are transported on subsidized roads; the wear and tear of trucks on roadways is far out of proportion of the taxes and fees they pay.  If we want to encourage veganism, ending subsidies on the dairy and cattle \"industries\" and transferring that money to city-based agricultural extensions would do as much as any one of us eating a plant-based diet.
