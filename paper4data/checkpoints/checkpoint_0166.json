"comment": "Let me get this straight.  You are saying that people who drive electric cars who want to drive further than the range allows are being irresponsible?  I disagree. \n\nThe ones who want piece of mind are the PHEV drivers who want a gas engine to fall back on.  What you characterize as a little piece of mind for the pure EV driver is the difference between getting home and not.  \n\nI'm still not getting why you think this is about free electricity.  In my mind it is not.  I don't think electricity should be free as long as it costs money to produce and or deliver it.\n\nI call balderdash on your final assertions.  What is better for the environment, getting more people to adopt pure electric vehicles, or getting more people to buy PHEVs?  If you answer PHEVs, you are fooling yourself.  Removing the constraints of EV ownership means making charging stations readily available to those that need them.  PHEVs are a huge step forward for the environment when compared to a standard ICE engine.  They provide the convenience of an ICE with the environmental friendliness of a limited range electric car.  Electric cars are another huge step forward from the PHEV and should be encouraged.  The environment will be better off if more PHEV buyers opt for EVs instead, knowing that charging stations will be readily accessible.  My proposal reduces one of the fundamental constraints that prevents people from buying EVs, which leads to a cleaner planet.",

Everything said no and that they have an open diff.  \n\nIf it's an open diff, the only way they can transfer power to the other wheel is by braking the other wheel.  That's it.  There's no other way physically for them to do this.  Considering how system their drivetrain is, that's just how it is going to be.  \n\nIf you're asking about the whole electronic setup and why it doesn't work so well in a performance environment, there is this: http://www.superstreetonline.com/how-to/transmission-drivetrain/1312-stability-control-torque-vectoring-systems/\n\nI am not a big fan of super street, but they explain it better than I have.",

"comment": "I also sell solar and my company only sells the entire systems, no leases. In essence people are already renting their electricity from a monopolized utility company. Switching over to solar city is like renting from a cheaper provider of electricity. Yes you save some money up front, but the prices of electricity whether with Solar City or Utility will still rise, and 20 years down the line when electricity is REAL expensive compared to today is when you really start saving the big bucks. You can't really do that with a solar lease. \n\nHowever, it's still fantastic that Solar City is spreading solar everywhere, and it still feels good to be going solar and helping the environment. But speaking dollars and cents, you save a SHIT TON more 20-30- FORTY years down the line when you buy your solar system. It's like buying VS renting a house. Old folks who bought their house in 1980 have a mortgage of 700 bucks for a 4 bedroom house that today is worth 700,000 dollars. Yes it was more money upfront, but today, after 30 years those old folks look like financial geniuses. \n\nFrom a sales perspective, Solar City is not the place to be if you want to make the big bucks. They are the McDonalds of Solar,  barely train their guys to sell and quite frankly don't need to since they have such massive marketing operations and standardized operating procedures. You can make alot more money with smaller companies. However still not a bad company to work for from what I hear and not a bad way to get into the industry. \n\nAlso Solar City uses Chinese solar panels, my company as well as other smaller installers stick with American Solar manufacturers. Better quality, better technology, better warranty and better America. SunPower and Solar World are the best American made panels. Solar World is partially owned by a German company, which not a bad thing since Germans have some of the best Solar tech. (not 100% owned, I'm guessing it's like 51% owned so they have majority control in business decisions.) \n\nWhy do the panels they use matter? Because these Chinese companies many of which have only been around for 6 years are guaranteeing 25 years of electric production. They haven't even seen their panels last for 25 years, they also are being subsidized by the CHinese government. Around 2010 the Chi-comms (chinese communists) dropped 50% of their solar subsidies and just like that dozens of Chinses solar manufacturers dissappeared. That is bad for anyone who bought their panels, no warranty to guarantee production or replace malfunctions. So no one really knows if these CHinese panels will actually last 25 years. \n\nAmerican panels 25 year warranty, backed by many warranties and insurances AND they have estimated 35-40 year life. 35-40 years is when you are saving a shit ton of money and laughing at all the fossil fuel addicted peasants. \n\nTL:DR  Leases are not the best option long term, you save/make WAY more money buying the system upfront. SolarCity uses Chinese panels, no one knows if they will actually last 25 years at or near full electric production. 'Merica \n\nI'm also a huge fan of the chosen one....his holiness Elon Musk. He co founded Solar City and has his cousins running the show since he's real busy fighting the good fight with Electric cars and Space rockets. \n\nBottom line, OP you're in the right industry at the right time. Lots of money to be made, lots of fulfilling work to be done. Good luck",

"comment": "&gt; Appears everything is run in PVC? On the DC side, inside of the building, before the inverter, this would be a NEC violation (690.31 E or G, depending on code year). Code specifies metal raceway.\n\nI can't comment on that.  All I know is the city inspector allowed it.  Although, he really didn't seem to know anything about solar installations.  Probably didn't know what DC even meant!\n\n&gt; Also, what is the analog meter inside the basement for? \n\nIt's my total production meter.  Probably required as a backup to monitoring.  The utility doesn't need to see it.  They are installing a meter than can read both incoming and outgoing energy (not just net).  \n\nThe workers probably wear the harnesses so they can say they are wearing the harnesses.  They never ever connected them to any kind of safety cable or even ran one.\n\nI noticed the ground skips a rail, also.  Technically, it's connected to the panel which is connected to the same panel.  Then it goes to the next row of panels.  \n\n&gt; PVC directly on roof surface, strapped with no flashing, really? \n\nThey plugged the holes with silicone.  Flashing probably should be used.  Again, I'm not an expert.\n\nIt was installed in 1.5 days, or about 12 hours total.  The crew started on the bad rainy day.  Six guys!  They said my install was \"small\".\n\nThe inverter warranty is 12 years.  I don't believe in paying for extended warranties.  You're always better off saving the money for a repair and likely never needing it.  \n\nIn 12 years, I could easily be looking at an upgrade as I already determined I would need about another 3kWs to offset the electric bill my future Tesla/EV purchase will add to my electric usage.",

Not have it so that if you put panels on your roof, you don't get a tax credit, but if solar city puts those same panels on your same rooftop, they do get the credit. That's insane.",

That's why I referred to it as an outlier.  SmartEV also has Bosch motor IIRC, so that adds (small amount) to their motor unit sales output.\n\n&gt; Can't say oh, not enough data to decide if Bosch is good/bad for BEVs.\n\nI think the unit sales info was good for showing they at least can deliver non-trivial volume of drivetrain components along with integration of *3rd party cells.*\n\nCheaper cell pricing would be available from direct purchase (LG/Samsung/Panasonic, etc.)  Bosch would like to get into that I'm sure, but they aren't there yet, so betting on them delivering is higher risk than established volume cell vendors (esp. w/ cells being high vehicle cost driver.)\n\nIf Bosch integrated units (to Fiat) are particularly high (from CEO claiming to lose money per car), that can imply cost inefficiencies/premium; but, as I said, Porsche can maybe just eat that and pass it down to customers by virtue of being a upper-premium brand and that the \"COGS\" may have (standard car industry unlike Tesla or tech industry) R&amp;D cost amortized into each car (which lowers gross margin but inflates net income (http://seekingalpha.com/article/2790765-the-truth-about-teslas-gross-margin) ).\n\nMercedes spent €0.5B to make their own pack integration facility (using 3rd party cells) ostensibly for cost savings.  Bosch doesn't have mass cell manufacturing capability (AFAIK) historically or at the moment.  Porsch/VW can go w/ establishing internal pack manufacturing (to avoid any potential Bosch middleman markup --assuming no loss leader sales padded by other component sales) and get cells directly in volume from Panasonic.  The article noted Bosch has ostensibly higher cost disadvantage than Panasonic but while also having locality advantage (being nearby).\n\nI have no doubt of Bosch component prowess.  Only the overall value proposition (of entire EV) to Porsche is not clearly in its favor and is undetermined from perspective I described here and above IMO.\n\n_____\n\n[edi1] rewote 1/2B as €0.5B to disambiguate.",

"comment": "Evidence the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt has no DC quick charging:\n\n~~1.  Neither Mary Barra nor Pamela Fletcher mentioned it in their interviews or presentations.~~\n\n2.  The new Chevy Bolt website shows a J1772 plug and describes an 'Available 240V AC charger' for home use.\n\n3.  The current and charging rates described by Chevrolet on the new Bolt website are consistent with 240V AC with either 6.6 or 7.2 kW chargers and a 60 kWh battery.\n\nEvidence the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt has DC quick charging:\n\n1.  Mary Barra said in her CES introduction [at -7:30 on the Facebook video]:**\"Thanks to a DC fast charging system, the battery can charge to 80% of capacity in only 60 minutes**, or to 100% overnight using the 240 volt charging system.\"\n\n2. GM has been widely understood to plan DC quick charging using the SAE CCS Combo standard.\n\n3. GM is a principal member of the SAE CCS Combo standards committee.\n\n4.  The photograph of the Bolt on the new official website in the \"Charging\" section shows a charge port door big enough for a CCS Combo connector, and appears to show an orange flap or plug over the DC parts of the connector in the car.\n\n5.  GM's partnership with Lyft (if they intend to lease them Bolts) suggests the car is meant to be in service all day, not just charged at home overnight by a commuter.\n\n6.  Chevy's 2014 Spark EV has SAE Combo DC quick charging as a $750 factory option.\n\nIt's possible they'll add it as an option when they go on sale, or discuss it in detail next week at the NAIAS.\n\n~~It's equally possible that they'll come up with a confusing excuse and that the slow chargers are GM's way of sandbagging the Bolt.~~\n\nI don't know why their website manages to omit details on DC fast charging.   Apply Hanlon's Razor as necessary.",

So I would need 7.2 kW of solar for $14,284 after all installation costs and tax credits. $1.98 per watt seems to be my break-even point assuming that electricity prices do not go down and my usage does not go up. Anything above that price and I would be better off just investing money in the stock market. Is $1.98 per watt a reasonable price after installation? \n\n| Month | kWh | Cost | $ / kWh |\n|:----|----:|----:|----:|\n|Jan|1111.3|100.33|0.0902|\n|Feb|910.7|85.21|0.0935|\n|Mar|869.6|80.83|0.0929|\n|Apr|901.9|82.37|0.0913|\n|May|1218.1|106.68|0.0875|\n|Jun|1208.2|104.93|0.0868|",

Other ~80-mile BEVs may have similar issues in the cold or high speeds but tend to be less prone to battery capacity loss.",

"comment": "Its only wasteful to an extent. The volt allows you to use the engine to recharge the battery, but again, only to an extent. \n\nAs the Volt is a series configured vehicle, which means the engine powers a generator which charges the battery which powers the electric motor, its actually efficient to use an electric motors awesome torque to take off, then fire the engine and let it idle, providing just enough power to maintain a battery charge while cruising easily down the highway. The battery never charges up, though, or depletes, it remains at the same percentage. this is what the Volt's Hold mode does.\n\nMany non-plug in hybrids work the same way; using the electric motor to silently take off with good torque, then idling the engine to maintain the electric power. The only difference is that because the battery is smaller and cant be plugged in to be recharged, the engine will run at a higher RPM when you give the car more throttle so it provides more electricity to the motor.\n\nSo, my point is, to explain to you that, it IS efficient to let an engine run to charge a battery that powers an electric motor, instead of using one or the other, which is what the Volt wants you to do. Thats how non plug in hybrids work, and it gets you great gas mileage.",

"comment": "BMW doesn't publish statistics, but it's pretty widely reported on blogs (inside EV, bmwblog, wikipedia) that the ratio was 3:2 rex:bev in 2014, and that it has flipped with the new 2017 33kwh model that came out last year.  It looks like the numbers are similar for europe.  So it's probably not quite 50%, but the BEV isn't a tiny share either.\n\nThe rex version of the i3 actually takes some useful things away from the car.  The biggest one is that it doesn't have a heat pump for heating and instead uses resistive heating, because the gas tank takes the space of the heat pump.  I'm not sure how you'd like to use the space where the engine goes on the rex, it has an axle running down the center of it.  They could move the electric motor to the middle on the bev version just to make the space look better used.  \n\nIn 2014 there weren't any other designed as an EV from the ground up cars from a major manufacturer available besides the Tesla and i3.  The Leaf is a highly modified Versa, and everything else was basically a compliance car (often nice ones).  It's nice that things are changing with the Bolt and other cars that are coming out now.",

That's a pretty large market.\n\nMaybe that's why the UK in particular has seen these efforts to install charging points in lamp poles.\n\nAnyway, it's large, but the point is, the rest of the market is 57%, let's say there's a 50% market share for EVs, given they become cheaper, with no organized effort - public or private - to install street-side charging. That's still a huge market, plenty to bring EVs to maturity.\n\nOnce that market share is reached, there will be EVs and plug-ins of every kind of model. Lots of the people who can't charge at home will have plug-ins. There will be huge opportunities to make money on charging. That's when street-side charging will become ubiquitous",

As much as Solaredge is going to give you better outcome, you’re paying 100 extra per module for the optimizers. \nGo with a delta - they’re compatible with the 330’s if you’re worried about price. \n\nPlus you’ll be paying an up charge on the 330W modules for a 5watt increase. Unless you’re getting 60 panels, you’re really not buying much more. \n\nGo with the 310’s if you’re worried about price.\nGo with the 315’s if you’re worried about looks. \nIf you really want “sleek” go with the 315 LG black on black modules. \n\nThe new Tesla hardware far outweighs the iron ridge hardware. Why would you pay more for all of the panels and inverters and go cheap on the way the mounting hardware looks? \n\nEdit: if you’re only using 20 modules, 1 solaredge inverter is twice the price of any other inverter. \n(2,000 inverter/2000 optimizers, vs 2000 for a Delta or ABB)",

There really aren't any offroad worthy EVs available right now and it's probably a few years until Rivian can start delivery. Mercedes SUVs have been historically been good offroad, so could be an opportunity to tap into the truck/offroad market if the range is worthy.",

As does Hydunai, Mercedes, VW (+ the rest of the company), Toyota, Honda, Ford, Mazda, Volvo etc. etc.\n\nWe can talk about all the \"amazing potential\" of Tesla's system all we want (and I simply refuse to believe anything that comes out of Elon's mouth in regards to that at this point .. we were supposed to get level 3 last year, than Q1 this year, and yet we still haven't even experienced a prototype) but right now, as it is, Tesla's autopilot is an ordinary driver assistance program marketed with a lot of fancy words (and negligence because Tesla has way more leeway with costumers when it comes to potential PR desasters, e.g. crashes).",

If you threw koalas into a monoculture forest without eucalyptus trees, they'd die.  If you threw pandas into a forest without bamboo, they'd die.  If you cut down every tree in a forest and then planted new ones all at the same time, woodpecker birds wouldn't be able to search for grubs in the dead wood of older trees.  If you took away fruiting trees, pollinating insects wouldn't have anywhere to feed in that forest.  I could do this for days.\n\nNot to mention the fact that switching the world from gas to electric will save \\*\\*\\*far\\*\\*\\* more animals than are displaced by this factory.\n\nYour view seems very myopic.  Every factory on Earth required land to build, and I seriously doubt that they agreed to replace the cut trees 3x like Tesla did.  And I seriously doubt those factories are helping to save our planet instead of contribute to its decline.",

By a lot. This is fine: carmaking is hard, especially when it's a new technology and they were a small company. There were lots of manufacturing issues/defects and supply issues when they finally did reach their milestones. Again, not great but not unexpected either. Carmaking is extremely hard to do.\n\nAll the Tesla fanboys used this as proof that Tesla was committed to EV because they were sticking through all of their problems, etc.\n\nFast forward a few years later: All the large automakers have EVs coming out, but supply is constrained, or they are also running into issues and releases are being pushed back. According to the same people, this is clear proof that the automakers aren't serious, that they don't actually want EVs and are just dragging their feet and hoping Tesla goes away, etc.\n\nI see that kind of double think almost exclusively with Tesla fanboys.",

"comment": "I had the same thoughts when Newsom first made the announcement. Electric power generation and distribution are huge weaknesses for California.\n\nAs it currently stands, California imports 1/3 of the electricity it uses. It has two power generating stations under construction, both are gas fired, and both are to replace existing generating stations. It has approved but not started construction on two more plants, one is a hybrid gas fired and solar thermal plant, and the other is solar thermal. Neither of them will come close to making the state energy independent based on it's current consumption, much less the substantially increased consumption it would have if all vehicles were rechargeable electric.\n\nThe state currently has to shut down power to districts in a rotating fashion, a tactic known as \"rolling blackouts\", when the demand on the grid is too high. This is caused primarily by increased air conditioner use on hot days. Bear in mind that a typical electric car charging station draws about twice as much power as a typical residential central air conditioning unit.\n\nThe state has recently begun ordering \"rolling blackouts\" on windy days. This is because high tension transmission lines are not insulated (no type of insulation would be effective at 350KV). Wind can cause the transmission lines to come close enough to arc, producing sparks. Since California no longer maintains the forests and grasslands beneath these transmission lines, a spark can start a wildfire. Did you get that? Because the state refuses to clean up the area beneath high tension transmission lines it must shut down power to entire cities in order to prevent wild fires.\n\nYet, the governor has ordered the sale of fossil fuel powered cars to end in 15 years.",

Start saving money now so when this happens you have the money set aside to build your dream collection.  10 years after the market tanks it will probably double or triple in value so it's a good investment.

However if you're looking for a hatchback/CUV style SUV I think it's still sort of a competitor, given that there's nothing really directly in the same size class. Everything else I can think of for sale now is either bigger or smaller except for the XC40 Recharge, and I doubt many people are cross-shopping those two. (plus the XC40 has a [lot less headroom](https://www.edmunds.com/car-comparisons/?veh1=401852746&amp;veh2=401874639) despite being taller) I would expect most people to size up if they wanted something other than the Niro in the same class, rather than sizing down.",

"comment": "They are providing a service. But this is not happening altruistically. They are arbitraging solar households power. How it works is you generate 1 kWh of excess power and roll it onto the grid. You receive a credit of 28 cents. The utility sells that 1 kWh of power to your neighbor for 28 cents (with significantly less transmission loss than sending your neighbor power from a gas peaker plant that is not in your backyard). Then at night you need power. The utility provides you 28 cents worth of power, but it only costs them 4-7 cents to pay for the generation and transmission. And they didn’t have to pay for your solar installation. So they netted a profit of 21-24 cents per kWh on your power. \n\nAs to your second point, I do know a little about grid infrastructure and engineering and that is totally false. The problem comes down to a lack of utility planning and old fashioned greed. There has been a million rooftop solar mandate since the Governator was in office. They have had about two decades to build out grid scale storage and incentivize the installation of home batteries that can be networked into Virtual Peaker Plants. They could have gotten creative with pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed air, or liquid air storage solutions to solve the duck curve problem and any intermittency that could threaten the grid. As we have seen in South Australia’s Tesla Megapack system, it is stupidly cost effective and really helps modernize and stabilize the grid. \n\nThe reason we are in this situation is that the utilities were allowed to take over a grid that was paid for with tax dollars in the 1930-50s. They were charged with maintaining and modernizing it, as well as to serve customers with reliable power. But they decided to put off upgrades and pocket the money as profits. And then you have wildfires started by utility negligence when parts that haven’t been replaced in 90 years weirdly fail. And then there are liabilities from that. So they have to raise rates. California has some of the most expensive utility rates in the country but it is not because of rooftop solar. \n\nAnd even if the utilities got everything they wanted in NEM 3, they are still going to raise rates by double digit percentages this year, next year, and the year after.",

But that's the age that lined up with my budget so it wasn't an issue.\n\nIf I can't find reliability, I'm also willing to accept repairability. My second biggest fear is having an issue and being blocked from fixing it or buying parts.\n\nI figure at least Hyundai replaced engines under warranty, will happily sell parts, and won't block anything from working after it has been DIY repaired. \n\nTldr: While not known for reliability, at least they’re not Nissan or FCA, or anti-repair as Tesla, so I’m willing to give them a shot.",

"comment": "Sorry, but there’s no way you don’t use cabin heat at temperatures below 15C/60F. The windows need to be de-fogged too…\n\nTemperature control is a REALLY complex process in an EV…… there’s no publicly available detailed data AFAIK.\n\nBottom line my car uses up to 5kW to heat whatever needs to be heated. I can easily see that on my charger.\nMy 2017 car is an older one. Heating and cooling are still separate systems. The 5kW heat that’s used is generated by a resistance heater (PTC element). The PTC has a (bad) COP of 1 by definition = 1kW of electricity is converted into 1kW of heat. It also doesn’t scavenge waste heat. That means this is about as bad as it can get in sub 15C/60F weather. My range takes a big hit at anything below that.\nUsing resistance seat heaters and limiting cabin temperature helps a bit but comprises comfort too much for my liking.\n\nA new Tesla (yes, they are the benchmark here) has a well implemented heat pump, these have a variable COP 4-1. At moderate temperatures it generates 4kW of heat for 1kW of electricity! Below -15C (5F) the COP has dropped to 1. \nBut that’s not all! It has 1 fully integrated thermal system and superb thermal management software. Heat can be “produced” by the heat pump, if needed by resistance heating (using motors out of sync) and is also scavenged from ANY(!) part producing waste heat.\n\nIn this situation the energy consumption for heating is a really complex equation:\n\n\t• heat demand from the battery pack\n\t• heat surplus from the battery pack\n\t• heat demand from the cabin\n\t• heat surplus from other car parts (motors, cpu, pumps, ….)\n\t• the COP of the heat pump\n\t• the need for using resistance heating\n\nAt moderate temperatures (limited heat demand) and highway driving (drive train & battery produce waste heat) the heat pump will easily be at a COP of 4. Meaning it uses less than 1kW for heating where my car will use ~3kW. The air density increase is limited too, limiting air drag resistance increase/increase of the energy needed to drive.\n\nSo a GOOD thermal management system with a heat pump & integrated thermal system in an EV DEFINITELY limits energy consumption for heating in the 0-15C (30-60F) range.\n\nThings start falling apart somewhere below that. The temperature difference between outside air & inside demand gets bigger. That means the pump in heat pump needs to transport more heat = pump runs at higher revs = more electricity consumption = COP drops. The heat produced by the battery pack from driving is also no longer enough to keep the pack warm AND deliver heat to the thermal system. So your supply gets more costly & demand increases….. at the same time air density is now increasing significantly, increasing energy demand for driving too…. Combine that with colder batteries being unable to release all the electric energy stored in it and you get the picture….\n\nUnfortunately, in freezing cold temperatures there’s not even a theoretical way to rescue range in an EV. Below -15C/5F range will always drop 30-50%.",

On average, I'd say gasoline-powered cars do 25mpg and EVs do 100mpge, so EVs are 4x as efficient. i.e., EVs require 4x less \"fuel\" but the \"fuel\" costs 1.5x more.\n3. **How much you actually drive** \\- for a realistic savings total.\n\nI used [this calc](https://gasvselectriccalculator.com/) to compare specific ICEVs and EVs and the savings are definitely higher for some cars than others and vary from state to state. There's also maintenance costs, different rates of depreciation, etc. but in terms of driving costs, this sums it up.",

Best vacation car ever.\n\nI'm on course to have 30k miles on my model Y by the time it's 2 years old. My commute to work is 22 miles round trip, and I work 3 x 12... so massive amount of road trip miles.\n\nWe also road trip with 2 MTBs on the back, which cuts our range to about 190 miles, going 70-75. It's all good and dandy, and we never have problems charging or finding chargers. Getting used to going low is fine. You seriously have plenty of range, even under 10%.\n\nWe also camp out of the car and usually not at a campsite or with electricity nearby. I'd say 25% of the time we're at a campsite or charging while sleeping. \n\nBest decision ever, we're looking into getting a 3rd one... a model x to camp out of. The price just needs to be a little more realistic.",

Supersonic flight was a boutique novelty, was like 10x more expensive than regular jets, noisy, burned fuel like mad, the planes were small, and the time savings over were not enough to justify all those things for trips most people took once a year or less. \n\nEVs are better than gas vehicles in almost all respects, cost is like 1.5x more, and people use their cars daily. \n\nIt just doesn’t make sense as an analogy.",

My brother on the other hand bought a 3 year old BMW and has had a ton of issues with electronics already.\n\nI still don’t think that battery tech/electric car tech is the same thing as basic interior electronics, and so I wouldn’t give them credit there per say. But I do think that the Japanese cars are reliable in more ways than just their ICU engines.\n\nWith that said, I personally wouldn’t make any large investment ($10k+) into something that hasn’t been proved out. The fact that they’re so late to the game, and have such a mediocre performance tells me this is more of a business requirement check box and less of a performance oriented innovative car. Would rather buy another electric car with better tech.",

I ask this because you might get sold a big system that can 'theoretically' post huge numbers, but you've also got a big tree that might cast a long shadow later in the day, and during the winter, lord knows you won't be producing like you are in the summer. Check to see if they provide any performance guarantees, and how they 'make it right' if they oversell you on a system. I know some companies do this, so if you're leery that they were just trying to sell you the biggest system possible, get a quote from another provider like Sungevity or SunRun. I know Sungevity will give you a guaranteed system efficiency quote (ie - \"We guarantee you will produce enough solar power to take care of 98% of your utility bill\"), so if they oversell you, they'll make up the cost for your system's under-performance.

"comment": "Well, if you use steel truss beams, that would involve 2-4 beams across your roof, and the ends of the beams would sit on the perimeter. The normal panel hardware could then be attached to those beams with metal screws at the mount points, or clips -- metal roofing hardware for this stuff is common among roofers and solar installers. The beams would be attached to the load-bearing perimeter parapet of your roof with similar hurricane strapping and screws. Whatever contractor or engineer does this for you can easily specify the hardware.\n\nIf you're doing this yourself on a house you're uncomfortable making major structural modifications to without engineering advice, you've painted yourself into a corner, there are no off-the-shelf products designed to solve this problem. It would be a very cool product though, and someday someone will probably invent it, like building a deck that floats over a flat roof bearing only on four non-descript columns positioned around the perimeter of the existing house. Minimum change to get a whole new, structurally independent story on the house. Good idea, doesn't exist at a consumer pricepoint.",

"comment": "What you are missing and leaving out just as the power company is leaving out is that even before the change there were fees associated with being on the grid.  So the solar customer paid several service fees for the pleasure of using the grid as a battery.   Afterwards they increased the fees pretty drastically which was unreasonable.   There have been many reviews of nv utilities and every other state with net metering, showing that the PV customers are still an advantage to the nonpv customers and the utility.   \nYour statement that Nevada non customers finance PV is simply inaccurate.",

There's a good blog article debunking a lot of what Ferroni and Hopkirk are saying in that paper: https://matter2energy.wordpress.com/2016/05/17/another-pv-eroei-debacle/\n\nHere's the lede:\n\n&gt; &gt; Solar panels will produce only 0.83 times the amount of energy they take to produce… If correct, that means more energy is used to make the PV panels than will ever be recovered from them during their 25 year lifetime.\n&gt;\n&gt; That’s a big if. And guess what, it’s _not_ correct.\n\nHe's gone on to address the issues raised in the paper and I encourage you to read the retort to form your own opinion.",

Reasons this won't work: \n\n1) You can put something on the order of 1 MW on an acre of land, at a cost of around $1 million. If your land costs are a signficant portion of that, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG. \n\n2) Anything with a \"Prove Einstein Wrong\" DIY link has a hell of a burden of proof, to put it mildly. Enough that I didn't bother clicking. If you treat light as a wave it will act like a wave, but it shows up in quantized packets of specific energy. This is known. If PV panels don't work then neither will the computer you work on. Semiconductor physics is pretty fucking well understood. Not by the Instructables guy, obviously. \n\n3) You're offering 3x the output from 6x the cells. That's not a particularly cost-effective move. \n\n4) It is also worth considering the Shockley -Quessier [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit). You're going to run out of high-energy photons if you do this.  Unless of course you want to start fights with TWO Nobel Prizewinners today.",

All plants currently on the drawing board in Western countries have massive state support – the new Hinkley Point nuclear plant approved in the UK is to have feed-in tariffs higher than what Germany pays for solar power in addition to state guarantees for bank loans;\n5.the limited availability of uranium resources; and\n6.the incompatibility of inflexible nuclear baseload power with fluctuating wind and solar.\nThe third risk of radiation from nuclear waste is even greater because it will be passed on to future generations, who will not be able to consume the nuclear power we produce today but will be forced to deal with our waste. Even when all of our nuclear fission plants have been shut down globally, mankind will have to protect its repositories of spent nuclear fuel rods for up to 100,000 years.",

You pay for the NET consumption at the end of the month and in many cases you can carry over production forward for a period of time, usually 12 months.  \n\n&gt; Some pay out at a reduced rate, others don't.\n\nWell not any more.   You get retail value for NET generation but the excess generation over consumption is called NEG (Net Excess Generation) which pays out at avoided cost rates or not at all.  Avoided cost rates are wholesale, and some utilities will not pay for any NEG on a net meter account.\n\nIn the US NET metering is structured this way to prevent there being fees, and taxes associated with actually paying for the power generated.  This would make the value much less than retail.   \n\n&gt;  For instance in Ontario Canada when they first started solar contracts they were actually paying MORE then retail for the net power\n\nNo they paid a FIT or Feed IN Tarif as an incentive.    Often FIT incentives and other incentives of this nature have the system size limited to 110% of annual average consumption as well.\n\nFIT and NET metering are two different things.  FIT is an application and contract (in Ontario 20 year) with different financial issues and are as you pointed out fairly uncommon.\n\nFIT does NOT mean that it is more than retail.  There are several programs in the US and many municipal and coop (not usually governed by state NET metering laws) that offer FIT contracts at below retail.\n\nhttp://www.hydroone.com/Generators/Pages/NetMetering.aspx\n\n&gt; Excess generation credits can be carried forward for a consecutive 12 month period to offest future electricity costs.\n\nhttp://www.hydroone.com/Generators/Pages/Distributed%20Generation.aspx\n\nhttp://energyinformative.org/net-metering-feed-in-tariffs-difference\n\nThe sum is that other issues limit the size of the array in most locations to be interconnected to little more than annual average consumption.   Net metering pays wholesale or not at all for NEG, FIT and other incentives like SRECs vary widely but often have limits as well as the interconnection limits.",

Electrons ocellate at various frequencies, including ranges in the photonic spectrum, including visible spectrum.\n\nAtmosphere filters out the higher frequencies, basically by absorbing it. Lower frequencies are absorbed or reflected by the magnetosphere or ionosphere.\n\nBut... light is radiation. Infrared is the colour of hot metal, and eventually the metal turns red. This colour you're seeing is radiated from the metal. Look in a toaster.\n\nDoes the sun's only job affect solar power, well, yeah, because it's how it works! :)",

"comment": "Ford is pushig hybrids for the F truck line and one of the advantages is that they internally have a generator onboard.  Think of how many working pickup trucks have generators lurking in the beds.  Also, those little generators are dirty as hell, while the emissions from the truck's ICE is vastly better controlled.  They also gain the ability to \"idle\" the generator without needing the engine actually running.  Those advantages all carry over to your RV scenario.  Lastly, you have almost all the electrical infrastructure (batteries, management, inverters) needed to add solar panels for boondocking.  Conserving fuel is important when you're in the middle of nowhere.\n\nBe mindful though, the first time an RV owner has to pull over while climbing a mountain just to get the battery charged up enough to continue is probably the last time they'll find the system acceptable.  The engine will have to be sized to deal with that as the worst case scenario.  You'll need manual control on the charging so that you can ensure the batteries are full before starting an ascent.\n\nOne concern though is weight.  EV drivetrains are heavier and RVs are usually right up against the edge of 26000 lbs.",

The first link below is for a lantern that's charged with either the built in solar panel or via USB.  These are pretty popular among campers and van dwellers.  I think 2 or 3 of these should be sufficient.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Rechargeable-Collapsible-Flashlight-Emergency-Water-Resistant/dp/B00YH0ZFIQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517707187&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=solar+lantern&amp;psc=1\n\nIf you are running other things that require AC power (like TV or laptop charger), then you could get a portable power pack.  If this is a 1 or 2 day festival, then you could probably get by without even recharging it.  But if you have access to an AC outlet, then you can recharge it that way or if you really want, then get a solar panel but I think it's unnecessary unless you plan on doing this at festivals in the middle of nowhere with no power.\n\n[Goal Zero Yeti (more expensive)](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Zero-Portable-Generator-Alternative/dp/B00CWBABRM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517707564&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=solar+generator)\n\n[Harbor Freight Power Pack (cheaper)](https://www.harborfreight.com/5-in-1-portable-power-pack-with-jump-start-62747.html)",

He exclaimed “that's why sun power is better.”\n\nThat's quite ridiculous, and possibly a scam. There's no reason why a quality non-SunPower panel should be brittle like that.",

"comment": "Net metering is at retail rates but is only valid up to your consumption.   Above your consumption is called Net Excess Generation.   Some states will let you carry this forward for usually a year (some only a month) on your books to help even out Annual consumption.  \nThe problem comes after the year at what is called true up.  The NEG is paid out at WHOLESALE rates (or not at all in some states).  Wholesale rates are about 1/3 - 1/4 retail and thus not very financially viable.   KW installed beyond what is required to zero your bill have the least ROI.  It is generally best to size to 110% of consumption to allow for future growth and/or degradation.",

"comment": "The fuel savings alone from moving to electric afforded a roof top solar array in less than three years time. Now I pay less than $80 per year with all the home charging I do. Screwing over exxon and Duke energy is worth the entry cost, imo. Note we started out with all cheap used vehicles (sub-12k) before committing to buying brand new (considerably more efficient and functional) ones. I keep the original fleet long enough to meet my expected ROI, then refreshed. I myself drive 30-40k/yr, savings add up fast (average for area is 22,400/yr).",

Hurricanes are pretty self-explanatory, as many systems are rated for, say, category 3 hurricanes, but Florida and North Carolina are often hit by these types of hurricanes--and stronger. Traditional solar arrays basically just become big sails w/ strong enought winds. Telsa's \"Solar Roof\" tiles may help, but they're way too expensive right now. Creatures range from squirrels to bugs to birds nesting under the equipment--requiring specific \"pest abatement\" measures.",

"comment": "These are fundamental solar system variables. All of them affect performance, because solar panels generate electgricity by facing the sun. the optimium conditions would be to always face the sun using a tracker. This is usually cost prohibitive for a residential system.\n\nIf your panels are on the north side of a 12/12 roof at a northern latitude, they will rarely have enough light to generate electricity. Too, tilt impacts the amount of electricity you generate because the more you lay south-facing panels flat, the more light will bounce off the surface of the panels, making it unavailable.\n\nYou will see more sun on your east facing roof in the morning than in the afternoon. You will see more sun on your west facing roof in the afternoon than in the morning. This is called azimuth, the direction a roof faces. The closer it is to true south, the more electricity it will generate.\n\nLook up some solar electric system basics from NREL (the National Renewable Energy Lab.",

"comment": "After federal incentives, I paid around $2.1 per watt in Los Angeles California. You are quoted around 31700/11160 = $2.8 per watt. The price may be a tad bit high, but not totally unreasonable.\n\nAnother thing to consider, if you do get an electric car (like we did) our solar installer said it will consume around 10-12 kwh a day. Our real world driving came to 12.5 kwh per day.\n\nFinally, we found that our bill changed drastically after the solar company was done and our utility was contacted. It sounds like different companies and states handle it differently, but for us, each kwh went from 23c per kwh to time of use. The price is now 29c from 8am to 4pm, 47c from 4pm to 9pm, and 31c from 9pm to 8am. Also, each consumed kwh is 2c, regardless of time. Produced electricity is now, as you see, the cheap stuff. All this to say, utilities are encouraged to find ways to not make your bill zero.",

"comment": "I can tell you now I have 2 Powerwalls with a 4 ton 20 seer Trane variable speed unit.  If we don't run hot water or cook on the Powerwalls that they only last till about 9am tops.   They are 2 years old now, so that could change.   I could raise the temperature of the AC to make them last longer, but even with my unit the Powerwalls get drained.  Unfortunately for me I have a large live oak that blocks the panels until about 10am, and really I need for it to be around 11am to be able to charge the Powerwalls and use the AC again.\n\n\nI need to talk to my brother in law for that because if I could do it all over again I would have gotten 3 Powerwalls minimum, and maybe even 4 just to really future proof it.  I'd of also have gotten the solar credit with them, and now won't be able to in the future.\n\n\nI'll be changing my water heater hopefully later this year, or next at the latest to a hybrid one.  I kinda want a solar one, but I have too much stuff on my roof already, lol.   I think a hybrid will be a huge upgrade over my 13 year old water heater.  That'll really help offset my energy usage even more.",

"comment": "This happened to me. I was in the market for a vehicle last year. Had originally always wanted a Tesla, but with all the crap he's been saying over the past few years and my awful experience with choosing Tesla for my solar panels I said nope. Ended up purchasing a Kona EV. Loved the car so much I got a second, although wish I had waited for the Ioniq 5 or EV6. The polestar 2 looks really good as well. I stayed away from VW as well with the diesel gate scandal, but had looked at the Bolt and Mach-E at the time too (the latter was almost impossible to find). Still very happy with my choice as I often average 5-6mi/kwh in my mostly city/suburban driving.",

I contact my solar installer and told them what was being proposed and they reached out to other solar companies in the area to draft an expert opinion. It worked. The town then drafted more common sense rules based on expert's opinion.\n\nRemember that often city officials, planning boards, etc don't have experience cenwirh everything and sometimes don't know what they don't know. Getting an expert to weigh in can make all the difference",

I don’t really get what you’re trying to do - whether it’s advocacy or selling or a blog or what…?\n\nBut, I do think a lot of countries are going to look at this war, double down to reduce a reliance on fossil fuels (still a very long journey) and ensure that the grid resiliency and reliance is improved. I think this will show the importance of distributed sources of energy and the need for large, grid level battery storage as well as distributed storage. I know companies have been looking at micro grid options - new sub divisions purposefully built around renewable and battery backup where an entire neighbourhood can operate independently from the grid in power outages (look at BlockEnergy).",

Looking at you Pink Energy!  100% offset is only useful if you have real 1:1 net metering.  If not you should probably go with a system in the 40-70% offset range.  Try to offset the daytime power needs while exporting as little as possible.  Should account for around half your electric needs.  Also I don’t think Powur is their own bank, so check with the lender on the terms and conditions.  Maybe talk to the lender first and make sure that your parents are going to actually qualify for the FITC and how much year one and size the system based on that.   In solar there are diminishing returns when adding more and more panels.  But please do go solar!",

I need to double my battery bank capacity before I consider increasing solar panels. \n\nOther problem is when we have poor sun in winter I could put up 10 times the panels and not produce enough power, I've had days where my 5kw solar array produced less then 0.4kwh. I've had multiple 5 day stretches where my production totalled &lt;10kwh. \n\nIn order to get rid of the generator I would need to spend 10 times what I have on solar and batteries and there is still no guarantee that I wont need a backup generator if we get a couple weeks straight with heavy cloud cover. \n\nIf I double my batteries and solar panels I could cut my generator usage down significantly but even then it will probably take 10+ years of generator fuel savings to pay for it. Any more then double I'll be spending a $1000 to save $10 a year",

"comment": "A huge hurdle in nuclear adoption is (until recently) a lack of standardized, repeatable, 'factory-line' assembly for the components and buildings. The recent push towards smaller 'prepacked' reactors is a step in a good direction, but more development and standardization of nuke plants would go a long ways towards lowering the cost and time allotment.\n\nPretty much every plant is a 'bespoke' project. Certainly some of the components are similar or identical among plants, but there's no standard easy 'template' for the things - unlike something like a factory churning out solar panels, or dozens of wind turbines.\n\nOf course this means someone would have to shell out for the development, for the factories, and someone else would have to subscribe to the model: this means national adoption at the least. As is, nuclear plants tend to be single projects undertaken years or decades apart rather than built all at once, but there's been some recent attempts to move towards pre-made setups, if at a smaller scale with Small Modular Reactors.",

"comment": "Ouch, those seem very high. I am currently getting new quotes myself because the installer I’ve been dealing with wants to do a 7kW system (of Seraphim 415W panels and Hoymiles micro inverters) for $24,690 cash price before federal incentives. I want a smaller system since GA doesn’t do net metering so 100% coverage isn’t worth it without a battery and drives the cost up to $40k, but they keep avoiding it since under 7kW drives the price from ~$3/W to ~$4/W which is absurd.\nAtlanta area\n\nWe had a 5kW system with Heliene panels and enphase micro inverters installed in 2017 on our previous house for $17,450 before federal incentives (that was in FL)",

"comment": "Very helpful. Thank you. I am looking at a VPP program with a local CCA in San Diego. Basically they pay for half my powerwall but in return they can discharge anywhere between 2-4 hours during peak rates back to the grid for 10cents/kWh (roughly 1/6 retail rate). \n\nSo overall curious if I am helping them more or if it will be a fair trade off.\n\nIt’s almost too good of an incentive to not try. My out of pocket for 2 powerwall would be $6k. The other $16k is covered by tax credit ($6k) and CCA purchase credit of $10k.",

"comment": "I, possibly, have a contrarian view.  The Biden tariffs, which affect most solar panels installed in the U.S., are going into effect at the end of this year.  Domestic products are around 15 cents more per watt but come with additional incentives (for commercial +10% tax credit in certain conditions).  \n\nTrump is extremely unlikely to change any existing laws for renewable energy; there are many Republicans that are not opposed to them (and one of his main supporters, Elon Musk).  The solar tax credits (which are the main federal incentive) are on the books for many years to come.\n\nTrump is more likely to incentivize domestic production, which will likely bring domestic costs down.  All in all, I don't see a dramatic shift in pricing in the short term.",

Your options range from plugging some wires into a sheet of glass, using the wind to turn a turbine, using the natural flow of water to turn a turbine or using the heat from the earth to heat up water to turn a turbine.\n\nNuclear combines the worst aspects of hydro, fossil and geothermal power into its costs. Along with other unique problems. You need a massive amount of water for cooling, you need expensive energy inefficient fuel refinement that is monopolized by a few countries, your infrastructure lifespan is cut to a fraction due to radiation embrittlement etc.\n\nFrance literally does not have the economic resources to run their nuclear reactors despite their government trying as hard as possible to support them. Hence why they have lost over 130TWh of nuclear electricity production since their peak in 2005.\n\nIt will never be economically competitive with renewable energy and in order for it to be competitive with fossil fuels we would have to kill the planet with greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLand usage pressures are also entirely fake. If the US and EU replaced their biofuel cropland with solar panels they could provide all of the world's primary energy.

"comment": "I never said I have 0 fuel costs, just very low fuel costs. I'm not saying that I don't ever drive it, I'm just saying that I drive it a lot less than most people. The EV fee is based on annual mileage for most people, but I'm not most people. I own multiple cars, only one of them is EV. The ICEV I use in winter and on rainy days. The gas motorcycle and electric bicycles I use in spring and fall nice weather, and the EV I only use in the summer when it's too hot and I need air conditioning. I don't commute to a job, but go snowboarding a lot in the winter, but in the summer I just swim in my pool in the backyard and use the EV for grocery store runs, maybe home improvement store runs in the spring/fall. Since I make good money, and I work from home so I have no commute, it's mostly not about the cost, it's about burning as few fossil fuels as possible to help the planet. I charge my EV with solar panels, which don't work well in winter or rainy days so I drive my ICEV in those times. It's a bit of both planet helping and money saving, not in the short term but in the long run. Let's say I lose my job and I have no income, but I have stock market money paying my property taxes on my paid off house, and my cars are paid off as well. It would be nice to have 0 fuel costs if I did only drive an EV and charge with solar panels, b/c that's one less bill to pay. But like I said before, it's more the prinicipal of the thing. The federal govt. gives $7500 tax credits for new EVs (my EV is used), and $4000 tax credits for used EVs (I didn't qualify since I make too much money for the used EV credit) and 30% tax credits for solar panels. These are all great incentives to help the planet, meanwhile my state goes and sets up one of the highest EV fees in the nation. It's not about paying my fair share in gas taxes, it's about the state disincentivizing EVs when they should follow the lead of the federal govt and incentivize EVs, this would help the planet more. People who burn fuel in ICEVs should be punished for not switching to EVs, people who use EVs shouldn't be punished for using EVs. If it is about paying my fair share of taxes, then the EV fee should be based on mileage, not a flat fee, just like ICEV fuel taxes are based on the size of the vehicle and how many miles you drive because you'll burn more fuel and thus buy more fuel and pay more taxes on that fuel. The flat EV fee punishes people who drive less, when people should be trying to drive less. All jobs that can be done from home should be done from home (office jobs). People being forced into an office when they can do thier job from home just fine is just nonsense coming from bad bosses who don't know how to manage people remotely. People should also be encouraged to bike to places whenever possible to cut down on driving. IDK, I have financial reasons, but I think it's mostly environmental reasons for choosing an EV (also performance reasons). For instance, an ICEV just as fast as my EV would get terrible fuel economy, so I get to have high performance without worrying about shitty fuel economy.",

Now, they are orders of magnitude more efficient and orders of magnitude less expensive. \n\n\nNow, renewables are a serious alternative to other forms of energy generation. If we had good long term energy storage technology then we could swap to 100% renewables right now. They are just that good",

I just don't see how it is a tenable position to say that killing animals with cars and other technology is necessary while killing animals for food is a luxury. \n\nMy position is that efforts to minimize suffering are to congratulated and all failures to reach the ideal of cruelty-free life are to be met with understanding, regardless of whether the failure occurs with food, clothing, transportation, or any other lifestyle choice.  \n\nOn a practical level, more humility from vegans and a focus on minimization over elimination would likely lead to greater sympathy and participation.",

"comment": "2,301 animals were killed. 8 were adopted. \n\nAre we to believe that -- even if all those animals came in sick and injured enough to need PETA's attention -- that all but 8 were beyond medical care? I've seen a lot of really abused animals with severe medical problems get a second chance. \n\nNow, if PETA is unwilling to run an adoption shelter, fine. But then they should get out of accepting animals and hand those animals over to people who are willing to try to actually save those animals. Even killing shelters have better rates than 97% and there are many more shelters doing much better. \n\nFrancione definitely understands that spaying and neutering are necessary. He has spoken out before for those methods. However, he and I do agree that needlessly killing animals that could be given a loving home is counter to both veganism and animal rights. We owe it to these animals to give them what life they can have. \n\n&gt;Francione surely should question whether the best or most effective use of limited resources is really to do as he suggests and invest PETA's funds in a shelter program.\n\nYeah, because PETA is really known for spending money on only the most important stuff! Here they could literally and directly save the lives of animals. How many veggie porn videos is that worth? But again, if they won't do it, they should step aside and let others do it instead of going out to find and kill these animals.",

But I rarely depended on a cooler (they are a pain to keep up). Here is, mostly how I got by:\n\nI packed dehydrated fruit, granola, cliff bars (or any type of satisfying meal-replacer bar with high protein- you can ever make your own), hearty cereal, bread, peanut butter, jam, whole wheat crackers, nuts, and a couple fruits an veggies to start (not-quite ripe avocados are great)\n\nYou'll probably finding yourself munching a bit more than usual on the road trip- so hearty, healthy snacks are your best friend. For actual meals I usually had sandwiches- pb &amp; j, pb &amp; banana, avocado &amp; tomato (sometimes with cucumber or hummus if I could find small packets).\n\nWhen you stop at grocery stores (or even some of the better-stocked gas stations) you can re-up on fruits and veggies (small quantities at a time), and really any other snacks you may crave. \n\nI would occasionally stop at asian or mexican restaurants. A fall back has been the veggie sub with no cheese from subway (subways are freaking everywhere). \n\n*Bring a couple big water bottles and a few personal-sized ones. You can always refill water for free at gas stations and you'll need to stay hydrated!\n\nAnd congratulations! You're going to have an amazing time!!",

It sounds like a little down the line you could start a business making vegan film (easier said than done). \n\nPersonally I still drive a car powered by fossil fuels. So technically I'm not vegan in that aspect right?\n\n Every other aspect of my life is hardcore vegan. I go out of my way to not kill ants, or spiders, or any being. I want to send hugs and love to all those critters, no matter what my culture taught me about who I should love and who I should squish. \n\nI make a lot of banana smoothies, and sometimes I've found that I may have eaten an ant accidentally, because they love bananas too, and sometimes they are running around having a field day on some tiny part of the banana that was exposed. I'm sure I've accidentally eaten an ant, but I don't think that makes me non-vegan. \n\nAnyways, I hope I didn't stray to far off topic and I hope you don't quit film. This is one of the toughest dilemmas I've read about regarding  our plight to not participate in the suffering and exploitation of animals. Sending you lots of love, congrats on your little one... I'm of the belief that children chose their parents, so I think your little one is excited to start a vegan lifestyle in this new loving, and compassionate family he is about to be a part of!\n\nBlessings and love",

That's something else. I was ADDICTED to those. I've splurged on them once since becoming vegan, but it really is like an addiction. Just stop eating it. There really isn't a good replacement for hot Cheetos, so I just try to stay away from them and eat something else instead. It's hard af still, and I've even considered just being vegetarian just so I can eat hot Cheetos, but the more I think that, the more guilty I feel. Idk if that helped ahaha",

Sometimes that’s fresh fruit, sometimes it’s potato chips, sometimes it’s Taco Bell! I wouldn’t focus too much on calorie counting and tracking, as it has the potential to be obsessive (which is not sustainable) and that is your goal: Sustainability. \n\nRemind yourself when you are tempted to eat non-vegan food. Why are you doing this? This is a very selfless act. If you have to willpower to stick to it for other beings, you are golden. Your spiritual life will benefit from having this type of viewpoint.",

I am not sure what your diet was when you cut animal fats, but if you stay in ketosis eating plants, it should have the effect you want.   I hate keto, I think it is terrible, but it is supposed to be effective for “epis”.  I’m not sure if you are on steroids at all (delatin?) but lowering protein levels can help with excess gum growth.  I knew an epileptic maybe 25 years ago, and she had to keep getting her gums cut.  Details are a bit fuzzy... but it’s just an anecdote anyways.  I do recommend veganism for so many reasons...  health, morality, ecology, economy...  if you can make it work, I think you will find happiness.",

"comment": "Impossible foods said 95% of people who eat their burgers are flexitarian looking to reduce meat consumption. If there aren't convenient options for them to do so they won't do it, otherwise most would have cut meat out by now. I think you vastly underestimate the amount of people that change their eating habits when it takes no effort though. Also it makes the idea of veganism less intimidating to normies as they can see that there are easy quick options everywhere.",

Regular content and engagement are the best way to build subscribers/followers. If you want to do youtube I would suggest doing Instagram and other platforms simultaneously.  Anyway I can't really speak to what content you should make given that I'm not particularly interested in procreation but I think you should still go for it! If you want to get at least 1 sub, feel free to comment or DM your channel, I'm always down to help out another vegan YTer.\n             \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOH!

"comment": "&gt;As long as I'm alive, my comfort is going to come at the expense of something else's discomfort. Even if I'm a vegan.\n\nThis is an incredibly selfish and ignorant viewpoint. The animals suffering is absolutely no different having children suffer. You're own pleasure is not worth the lives of any being. Unless you plan to move alone in the wilderness and homestead you are going to cause suffering. Why maximize it when you could try to do everything possible to lessen it? \n\n&gt;I would assume that they would be in relatively good fortune (it is never fortunate to be born, so fortune is all relative) based on the assumption that you live in a developed nation\n\nWhy would you assume that? What have I said that you could assume I was born in a developed nation? And what would make you assume I was born well off in a developed nation? And what would make you assume that I would continue to be well off in a developed nation? You're making assumptions out of literally nothing. \n\n&gt;Why is a wild animal's suffering of lesser value than that of a farmed animal?\n\nBecause wild animals are bred into existence so people like you could enjoy their suffering. Farmed animals are bred into horrible existence and exploited because you enjoy doing so. The suffering isn't lesser, the cause is higher. \n\n&gt;The wild has absolutely no rules with regards to how animals are treated, and nature is red in tooth and claw. There's no way that the wild can be legislated in order to limit animal suffering, but it is possible to pass legislation to ensure that farmed animals are treated more humanely.\n\nYes because that is natural. Animals should not be farmed, at all, but definitely not like they are right now. Yes, you get it now. We should let nature be natural and stop exploiting animals. \n\n&gt;So animals in excruciating pain and being eaten alive whilst they scream in terror is fine with you, just so long as it is not humans doing it?\n\nYes. As long as they are not being exploited by humans I'm fine with whatever goes on in nature. The issue is the human exploitation. Because, just so you remember, this is a vegan sub. I don't care about animal suffering, I care that people are literally funding it, enjoying it, and cause it grow more each day.",

I support nearly all forms of vegan activism, from standing in grocery markets to pouring fake blood on restaurant floors to debating/promoting veganism online/in-person. I don’t disagree with your point, just the way you went about it. While the feminism I ascribe to lead to me being vegan, I don’t appreciate you trying to shift the attention off of the way women are treated to the poor treatment of animals. I know that women were (and in some places still are) treated like property and animals are treated like property. Just like prostate cancer and breast cancer are both cancers. That doesn’t mean appropriate to take attention off of the one that’s being discussed to the other.",

They tried to accommodate vegans (and, yeah, probably failed) but damn, they did better than 99% of people and were under no obligation to do so. You sound like you're pouting and making the wedding about you. \n\nI'm honestly surprised any vegan would go to a nonvegan (even vegan friendly) event without at least a power bar or something. I would never blindly take nonvegans' word that there would be an appropriate vegan meal-- lots of nonvegans think dairy, egg, etc are vegan so it's better to just always be prepared.",

I think it's healthier to remain a little over weight than to have your weight go up and down.\n\nThese diets sound miserable. My brother is on Keto and he ate almost nothing for thanksgiving. I didn't have turkey but I made vegan green bean casserole, had my aunts salad, and my mom made mashed potatoes without milk. I also had some succotash which I think is the grossest meal ever but I ate it. I think my brother just had turkey. \n\nMy brother wasn't even fat before he started the diet, he was a normal weight but i think he's hitting a mid life crisis. \n\nNext year I'm going to try to make one of the  main dishes from Isa's Holiday cookbook.",
