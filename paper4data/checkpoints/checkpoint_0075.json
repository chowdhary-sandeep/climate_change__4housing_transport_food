"comment": "You could, in fact it's common to do this on commercial buildings where you might be connecting to various distribution panels or cannot have the noise/weight/siting issues of a large central inverter.\n\nThe TL line is a bit overkill for this IMO, as you don't need the extra power plug. There has been alot of development in this general area. Ampt is looking at \"string level optimization\" as an alternate to \"module level optimization\". KACO is focusing on 50kW distributed inverters as an alternate to large central skids. We've found found SolarEdge to be very price competitive with central inverters - at the 480V level. \n\nI had a meeting with a very high level solar industry contact, who was trying to get me back into the central inverter camp. The three main reasons why I like the module-level optimization are 1) increased up-time during \"failure\" events and 2) reducing module mismatch with a strong focus on PID degradation.\n\nOn topic 1, his response was that inverters fail. Central inverter failures are generally panel board failures, and swapping out a panel board on a 500kW inverter is not the same cost as swapping out the entire inverter (which is the common solution for string inverter maintenance). When you look at swapping out all of the string inverters on a 1MW array over its lifetime, then labor costs might catch up to the lost system downtime revenue.  There is some doubt about whether Enphase + others will truly cover the labor cost of the inverter swaps. Enphase may have a 25 year standard life, but DC optimizer + string inverter solutions have standard inverter warranties in the 12 year range, necessitating a swap. He would advocate for not buying the extended warranties, and instead go with the standard warranty w/ a service contract. I think his points were valid - particularly when the 30% tax credit drops out and feed-in-rates reduce. There also seems to be increased cost benefit to his recommendation when system size is 2MW+.\n\nOn topic 2, I freak out over PID burn-in, because I've measured 5% PID degradation on our arrays in the field. This same industry contact mentioned that my brand of commercial central inverter has an issue with excessive PID burn in. I'm still researching if this is true, but it seems to pan out so far. Furthermore, PID burn-in is increased in hot, humid climates - and where we install in Mississippi, our roof is almost always wet in the mornings from dew. Plus it rains all the time and our roof mounted HVAC units produce a ton of water. Lastly, PID is not an issue with frameless modules. We were about to swap to SunWorld frameless modules until the import tariff fudged things up. So in short, my experience that 5% PID degradation occurs in MOST arrays may only apply to my portfolio. Valuing that 5% production or not has a huge impact on whether or not optimizers are worthwhile.\n\nAnyway, my client likes getting the 20 year extended warranty option. So at a price difference of ~4 cents per watt between a 1MW central inverter system w/ 20 year extended warranty  and a 1MW Solar Edge system w/ 25 year warranty + module level monitoring/optimization, I feel comfortable recommending solar edge. We should be building a few more 1MW systems next year, and we'll certainly use the data from the SolarEdge system to determine if we've overvalued PID in our model.",

"comment": "That's really the only way that other manufacturers will ever get into the long distance EV market. \n\nThere are quite a few Chademo chargers out there, but they are only 50kW and not conveniently located next to interstate routes. There are only a few SAE combo chargers which are also currently limited to 50kW max. \n\nMost of the other DC fast charger locations only have one charger per site so if it is full on a busy day you might have to wait 2-3 times as long. Tesla installs their chargers in large banks and can easily add capacity if a station is regularly busy.\n\nNone of the other car makers want to pay for a nationwide or worldwide network of high power fast chargers. And lacking a charging network they can't really build a vehicle that competes with the Model S.",

"comment": "Here are a couple of links, the first one details some of the lithium battery chemistries and the percentage of cobalt used. You can see that the traditional chemistry (LCO) is 60% cobalt which probably makes it unaffordable for automative purposes. However Tesla are rumored to be using Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide which is only 9% cobalt, much better. Nissan/Renault are currently using Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO) which uses no cobalt at all, however they are rumored to be switching to Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) which contains 10-20% cobalt, so probably isn't going to be a cost issue. GM also use LMO.\n\nThe second link is a PDF which attempts to analyze the costs of batteries, but bear in mind that document is from *2009* - much has probably changed since then. In that PDF they state that Tesla are using LCO, which I suppose they did for the Roadster, but are still showing that as been cheaper than the other chemestries. The important point is that it seems to show that the only reason they were cheaper is because of the established *volume* but the actual breakdown of material costs shows a much higher percentage for the cathode (30%!). I couldn't find hard cost percentage for the lithium, but it's my understand the lithium are usually salts in the electrolyte, and the electrolyte makes up 20-30% of the material cost of a typical battery. The cost of the lithium will probably become more significant over time but it does seem apparent that it's not the *main* material cost.\n\nSo my conclusion is that there is a good reason that Nissan/Renault and GM went for the prismatic LMO, because it has ended up being cheaper, the materials are cheaper and all the other costs you can eventually remove whereas material costs you cannot. Tesla have stated they are battery technology agnostic, but it may turn out that they will stick with the cylindrical cells for the Model E if they are using this cheaper Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide chemistry. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not an expert on any of this but since I own a LEAF and intend to continue driving electric vehicles I'm interested in battery technology progress and their costs.\n\nhttp://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/the_high_power_lithium_ion\n\nhttp://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/The%20Electric%20Vehicle%20Battery%20Landscape%20-%20Opportunities%20and%20Challenges.pdf",

Keep in mind those prices are typically quoted before either tax credit (you'd be looking at around $27k after credits) ... but they're still quite expensive.\n\nCCS (J1772 combined charging system) is a DC quick charge system that can deliver 50-100 kW to the vehicle, similar (but not compatible with) to CHAdeMO. It's a DC mode of J1772, which requires a special plug (J1772 normally supports AC only). On plugshare CCS is called \"SAE Combo DCFC\".\n\n\"J1772\" more commonly means J1772 AC charging, which is typically 240V AC supplied to the car's onboard charger at 15-40A (3-10 kW). The car's OBC converts the AC power to DC power to charge the battery correctly.",

It's also based on overpopulation to keep an eager workforce, that can be paid basically nothing for their work or be fired.  It's created the 1% and the atrocity of profit for war... I guess that's enough, except to say that overpopulation is the essential cause of Climate Change ( /r/overpopulation ).\n\nIt's tied to Climate Change by the corporate disregard of human safety, corporate pollution, misuse of resources  and risky environmental destruction (Oil spills, etc), competitive agenda at all costs, and denial of scientific fact.  I personally saw stacks (acres) of leaking barrels of nearly empty oil and kerosene in the Peruvian Amazon, where companies left them to rot, leak, and fester... little rivers of pollution being entered into the Amazon.  Now nukes are trying to get a foothold in Bolivia, which will inevitably lead to more horror.  You seem to not understand how desperate these SA countries are for spending capital, as related to mineral extraction...\n\nAs for Bolivia, the US is famous for poorly treating the 'Banana Republics', and if you are unaware of 'The School of the America's' that trained dictators, snipers and support for OUR policy - then you should investigate that.  But it's things like having a country come in and tell Bolivians that their water, oil, minerals (and government) is not theirs that probably was the icing on the cake.  I'm not surprised that most SA countries find capitalism distasteful...",

You might be able to hot-wire multiple 120v outlets into a higher-voltage charge solution, but you most likely just trip a breaker somewhere.  \n\nIf you are really, really, really lucky, your wilderness route will have some 220v outlets for RVs at campgrounds, or outlets for electric clothes dryers in residential locations. If you can find a high voltage outlet, it's trivial to get a charger that will work with it. You probably want to carry a few adapters, since there's about 4-5 standard plugs for 220v outlets.",

I'm talking about making them. Northern Europe has really good EV/PHEV adoption thanks to gvmt incentives. Tesla has seen great demand in Europe too. It's just that you don't see BMW, VW, Audi or any other Euro giant for that matter making a long range, affordable price EV and risk cannabilizing their other ICE cars. They play the game of \"yes this is the future as you can see from our concepts.\" and give out the image of \"of course we are visionaries thinking about the future\". Whereas all they care about is more sales. For example 80% of BMW i3 sales are new BMW owners. They could have easily made a &gt;40kWh i3 with no REX version. But wait, that would cannabilize other cars. i3 shouldn't change the game, it should focus on utilitarian urban people on BMW's book.\n\nI can go on about this for thousands of words but I'm hoping you get my point now.",

Powerplants do it in dozens of miles away from major population centers.  \n\n&gt;Even with large increases in wind and solar generation, the EIA projects that the nation’s electric generating mix will be just 30% renewable by 2030.\n\nThe EIA [is absolutely hilariously bad at forecasting anything](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/experts-bad-forecasting-solar/).  They have zero credibility in this field.  Excellent up to date information and data, absolute trash forecasting.  It's what they do.\n\n&gt;As for greenhouse-gas emissions, my analysis shows that electric vehicles will reduce them compared to new internal combustion vehicles.\n\nWe didn't need your analysis to know that.  We have a ton of literature on that from [very](https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner) [reputable](https://www.nrdc.org/media/2015/150917) [sources](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920916307933).\n\nLatest data (see 2017 UCSUSA update) shows they are 64% lower emissions in the US currently, with significant improvements every single year.  50-60% is common across Europe.  \n\n&gt;But based on the EIA’s projection of the number of new electric vehicles,\n\nAh, here we go again.  He uses a very pessimistic projection to minimize the benefits as low as possible.  Yes, obviously if EV adoption is low, benefits will be low.  We don't need a consultant to tell us that.\n\n&gt;But based on the EIA’s projection of the number of new electric vehicles, the net reduction in CO2 emissions between 2018 and 2050 would be only about one-half of one percent of total forecast U.S. energy-related carbon emissions.\n\nLet me do some quick estimates to show how ridiculous this is.  Per [this study here](https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner), EV's are 64% cleaner on average.  You can see [emissions statistics I use from the EPA here](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions).  \n\nEven assuming our grid never gets cleaner from here on out ever (absurd, but I'm feeling generous), can we all agree EV market share will hit 10% at minimum at some point before 2050 with a really conservative estimate?  Yes, I assume?  OK, let's do math.\n\nVehicles are 16.2% of total emissions.  We would see slightly over 1% lower total emissions in that scenario, which I feel is extraordinary conservative  He estimated 0.5% reduction of *energy*-related emissions.\n\nLet me use some slightly more realistic numbers.  Over the past 10 years, [electricity emission intensity has fallen by around 1.8% per year](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=31012).  Let's assume the grid gets 30% cleaner over the next 22 years to 2040 (very reasonable imo).  We'll assume EV adoption hits 54% [as Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts](https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/).\n\nIn this scenario, we would have over 6% lower total emissions.  That's pretty good for a sector that produces only 16% of total emissions.\n\n&gt;Most electric-vehicle buyers are far wealthier than average Americans.\n\nHe seemed to forget his analysis here.\n\n&gt;Not only that, the wires and charging stations needed to charge all those electric vehicles will be paid for by all ratepayers, further raising electric rates. \n\nThis is stupid.  Most charging stations are installed by private companies, and occasionally local governments.\n\nThe \"wires\" are paid for in the large electricity bills EV users pay.  He provides exactly zero evidence any of this will result in a rate increase.  \n\n&gt; And third, states should eliminate their various subsidies for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, which are also **paid for disproportionately by the poor**\n\nEvidence, again that poor people are paying for this?",

"comment": "The biggest friction point in AZ IMO is that doing the math on what you can save is not at all simple. Take the demand plans as an example. The demand charge is calculated based upon the highest half hour of energy usage... But you can only download your usage data from SRP in hour blocks. This makes accurately calculating your demand charge impossible. Since the demand charge is the biggest part of your resulting bill, calculating it even a little wrong will cause huge swings in the actual bill you receive.\n\nIt is possible to save with SRP, but it's not easy. generalized guide to each of their price plans:\n\n- TOU export - You should do this if you plan to install a smaller solar setup, will not have a battery and your system has a majority of it's panels facing east/west. West facing is the best setup here so you offset during peak window. Over producing gets you peanuts, 2.8 cents/kWh, but producing during the peak window gets you the equivalent of ~22 cents/kWh.\n\n- Demand plan - Choose this if you have a larger solar array that is intended to generate ~80%+ of your usage and no battery. You will want to figure out ways to lower peak demand, even if that raises over all usage, as demand charges will be the majority of a typical bill. Look into things like demand governors, water heater timers, precooling your house, etc. precooling tends to work well here, assuming you are ok with the large temperature swing, as your panels are likely to be way overproducing in the middle of the day in summer.\n\n- Average demand - Choose this if you plan to get a battery with your solar to ride you through the peak windows. You want average demand so that when weather rolls through and stops your solar from producing for a day or two, stopping your battery from charging, the demand charge you get after would be averaged with all of the 0 demand use days from that month.\n\n---\n\nAssuming that your usage fits within ~12kWh total during the peak window, I believe it makes sense financially after you factor in the SRP $3600 rebate to get 1 powerwall, but just barely. Your payback timeline is going to land somewhere in the 9-12 year range, 10 years being the length of the battery warranty. You get 2 nice benefits from getting a powerwall though, beyond just saving on the demand charge:\n\n1. Your off peak electricity is much cheaper, at ~4 cents/kWh. The 9-12 year payback assumes 'standard' off peak loads and so already takes this into account mostly, but if you have large off peak loads, such as pool pumps, lots of people (hence lots of hot water), EVs, etc. the 4 cent offpeak pricing makes a bigger difference and pushes the ROI closer to the 9 year time period.\n2. You get some degree of blackout protection. During the night in summer, your battery is likely to be very low on charge due to the peak window shaving, but just having a battery will allow your panels to keep producing during the day, and in the spring/fall/winter, due to low typical electrical usage, you will have backup capability then. So you will gain \"free\" blackout protection in the off seasons and partial blackout protection in the summer.",

Tesla does not (yet) sell a CCS adapter in the US, which... Is bizarre, but adds to the fact that Chademo will be around a long time in the US. I have yet to see CCS-only stations. I'm sure they'll pop-up soon enough, though. \n\nIt will be interesting to see how long it actually takes, or if Honda or Toyota, when they finally make a new EV for the US market, continue with their home country standard.\n\nIn any case, maybe the chart will be correct in 10+ years when the stations remove support for aging cars, but it's not correct currently in a couple of areas.",

When they make it to court they often have some merit, though not always. \n\nLawsuits are complex and it’s not uncommon for them to be complicated where entire teams of lawyers are required to navigate it. As a result, the distilled information provided by a media source can often be misleading, intentional or not. Certainly no one in this thread is going to be an expert on the case. \n\nI find it best to let the process work. despite our feelings, the legal system is pretty resilient to sniffing out bullshit.",

Tesla is literally offering a [model Y SR](https://electrek.co/2022/04/12/tesla-launches-model-y-standard-range-employees-specs-price-upgrades/), they’re just prioritizing employees until production ramps up. Not even that but FSD price is always locked in when you place an order. Unless you’re talking about the 1 instance of someone refusing to cancel their order and then losing their place when tesla had to go in and manually remove their order 11 months after they were notified of the model being pushed off. So many things you can learn if you actually research before commenting",

I have a long list of reasons why but a big one is I hate going to a gas station to get gas and by that I hate the process of wasting 10-15 mins having to drive someplace to fill up or make extra time just to fill up the tank.  I would hate it just as much if I had to go DC fast charge all the time. \n\nAdd in cheaper to drive, more fun to drive. It is so much quieter than an ICE. Did I say I don’t have to go a gas station. That single issue alone means if I break even in cost I am happy hell even if I lose a little money on it I call it a win. \n\nNow days I honestly loose track of gas prices even though I have to fill up my other car once a month or so. My wife is completely oblivious to gas prices as she has not really filled up since Covid hit and it is just me. The EV just made it even lower.\n\nI been following EV tech since the Volt concept car when I was like 18. I am nearly 40. 18 year old me did not want to follow in my father footsteps to become a chemicals engineer and work for the oil industry because I did not see it lasting my entire career so I went a different path. I am all about efficiency. \n\nLastly the environment is not one of the reasons I got an EV. It is super low on the list that even my wife knew I could not put it on it with a straight face. Yes she made me make a list at reasons why as she was a skeptic of an BEV working for us and my reasoning. She is now all on board with going full EV in the next few years or at the very least PHEV.",

Cars not intended to contest in being the most sold or most value for money? The driving capabilities of this car is only superseded by electric cars like Porsche, Etron GT etc - cars that are even pricier and makes even less sense economically. I think there should be a place for different cars for different needs and markets also in the electric world - and there should definitely be a place for the I pace.",

I'll advise getting a bicycle and a bike rack. My routine is to drop off the car at a public charger after work, cycle home and come back a few hours later when it's finished charging.\n\nOn the chargepoint app you can see chargers in a certain area and if you tell the app your model of car it can tell you how many miles each charger gives you in an hour. It'll also tell you the price and it can show locations for non-networked chargers. It won't show all the ones PlugSHare does but it has more information alongside real time availability.",

We had a ~250 mile road trip and the SR+ is supposed to get 263 miles of range, obviously reduced for highway speeds (weather was fine - it was summer). Told the passengers I'd probably have to stop to charge once...ended up having to stop twice on the way and once at the destination. Completely turned my friends off from an EV for now because of all the needed stops for a common sister city-to-city drive in state.\n\nGlad I saw this thread because I've actually got the Lyriq EV on my shortlist to switch to (alongside the Volvo EX30 and VW ID.7).",

This is because the sun shines 24 hours a day during the summer at the North Pole, while at the equator there are only 12 hours of daylight.  The problem with solar power at the North Pole is that for much of the year there are 0 hours of daylight, which decreases annual production - obviously. The reason solar power makes so much sense at the equator, is that there are 12 hours of daylight year-round.  \n\nCalgary, for example, will get more solar output during summer than a tropical location, because summer days in Calgary are 16 hours long. In winter the daylight hours drop to just 8.  A tropical location with constant 12 hour days will get more annual solar energy production.",

"comment": "We routinely use that NASA data set. For a PV installation, you should choose \"Insolation on horizontal surface\" or even better, \"Radiation on equator-pointed tilted surfaces\". DNI is for solar thermal or concentrated PV.\n\nThe tilted surfaces tables will give you rows of tilts (e.g., \"tilt 30\" for PV panels installed with a 30-degree inclination). Choose the one closest to the tilt of your installation. These values are in m2. So calculate the surface area of your solar panels in m2. Since the module you picked has an efficiency of 15%, you can only convert 15% of the inclined radiation values into electrical output. Finally, multiply the total surface area with the tilted radiation values (in kWh/m2/day) and 15% to get an estimate of electrical output in AC. Then pick a derate value to account for DC to AC losses, wiring loses, inverter losses, etc. (such as the suggested 84% derate factor).\n\nPlease note that the values on these tables are for a typical day of each month. So for monthly total kWh output, you should multiply those values with the number of days in each month.  \n\nAs also suggested already, it's a great idea to double check your calculations using an online calculator such as PVWatts.",

"comment": "&gt; For example, burning coal is so dirty that it singularly account for 40% of global CO2 emissions!!\n\nI'd like to see some backup for this because there are a few things that get mixed up when we talk about different sources of global warming gases. For example, often we'll just look at \"energy and transportation\" or we'll only look at CO2. And when we do things like that we end up with over simplistic views of the problem, but when we really dig in to it, it's obvious the problem is much more complex than that. We can't just stop burning coal to cut global warming emissions by 40%. Look at Google's RE&lt;C project that was just stopped because they realized that even if they were successful, it wouldn't be enough. Solar panels and hybrids and  LED lights aren't going to save us.\n\nIf we look at every source of every greenhouse gas, things like our diet start to stand out. It incorporates transportation and fertilizer and the incredibly inefficient process of factory farming. The latest estimate is that 51% of all global warming gases come from eating animal products.\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/michellemaisto/2012/04/28/eating-less-meat-is-worlds-best-chance-for-timely-climate-change-say-experts/",

"comment": "Don't overestimate the value of certificates - you can and should hire the skills you lack. Learn solar design, installation, cost, and economics. That's all you need to do to find employment in this industry. \n\nSolar is not yet mainstream, despite massive growth. The start of mainstream is when solar is included into home mortgage refinances. This hasn't happened yet, because real estate appraisers have lacked \"comps\" to legally determine the market value of installed solar. That's beginning to change in California, and could come within a few years. But to compare the solar early adopters to internet users, we've just begun the \"dial-up\" era.\n\nSolar is 1% of the USA energy supply, but there is no real reason that it couldn't be 100%. Storage can be cheap if it's inefficient, and storage efficiency becomes irrelevant if we're generating vast amounts more energy than what we consume (which solar can easily do for society).\n\nMore realistic is the idea that solar could achieve ~30% market penetration over the couple decades, which is still a very attractive growth rate. That rate of adoption is most likely to occur without subsidies, but more streamlined policies which allow the true value of solar to compete economically with fossil fuel resources. For example, 30 year mortgage lending would be a competitive powerplant funding mechanism against mandatory power plant bonds.\n\nSolar will be a lucrative market for some time. But what about fringe technologies? It depends. I don't think there is anything wrong with focusing just on solar PV. The demand is there. Any additional service you offer should really only be to distinguish yourself competitively. Remember, it might be that a $5 light bulb is a better investment than a $20k solar array. But even if you swap out 100 light bulbs in a home, that's $500 vs $20,000. As the installer, which service do you really want to sell?  A lower margin solar project might still earn you significantly more money for your time involvement. However, I do think diversifying into storage + smart home technology integration is a good idea.\n\nJust keep in mind you don't need to pan for gold to make money off a gold rush. Your best course of action would be to take your current oil industry skills and figure out how to make money with those skills in solar. I did construction management and electrical design in the oil industry before jumping in, and that has served me well.",

However, do countries that allow this have net metering rules which DO benefit the customer?  You say it can only displace power you use during the day. In American states with net metering, you can build a bigger system than you could use during the day and net metering allows you to displace your nighttime electricity usage cost too. Granted, utility companies are trying to end this system because it is losing them money. I'm just wondering if it works that way in your country.",

My average monthly kw/h is around 1400.  Goes as low as 650 up to 2300.\n\nWhat am I looking at price wise for a best effort chance at covering my electric 100% using a grid tie in service to earn credits for the winter months when solar is weaker.\n\nI have a large unshaded south facing roof with minimal slant.\n\nI also want monitoring over my network,  and the ability for my system to power my home during power outages (either with a battery bank for critical appliances and/or just having daytime power through the local grid solar).\n\nI haven't consulted with SolarizeRI contractors yet,  but my own ballpark figure puts it around 30,000-40,000$.\n\nAm I close?  \n\nAlso using say a 180 watt panel,  it says I would need something like 60 of them.  Which may not even fit on the roof.  Are secondary  ground arrays problematic?  Space on the property is not an issue.\n\nHow much of the cost will be installation versus a DIY approach?\n\n(I am prepared to downsize my ambitions but I kind of want my own solar power plant,  I even started to think up names)",

"comment": "Yeah, the savings from inflation alone I thought would make it worth it, plus electricity prices will most likely go up.  I asked about selling the home, we would either have to buy out the contract or have the new owner take it over.  Definitely a good point on the nominal prices, I'll ask them that.  The usage going down part is what is making me hesitate, while I don't expect it to go down, if it did since I only need 3% from the grid then the credit seems almost useless (say $4/month service charge plus maybe another $2/month in electricity, that's only $72/year).   \n\nNot sure if National Grid zeroes the credit, this is from their website:   \"Generally, unused NMC will **accrue on accounts indefinitely (or until they are used)**. In other words, customers with Net Metering Services should NOT expect to receive a check or payment as compensation for accrued NMC.\"",

"comment": "I cant speak for the American rules in general or the state by state ones. But here in Australia (and I suspect its similar). Most systems are grid tied, which effectively means you dont actually use your own solar. What happens is they measure how much power you use from your feed, and how much power you push to the line from your panels. Then they give you an adjusted meter bill:\n\ne.g I used 100 watts but I produced 80 watts from my panels , my bill would be 20 watts (this is called nett metering, there are other types too)\n\nNow as geo38 points out, when the power goes out, your solar panels would still be pushing power to the line which is a danger to linesmen that might be fixing the problem so there are devices installed in your meter box that disconnect the connection to the line for your solar system while power is out.\n\nIn order to make your solar available to you while power is out you need to do a fair bit of system re-engineering to get that to happen which would likely involve changing your inverter and potentially installing a battery storage as well.\n\nIn essence it all comes down to the TYPE of system that was installed at the start and the agreements in place with your local  power distribution company/retailer",

"comment": "Did you leave room for the bolts between the modules?\nDid you leave the code required setbacks for your area?\n\nSunpower modules cost considerably more and only sell to their registered installers.  This is a protectionist distribution method.   They don't sell to any distributors.\n\nSolarDesigntool includes old no longer manufactured modules and only adds new ones when requested by installers.\n\n&gt;  Are all panels equal at their rating?\n\nNo many are larger.   There is no standard size either.   If you are trying to have the most wattage in a small area then you want higher efficiency.   This is not always the best financial move though.\n\n&gt;  Do I want to get the most Wattage up there?\n\nNot necessarily.   Often the cost for the slightly higher wattage does not have return.   There is a balance to be struck.  Also since modules have difference sizes you can often fit more with one brand than another and then there is landscape vs portrait installation.\n\nthere are often fire code setbacks that need to be left empty as well as different gaps for the attachement bolts which go between the modules and some expansion gaps between modules for thermal expansion.\n\nThen you have the electrical issues.   depending on the inverter system you often have limits to the numbers that will work.",

"comment": "Well it's a two prong answer:\n\nThe utility who's territory I'm in has nuclear sites, some combined cycle plants, some solar, and few other types of plants. So, the nuke plants are high capital expenditure but very low overhead, the combined cycle plants burn natural gas which is the cheapest fossil fuel to burn (currently), and solar is the same as nuke in that it's high upfront capital expenditure along with a very big square footage need and but negligible overhead. \n\nBut this only answers part of the question. As you'll notice in your bill, the majority of it is made up of the \"fuel\" and \"non-fuel\" charges (besides taxes, customer charge, etc.). Everything I've mentioned up to now explains a low \"fuel charge\": cheap natural gas, high efficiency of the nuclear reactors (believe or not kW per kW nuclear reactors are very cheap to run), and solar has no fuel costs.\n\nAs to the non-fuel component, this is what you pay for the utility's fixed costs and the non-fuel variable costs. So in order to get a low non-fuel component they need to drive down admin &amp; general expenses, operations and maintenance expense and have their plants run as efficiently as possible. In fact the non-fuel component is larger than the fuel.\n\nIf you look at a state like Hawaii, they have very old fuel-oil burning plants and some hydro. The literally have to ship in containers full of oil from mainland to run their plants. This results in a very very high fuel component of the bill. I think the average 1,000 kWh bill over there is upwards of $450. This is the reason you see very high penetration of rooftop solar over there, because your payback period is actually around 5-7 years.",

There should be some specific examples of recommendations to address climate change problems if she genuinely thinks its a problem. \n\nBloomberg is a news service with a very wealthy man at the top of the food chain.  I don't know how they are biased to over represent battery storage as being an affordable alternative. I also don't understand why it isn't a valuable alternative even if it can only make a dent in resolving intermittency issues and not solve it completely.\n\nI presented a scenario where solar works during the day and the intermittency gap is covered 50/50 by battery and gas instead of 100% by gas. Seems like a positive step to a layperson.\n\nIf you think Bloomberg is not being a straight shooter here, what's your angle?",

As for neighbors, we used to get a lot of customers that complained about the aesthetics of solar panels and wanted us to do odd installs to keep them off the front of their house.  It's been awhile since we got that request so I think people see them as just normal now-a-days. \n\nFor an array on the front of your house, go with an all-black module and use black low profile racking. Even if you give up some production with the all-black modules and low clearance, it will be more aesthetically pleasing. They also make trim rails you can put on the front to hide any wiring/racking (a competent installer should leave no wiring visible underneath the array). Additionally, request to keep the array(s) as uniform as possible, so have a plumber move any vents that would break up the array and make it look irregular.",

"comment": "Financing that is specific to solar is expensive. The closing costs are hidden in the price but tend to be significant. It is always cheaper to pay the solar installer's cash price and then work through a local credit union for financing rather than with the solar specific financiers. They may have attractive APR's, but you are literally just paying crazy amounts to buy down the points behind the scenes. You get the ease of a one-stop-shop with the Tesla or any other largish installer, but you pay for it in the end.\n\n^not arguing against the ease of a one stop shop, just know that it is more expensive. The peace of mind/warrenty, etc may well be worth it. I would avoid Tesla and go with a large regional player if you want to go that route, but that's another post for another time.",

The company, Akon \\*\\*Lighting\\*\\* Africa, kind of says as much in their name. Of course, their website is down, but their set-ups are street lights run by solar panels, with some that run lights in homes as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLight is better than no light (maybe).  The company has 5,000 workers, and funding, and I would expect a lot more could be done with the same funding and staff were they being directed towards more energy efficient production methods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe gist of what is really happening is here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akon\\_Lighting\\_Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akon_Lighting_Africa)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;This initiative has taken advantage of the tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese solar panels, leaving the Chinese manufacturers with stock to sell, by lining up credit with China Jiangsu International Economic And Technical Cooperation Group to finance purchase of solar equipment, which allows the nations participating in the project to bypass World Bank loans to get a project started in their own nation.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akon_Lighting_Africa#cite_note-atlanta-1)\n\nThe World Bank has been fucking over these countries for decades, and China has taken a different approach. They present loans to African nations that are basically broken down like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n75% will go to companies associated with the World Bank for projects of marginal utility,\n\n25% can be siphoned off by the current leader of the country to buy a Castle in Switzerland.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever resources the country has will be provided to the World Bank indefinitely until the unplayable loan is paid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChina is actually building shit and then keeping most of the control/profit, but at least they're building shit that can make a profit. China was stuck with a large supply of solar panels, and they could monetize them in Africa and Akon would look good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the rest of his nonsense about how charity works, not even worth the effort to type about.",

"comment": "Solar installer here with Sense and solar at home. I like the low price tag and the concept but have run into a couple issues:\n\n1. It still has trouble recognizing loads. I don’t have 20+ sources of “heat”. It just keeps adding new ones.\n\n2. Connection. Pretty much weekly emails about loss of connection in a home with 400MBPS connection, nighthawk router and signal boosters. Nothing else loses connection, signal is very strong at device, yet it drops connection. Apparently it’s an issue with first gen.\n\nA major electrical company white labeled this product, maybe Schneider? And they’ve said they fixed the connection issues.\n\nI looked to add it to our products as a value add but I think this would add a lot of calls due to the issues listed. It has the potential to be good, but AI and connection (at least on my product) would prevent me from recommending it.",

If you do have TOU then you'll have to configure it so it knows what the power prices are at what time do it can change and discharge in such a way to maximize your savings.\n\nI don't have TOU but I still run it with 90% reserve.  I will have UPSs in the house and they all beep when there's a power failure while they're full and solar is producing more than consumption.  When they happens the Powerwalls will skew the microgrid frequency to 63 Hz which makes the UPSs mad.\n\nIt is kinda neat to see the grid connection flatline during the day.",

If maximum income is your top priority purchasing a solar kit wouldnt make sense.\n\nThat said increasing your carbon offset while getting a roi half that of market rate isnt too shabby. This path may split the difference to some folks priorities. Personally I also like lowering my COL immediately rather then banking on investment profits to cover living costs and also value being a bit less reliant on the grid/infrastructure so the lower roi is worth the uptick in ecological stewardship, lower monthly expense and energy independence \n\nEach to their own!",

Many do not even need to cover their entire roof--just a portion. If newly-built businesses and homes had solar roofs, and if old buildings started placing solar, I wonder how much of that area would be eaten up real quick. And I wonder how much of that land area is already taken up by coal and natural gas production and use.",

"comment": "The gullible greens still try to convince themselves that China really is going to cut emissions eventually. They cling on to the pledge of reducing energy  and carbon intensity, but they really ought to realise that this is a meaningless promise, as all maturing economies do this as they expand into consumer goods and services. This does not mean though that energy consumption will actually decline, simply that the economy will grow faster than energy use does.\n\nThen there is the nonsense about China being the world’s leader in renewable energy. Naturally, given the size of their economy, everything thing they do is big. But the sad reality is that wind and solar power still only contributed a paltry 4% of China’s energy last year.\n\nAs for Xi’s “promises”, we might recall that Senile Joe actually believed the Taliban.\n\nThe report reckons that these new coal plants and blast furnaces will add 150 million tonnes to China’s CO2 emissions. This is roughly half the UK’s total emissions.\n\n➖➖➖\n\nWhile the United States is fast-tracking decarbonization of electricity generation due to a claimed “code red” climate emergency in the wake of the latest United Nations report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), China has announced plans to add 43 new coal-fueled generation plants.\n\nAccording to Energy Live News, China built over three times as much coal plant capacity as the rest of the world in 2020.\n\nChina added nearly 40 GW of electricity generation in 2020, the equivalent of building approximately one large coal-fired power plant every week.\n\nhttps://climatechangedispatch.com/china-building-43-new-coal-plants-as-biden-fast-tracks-shuttering-ours/",

"comment": "Your son is most likely responsible for purchasing all the energy produced by the solar panels. Period. Independent of your consumption. I have not seen a PPA that had payment dependent on the homeowner's consumption - just on the solar production.\n\nThis should not be a problem if you are on net metering in New Jersey, and the system was sized appropriately to the load in the house. 13,385 kWh/year is 36 kWh a day - that's about average for a single-family home in the US.\n\nHowever, I personally wouldn't not buy a home with a solar PPA - if possible, I would have insisted the seller buy out the PPA, and include the solar system with the sale free and clear. Many of these PPAs are not good deals. They have annual escalators, and if the system was installed even a few years ago, may just be too damn expensive. Has he signed the transfer agreement putting the PPA in his name? Your son may be in a stronger negotiating position than you think - he can simply threaten to not accept the PPA, and Sunnova might negotiate a lower PPA payment, or a more attractive buyout.",

No advantage cost wise where I live because we have net metering with no time of use here in Los Angeles city owned utility. It's a different story if I was in Edison territory. But.. I like that we can hook up a generator once the firmware is released in the event of power outage which is relatively rare here. Of course got to buy the backup interface which is another $1400. Also want the car charger.\n\nThe hot water heater doesn't seem popular in the US. How do you plan on integrating it? Doesn't it just power a immersion heater element? Or does it integrate into a traditional electric wh?\n\nWhat kind of issues are you having? Is it with the LG chem integration?

They are “worth” only $85 Billion. Even though their real assets net of liabilities, plus cash on hand (as high as $50 Billion last year) is literally worth more than $85 Billion if the company dissolved today. Heck, their autonomous drive company, Cruise, is worth $30 Billion and GM owns 83%. They own four lithium battery factories with LG, for an annual production capacity of over 140 Gigawatts. What’s that worth? They own an insurance company. A bank and finance company. A battery storage company. A defense company. OnStar is estimated to be worth $13 Billion on its own. The list goes on. \n\nEven though GM made $9.7 Billion last year and $3.3 Billion Q1 2021 alone (guidance for $11-12 Billion for the year)… they’re only “worth” $85 Billion?\n\nTSLA is 685 times earnings with no assets \n\nGM is 9 times earnings with net billions in assets\n\nSee where I’m going with this?",

"comment": "And emissions from the creation of electrical power, utilities, etc., is often brought up as an uninformed argument against EVs but it doesn’t have anything directly to do with them. These emissions are strictly power-grid related. Since the American power grid is one of - if not number one - most-polluting electrical grids among developed nations, EVs in the US will naturally be linked to these emissions even though it’s not an actual EV problem. \n\nPhotovoltaic power production is almost entirely emission-free… manufacture the solar panels and the associated equipment - no more emissions for the rest of the life of the system. \n\nThe US has double the land area as the EU but only 60% of the EU’s PV power generation capacity. And the US has enormous desert areas that are becoming uninhabitable anyway. \n\nThe only EV-specific emissions are those from the manufacture of the battery pack, but that’s the same quantity of emissions from driving an ICEV for a few months.",

Consequently, the global demand for coal and gas is now accelerating to prevent winter deaths and the closure of industries.\n\nYet he continues with the nonsense of urging countries to:\n\n&gt;Put the pedal to the metal towards a renewable energy future.\n\nIn 2022, *The New York Times* reported how António Guterres claimed that “the world is committing suicide if there is no collective action on the alleged climate emergency” and how humanity “faces collective suicide over the climate crisis”.\n\n###There is no evidence of any climate crisis but the statement from Guterres was mischievously timed to coincide with recent heat waves experienced in Europe at that time.\n\nGuterres appears not to know the difference between climate and weather, as defined by the World Meteorological Society (WMO):\n\n&gt;Climate is an average of weather over 30 years and any short-term weather event lasting a few hours or days, be it a hurricane, cold snap or a heat wave is weather and not climate.\n\nGuterres also appears not to know that temperatures recorded in cities are unreliable because of the Urban Heat Island effect due to more buildings, roadways and waste heat that exaggerate recorded temperatures.\n\n###Except that floods have not increased in frequency or intensity according to peer-reviewed, published papers.\n\nFacts have never bothered Antonio Guterres since his prime mission has always been about de-industrialising and taking money from developed nations to give it to developing countries under the guise of climate compensation. He continues to make wild, unsubstantiated statements such as:\n\n“&gt;It is fifty years since the United Nations convened the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. But since then, few of our promises on the environment have been honoured.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;The window to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing fast.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;Last year, global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions grew by 6 per cent when they should be falling. Let me be blunt: most national climate pledges are simply not good enough.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;We are witnessing a historic and dangerous disconnect: science and citizens are demanding ambitious and transformative climate action. Meanwhile many governments are dragging their feet.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a liveable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels, especially coal, and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition. Renewables are the peace plan of the 21st century.\n\n###Perhaps governments are dragging their feet because more than 1,300 peer-reviewed papers have now been published in support of skeptical arguments against climate alarmism.\n\n###Perhaps governments are dragging their feet because they know that a vast majority of scientists reject climate alarmism as espoused by Guterres with more than 4,000 scientists, including 70 Nobel Laureates having signed the Heidelberg Appeal to say there is no climate emergency.\n\n###More than 31,000 scientists, including geophysicists, climatologists, meteorologists, oceanographers and environmental scientists have now signed the Oregon Petition to say there is no climate emergency.\n\n➖Dire predictions from Guterres and other climate alarmists never eventuate and those years they have promised to bring Armageddon come and go. Undeterred by the failure of their silly alarmist deadlines, the climate doomsters simply move their dates for disaster further into the future.\n\nThe public and especially children should be told the truth, that life continues to improve with more people being lifted out of poverty than at any other time.\n\nThey should be told that people are now living much longer and are healthier.\n\nThey should be told that climate-related deaths have declined dramatically.\n\nThey should also be told not to believe any of the alarmist climate nonsense that comes from people such as António Guterres and others who have a vested interest in convincing politicians and the general public that there is a climate emergency. \n\nThey say that climate doom is coming and only paying huge sums of money to the UN can save us. They also say that industries and businesses have to be shut down since they mostly depend on reliable energy sources such as coal and natural gas.",

"comment": "Absolutely, nuclear waste is highly controlled and regulated. \n\nWhen highly radioactive nuclear waste is generated from fuel cells coming to the end of their life, it is placed in a cooling pool onsite while it is still hot, but not enough to turn water to steam. This is a massive indoor pool, where the water both keeps it cool and acts as a radiation shield, blocking most of the radiation. Once cooled (up to 20~years) it is placed in a large concrete cask or barrel, part of this process is turning the waste into glass inside the barrel, so it is solid and stable. These are extremely durable, there’s a handy video of a train being crashed into and exploding on the cask, which suffered no damage. These are mostly kept on site, as there are few long term storage locations at the moment. There is a deep geologic storage site in the Netherlands, where casks are place very deep underground, in a stable geologic area, then the tunnel backfilled with concrete.\n\nThere are alternatives to storing the waste, some reactors can consume the waste as fuel or reprocess it into usable nuclear fuel again, basically recycling.\n\nThis is more of a dig at other energy sources, but nuclear is the only energy source that manages its waste. Fossil fuels remove sulphur and some other chemicals, then spew whatever’s left into the atmosphere, which is also partially radioactive, to the point that more radioactive waste is released by coal than nuclear.\nRenewables although possible to recycle, are not done so at any scale atm, solar panels are difficult and expensive to recycle, so are effectively landfilled as large piles or in warehouses at end of life. Wind turbines pollute some of their blade surface through erosion in use, but are just buried at end of life.\n\nYou are right to be concerned, given that our main source of energy, fossil fuels waste has caused immense damage to the environment. But as mentioned nuclear waste is controlled, tracked and managed relatively easily and effectively, though there have been issues, we have learnt from those issues and taken action.",

"comment": "I just got my first bill in Seattle since installation was completely and approved on March 27. Very weird bill. It ran from March 8 to May 7. I'd have figured that my billing would have switched mid-month to April 1 - June 1 etc since net metering begins April 1. In any case, Seattle City Light let my production from March 27 to May 7 count toward my non-solar-installation bill from March 8-27, - when I had no production since it wasn't installed yet. So $0 bill aside from the base charge that all SCL customers have to pay. Not going to complain about it being back-dated. \n\nThe only bizarre thing is that my meter reading for the solar is off (under) by the amount I used March 8-27 (\\~600kWh) before I had the solar installed.\n\nAnyway, a bit weird, but seems to be working as intended by SCL?",

"comment": "Hey all, I hope you'll read my latest L.A. Times column and let me know what you think! Here's how it starts:\n\n*Gov. Gavin Newsom’s appointees could vote next week on a widely criticized plan that climate activists, solar installers and labor unions say would pointlessly slow California efforts to phase out fossil fuels and limit energy bills for low-income families.*\n\n*A few days later, Newsom will travel to the Vatican, at Pope Francis’ invitation, to speak about the urgency of the climate crisis.*\n\n*The dissonance would be funny if it weren’t so scary.*\n\n*California is still a global leader in combating the deadly consequences of coal, oil and gas combustion. Newsom has played a role by requiring an end to the sale of cars and light trucks that run solely on oil-based fuels by 2035, among other initiatives.*\n\n*But monopoly utility companies such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison — and the politically powerful labor unions that represent many of their employees, most notably Local 1245 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — have engaged in a remarkably successful campaign over the last few years to reduce financial incentives for rooftop solar panels, which don’t fuel utility industry profits and are typically installed by non-union workers.*\n\n*Some environmental groups, meanwhile, support rooftop solar but have questioned the wisdom of building large solar farms on undisturbed public lands that are currently home to tortoises, sage grouse and other animals. Some conservationists have tried to block construction of those solar farms despite a mountain of evidence that we’ll need them — lots of them — to avert a future of ever-worsening heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts, with dangerous repercussions for wildlife and humans alike.*\n\n*In theory, nearly all of the key players duking it out in Sacramento — utility companies, unions, rooftop solar installers, consumer watchdogs, environmental groups, large-scale solar developers — agree that we’ll need lots of solar from lots of sources.*\n\n*Massive solar projects in the desert, small rooftop systems — all of the above, please. In a state still heavily dependent on planet-warming natural gas for electricity, there are plenty of climate-friendly electrons — and plenty of jobs — to go around.*\n\n*In theory, anyway.*\n\n*In practice, unfortunately, many suppliers and supporters of large-scale and rooftop solar have done hardly anything to help each other politically. And some of them have torn each other to shreds. Especially in California, this solar infighting is exasperating and increasingly embarrassing. With time running short to stop burning most if not all fossil fuels, it needs to end.*\n\n*We could use a grand bargain — a political masterstroke to end the solar squabbling.*\n\nAgain, I hope you'll read the whole column and share your thoughts.

Solar panels are not recycled but buried in mass pits, as are many components of wind turbines. But please do lecture us on how nuclear is less renewable than solar or wind. Sure, the sun keeps giving us light and heat, so the source of energy is renewable, but the means to harness it and make it usable is not. And I suppose we will just ignore the fact that there are more ways to power a nuclear reactor than just U-235?",

Not only are you pushing the roof replacement 5-10 years out which will have increased labor costs, but now instead of only paying to install the solar panels once you'll pay for the removal and re-install.  Last quote I saw for a remove and reinstall was $4000+ for 20 panels.  I have no idea what that labor price will be by 2030+!\n\nAnd I don't know if I agree with your premise about having to re-roof it again while the solar panels are still installed.  Most roofs are rated for at least 25 years, are they not?  I guess if your roofing material won't hold up for 25+ years then your plan makes sense, but I just can't see that being the case in 98%+ of installs.",

There are a lot of great vegan blogs out there, but this site allows us to find recipes that aren't going to take a day and a half to prepare.They have some amazing user submitted recipes and so many filters! Lately we search for Vegan meals that take under 15 minutes or we cook more elaborate meals and freeze them.\n\n\nDefinitely buy your grains and rice in bulk and don't be afraid to go beyond the rice and try some barley, quinoa or any other grain that strikes your fancy. Assortments of dried beans and lentils will really help too! Experiment with spices -- you should try to buy these in bulk. We've found the best deals at Raley's and Winco if you have those where you live.\n\nWe also buy frozen veggies and fruit in bulk and buy fresh from our local CSA during their growing season. If you're interested in getting a bit more advanced, making our own breads, pastas, and almond milk saves us a lot of money.\n\n\nIt's tough because you're going to gravitate towards veggie patties and faux chicken nuggets at first. There's nothing wrong with this, but they're often pretty bad both for you and your wallet. I don't know what TVP is like as we try not to eat soy, but I've heard it's pretty inexpensive and similar to beef? There are a lot of chili recipes for it out there, and you can buy in bulk.\n\n\nLearn to make soup and freeze in small portions for yourself. Learning to think about a salad as a meal will help as well.\n\n\nGood luck to you, and don't worry about getting enough protein. Chances are great that if you're getting enough calories you're getting more than enough protein. You should probably ditch the ramen if you're vegan for health reasons -- also I'm pretty positive it contains animal products despite what PETA says.\n\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any specific questions, and congrats on taking an active role towards a healthier you. :)",

I also add sage, oregano and other spices to it, though the choice of spices can limit its versatility: sage makes it taste like sausages, which doesn't necessarily work in a chicken dish, for example.  \n\nI get my wheat gluten in [50lb bags for ~$100 shipped](http://store.honeyvillegrain.com/vitalwheatgluten50lb.aspx), though I've seen it being sold in the bulk bins at $2/lb (ie - the same), though not in my area. We've gone through 2 bags in the last couple of years. A lb of wheat gluten makes a 2-3 lbs of seitan.",

"comment": "Way to go!!! My daughter is 5, she's been vegan since birth. \nObviously, one of the reasons she is vegan is because we, as her parents, are vegan. So she eats what we eat -like any family, vegan or otherwise. \n\n\nNow that she is older she asks questions about why we don't eat animals, what happens to the animals, why do other people eat animals, ect. \nI am honest with her. I spare her the gory details, but she\nunderstands that animals are killed so people can eat them. She understands that you don't love one, but eat the other. \n\nSome of the things she has said:\n\n\n\"why would people eat animals when there are so many other things to eat? \"\n\n\n\"it makes me sad when people eat animals\"\n\n\n\"i need to be the voice of the animals because they can't talk\"\n\n\n\"animals shouldn't be in cages, they need to be free in the wild\" \n\n\n\"Cow milk is for baby cows\"\n\n\nShe has said this openly to family members who are not vegan. \n\noh, and her pediatrician knows we are a vegan family. My daughter is thriving, perfect percentile for weight and height. No mineral or vitamin deficiencies.\n\nI believe all children are born vegan. It's the omni parents who force them to eat otherwise. They use abstract words - bacon, ham, nugget - to hide the truth from their children. Why is that? Because when most children realize they are eating a cow, pig or chicken, they are horrified. They understand on a basic level that animals shouldn't be eaten. \n\n\"But don't worry little Johnny, it's just a pig. Nothing like your best friend, Spot. Now be quiet and eat your bacon\"\n\nAnd so the first lesson of double morality is learned. \n\nedit: formatting",

If you're in the US, there are some pretty good cheese substitutes, such as Chao or Follow your Heart.\n\nThe issue is that you're eating it everyday and switching to a vegan alternative will just make it more obvious that they are not the same.\n\n&gt;Most Asian cuisine is almost vegan by default.\n\nWhich is great. Try and abstain from cheese by eating those meals that don't need it. Do this for at least two weeks and you will be able to adjust to a substitute. \n\n&gt;I already use vegan butter, mayo, and milk\n\nThat's awesome and you're doing more than others already. Just continue to do that. Try a pizza with vegan pesto, marinara, vegetables and no cheese. You might like it, pesto is pretty tasty.",

Some of the worst things about the animal product industry (factory farms, fur for fashion, etc) are justified based on their profitability.\n\nThere’s also just more of an overlap between vegans and left-leaning people, so you’re going to find more left-leaning people who are vegans, including some who are very far left. There are exceptions of course (even some far-right white supremacists are vegan, as well as many relatively moderate people), but that’s just the way it seems to shake out.",

There are times that it does make me feel sad or the meal might look particularly gross to me, but I would never share that with them. I don’t think that would help the cause. Two of my friends have gone vegetarian since I became vegan and another is only eating fish, no meat or dairy so I think my gentle approach is working!",

I'm a vegan bot.  \n\n\n-------------\n\n**Your Fallacy:**\n\n&gt;meone raising their own chickens **(ie: Eggs are not unethical)**\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\nEating eggs supports cruelty to chickens. Rooster chicks are killed at birth in a variety of terrible ways because they cannot lay eggs and do not fatten up as Broiler chickens do. Laying hens suffer their entire lives; they are debeaked without anesthetic, they live in cramped, filthy, stressful conditions and they are slaughtered when they cease to produce at an acceptable level.\n\nThese problems are present even on the most bucolic family farm. For example, laying hens are often killed and eaten when their production drops off, and even those farms that keep laying hens into their dotage purchase hen chicks from the same hatcheries that kill rooster chicks. Further, such idyllic family farms are an extreme edge case in the industry; essentially all of the eggs on the market come from factory farms. In part, this is because there's no way to produce the number of eggs that the market demands without using such methods, and in part it's because the egg production industry is driven by profit margins, not compassion, and it's much more lucrative to use factory farming methodologies.)\n\n\n-------------\n\n**Your Fallacy:**\n\n&gt;What would the vegan stance on someone raising their own chickens as loved pets/family and using the eggs they lay in cooking, considering most eggs remain un-fertilized and you aren’t taking away anything of need from the chicken. And for that matter, family-kept bees and honey? **(ie: Honey is not unethical)**\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\nBees possess extraordinary intelligence, decision-making ability and even specialized language. They also experience pain. This means that bees are thinking individuals whose needs and wishes are usurped for our benefit when we consume honey. This also means that bees suffer when their honey is taken from them.\nIn commercial honey operations, queens are purchased after having been artificially inseminated with crushed males. The wings of these queens are ripped off to prevent them from flying away, and while they would normally live to four years old, they are killed at age two to make room for younger queens. Further, commercial hives are often left to die by starvation and exposure or killed as a means of controlling stock. Even in smaller honey operations where bees are treated gently, some are crushed to death when their hives are disturbed. Beekeepers in these environments often replace honey with sugar or corn syrup to maximize profits, but these are not a bee’s natural food, and they are not sufficient to sustain an entire hive through the winter. Ultimately, wild hives create living conditions and food stores ideally suited to sustain themselves, but human intervention results in starvation, suffering and death for bees. So since humans do not need honey to survive, eating it is indeed unethical.)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]",

I wouldn't buy or use meat personally, but I could see the argument that they aren't slaughtering or harming animals albeit contributing towards animal agriculture in some minimal form...they're trying to produce a net positive by testing the already processed meat and creating a similar plant-based option as a result. But they need a reference if they want it to be effective.\n\nThey want to create a more effective product to get people to stop eating meat, and I'm under the impression it wouldn't be as effective if they went based off not being able to compare meat at all to develop their product because they wouldn't touch it or smell it.\n\nIt's probably similar to how some vegans may feel about vaccines and animal testing.",

"comment": "Honestly if you think saving one packet of bacon from the trash makes the slightest difference in demand, you are sorely mistaken. The amount of meat that is *already* being wasted (mostly by supermarkets and bigger stores, but also through people just buying too much) is so immense that any ponctuai discrepancies in demand are absorbed by the amount of meat wasted every day (In the US, food waste is estimated at 30-40% of total food supply).\n\nThe only way to really reduce demand is by encouraging more people to go vegan or to reduce their meat consumption *long-term*. You don’t do that when you give extra meat to a carnist. Quite the opposite actually.",

"comment": "My goal is to reduce demand for animal products. Leftover grease on a grill does not increase demand for anything, and I honestly do not care if there happens to be bits of animal in the food. This contrasts with a chain actually using animal products in their oil which they buy and use to fry their products, like McDonalds does with their fries. I do not buy them for that reason.\n\nLike you said, cross contamination is important for allergy purposes, but this is irrelevant to veganism itself. Obviously I wish the place was just full-vegan but that’s just not a reality for large chains right now. Refusing to buy otherwise vegan products due to possible cross contamination accomplishes nothing and actually discourages the chain from having vegan options at all.\n\nVeganism is a way of life which primarily seeks to reduce demand for animal products. Going down the path of ignoring logic and actually trying to accomplish goals in favor of keeping a “pure” diet and lifestyle is anti-logic and reeks of  the insanity of Kosher and Halal foods. Veganism is not a religion. Treating it like one is detrimental to our actual goals.",

If you can do that, and the vet is on board, maybe it’ll work out. KEEP doing that, because nutrient deficiencies take a long time to do the damage that they do sometimes and can be invisible until the devastating symptoms set it. I’m against most people forcing their cat to be vegan because it’s very very hard, and veterinarians across the board advise against it for a reason. Long term there are no studies that support vegan diets don’t cause those common deficiencies, so if that’s a choice you want to make for your cat, that’s your decision. Genuinely hope it works out and your cat stays healthy 👍🏻",

I typically just eat after my intuition and hunger, but i've tried weighing and logging my food, and i averaged 40-50gr of protein, and 1500 calories (I probably eat more on the weekends, but those calories would mostly be from alcohol, and vegan sweets, and that doesn't have a lot of protein). I know from personal experience that eating 60-80 gr. of protein allows me to build or preserve muscle. I could in theory just eat a big pile of beans or lentils or something like that, but it would be a chore for me. It's much easier to just chug a protein shake. \n\nbesides that, i like supporting companies who try to make some vegan products. And by using vegan protein powder, i have a really effective argument against those dudebros who say \"what about protein tho\" \n\nTL;DR: Is protein necessary for everyone ? absolutely not. Is it convenient and usefull for some people with specific dietary goals ? yes it is.",

"comment": ">I don't see any excuses being made in relation to the ages of the dogs:\n\nOops. Sorry. I made my comments partially from notes I wrote when I first read the study, but partially from my memory of what I thought I knew about the study. I was recalling an aspect of another similar Andrew Knight study, this one:\n\n[Vegan versus meat-based dog food: Guardian-reported indicators of health](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265662)\n\nIn that study, which they obviously tried to make the outcomes work out better for the \"vegan\" dogs and employed P-hacking such as modifying the study design after data was already collected and analyzed, the meat-fed dogs had far and away better health outcomes. But the authors tried to dismiss it:\n\n>Within our studied sample, on average, the youngest dogs were those fed raw meat, and the oldest dogs were those fed vegan diets, with statistically significant differences between all dietary groups. Given that younger dogs generally have fewer health problems, this may have positively influenced the general health outcomes of dogs fed raw meat diets.\n\nWell another factor that can skew results in the opposite direction is that many dog carers put their dogs on a meat diet because of a chronic illness. At least, that's something I see very often in pet discussion forums: \"My dog was getting sick on kibble, so I started feeding him meat.\" It might be sufficiently of the meat-fed dogs that they began their diets with poorer health for it to affect the statistics. Anyway, if the researchers believed that mean age of groups could have affected outcomes, with such high numbers of dog subjects per group they could have easily compared dogs per age bracket to eliminate the factor.\n\n>The dogs on vegan diets were indeed more sedentary than those on raw meat diets. The cats showed no differences in activity level.\n\nI did say that the results for cats were similar to the dog results, not identical. The study (linked in the earlier comment) is a palatability study. The cats in the so-called raw meat group were reported to lick their food more often than the conventional diet cats, which licked their food more than the vegan diet cats. The cats fed raw meat had the highest rates of finishing meals.",
