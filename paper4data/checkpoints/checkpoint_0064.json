"comment": "&gt; if I completely discharged it\n\nWon't happen.  The generator kicks on and charges the battery from inside the car.  The Volt doesn't move on gas alone, ever really; it's more of a \"series hybrid\".  The quotes are there for a reason.  Here's why:\n\nWhen people were thinking about electric cars and charging and the like, someone had a brilliant idea: Why not have a regular fully electric car, and then have a small trailer that's got a gas generator in it so you can charge the car while you're driving, from gas?  Well, people said \"why not put the generator in the car then?\"  And the Volt was born, right? \n\nOriginally, before it was released, the car was marketed as a \"series hybrid\" but as they moved toward production Chevy stopped saying \"series hybrid\" and began to insert the phrase \"Range-Extended Electric Vehicle\".  Then, after quite some time of people saying \"ok, whatever Chevy, we know it's a Series Hybrid.  Maybe that long name just tested better in focus groups\", some bloggers and car writers found out that it wasn't going to be a \"true\" series hybrid.  They freaked out, everywhere (like even NPR freaked out), and Chevy got a bunch of bad press for no reason.  All the crazies came out from behind their rocks and started throwing poop.  \"Chevy lied to us!\" \"I bet the oil companies had something to do with this!\" \"Why can't we have nice things?\"\n\nSo why did they freak out?  It's really no good reason.\n\nIn a series hybrid, the gasoline engine never turns the wheels of the car.  Why is that a good thing? Why did people want that?\n\nWhen the battery starts to get below a certain charge, the \"engine\" (generator) turns on to make electricity from gasoline.  The electric motor is what turns the wheels, using battery power.  We'll use equals signs for wires here, and ignore the inverter.  \n\n(Gas Engine)--&gt;(Electric Generator)=(Battery)=(Motor)--&gt;Wheels\n\nAt first glance, it seems like that's a lot of extra steps where things could be inefficient.  Why not just:\n\n (Gas Engine)--&gt;Wheels?\n\nHere's the kicker.  When the gas engine runs in a series hybrid, it's running at peak electricity-generating efficiency.  Always. All the time that it's on. Every time. Always. Did I say always? Because \"always\" is important later. In other words, you're getting the most possible electricity out of that gasoline.  Once it's made into electricity, the rest of the system is like 95% efficient (or something super high like that). So really, in a series hybrid, you've got a process that makes gas into electricity really efficiently, and then uses that electricity really efficiently.\n\nMost gas engines have a peak efficiency point (on a curve), and it's generally somewhere between 1,000 RPM and we'll say 6,500 RPM.  SO, if you're not operating the engine *at that peak*, you're not using gasoline in the most efficient way.  Transmissions in conventional cars turn pretty fast spinning energy (torque) into slower wheel spinning.  You can hear this when a regular car (or better yet, imagine a school bus) starts from a stop.  The engine is spinning faster than the wheels are turning until it switches to higher gears a few times.  So a conventional transmission lets the engine operate at peak efficiency between three and nine times (depending on the number of gears) between 0 and 100 mph, and only for a few seconds during that whole time.  The rest of the time, the engine is spinning at a rate that doesn't translate to peak power or efficiency.  Also when you're slowing down, the engine is still running.  MOST of the time, the gas engine turning the wheels is not burning gas very efficiently.  \n\n\nSo why the freakouts? Well, the Volt is a series hybrid most of the time, but sometimes, it's not.  If you really really floor it, the gas engine will actually provide power to the wheels through some sort of transmission.   And that right there is why people freaked out; there's no \"always\" with the Volt. *Sometimes* it turns the wheels with gasoline.",

"comment": "I am leasing a leaf now, planning to get a Tesla. The Leaf is a very capable, affordable electric vehicle. \n\nThe Leaf cannot use a NEMA 14-50 outlet without an EVSE(wall charger) with a J1772 plug. I got an EMW Juicebox for about $500 that plugs into a NEMA 14-50 outlet. The Juicebox can handle 60A - twice the power of most commercial chargers and will be able to provide enough power for a Leaf(6.6kW), an i3(7.4kW) or a Tesla(10kW). I plan to keep it in my garage for charging the Tesla(with a J1772-&gt;Tesla adapter) and keep the Tesla mobile charger in the car for use on road trips.\n\nI got a 2013 Leaf SV for $270 per month and paid $850 at signing for taxes, title, first month on a 2 year lease. You can get lower monthly payments if you pay more at signing, but I would rather keep the money in my pocket and pay slightly higher monthlies. Dealers were obstinate - it took me 4 weeks of investigation and gathering quotes before I got one that I felt was fair.",

Just look at the shit production value of the okeefe stuff, if you or a normal joe on the street had meandered into acorn said a bunch of weird shit, edited up and run off to a random news agency with it, they would have been ignored at best, and turned over to the cops for submitting evidence on tape that you were running an underage prostitution ring.

"comment": "GM definitely backs the car. However, GM is not as \"all-in\" with EVs as Nissan or Tesla.  With $3.50 gasoline and driving about 15,000 miles per year, you'll find that leasing a Volt is comparable with lots of other cars on a total cost of ownership basis.  With gas at $2/gallon it's a much tougher sell.  Unfortunately, I think you'll find that across the industry dealerships and salespeople are not well educated about EVs and plug-ins.  I think you're better off doing research online and buying from a dealership that sells more EVs. They will be more knowledgeable.",

"comment": "It's not only GM who uses this setup, they just happened to arrange their batteries into a T shape. Ford uses a similar style batteries for their hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles, but puts them in the trunk. Honda as well for their Accord plug-in. The Volt has about twice the capacity of those vehicles. The Volt borrowed heavily from the EV1, and the Gen 1 EV1 used lead-acid batteries, not LI-Ion. That's likely the reason for their shape vs a flat-pack. Also, they only got so far as NiMH batteries before they discontinued the car, and those had some issues, I'm wondering if they tried to keep the batteries as central and protected as possible in the car, because they were afraid of road debris possibly damaging the batteries.",

You do realize that every organization spends a substantial sum of money on R&amp;D in order to remain viable, and yet those companies still manage to turn a profit...\n\nThose companies aren't investing to expand their model lineup by 200% and production volume by 900%, or their infrastructure by some astronomical percentage.\n\nTSLA stock is probably overvalued, but the company isn't going anywhere.

I'm not from the US. \n\n&gt;A distributed power generation/storage system would have prevented that;\n\nA well-maintained control room would have prevented that. Don't you think that it would be cheaper to build additional power plants, dams or something, which could satisfy this need for redundancy? Cheaper than building millions of tiny batteries \"just in case\"?\n\n&gt;Under the current paradigm, the nearest plant that they can call for help is several hours drive away, \n\n...what? You really think that everything instantly goes to stone age if one power plant goes down? And the techs physically need to drive to another plant and knock on the door, asking for some spare parts?\n\n&gt;With the distributed production, the nearest power station that can help is only about half an hour away (if that),\n\nIt's literally seconds away. Watch [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCAzalhldg8) It's obviously slightly exaggerated and everything's now done by software (with lots of redundancy) but the general idea is the same. Lots of different sources of power, they go on and off when needed. The whole Europe is interconnected like that, so a total blackout is not really possible.\n\n&gt;Or for a real world example of the difference between Distributed Power Generation, compare ICE vs EVs. \n\nThat's not a very good example. ICEs can go for longer because they can store more energy than EVs, that's all. Transmitting power from a power plant to the car doesn't offset the efficiency, it all stays the same (i.e. more efficient than ICE), but as I said, you simply can't store as much energy in a car-sized battery as you can in a gasoline tank.",

So if you want to get any traction, knowing all of the state/local rules and regulations,  that's going to be your job, not a lawyers. \n\nNo lawyer is going to know any of that stuff anyway, especially not any cheap ones. \n\nOverseas panels aren't worth the extra hassle unless you're building massive installations. \n\nIf you want to do the \"Rent PLan\" you're going to need to be able to afford to take on debt to the tune of $20k+ per system you install, and have the ability to utilize the tax credit on that through whatever business entity you form. Or become a franchised installer of some other 3rd party owned company which isn't exactly hobby status. \n\nYou  really only need an electrician that has done solar before, pay extra for someone with experience, and you can easily contract out all of the engineering/paperwork to a local firm. At that point you're just marking up labor for lugging panels up the roof and bolting them down, and making money on whatever you can sell your projects for.\n\nAs you said, you should be your own first customer and build a project on your own house to learn that way. Equipment-wise, call up a local distributor and ask for whatever's cheapest and what others are installing locally, honestly there's no difference between 90% of the stuff out there.",

Likewise, now that we are seeing a growing amount of real world usable EVs it might be time for governments to start taxing fossil cars to drive the change.",

They know they’re doing something idiotic and\n\nJust like owners who abuse autopilot.\n\n&gt;\tI would just think that it drove itself because its called autopilot and it drives itself.\n\nThat’s because you aren’t an owner. I’m saying owners know. I literally gave you an example and you ignored it. Owners know that autopilot isn’t FSD, they abuse it and crash and then blame autopilot. **the name isn’t the problem** changing to to “willbywomks” wont solve anything.\n\nRead here:\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-autopilot-20180125-story.html\n\nThe name is not the problem. It’s the level 2 systems create people who end up abusing the system. That’s the risk. It’s not a Tesla problem but a technology problem of how do we stop people abusing their Level 2 system.\n\nI can’t believe I have to explain it so many times",

If skyactiv-x can improve that 30% (44-60 mpg) and then later tack on a hybrid power train we could easily be looking at a combined fuel economy above 65 mpg.  This kind of efficiency would definitely make a difference and represents double the kind of fuel economy we had less than ten years ago.  And yes, it would be about even in environmental impact to an electric car that isn't powered by renewables.\n\nI'm a big fan of electric cars, but highly improved gasoline engines can stay competitive in many ways over the next decade or two.",

"comment": "BEVs are probably non-starters in this context due to dead battery and range-affordability concerns, but EREVs seem blindingly obvious. Lower center of gravity is an easy sell. Independently-driven axles or wheels would be too. \n\nAn efficient, integrated, long-life electric generator is even better, especially if it runs on diesel and at least options a substantial inverter. These vehicles go further off-grid than anything else on wheels, and hydraulic or 12V accessories are quite expensive where they're even available. With a rooftop solar panel and a boat-style wind turbine these electrified Jeeps could be humble little rolling microgrids, with much better amenities and endurance than you'd get from propane equipment. I'm sure some enthusiasts are in it for noise and fumes, but an EREV's longer legs and self-reliance could tempt others away.",

Even then, this assumes the tax payer takes 100% of the credit and applies it to the principal of the car. This is certainly a possible outcome, but it's not the default outcome you're assuming.",

"comment": "&gt; It seems the only reason Model 3 isn't #1 at the moment is that so many cars are getting diverted to the Netherlands. \n\nThat's why looking at monthly Model 3 numbers in individual European country seems pointless. Like it seems like they ship to select countries at a time, so one month Model 3 will sell 4,000 in Netherlands, then the next month it'll only be 800 because other countries are getting their share, then the next month again it'll be 4,000, then again only 800 the next month. Doesn't stop the Tesla sub from having the usual \"Model 3 sales up 300% from last month in X European country!!!\" posts. Can see the same here, only 188 Model 3s sold in Germany in October whereas it's been around 1,000 a couple months ago and will probably shoot back up in January.\n\nThere's only so many Model 3s they can sent to Europe each month if they're only make like 8,000 a week total,so if they save half for America then thats 4,000 to send to Europe. So if Model 3 sales double in 1 European country then they'll have shrunk and almost equal amount in the other European countries. Need to look at European sales as a whole if thats possible, or at worst just look at the yearly sales so there's a monthly average sales which will be accurate.",

Due to huge debt they accumulated and near bankruptcy caused by their failed attempt of hostile takeover of VW group.\n\nVW Group decides to buy out Porsche AG (Car Company) and made a deal with Porsche SE Holding to still retain their 50.7% shares but VW will replace the management positions of Porsche SE Holding so, that VW still remains on control of the company even when Porsche SE officially owns the major shares of the VW Group.\n\nBut whatever is the case that comes out of these comments. My point still remains that the Volkswagen and Porsche has a very close relationship and pretty much is the biggest player inside the VW Group. And is much much bigger company when compared to other car or tech companies like Tesla or even Ford and GM combined.",

If you base it solely on CO2 the answer is a maybe.\n\nIt's just not sustainable either electric car capacity can't expand too much more because the demand it would put on the heavy metals and minerals used to produce that many batteries which have such a short life span would cause shortages and it would no longer be cost effective.\n\nThe technology is just not there yet.  Perhaps on another 10 or 20 years something new may come along to lessen the reliance on these components.\n\nWe see with California that renewables other than hydro aren't reliable either so there will always be fossil fuel backing unless you want rolling blackouts.",

"comment": "I'm trying to find out more about Project Solar, but Tesla is trying this route as well. As is Solar Wholesale. There is a company called Wholesale Solar which is now called Unbound Solar. They are definitely a reputable seller of DIY solar kits, plans, and a source of advice. I used them to install my own system in 2013 as have thousands and thousands of others. Now I'm a solar installer who does everything from small residential systems to 100-panel luxury homes to light commercial. In my opinion, companies like Project Solar and dozens of other companies here in Southern California subcontract sales, installation, and service in the hopes for fast revenue building on a high-volume model and then a big payout as an exit strategy. Many have already disappeared leaving customers stranded and calling companies like mine to pick up their monitoring and service. The Tesla, Project Solar model might be highly backed and can survive an initial onslaught of losing projects, but my biggest concern is for things like offering a fixed price when interconnection fees and permit fees vary so much from AHJ to AHJ and utility to utility. How do they handle HOA drawings? How do they handle 400A and 600A services, clay roofs, ground mounts, easements, fire setbacks, and on and on and on. The answer for Tesla anyway, is \"really shi++y\". Caveat Emptor",

Sure, you can send power back to the house, but you need to make sure you’re not connected to the grid at the same time (or else you would also be powering the grid), which is bad for several reasons including energizing people trying to repair a downed line. \n\nObviously, you could go turn off your main fuse manually, but then it’s not automatic backup power. \n\nYou also need a charging station that can handle this two-way power delivery, and depending on output you might need to limit the amount of consumers. \n\nAt most I think it’s a gimmicky feature and you’re likely better off investing in backup-batteries and/or solar. That way you could store low price energy and use it at peak, or you could save up before a storm without depleting vehicle range to keep warm if the power goes out. \n\nIt’s probably great if you can make it work in a pinch without expensive equipment, but I have a feeling you can’t really.",

Stelllantis is also investing $1 billion CAD plus at its Windsor plant to make EVs.\n\nAs for Mexico, both GM and Ford have announced massive spending and the Mach-e is made in Mexico.\n\nProtectionism rarely works in the long term. It limits choices to the consumer and often results in artificially high prices.",

Personally, I'm holding onto the receipt I have for PPF on the vehicle as I think it demonstrates my intent to keep the vehicle long term.\n\nThe 800lb gorilla in the room here is that we all know there is rampant fraud going on with the federal tax credit.  There are EVs for sale on Carmax that still have the protective film on the screens.  The EV tax credit needs to die, there is no shortage of demand for the vehicles.",

If power is being ran to the location for the CCS chargers then when Tesla adds their superchargers they'll have the feed already there.\n\nBut yeah regardless of if the Tesla connector is better it seems it'll be better for them to switch to CCS.\n\nAlso 4 is the minimum but what about the max? I couldn't see it. Tesla seems to be able to make large sites for relatively very cheap and I feel like they could use that to just underbid everyone and take up a lot of the subsidies, if that's how this specific subsidy works that is. I mean if one company is applying for a 12 stall site and another is applying for a 4 stall site in the same place but for twice as much per charger then go with the 12 stall applicant.",

Batteries are as expensive as the market tells us they have to be, but we (people who ride scooters and have to pay for this stuff) are operating in yesterday's world, before people knew that the amazingly expensive, hard to source \"Lithium\" (Sounds like a Nirvanna song!) ion batteries were just a vacuum sealed pack of the same 18650's I have been putting in my vapes since 2014.  I was a little off put, thinking I must be wrong since the consortium had such strong opinions, however unsupported they may have been.  But no, there are 60 and 72v batteries on Amazon, not even overseas for $250 bucks now.  A close inspection of my dead battery, and one 52v 20Ah version a mere cursory Amazon search turned up revealed the same XT60 connectors, promised the \"cells\" (the thing I put in my vapes) would be \"top 5\" meaning LG, Samsung, Panasonic, and I forget the other two, had the same charging current and actually the exact same charger.  Let me be honest, this is probably not a replacement for my battery, the physical dimensions are as important as any other factor, but it ***is*** for e-bikes ***and*** scooters and looks identical to the one that came from my 11x clone.  $1,000 shippped?  I just bought a used scooter for $400.  It came with a 52v 20Ah battery as well.  Because it was busted (arrived water damaged) I was shocked to find that the seller is sending a new battery rather than giving me a refund.  That is why I am revisiting this post, so the blatantly wrong information isn't perpetuated.  Another point, a lot of the batteries I saw on Amazon this evening were warehoused in California.  First stop from China, yes, but also some of the strictest environmental codes as well as consumer protection and products liability laws.  So to suggest that these are \"absolute fire hazards\" and \"filled with sand\" is just uninformed and reactionary.  Battery prices, like scooter prices, are going down.  They should be.  After all my friend, as an offshoot to this original little thread, ***MADE ME BY HAND*** a 36V battery which powered a small scooter.  Riding scooters is magical.  But they are not powered by magic.",

"comment": "Where do you live? In South/Central TX, anytime I drive more than half an hour I'm going to be adjusting the temperature. I'll definitely be adjusting HVAC outlets to blow directly at me or not. Apparently those have motors attached to them and you can't simply manually adjust them in some EVs, which is the dumbest possible control scheme for that. I'll also be driving through areas with spotty or no cell service and in multiple radio markets, so I'll be swithing inputs and stations. \n\nI agree that a lot of cars have too many buttons and knobs, but I regularly use and want simple tactile controls for audio and HVAC.",

It’s not that I’m saying this is wrong, but it’s not obvious to me why it’s true.  We could just have Tesla, Rivian, Lucid and other new manufactures replace all the old ones that can’t or won’t make the change.  There are too many manufactures.  The industry has know this for years.  There are way too many models.  Some manufacturers have a single profitability model that props up the rest of the models that lose money.

"comment": "Of course. When you select an orange DCFC icon on the PlugShare app it includes the Electrify America icon or says “Tesla” on the first line so I know what brand it is. FPLs chargers only say the location and what charger types are available. It seems the FPL chargers aren’t “coded” as FPL branded. I would 10,000% rather charge with FPL than EA given EA’s reliability issues and that I don’t want to hang in the back of a Walmart parking lot.\n\nFor example, pull up the two DCFCs at the Port St. Lucie/Port Pierce Service Plaza in Florida on the PlugShare app. I can click the right orange icon and know it’s Tesla, but how would I know quickly that the left orange icons were FPL? Neither line has FPL and there’s no logo (same for the next stop at West Palm Beach Service Plaza - except no Tesla). I’d have to open it up and scroll all the way down to find out the brand. Under the “network” filter there’s also no FPL filter despite it being one of the largest networks in one of the largest states.",

"comment": "Actually, 2018 is not all that long to be in solar, just the beginning of the gold rush. We were fooling around with PV when i was in electrical engineering at Rutgers in the late 70's.  Flat commercial roofs, and ground mounts, came way before roof mounted residential systems. Because of their inefficiency, they needed a lot of open space. \n\nThe first known functioning solar panels were put on a flat apartment building roof in New York City, in 1883, by Charles Fritts, an American inventor. Their efficiency was 1%, but you have to start somewhere.\n\nRoof mounted resi systems didn't start becoming economically feasible until the development of thin film silicon ribbon crystal modules in 1976 by Sharp. The history leading up to that:\n\n1883 - first system\n1888 - first US patent granted for a \"solar cell\"\n1901 - Nicholas Tesla patented the first \"solar panel\" 1954: Bell Labs physicists Pearson, Chapin, and Fuller invented the first \"high power\" silicon solar photovoltaic cell in the Murray Hill facility\n1954 - the same 3 made improvements to the design and strung together several cells and called it a \"solar battery\"\n1963 - Sharp produced a viable PV module of silicon, which led to successful mass production of solar panels. 1973 - the first PV powered building was built by University of Delaware, called \"Solar One\"\n1999 - Germany launches the \"100,000 Solar Roofs\" program, a $500M project pivotal in creating the residential solar industry.\n2005 - The Energy Policy Act created the 30% tax credit for commercial and residential solar systems.\n\n*Credits: Smithsonian, American Physical Society, US Dept of Energy",

"comment": "I forgot to mention a congrats on the staggered roof feet, that's another great practice. I very much agree with all of your line of thinking. We use a [similar splice kit](http://www.idealindustries.com/products/wire_processing/heat_guns/thermo-shrink_splices.jsp), although I'm actually not sure if using such kits inside habitable buildings is code-compliant. But then again, upsizing the wire reduces heat, and the Enphase coupler is only compatible with #12 TC-ER cable! It's an issue I've taken up with Enphase - they don't seem very committed in making their coupler an actually useful product. Running TC-ER into the attic, adding a junction box for your Romex, and then hitting the service panel would be a very simple, elegant, NEC compliant design!\n\nIn my mind, Enphase really needs to make their couplers a) cheaper and b) compatibly with #10 TC-ER cable. \n\nI'm also not so sure how I feel about the bare copper going inside the building, as the point is that during a ground fault, that's your path to ground! So if it's being used as such, I'd rather that current and heat stay outside the building. But I understand your aesthetic consideration. It might be worth upsizing the ground wire and insulating it.\n\nI also am very much in your line of thinking with the Romex. NEC 2014 pretty much allows you to connect up to a 15kW system to a 200A service panel, and with the AC disconnect being a jurisdictional requirement, you might want to think about simply tying into the service panel with an AFCI breaker (if you are allowed to remove the AC disconnect). If you have to use the disconnect, then I think you have a pretty optimal solution.\n\nAnyway, it takes someone with a good head on their shoulders to come to your conclusions.\n\nTake a look at the [Cali Fire Code Roof Access Requirements](http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/education/southeast_training_network/Background%20on%20CA%20PV%20Installation%20Guide.pdf). The residential rule of thumb is \"can a fireman run up one side of the roof, scamper across / cut a vent in the ridge of the same surface, and then escape down the other side/hip/valley.\" \n\nNot many people are utilizing it, but look at it this way, you just mention that your designs are compliant with the standard fire code out in California, because when it becomes standard in Louisiana five years from now, the home owner won't have to rip out their solar array to make their home fire code compliant. Then ask the home owner if any other installer has even mentioned 2014 fire code requirements. That ought to get you a few downpayments right there.\n\nLouisiana is smart about their solar incentives. \"Lets put our solar subsidy into the market which creates the most jobs, raises the most home value, and its straight forward\".",

"comment": "I noticed that a lot of solar installers have 'Free Quote' on their websites, but poach your contact information out of you, call you back and give you a 'sales pitch'. \n\nSo I built a simple solar calculator to estimate the costs and benefits of switching to solar, using data collected from across Michigan. This does not replace a site-visit from an installer, but it is a good place to start visualizing your system. Solar markets in Michigan are nascent, so I built this to help residents and installers identify the benefits of solar. \n\n**Assumptions:** No shading with clear solar window through the year. (snow is okay) \n\n**Full Disclosure:** Not a solar installer, just a grad student trying to make this easy for everyone. I am not even a fan of Michigan's Renewable Energy Policy, and [I document why on my website here](http://abhilashkantamneni.com/of-turnips-and-panels-a-critical-look-at-michigans-renewable-energy-policy/). \n\n**Sources:**\nSolar Irradiation Data from [NREL SAM Modeling Tool](https://sam.nrel.gov/)\n \nUtility rates from MPSC (Michigan Public Service Commission) [utility rate books]\n (http://www.michigan.gov/mpsc/0,1607,7-159-16377_52818_53477-214344--,00.html).\n \n Utility rate increases from [MPSC statistical data compilation](http://www.dleg.state.mi.us/mpsc/electric/download/rates1.pdf)\n Loan rate and interest from [MichiganSaves.org](http://michigansaves.org/)\n \n Envoirnmental Impact calculations made using [US EPA](http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/refs.html). \n\n**Bonus:** [Complete Guidebook for going solar in Houghton](http://abhilashkantamneni.com/everything-you-ever-needed-to-know-about-solar-energy-in-houghton/) (and Michigan).

"comment": "I think the law of demand is above empirical test. If the price of a good goes up and demand goes up, it only means demand would have gone even higher if the price had remained the same.\n\nOf course, demand is less sensitive to price in cases where the price is pretty low already, and/or there are few satisfactory substitutes: if you went to the grocery store and found out that the price of salt had doubled, almost everybody would still be buying the salt. But people already think the price of coal power and of gasoline is rather steep, and technological alternatives are advancing all the time.\n\nIndeed, we have seen a significant shift away from oil in this decade. Sadly, much of that shift has been to another fossil fuel, natural gas; but we do see used car lots full of unneeded SUVs and pickup trucks while electric and hybrid vehicles, practically non-existent ten years ago, are now considered among the best cars you can own. Solar panels have become a common sight on the roofs of both homes and businesses. Popular magazines are full of tips for lowering your energy bill by insulating your attic, getting a tankless water heater, switching to CFLs, etc. Money matters to people.",

Which one depends on when they qualified.  \n\nIt's confusing but Commonwealth Solar II is a MassCEC grant, whereas the S-REC II is administered by the DOER to sustain the industry until we hit 1600MW (we are currently at about 875MW qualified under the cap).  \n\nRight now all generation is getting SREC II AND Net metering PLUS any optional programs that they sign up for like the FITC or MassCEC grants and awards.   The first two things I listed is simply how much they get for their generation rather than investing in solar.",

I know this is much higher then most people work with for residential batteries, but, it is actually pretty similar to the Powerwall ouput voltage. \nI think the 48V convention in batteries is more of an anachronism that´s been baked into the design of Pb acid batteries. Given all the comments about the difficulties of the individual cell monitoring and all that, your best bet might be to leave the pack alone, transplant the battery with all of its electronics and charging and monitoring hardware, and simply try to use the 360V out rather than touching anything in the cells. You could just add another inverter that can accept that voltage (SMA Sunny Boy, etc). By the way, what is the voltage of your solar system? What is the max input voltage of your inverter? If you have a low-voltage inverter than you could also look at down-converting the 360V to 48V using a 600V MPPT charge controller backwards (this would be cheaper than buying another inverter).\n\nThe biggest problem with the above would be the efficiency hit for charging off AC rather than DC, but I think that the fact that you can use all the existing charging electronics directly might make it worth it...",

"comment": "Not to mention that this huge setback has gotten individuals motivated to take action. I know people in my community who have switched to alternative fuels for their cars even if they don't buy electric, people who are switching entirely from meat to a vegetarian or vegan diet, I've gotten dozens of my friends to donate to environmental causes like Carbotax and the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nSolar panels and EV fuel stations dot towns and country that once housed gas stations and coal-fired power plants. There are now a fraction of the coal plants in this country that there were even at the beginning of Obama's term - for Trump to get it back to that rate is going to be difficult, let alone to bring them back as quickly as Obama got rid of them.\n\nAnd the fact that you care is huge. Take two or more friends with you and act. The problem is big but a solution is made of a ton of people doing little things.\n\n**Really late edit:** I just want to add that none of this is a reason to get complacent. The environmental situation is still dire, and none of the above happens unless you personally take matters like recycling, reducing your consumption, and buying environmentally friendly products (when you do have to consume) into your own hands.",

"comment": "I've read the book associated with this org, and they note that all their projections assume that prices stay as they are now, and efficiency of the tech as well. \n\nWith wind and solar especially, costs of installation have been plummeting and seem likely to continue doing so. For this reason returns are expected to increase, hopefully making those payback windows shorter and shorter. The initial cost of 10kW of solar panels has gone from $100,000 to $14,000 in my country in the last few years alone. \n\nBut, yeah, the fact that there are assumptions on all things in drawdown.org remains, so I think they the site is a good way to see possible potential rather than actual projections.",

"comment": "Like Trump, you don’t understand the basic principles these deals are founded upon.\n\nEssentially, every person has the right to emit an equal amount of carbon. Wealthy countries have emitted the majority of the added carbon in the atmosphere so far, benefiting a small minority of the world's population. Countries like India and China are lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and one way or another this is going to result in increased fossil fuel emissions - though currently still less per capita than the West emits. Any practical climate deal has to acknowledge that this is fair enough - a blanket 80% reduction across all nations would be relatively easy on the rich and hell for the poor, in aid of avoiding a catastrophe that can largely be laid at the feet of the wealthiest, yet will incinerate poor countries much sooner. \n\nA fair and practical deal involves rich countries making very large percentage reductions, creating headroom for less developed countries to increase their emissions more safely, as well as sending money to produce solar panels and wind turbines. In return, those countries agree to peak their emissions much earlier than they might otherwise and attempt to decouple their growth from emissions. \n\nYour talk of Canada reducing emissions while India gets to increase theirs slightly obscures the fact that India emits nearly two tons per person while Canada emits **fifteen**. Not including emissions from the fuels Canada is greedily extracting and selling abroad. So righteous indignation directed in this direction appears to be absurdly self serving.",

It might be worth it to satisfy my personal curiosity...\n\nThe problem with doing net metering now, adjusting later, is that there's a good chance I'd have to replace a lot of equipment now.  Also, beyond just net metering, I would like blip ridethrough and the ability to ride through power outages, which a pure grid tied system won't get me.  Battery + generator, while not the cheapest solution, gets me unlimited (mostly) off grid run now, while letting me adapt in the future... I think. :)\n\nI assume the Powerwall talks over Modbus/Canbus, like the 1st gen, but I can't find a register map for it *anywhere.*",

"comment": "Technically the boiling point is the point where the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.\n\nYou can increase the vapor pressure by heating the liquid, or you can lower the atmosphere of pressure by pulling a (partial) vacuum. \n\nAt standard temp (25C) water has some vapor pressure which is why it slowly evaporates.  \n\nYou can theoretically slowly turn salt water into clean water by putting it in a (warm 25C+) pipe and move air through the pipe to a colder section where the clean water vapor condenses into liquid .\n\nThe rate is the real issue.\n\nIn a survival situation you can use a hole in the ground filled with \"bad\" water and a clean plastic tarp covering it will slowly allow the vapor to condense and drip into a collection container.\n\nThe real issue is providing enough water for a village. A single person would need a large surface area of slowly evaporating water and a village would need a huge surface area of slowly evaporating water. Or a lot of heat.\n\nBut heat in Africa seems to be in abundance, which makes me think mirrors and a heat collector might be an alternative. \n\nSolar panels are at the point where they are almost cheaper and definitely more compact solution than using heat, but if cost is the main factor then mirrors and heat collection might make sense .\n\nEdit-\n\nWith a high concentration of dissolved solids (high salinity) the more heat you need to increase the vapor pressure. So it takes more energy to evaporate salt water than it does to evaporate pure water.\n\nAlso you can cool the water and reduce the salinity because colder water has less ability to keep dissolved solids in solution, but again it takes energy to do that.\n\nIn theory you can use gravity alone to power the entire thing, but in that case you can set up a hydro power plant and make electricity to use reverse osmosis...\n\nIn short there are a lot of solutions, all of which require money and infrastructure .",

Always safer to go with a supplier you feel will be around in a few years to honor any warranty issues, etc.\n\nThe list is updated quarterly, here it is for 1Q2019:\n\n • Canadian Solar\n • LG\n • Hanwha\n • Risen\n • LONGi\n • HT-SAAE\n • NSP (Neo Solar Power)\n • Seraphim\n • Astronergy\n • Talesun\n • Trina Solar\n • Jinko Solar\n • Hansol\n • GCL Systems\n • JA Solar\n • REC Group\n\n\nTier 1 Qualifications:\nTo qualify for the Bloomberg Tier 1 list, and listed in order of accomplishment, a manufacturer needs to prove: \n\n  • At least 6 different projects of 1.5 MW’s or more in the past 2 years\n\n  • Which have received non-recourse debt financing by 6 different banks (where available – otherwise additional documentation is needed)\n\n  • Manufacturers need to own production facilities and the brand name\n\n  • Cannot have filed bankruptcy, insolvency, or defaulted on bond payments",

"comment": "15.84kW system with 2 Powerwall 2’s. \n\nWe used 989kWh and produced 1,088 for the month.  That left us with a credit of 169kWh, which may come in handy this month, since it’s been raining so much that our system isn’t producing a ton of power.  \n\nWhen we built the system it was only supposed to offset 74% of our energy consumption.  We left the ac on 24/7, so we used a lot of power.    On top of solar loan we were still getting $80-$110 a month electric bills, which we hated.  \n\nThis year we got a Trane XV20i Ac unit and it drastically lowered our energy consumption, even though the unit is on for about 18-20 hours a day.   It uses so little power and keeps the house super cool, even at higher temperatures.  The new AC made it more comfortable for us at home, and was the key factor in making my system go from 74% offset to almost 100% energy offset.   I say this because I don’t know if I’ll be this lucky every month, but I’ll keep on checking.  Just a few good sunny days this month can allow me to build credits again, even though we used about 150kWh more than we produced.  The net metering credits might come in handy.  \n\n\nI’m guessing around 11-6pm, any solar that meets our energy consumption is cancelled out, which is why it looks like our system produced so little.    I can’t give an accurate description since our bill is from 5-02-2020 - 6-03-2020, and my tesla app only gives me month by month details.    I could go do it manually, but I’ll take TECO on their word.  \n\nI have two delta inverters, but think they are kind of holding my system back.  I didn’t know anything about this at the time of the install, but I think my system caps out at 12.8kW. I have seen 12.9kW, but it’s very rare.",

"comment": "Demand curves are often bimodal (morning and late afternoon) already, without solar.  The midday dip pushes some natural gas plants offline or into reduced production modes of operation.   \n\nIssues can arise if required ramp rates exceed the rate(s) available.   Energy storage systems are able to quickly and efficiently take advantage of the associated price spikes. \n\n&gt;Utilities do not need more midday power.\n\nMaybe your utility, but here in Texas, ERCOT's peak demand period is 2-6pm with peak prices forward of peak demand.   So additional solar is absolutely welcome and very cost effective. \n\n&gt;Utilities need to have power produced during system peak in order for it to actually have meaningful reductions to capital expenditures.\n\nSo solar (and coastal wind) is a great fit currently. \n\n&gt;Therefore, mandated rooftop solar does nothing except cost you money for the solar array and cost the utility money because they still build out infrastructure for a growing system peak-- which means costs you more money. \n\nNo.  Many utilities here in Texas (a non-net metering state) offer both net metering agreements and rebates on systems.   They aren't doing this out of the goodness of their hearts.   They do this because it actually lowers their peak demand and produces electricity at the very times electricity is the most expensive.  It doesn't take very many hours of $1-9/kWh wholesale electricity prices to completely offset a year's worth of retail rate net metering. \n\n&gt;Net metering is a figurative idea and not actually how energy works. Energy is mostly consumed on demand.\n\nTrue,  but somewhat misses the point. Net metering is an incentive structure.  Some places have good programs, some are ridiculously in favor of the customer, some places have none. My preference is real-time wholesale pricing of excess power.",

I was sure that my rooftop solar array would provide all the electricity my home and my EV would need! \\[grin\\]\n\nTo be fair, apparently a typical rooftop collection system can supply a large portion of a normal home's electricity needs. That comes with a big asterisk of course: peak demand, storage, and so on. I got some recent quotes on a rooftop system. It's enticing, appears it would pay for itself, but not in less than 20-25 years. If you're eligible for a 25% tax credit and/or you live in an area where the utility is forced to buy your surplus electricity at a lucrative rate, it may make more economic sense -- for you, not necessarily for the overall economy!",

We put up an underlayment of clear plastic roofing. solved the problem.\n\nYou can buy a waterproof awning framework specifically for solar but it would have been $25K-$50K more for the same installation. \n\nExample\n\n[http://www.strutchannelfittings.com/Waterproof-Solar-Roof-Structures--Perfect-Protection-for-Your-Car-Veranda-Porch-Childrens-Play-Ground-Barn-and-Semi-Shaded-from-UV\\_c\\_167.html](http://www.strutchannelfittings.com/Waterproof-Solar-Roof-Structures--Perfect-Protection-for-Your-Car-Veranda-Porch-Childrens-Play-Ground-Barn-and-Semi-Shaded-from-UV_c_167.html)",

"comment": "In OP's case, the battery is still there maintaining frequency on the microgrid, but is full and isn't charging or discharging.  99% of electrons go straight from the solar into your appliances.\n\nThis only works because if a cloud passes overhead, the battery will instantly start discharging to make up for lost solar power.  Otherwise, your power would blip on and off all day as clouds pass by and loads turn on that exceed the panel's real-time output.  It would have the potential to damage your home appliances and computers from so many brown-out conditions.",

"comment": "Spending less energy is absolutely right. \nYour take on batteries is however not fully correct. The lifetime is not an absolute number but depends on a lot of variables [1]. Batteries for electric vehicles optimize this already which is why they last much longer than those batteries in other consumer products. It also depends on when you declare a battery as dead. Typically that's 70% of charge left. Usage beyond that point is still possible. \n\nBattery storage has the advantage to provide power within a few seconds. Conventional power plants need Typically minutes to hours before providing power. This makes them a good tool for stabilizing the grid. \n\nThere are also other storage solutions like heat storage [2] that can also provide buffer energy. We also have other options and I would rather see the money spend there than on nuclear or fossils. \n\nYour take on nuclear energy is strange; if you say that 10 years is a pipe dream, then how does this differ from the dream of using nuclear energy? The construction time alone for a nuclear power plant is around 7 years [3], which doesn't include planning. \n\nOn the last part, I totally agree - we're running out of time and we need solutions yesterday. It's depressing me a lot that the energy hunger of bitcoin alone grows quicker than we're building renewable energy. \n\n[1]  https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries\n[2] https://www.siemensgamesa.com/products-and-services/hybrid-and-storage/thermal-energy-storage-with-etes\n[3] https://www.statista.com/statistics/712841/median-construction-time-for-reactors-since-1981/",

"comment": "I wouldn’t buy more than your peak demand because net metering is about to go to shit. Why would a utility pay you $.20 when they can buy wholesale solar for two cents. Utilities are going to flood the market with solar and you’ll get pennies on the dollar for excess capacity in a matter of a few years.  Those economics might change if you get storage or an EV with vehicle to grid capability.  Storage has value, and your utility won’t be offering it for free for long.  Peak pricing is about to become when the sun is shining, unless you’re in a wind rich area such as Texas.\n\n100% offset is a solar sales scam.  The reps may not be aware of it, based on their training, but management surely is.\n\nAlso, the industry is terrified of Tesla due to their low overheads. It doesn’t leave much room for sales commissions.  Expect down votes from anyone competing with Tesla.\n\nThey are the E*TRADE in a world of commission brokers, who retire off your savings.\n\nI only wish Tesla would enter the real estate market and break that stranglehold.\n\nDon’t buy a 20 year production contract you can’t use, unless you have a 20 year sales contract you can.",

If they don't, it's not because of efficiency.\n\nIn solar panels efficiency just means how big the panels are, that is how much space they take up. With 22% efficiency panels you can fit 220W into 1sq meter, where with 21% panels you can only fit 210W.\n\nYou should be concerned with $/W, not efficiency, especially if you are doing ground mount and are not worried about roof space (the big difference really is higher efficiency panels can fit more watts on your roof)",

Then, I saw you post about how “food insecurity is a lie” while billions face food insecurity every day.\n\nNormally I wouldn’t debunk such obvious trolling but I feel like I have to for the impressionable minds who read this crap and don’t have the time to fact check.\n\n#I just completed my B. Arch Thesis on a vertical farm tower.\n\nIn a nutshell, the significance of vertical farming is efficient land and water usage. I calculated that 4 square miles of barley can consolidate in my 500’ tower. Go higher and you have more square miles. In so doing, you are using 90% less water, 100% less glyphosate/atrazine and creating a healthier, tastier food product.\n\nBut as you mentioned, there is an undeniable energy consumption cost. The question then becomes is it worth the trade off for increasing energy usage if you are cleaning the water cycle and cleaning our food products? Then the next question is what the energy source is: are we talking coal, gas, wind, solar, hydro, or nuclear? If it’s a renewable source, then, no, you’re not contributing to pollution. Within the 4 square miles  I packed into my tower there is more than enough space for a solar array, perhaps placed on top of industrial crops like hemp as “agrivoltaics”, to power the farm AND have some left over to sell to the grid.\n\nThen there is the question about “embodied” carbon. How much energy is used to make the steel of the building and its racks? A non-zero number. Putting aside what the source of energy is, there is a ROI for the upfront carbon spent and the water saved. It is a trade off between energy (and a possible but not guaranteed carbon pollution) and water. If you can use nuclear for base load + solar suburbia and wind where it makes sense geographically, then it’s not necessarily evil to build things, which is basically what your post implies.\n\nIf you oppose vertical farming still, then go look up glyphosate and atrazine and its impacts on the human body. They are far worse than the amount of carbon *not necessarily* needed to build the farm itself. Once we have a green energy grid, again, responding to geographical limitations of solar/wind/nuclear/hydro/LNG where they are most appropriate.\n\nIf you are still not convinced…. More money for me I guess.",

You've got 20ish amps to spare on that transformer.\n\nWill the electric company allow you to back feed that transformer?

You talk about roads, but this is a total non sequitur. The laundry list of criteria is both short and easily resolved. No, no one *needs* a nuclear plant in an industrial area, but it certainly can't hurt. Finally, it categorically does kill birds. There are so many independent studies proving this it's not even funny. Great, ban housecats. You still have other shit killing birds. I agree that solar is preferable to coal, oil, or natural gas, but I don't think it's the best option.",

Nature is the executioner. \n\nIt doesn't give a shit about culling a few billion humans with massive crop failure and weather disasters over the next 16 to 100 years. \n\nNever forget our species (as a whole) isn't suppose to survive global climate destabilization. The sooner you accept this the better. Places with dense population levels that rely on a lot of imported food are absolutely 100% fucked. (China, India, parts of Africa, some cities in the USA, and Bangladesh come to mind)  \n\nYou as a Scientifically literate human see what's coming. Plan accordingly. Do not let yourself and your family be a victim of circumstance. \n\nPersonally I've got a very large family and I've accepted that some of them are just too stupid (and fearful in general) to act. They seem stuck .. like a deer in the headlights. Many of them aren't Scientifically literate. \n\nI'm planning on leaving the USA for a country in the northern hemisphere or far, far southern hemisphere. I think the USA is not going to be an ideal climate or culture to stay here. \n\nThe plan is to build a super insulated Earthship style home, build an mostly automated drip irrigation garden(s) specializing in crops that are heat tolerant and low water tolerate plants. While getting that going I'll build a food forest around the garden. \n\nEarthship homes heat and cool themselves passively, harvest all it's own electricity via solar panels and small windmills, harvest rain water for drinking and everyday use via a specially shaped roof. They can also grow a small amount of food inside (depending on climate) .",

A regular house/farm can produce many times what it can store and make available to be consumed by others. Central energy companies consider this a threat, and instead of supporting production of clean energy, they hand out state promotions in the form of reduced taxes. This is the libertarian economy like Allan Greenspan should have promoted. In oil, everyone is allowed to buy a donkeyhead and pump oil, but now, in electricity, the state,  socialists, demand to approve.  Please educate the people, bring small units around, because they are economically viable and should be profitable. But the state will try to block the individual. That is communism. Making it not profitable requires that they lowered electricity prices for everyone. It is a commodity of great demand - in a regulated market.",

"comment": "&gt; Well, I do believe that bees can suffer. They have brains. They have the same evolutionary reason to be able to feel pain -- i.e. they can choose to move away from it, something that plants and rocks cannot. They are social animals even.\n\nI respect that you have this belief, but the fact of the matter is that the issue is still not clear, and there are conflicting opinions in the scientific community. Keep in mind that we can create materials, machines and computer programs that move away from a source of injury. They don't feel pain; it's just a programmed reflex. Insects don't have nociceptors (the pain receptors that mammals have), and it's unclear whether they have an analogue for our subjective experience of pain, or whether it's just a reflex that doesn't cause them to suffer.\n\n&gt; Do you think they are just little automatons?\nIn the same way that humans are automatons; yes. We are all biological machines.\n\n&gt; And if so, what do they have to do to prove that they are sentient -- and how do we see that in other animals like chickens or cows or fish?\n\nThat's a big question. There have been libraries written on the subject of sentience and animal cognition. I'm afraid I can't give you a succinct answer, but you could start [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience#Animal_rights_and_sentience).\n\nI think we have a tendency to anthropomorphise other entities that have similar appearances or mannerisms to us. If we see an insect perform a complex behaviour that we associate with humans, we tend to project other traits of our conscious experience onto them. This doesn't mean the insects *don't* possess those traits; it just means we should be careful about making assumptions that aren't supported by scientific evidence.\n\n&gt; And I must correct you on the ethical principle behind veganism being \"suffering minimisation\". It is not. It is to reduce exploitation and cruelty. That is not the same thing. Exploitation and cruelty are about what we do to them, and about our intentions. \n\nI think about this in terms of Singer's view of suffering, which is a bit wider than the layman's view. It includes exploitation and cruelty; I think these are forms of suffering.\n\n&gt; Suffering is on their side and is an inherent part of life. It is not inherently wrong to suffer, but causing certain kinds of suffering are wrong. \n\nPerhaps you mistook me. I am not suggesting it is inherently wrong to suffer; I am suggesting that we should do what we can to avoid *causing* it. I suppose suffering minimisation is not quite the meaning I wanted to convey. More precisely, I think the ethical principle behind veganism is: avoiding the consumption of products that cause or contribute to animal suffering/exploitation/cruelty. As you alluded to, situations that involve conflicts of interest, or that don't involve consumption, are outside the scope of veganism.\n\n&gt; One could try to justify some forms of exploitation by saying that it \"minimizes suffering\", but that does not make it right. For example, enslaving others for your amusement and justifying it by saying that the life you give them is better -- or even killing others as death is the ultimate minimization of suffering.\n\nI would say these examples are mis-uses of the utilitarian principle. But anyhow, it's beside the point of what we're talking about.\n\n&gt; Minimization of suffering is a utilitarian principle, but not a vegan one. And it's how we get utilitarian groups like PETA that kill thousands of adoptable animals themselves and promote the gassing of chickens. Neither of those are vegan.\n\nI'm not sure if I'd call PETA utilitarians. They euthanise adoptable animals, regardless of whether their adoption would increase the overall happiness of the affected parties. Basically they're ideologues who believe that under no circumstances is it permissible to keep pets.",

There are billions of examples of people quietly observing their religion with no ill will towards their fellows, yet you lump them all into one group, the same way we peaceful vegans are lumped in with the arrogant, judgmental, downright preachy vegans.   \nJust as you say religion = conquer and destroy, which though sometimes true isn't always, anyone can say veganism = unhealthy, which is *also* sometimes but not always true.  \nIf you don't see the similarity... then this has been fun, have a nice day!",

My family keeps trying to treat it like rice, but it's not nearly as bland as rice and it doesn't really work out for me, but they seem to have no tastebuds and don't mind. Do you have any recipes you'd recommend?\n\nYeah, quinoa is great but it's definitely not rice. I like adding some seasoning like veggie stock cubes into the cooking water. It's also great added to soup. My husband has made it up with sweet stuff like oatmeal-style before. That was interesting but kind of good. It does take getting used to. \n\nAnd yay, almond milk!",

Products that contain egg or dairy?\n\nThis isn't a popular opinion around here, but, I consider myself a \"best effort vegan\" or a \"non-perfectionist vegan.\" I won't eat meat. I don't drink milk. I try not to buy items with egg or dairy in them. I will occasionally eat an item that has egg or dairy in it under certain circumstances- like if a coworker buys me a vegetarian item not understanding the difference between vegan &amp; vegetarian. Although more and more they are coming to understand that I also don't want items with egg or dairy. Also, I don't freak out if I accidentally get something with egg or dairy in it, I make a mental note of it and devise a strategy for avoiding it in the future. I guess what I'm saying is, I feel like for the society I find myself trapped in, being a vegan 97 to 99% of the time is an achievable level and I feel like I'm doing something positive. I understand that not everyone agrees with me and there is definitely a disagreement about my understanding of what it means to consider oneself a vegan and some other people's. I share all this with you not to encourage you to follow in my footsteps but, only because you mention that where you live is not veg-friendly (come to SLC, we have 11 vegan eating establishments in addition to all the veg-friendly places) and I'd hate for you to give up on the process if you're finding it difficult to achieve \"perfection.\"",

"comment": "You can change how *individuals* react to you and your beliefs if you can learn how to resist this kind of peer pressure. The first thing to do is recognize what it is: their response to a perceived threat. I was bullied and isolated as a kid, so I'd say at this point that I've spent my entire life learning to deal with peer pressure of all kinds. The pressure is not exactly about your lifestyle, it's an attempt to make you *fit in*. They are responding not to the fact that you're vegan but that you have the temerity to question the status quo.\n\nIf you want to learn more, you can read about the [Asch conformity experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) and [The Third Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave). I find it helpful to understand the psychology of the bully before I confront that bully. I actually have an example from just last night of [one confrontation with a bully](http://np.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/2co5wa/pro_lifers_are_like_militant_vegans/cjia0cx) (please don't participate). I don't expect people to agree with my positions on stuff, but I do expect a certain level of respect. If I don't get it, I stop arguing my position and instead address the nature of the behaviour I'm encountering. You can't advocate a position effectively if the other person is just seeking a chance to reprimand you for having dared question them.\n\nSo my advice is this. Focus on the behaviour, not the person. Do not attempt to explain your ideas to a hostile audience. Address the hostility first. Later, you can explain yourself from a place of mutual respect. Above all, remember that you are dealing with a human being who is probably a decent person, for the most part, but is confused and threatened by you. When you can understand that these reactions are based in fear, you can confront their fears, soothe them, make a new friend, and then, finally, a willing ear.\n\nIt's a long process, but if this gets hard for you all you have to do is remember the life of a typical chicken. You've got it a lot better than that.",

Forgive yourself for moments of weakness, remember that we humans make mistakes sometimes and keep at it - steady constant effort. Soon enough the subconscious will get the message, eating vegan will become automatic and when it happens, you will be freed from having to constantly make effort as it will be second nature. Keep going and never despair - success is right around the corner. It's a learning curve.",

Honey might also be in a lot of the sweet foods but I don't know for sure.\n\nWhen I travel I eat a lot of nuts and fresh fruits as snacks and to supplement meals because I KNOW they're vegan. Falafel and hummus should be safe no matter what. Download the google translate app and make a simple phrase like \"I cannot eat meat, chicken, fish/seafood, dairy (butter, cream, milk), eggs, or honey.\" I did this across Europe in French, Spanish, Catalan, and Italian and it helped a lot!!!!",

I don't find it edgy and cool and masculine to emphasize how much I don't love animals. I don't love most animals because I don't know most animals, but I sure love some animals, and I think all sentient animals are proper objects of love in the sense of goodwill, affection, and respect.\n\nEDIT: Yeah I totally deserved downvotes for that. God sometimes this sub is dumber than bread.",

"comment": "Most people recommend slowly cutting out animal products and replacing them with plants like beans and tofu. Depending on how you eat, a plant based diet can dramatically increase the amount of fiber compared to what you're used to eating (which is a good thing since most Americans don't get enough fiber). This can cause gas, bloating, and digestive discomfort. But your body will quickly adapt in a matter of weeks. Also because you're increasing your fiber intake, you are likely to feel fuller faster and eat less. This is why many new vegans feel tired during the first two weeks. They're simply not eating enough. Nutrient deficiencies take months to show up, so if you feel crappy it's almost always because you're body is adjusting from such a dramatic diet change and because you're not eating enough. The same crappy transition period happened to me when I did keto and paleo (oh how things have changed).\n\nWith that said, I recommend tracking your food for the first week or two with something like Cronometer so you can make sure you're eating enough. Oftentimes as omnivores we already had crappy eating habits and when we eat a vegan diet we can compound our already crappy habits. \n\nAdditionally, I recommend educating yourself on veganism and plant based diets. Some great vegan documentaries include What the Health, Vegucated, Cowspiracy, and Forks Over Knives, all of which are available on Netflix. Earthlings is the most powetful vegan documentary imo and it's on YouTube.\n\nAs for general eating tips, eat beans/tofu/tempeh/seitan(You gotta try seitan!) with most of your meals. Eat seeds like chia, flax, and hemp seeds for omega 3s as well protein and other minerals. Obviously eat lots of leafy greens. Go outside for vitamin D lol. Oatmeal + peanut butter + flaxseeds is a great low cost breakfast loaded with protein and healthy fats. I believe forksoverknives.com has a bunch of vegan recipes. There's also r/veganfoodporn. Oh and i almost forgot about B12. Pretty much the only nutrient you can't find in a vegan diet is B12. We feed livestock B12 supplements as well so think of it as cutting out the middle man. You can take it in supplement form or eat vitamin B12 fortified foods such as nooch aka nutritional yeast (this stuff is also the bomb. It goes great with vegan mac n cheese!)\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions :)",

The truth is most people (including myself) still value the delicious byproducts of a cows life than the cows life itself. Nothing in this information changes that.\n\nThe only argument for veganism that holds any weight for me is the efficiency argument. ie energy in vs energy out. I'd focus on that if you truly want to convince people vegan is a good idea. The moral argument just falls completely flat for most people. Not many people care that much about cows quality of life. \n\nEdit: to all those trying to shame me for not caring about farm animals suffering​ ...

Though, weed isn’t a necessity like food is, so I don’t know if you could call it vegan if it’s grown with animal products. Don’t get me wrong though, i smoke weed that I don’t know how it was grown all the time. It’s a really small worry in the overall view of things.",

So in this case, it’s very easy to avoid using this product.\n\nAnd then someone replies to me saying I “bring others down” and make it look like a religion 🙄. Had no idea stating my own preference when a question is literally asked, still gives other vegans a bad name.

Veganism is not about reducing suffering caused by others.  Veganism is an agent-oriented philosophy and creed of justice and the moral baseline that seeks to control the behavior of the moral agent such that one is not contributing to or participating in the deliberate and intentional exploitation, abuse, and/or killing of nonhuman animals outside of self-defense.  \n\nPeople subscribe to veganism as the moral baseline not because they want to change the world but because they do not seek to be part of any injustice.  Whether the world will turn vegan in the future or not has no bearing on the vegan moral agent's behavior with regards to the nonhuman animals. \n\nEvery single day on this subreddit, I deal with plant-based dieting speciesists professing to be \"vegan\" even as they happily and enthusiastically fund the violent abuse and killing of innocent animals by purchasing animal products to feed their pet carnivorous animals on basis of species.  \n\nThey refuse to change their behavior precisely because they do not believe they are commiting any injustice by purchasing animal products to feed others just as their meat-eating counterparts do not believe that they are committing injustice in purchasing animal products to feed themselves AND others.  \n\nThe point is that veganism is about *behavioral self-control*, not about outcomes, consequences, and the behavior of others.",

If lunch was a fresh salad ($1.50/TJ's lettuce mix, homemade seitan- about $1/serving, and some chopped veg/balsamic/olive oil... we could conservatively say $4 for the salad). Add a couple of pieces of fruit for snacks ($1, TJs apples are $3/2lb bag) and you spent $7.19 for the day, which comes out to $50/week and $200/month.",
