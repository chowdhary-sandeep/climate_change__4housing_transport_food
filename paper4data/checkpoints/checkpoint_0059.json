Anyway as Tesla adopted the Type 2 standard plug for it's European Model S and stays with a full proprietary plug in US, and the fact that US has already a different \"official\" standard than Europe, I could only see a split in the market between US and Europe. Japan would be more to US side IMO. Not sure about what will happen in China but as the rest of the world they will follow either the US solution or the European one. Chademo is a standard allowing only DC with the need of another standard for AC charging so I see no future for it despite the fact they trend to have a worldwide solution at least. As I said I don't have enough information about the Tesla Europe solution but it seams to be the best of each world in one single and compact plug. I would love to see it being adopted as it worldwide but it's probably not gonna happen. The only hope in a worldwide standardisation will be with induction charging if IEC and co doesn't make the same mistakes as before.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004514944109056766,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06262459750246308,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16573186119168376,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1928111563126246,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1677968511875395,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20602379242889737,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.011692464351654053,"ev_1":-0.14420133202597718,"ev_2":-0.007523487987782573,"ev_3":-0.0038923835454625078,"ev_4":-0.027987544466062293,"ev_5":-0.00791696263574219,"ev_6":-0.0151309276673904},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

With electric cars, you consolidate power. Coal fire plants power a lot of things and there is less waste compared to the excess heat generated by petrol.\n\nBut there are serious environmental concerns with electric cars. Battery production is a big one. There's also battery recycling, and the entire process around that. \n\nI don't agree with attacking random stuff like this because it's the same tactic as climate change alarmist. \n\nThere is a lot of pollution out there, and many are much more damaging than CO2. The solution to those isn't more electric cars, but less cars in general. This doesn't matter as much in Germany as much of that nation is saturated with very good rail networks. Many of my German friends don't have cars, and the ones who do realize they're a luxury that they specifically want.\n\nReducing pollution is about reducing consumption in general. It goes at ends with the entire way the world economy works today. It wants to sell you thing. You buying worthless shit makes the world go round .. and dumps tons of waste into landfills in China .. far enough away from everyone so they forget. A lot of E-waste goes to Africa where kids dig through it for copper, instead of going through proper separation/smelter plants for safe, efficient recycling. \n\nCutting CO2 doesn't even scratch the issue of real pollution. Dealing with real waste and the things that will eat resources and harm our environment involves something much more uncomfortable than some symbolic carbon taxes (that just move CO2 waste to China), it means realizing we don't need as much, that we should demand stuff that lasts much longer and requires less replacement, and that shared public transit can reduce a lot more pollution and waste than continually creating new cars.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006999791658017784,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27596173193046525,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21561422432546004,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28591066345432853,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3201373554584232,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2635346628488077,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10133656677013884,"ev_1":-0.21168333399347428,"ev_2":-0.0014503735534769173,"ev_3":-0.0016088739491048425,"ev_4":-0.0016140944753715303,"ev_5":-0.0010204713204681564,"ev_6":-0.004273930477211252},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

The rest of the world will figure it out. A question is: should US made cars be able to be sold internationally? It'd be the benefit of the US.\n\nAlso you're missing that if you take a level of hybrid cars and BEV cars with similar net emissions, the upside of the latter is still huge.\n\n(1) There's more room for growth with further transitions to BEVs.\n\n(2) Improvements to the grid and electrical production will further allow BEVs to become cleaner over their lifetime, unlike with hybrids.\n\n(3) Reduction in dependence on foreign resources; how much money does the US transfer to oil states every year for oil? It's ~9m barrels per day=~$235b/year (and expected to increase this decade). That's a huge amount of money!\n\n(4) Localized pollution reduction. BEVs are zero emission at point of consumption.

Some people have bought second-hand cars their whole lives and have never taken a car to a dealer or an independent shop. Their whole life either and have saved a lot of money using the knowledge and skills they have to do it themselves. Now, there should be less maintenance with an EV, but when it does happen, you either need a warranty or have to pay a dealer to fix it. If they bought something with a combustion engine and a warranty, they could fix it themselves still when that warranty runs out. Again, I realize an EV would have much less maintenance. \n\nPart of the issue too though is that maybe people are buying second hand because they can't afford to buy new or slightly used. While the EV will cost less overall, they might not be able to even take on a payment to realize those gains. It still takes time for the EV to really start to pay for itself. The fuel savings and maintenance savings can make part of the payment, but when you fix your own stuff, it takes a little longer for that to happen. \n\nSome of it may be a little bit of a fear of the unknown without having experience with an EV. But if you are somewhat financially strapped and cns keep a little shitbox car going for well above the average mileage of a vehicle, why would you make the jump? \n\nAlso, new EV prices are definitely getting there and being comparable to combustion car prices and used model 3s are definitely in a reasonable range now, but it hasn't been real long especially considering the chaos the world has been in the past few years.

These are all legitimate reasons that people \"go solar.\" \n\nAs you said, solar thermal is much more efficient (per square foot) than PV but you need to use the energy as it is generated (can't sell it back to the utility.) Unless the system is way oversized for summer, you won't have enough thermal energy in winter to cover your hot water needs. What do you do then? Are there liquid fuels available (LP, oil, natural gas?) Are you going to have a boiler for space heat? Do you have a high and consistent hot water use (lots of laundry, bathing etc) or are you a small household (with a big house) that always showers at the gym and washes clothes in cold water? \n\nHeat pump water heaters are great IF you have waste heat in the mechanical room. But they are noisy and they cool off the room several degrees. Don't put one in a closet in the living space. \n\nUnfortunate that your utility is not offering a very good buy-back rate. Lobby your government to require net metering. Then it would probably be more advantageous to do PV. As is, hard to say without lots more details.\n\nContact a local solar installer (or 3) to get pricing. Try to find someone that has been in the industry for at least 5 years.  If they don't ask you all of these questions and more, they're probably not a very good choice.\n\nBy the way, here's a good write-up for using Leaf as emergency generator: [http://www.mynissanleaf.com/viewtopic.php?f=37&amp;t=13097](http://www.mynissanleaf.com/viewtopic.php?f=37&amp;t=13097)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00017456329684743346,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12079630103239651,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23129196589191756,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2994670072281096,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.37137922320754213,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2521941541582266,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22850881648870805,"solar_1":-0.08844656556660387,"solar_2":-0.12955043685724377,"solar_3":-0.009941012254481999,"solar_4":-0.03488347366995489,"solar_5":-0.0052728733426192775,"solar_6":-0.0937914303195161,"solar_7":-0.001705964178351375,"solar_8":-0.009761296164166803,"solar_9":-0.24277434712227355,"solar_10":-0.20535633030037084},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.

Humans happen to be the only chance Earth has right now of stopping an asteroid. Humans are also Earth's only hope of interplanetary exploration and emigration. The reason we have any hope of achieving these things is inherent to the fact that here are so many of us. It takes 7 billion humans to make a rocket to mars, or to develop commercially viable solar panels - for reference, see Earth.\n\nIs having a child ethical? I think most people's standard of ethics is based around harm/help to others, and I think it requires some mental tricks to conclude that a new life can be weighed in that ethics system without some very specific circumstances - e.g. Earth is at its maximum occupancy.

Surely you aren't going to pretend that we haven't had nearly three decades of poor policy that had nothing to do with the Paris Accord.\n\n&gt;At the same time, the policy being pushed by the current administration is extremely dangerous.\n\nAs we discussed very recently, fossil fuel resource constraints effectively rule out the \"extremely dangerous\" RCPs.\n\n&gt;Not only about climate change, but air pollution as well. Have you ever looked at the annual premature death count from air pollution published by the WHO?\n\nYes. There you go again, presuming that everyone who disagrees with you is less informed that you. If you want to play that game, let's play.\n\n- Have you contrasted the death rates in countries that use scrubbers with those that don't? \n\n- Have you looked at the embodied carbon represented by wind and solar? \n\n- How about embodied carbon in electric vehicles? \n\n- Have you seen the toxic lake in China that results from the production of solar panels?\n\n- Have you compared fatalities per TWh produced by energy source?\n\n&gt;Even if AGW didn't exist, getting rid of fossil fuels would be fully justified.\n\nReally? What are the causes of death in countries that don't have access to fossil fuels? Surely the people live longer, healthier lives, right?\n\nNow I'm going to dial back the rhetoric just a little here. I'm sure you assumed that we would replace fossil fuels with alternate energy sources when you asked the question. You don't strike me as a \"dark green,\" which refers to those who think we should all live in yurts and grow soybeans for whatever the hell those people eat, but as someone that recognizes the good side to modern civilization as well as the bad. To come full circle, then, we need policy that phases out fossil fuel use with energy sources that can compete on price, because energy is the master commodity of modern civilization. I assert, and I don't think you would disagree, that our energy policy over the last thirty years has not done much to satisfy both requirements.\n\nSo, with all of that as preamble, I present Will_Power's *Plan to Replace All Fossil Fuels by 2076*™. As the plan is long and time is short, here are some key elements in bullet form:\n\n- The cornerstone is advanced nuclear power. This begins with a focus on removing restrictions to R&amp;D by revamping the NRC, plus spending public funds to match private investment funds. \n\n- Fission is the focus for the first phase, particularly breeders reactors that can consume existing nuclear waste stockpiles. \n\n- Brayton Cycle research receives funding as well in order to allow advanced reactors to operate at higher temperatures (this is a good thing from a thermodynamics perspective) in order to massively reduce water requirements.\n\nAs these plants become commercialized:\n\n- Desalination plants are built near coastal cities. As their water needs are met with desalinated sea water, upstream water can be returned to previous uses, including growing forests.\n\n- Some surplus nighttime power charges EVs.\n\n- Other surplus nighttime heat and power is used to synthesize hydrocarbons as the US Navy has demonstrated (and as was done with the Fischer-Tropsch process clear back in WWII).\n\n- Waste heat runs steam plants for centralized heating of cities and towns.\n\n- PRT systems like /r/SkyTran start to replace personal vehicles.\n\n- Existing hydropower plants become huge energy storage systems as advanced nuclear displaces them for baseload. This aids intermittent sources like solar and wind.\n\nOther:\n\n- Solar and wind are built in areas of high insolation and stable winds, respectively,  *and where embraced by local residents*.\n\n- Mob grazing is used to enrich topsoil, which also sequesters carbon.\n\n- /r/Biochar is produced and used to sequester carbon in topsoil.\n\n- Fusion research is pursued at a later date.\n\nThose are the highlights. There's more, so feel free to hit me up with any questions.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.269880133865593,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2518162884553554,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1608438086179004,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.10140211839212142,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.13197464208250298,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25442685860448006,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.27676256927375104,"solar_1":-0.1052115493264273,"solar_2":-0.28358047566538286,"solar_3":-0.12551029603689226,"solar_4":-0.04075920131731771,"solar_5":-0.11124320644566268,"solar_6":-0.08988799946027001,"solar_7":-0.04540375673177813,"solar_8":-0.01445761237942347,"solar_9":-0.0233478934909499,"solar_10":-0.08852705448493105},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

The inverter and array are in gallons per hour (let's call these kw)\n\nYou need to size your system so that it collects enough so the tap can run and the jug still get filled so you can use it to run the tap when there's no rain.

So, couple of questions since I'm new to all of this.  1. Are my numbers OK?  ie can I expect the panel I bought to eventually charge those batteries?  2.  Can I splice or daisy chain the batteries together so there is only one input from the solar panels?  Any advice on the most efficient way to do that would be appreciated.  3.

Now it's clear solar energy can produce enough power but you need energy storage. Don't make the same mistake you made with solar and not look at the projected costs.\n\nProjected costs are going to show solar and energy storage beating out nuclear in x amount of years and that means that nuclear is a dead end technology and renewables and energy storage are the future.\n\nIf you think nuclear is the future, you're not as much of a science candidate as you think.\n\nTo be honest I don't think even fusion power makes sense because energy storage is pretty much 100% guaranteed to be easier than any type of nuclear power as is solar and wind and that's pretty much that.\n\nif you can make energy storage reasonably cheap enough there's almost no reason for nuclear power and since the long-term cost of waste storage and remediation is mostly unknown it's much safer to stay away from any type of large-scale nuclear power technology.\n\nit was also the simple fact that you can't easily proliferate nuclear power even at just the nuclear energy level. first off you don't have the number of scientists and engineers you would need to build nuclear all over the planet. Secondly you don't trust most of the countries around the planet to manage nuclear and the radioactive waste involved in such a process.\n\nof course the western nations would benefit since they're the only ones that can build the nuclear power and the developing nations would have to also effectively hire them to help manage the nuclear waste.\n\nSo you can spend decades doing that and probably barely get anywhere or you could just start buying solar panels and putting up wind turbines with full confidence that energy storage will be affordable enough in 20 years that you're not too worried about it.\n\nas long as the renewable energy is producing a low enough cost per kilowatt and you're not ridiculously over capacity, You're better off doing everything you can to avoid having to invest in nuclear because in like 40-60 years you'll be lucky if your nuclear facilities are still worth running.\n\nThat's what I mean by it's a dead end investment, it's going to take you 20 years just to get a percentage of them built and then 20 years after that they'll probably be one of the most expensive ways you have online to generate electricity.\n\nWhy do we want to invest in the most expensive ways to generate electricity that also produce pollution that we don't know how to clean up?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1820825986782097,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21171049618505006,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22303023313482603,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18297094394353713,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34435016838917226,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13011655421895044,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0075852833106182516,"solar_1":-0.09895487966212256,"solar_2":-0.2483706420930999,"solar_3":-0.06692861057222722,"solar_4":-0.05174587159005265,"solar_5":-0.013050418968002,"solar_6":-0.002891636332302975,"solar_7":-0.0019450583543706064,"solar_8":-0.003085936027976762,"solar_9":-0.05304163055067571,"solar_10":-0.27435626865460755},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

A small amount (at global scale) of excessive radioactivity because of rare accidents or bad practices has no consequence compared to the gigantic amounts of GHG we put in atmosphere... or thousands of liters of oil leaking in gulf of Mexico... \n\nAnd as you say, renewables also have intrinsic environmental drawbacks : for exemple solar photovoltaic requires 450 times the land surface used by nuclear to generate the same amount of energy, resulting in soil artificialization, loss of biodiversity (destruction of habitat, ...), sometimes loss of agricultural land... and nuclear emits less carbon per kWh than solar PV.\n\n\n&gt;I don't think anyone who sincerely advocates for renewable energy wants it done in conjunction with natural gas.\n\nNo of course, I'm pretty sure most people are sincere. But pernicious, repeated misinformation and lies from fossil fuel companies during decades has done their work. \n\nWe have to keep in mind that when nuclear share of energy production is reduced, CO2 emissions rise. Germany decided to phase out nuclear, aiming to 100% renewable power, before even considering phasing out coal, and its emissions rose significantly...\n\nMany experts agree that a 100 % renewable scenario cannot reduce GHG emissions quickly enough to meet our goals, and can even increase them for a while if we shut down nuclear too soon. However, shutting down all high carbon sources and replacing them with renewable and nuclear (to compensate intermittence of generation) would do it. \n\nI just wanted to share the fact that nuclear is an ally in our fight against climate change, complementary to renewables, and that many false ideas widespread in environmentalist communities are fake/overexaggerated informations originally created by fossil fuel companies.\n\nDon't be dogmatic, keep an open mind.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0014081519329920411,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2701830472905442,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1954285914683877,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.17381774230549732,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2598445195672462,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21886108325876014,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.4568612165749073,"solar_1":-0.07178328391613659,"solar_2":-0.15096395102141477,"solar_3":-0.234019815825377,"solar_4":-0.07049618145053198,"solar_5":-0.013709406835308377,"solar_6":-0.014916797352877134,"solar_7":-0.006262358650322615,"solar_8":-0.01251548508904913,"solar_9":-0.03077040655770702,"solar_10":-0.2247758539260758},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Boosting the cost of what the solar system would be. \n\nPossibly, the best local solar contractor around publishes that their costs currently sit at appx. $3 per installed watt and from there I figured I needed somewhere around 7-9KW system size to offset my \\~10MWh annual consumption.  At that low end, 7,000 watts = $21,000\n\nI have no real clue if that number they published is very current. \n\nI do know they recently installed a 240KW system at a local high school for $400,000 - so at that rate I could theoretically get a 9kw system for $15k - but I'm sure there were some economies of scale at work.\n\nParamount issue: I don't have much square footage of South facing roof space - basically half of my 400 sqft garage faces south and that's it. I do have a massive slab of east facing roof, however, that would have some limitations with evening production. East and west facing square footage is plentiful, east most of all.  Secondly, I would need to check with my HOA... Thirdly, my south facing and west facing roofs could pose a huge eyesore at the front of my house if done wrong. I would be 'that house' on the block that has the shiny crap on their roof. I also have very little back-yard space, we're on a 9,000sqft lot that backs up to a 13 acre shared lake and there's all this crap in our HOA about out-buildings and fences and whatnot so I don't think they'd be all that friendly to solar panels because of the scenery.\n\nI probably need to learn more about solar loans, better understand their terms and the methods used to secure the loan - collateral, appraisals, insurance requirements, etc...  HELOC's scare me, and I was assuming they worked something like that. \n\nThank you, you really don't have to jump this far down the rabbit hole with me, I do appreciate your input, you certainly seem to know a lot about the financials of solar power.\n\nI'm probably best off consulting a local contractor.

However, what you described only solves one part of the two part puzzle. \n\nPart 1 of the problem is what you described, having rooftop solar users pay their fair share of the network costs, for electricity that is not exported (internally consumed). I agree that the pricing of this should be made transparent to all users. For all users, rooftop solar users or not, the pricing structure for recovering network (infrastructure) costs should be identical and ideally consist of demand (kVA/kW, not volumetric kWh) costs. Demand costs are hard to explain, but one basically pays something that is similar to your peak instantaneous electricity demand for the month (Note: Demand (kWh/kVA) costs become similar or equal to volumetric (kWh) costs if you are using hourly or real-time pricing). Demand charges are cost reflective for network costs, as building transmission lines are not dependent on the total volume of electricity consumption of users (kWh), but rather the capacity of transmission lines to instantaneously be able to carry a certain amount of electricity (kW/kVA). The demand charge rate should be different for customers connected to high vs low voltage lines, as high voltage customers should not have to pay for the network costs associated with lower voltage distribution lines. You may note demand charges can be less for solar households compared to non-solar as they may have peak demand that is less due to internal production, reflecting the fair value of solar. Some jurisdictions cover networks using volumetric costs (kWh), which makes solar users significantly underpay their fair share of network costs. On the other hand, fixed monthly costs could make solar users slightly overpay for their fair share of network costs. Also note that demand rates encourages battery adoption as users would be able to reduce their peak draw from the grid.\n\nNow, as I said, there’s a second part that is unsolved, and it has to do with NEM 2.0 specifically. That is, what should the electricity that is expired by rooftop solar (not internally consumed in the household) be valued at? With NEM 2.0, it was compensated at the retail utility rate, which included both generation and network costs. This is problematic, since the utility could instead procure electricity at the marginal generation cost rate (LMP), without the network costs included. Since the utility is mandated to off take and pay for rooftop solar, it will overpay for this network cost portion. Anything overpaid by the utility needs to be recovered by the utility so that it does not run at a loss, which means the overpaid portion will need to be distributed across all ratepayers in the form of increased electricity rates. Given that wealthier household adopt rooftop solar at. 4 to 1 ratio compared to lower income households, this is like Robin Hood in reverse, where the rich are subsidized by the poor. Which confuses me even more when I see liberals/democrats support policies like these. \n\nThis is where the beauty of NEM 3.0 comes in. It was developed by E3, a consulting company specialized in energy economics. NEM 3.0 calculates the avoided cost of rooftop solar, which not only includes the opportunity cost of replacing imported electricity from generators with solar, bur also includes the economic benefits of distributed energy recourses such as reducing network costs as rooftop solar is closer to demand (this amount is small), reducing needed generation capacity for the future, and includes avoided environmental externalities associated with procuring solar electricity instead of getting it from a natural gas plant. In other words it reflects the true economic value of electricity produced by rooftop solar. \n\nWith both of these parts of the puzzle considered, a truly economically efficient and socially optimized low cost electricity grid is possible.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0893164575099945,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25368475907979576,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.28867367558268575,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2770567013439704,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3211331748503944,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24066085483622937,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12804022368472526,"solar_1":-0.19358719996773951,"solar_2":-0.14630361254481364,"solar_3":-0.07921246549193633,"solar_4":-0.035303382280223075,"solar_5":-0.08066769610057431,"solar_6":-0.04959318026764473,"solar_7":-0.16281841138212863,"solar_8":-0.03153472260546223,"solar_9":-0.032111603109115094,"solar_10":-0.126093501736452},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

However, this is just an apparent contradiction. Presuming you believe that suffering is something to be avoided if possible, less suffering is better than more suffering, and doing what you can to reduce the harm you cause is a good thing. Consider \"reducing harm\" a global movement, and that by not giving your money to bad things and instead to good things, you're helping that movement. It's not going to happen overnight and you're not going to be able to get it all right. All you need to do is what is in your power to do, and you do not need to feel bad so long as you are doing what you can.\n\n\n===\n\n[Edit: I reread and one thing I didn't address is the statement that people have to decide where living their lives is more important than the suffering it may cause others. This is true. I think you just have to consider impact versus effort. Veganism is a pretty simple change and aupports a culture that has the potential to benefit a lot of sentient beings. So long as you're not being biased towards yourself and work to develop a true understand of what is important and meaningful for you, then it is fine to decide where to draw the line where you see fit, informed by effort/personal suffering vs impact on others logic. I think this takes care of problems like \"meat tastes good to me so I would suffer and that's more important than animals suffering\" and on the other end \"walking through the park kills insects so I cannot do it\".] \n\n\n===\n\n\nOn that note, [fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com) is trying to change the electronics industry for the better; [armed angels](https://www.armedangels.de/) is trying to change the way our clothes are produced for the better by using fair trade and eco friendly and largely vegan-- just look out for a few items with wool and leather materials-- found through [better thread](http://www.betterthread.com); and as these companies get traction, it helps other values-based companies to get traction.

I mix the hummus powder, tahini (to-go packets available from Soom tahini -btw their chocolate version tastes like nutella and is vegan), a seasoning mix I make from home (nooch, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, mustard powder, salt), and mix. If I have olive oil I will add it but I don't usually and it's actually pretty tasty. Add with chips, tortillas, or carrots (hold up well as long as you don't use baby carrots).\n\n\\-Pack a lime and some extra nooch for both of the things above and a pocket knife to squeeze  the lime over for extra deliciousness. And keep sriracha packets on hand at all times. :)\n\n\\-To-go apple sauce packets are AMAZING on a hot day.

Now I avoided what I could and if vegan food was an option I would get it etc. \n\nTL:DR sometimes being vegan isn't an option and you should just do your best to reduce your harm even if you can't eliminate it.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.003795592696405947,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1040316571662874,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.08728272442307983,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1286662599692742,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2543255873947601,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.058718969409085275,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1331939717735319,"diet_1":-0.031016818470864866,"diet_2":-0.009395862073385311,"diet_3":-0.05258418078058943,"diet_4":-0.007362612690485548,"diet_5":-0.12843360065987022,"diet_6":-0.010347199388585674,"diet_8":-0.0005167026962832703,"diet_9":-0.0006091051424543062,"diet_10":-0.03277347733577093,"diet_11":-0.07306891169476633,"diet_13":-0.002077070595987607,"diet_14":-0.22557106738289198,"diet_17":-0.001229447220490935},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.
