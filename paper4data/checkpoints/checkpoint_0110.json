"comment": "I used to consider myself an anarchist but don't anymore. Anarchism is mostly masturbation about some revolutionary singularity and how post-singularity everything will change. That or fixating about some tactic that always leads to nowhere like insurrectionism. (Just got back from visiting my family in Greece. In the villages there are no cops for the most part, but every anarchist feels they have to go to the big city, Athens, to join the anarchist milieu and play insurrectionist games battling the MAT forces of the Greek police.) Except the singularity has never came and will never come. \n\nDay to day I see people complaining about walking three blocks(I live in the American suburbs) and living a lifestyle that kings and queens of two hundred years ago couldn't dream of(save for the retinue of retainers and servants which the average American lacks...). The average American eats as much animal products as nobility used to. How are these people gonna magically change after some mythical post-revolution singularity? Will they tone down their outrageous lifestyle to allow the rest of the world to breath? Do they realize their current cushy, climate controlled lifestyle where they only have to walk from parking lot to the stores/work, where they can afford to eat an animal product every meal of every day is only possible through massive imperialism? Will even self proclaimed anarchists be ready to give all that up if they don't start downsizing now by going vegan, car-free, etc.? \n\nIf you don't do something now, then what is the point? You are just a poser hiding behind a utopian movement and pinning all your hopes on *after the revolution*.",

"comment": "The BEV i3 starts at 41k and you get a tax credit of $7500 plus whatever your state gives out. If you do a ten year auto loan your payment becomes about four hundred a month. If you drive thirty thousand miles a year on it you would save at least three hundred dollars a month on gas and maintenance though. You can fold down the rear seats and put two full sized bicycles in the back of the car. You get used to the regen in about a week and modulate the gas pedal just right. When will the model three by tesla reach volume production? I have heard people say 2019 until every joe can get one since 2017 and 2018 will be limited production. So if you want to wait five years go ahead.",

The vehicle, which will be charged using 100 percent renewable energy will initially be used to transport automotive parts between facilities in Munich.\n\nThe result of a partnership between BMW and service provide Scherm, the truck has a range of 100km (62 miles) on a full battery and can be fully charged in three to four hours. The truck is the first of its kind to be used on public roads in Europe and has already completed its first test drives.\n\nIt will initially be used to transport vehicle components such as shock absorbers and springs between a BMW factory and Scherm's logistics centre and should cover up to 16km (10 miles) a day.\n\nsource: http://www.wired.co.uk/article/bmw-40-tonne-electric-truck",

A lot of battery tech promises to be transformative, which is good in a sense, but it also means rolling it out will take longer, much longer.\n\n The kind of changes Tesla has to make here are far more marginal yet they still make a difference to the overall range. \n\nThey've made a big bet on lithium ion, so they are unlikely to rapidly change their entire battery fundamentals, which is what would be required if you went into purely organic batteries etc.",

Personally I would have her wait and maybe buy a used bolt a few years down the line. It doesn't make economic or environmental sense right now. The Prius c I listed might make sense but it sounds like she wouldn't like it.\n\nOn the other hand however; if your girlfriend likes the volt, she's almost a perfect use case. An older high mileage volt can be had for sub-10k, is sporty and would fit all her needs I bet.\n\nAll in all, the EV revolution you mentioned is coming, you don't have to force it. The cost disparity is disappearing, they're longer lasting more efficient vehicles and infrastructure for them will only improve.",

"comment": "You can interview me, my wife and I both drive electric cars. We might not support your hypothesis, because we live in Maryland. The 2015 analysis says that our cars get ~68 mpg CO2 levels.\n\nhttp://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/life-cycle-ev-emissions\n\nBut then again we sometimes charge at the (free) green chargering stations near our house. When we charge at home, it costs about 4 cents per mile. \n\nSome people worry about the environmental impact of cars, but all I care about is the cost and maintance. No more oil changes or emission tests. Fewer brake changes as well. \n\nEdit: I mention the 2015 data, but unfortunately, it is already out of date. There were no new coal plants built in 2016, and many more are being converted to natural gas (thanks to fracking). The grid is getting cleaner everyday, which is one of the hidden benefits for electric vehicles.",

The \"list price\" of my Leaf was $36,000, after all the options, but most of the options and upgrades weren't things I really cared about - they just came with the Leaf the dealer had.  Upgraded wheels and the Bose sound speakers, heated seats, blah, blah, blah. It has the quick-charge adapter, which is something we wanted. The other stuff? Nice to have but I would not have chosen to pay to have it, if I'd have had the choice.\n\nThen, we got $5000 off from Georgia, $7500 off from federal funds, and eventually got $7000 off from Nissan Acceptance Corp to get us to convert the car from a Lease to a purchase.  So, with the exception of finance charges, I actually got the vehicle for $16,500.  Best car deal I've ever made.\n\nIf they offered a current Leaf for that, I'd buy it again today.  If Tesla offered a model that I could actually drive away with for $25,000, even without all the bells and whistles, I'd buy it.  Especially if it had more range than what I have today.",

By that logic, why aren’t they adding fees for owners of luxury ICE vehicles? Surely they can also afford to pay more? By the article’s calculations, an owner of a Mercedes or BMW ICE car will only see their taxes raised by 12% in gas tax, whereas the Leaf and Bolt owners out there see an increase of 133%. \n\nIf the market penetration of BEV was much higher in WA state than it is today, you could make an argument for replacing gas tax revenue with fees in order to fund road infrastructure costs, but do something smart like tie it to share of BEV vs ICE (they know how many of each vehicle is registered in the state so they have the data), so those WA drivers who invest in cleaner transportation aren’t disproportionately impacted.",

"comment": "&gt; Not most of them. And NONE for long. \n\nYes, most can. Name one that *can't*. And what's long? The Volt, Clarity, and i3 can all push an hour.\n\n&gt; EV’s need to charge, hybrids don’t. Stop hogging chargers and just go to the gas station.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I am a big PHEV proponent and own one. *However*, I've never used a public charger. There are a couple that would occasionally give me some utility perhaps, but I refuse to sign up for ChargePoint with their current TOS so I never have. So while I'm not sure I can say I don't have a dog in the fight, I have *much less* of one than you might think based on my comments about PHEVs on this sub.\n\nAnyway, I've got a couple counterarguments.\n\nFirst, PHEV owners often have the same goals you do with a BEV -- reduce gas consumption, reduce emissions. And to do that, they also need to charge. In a sense, they need it *more* than BEV owners, because PHEVs have short electric-only ranges.\n\nSecond, depending on the charger we're talking about, I kind of feel like if you're a BEV owner and need a charge... that probably bad planning on your part, and you shouldn't be putting your bad planning onto PHEV owners. There are a couple exceptions to this. DC fast chargers are an obvious one -- but PHEVs can't use DCFCs, aside from the i3 REX. (And the i3 has such a small gas tank that it probably has a significant need to charge if you see an i3 using a fast charger.) I would also put a *few* destination-style chargers in this camp as well. Particularly hotels, but maybe also things like a sports stadium or amusement park or something like that. But if you're talking a charger at your local shopping mall or supermarket or whatever? If you *need* a charge there, IMO either you planned poorly or you have a car that is woefully inadequate for your needs.",

Jesus, I get that you're an EV evangelist, but shouting down every opinion that disagrees with your own is not the right way to go about this.\n\nI love Tesla, I love the Model 3, I love EVs and want everyone to have one. But at the same time, objectively, the Model 3 would be a better car if it was 200kg lighter.\n\nI've had multiple test drives of every Tesla model, and had a Model 3 for 48 hours a couple of months ago: most of which was spent in the Lake District.\n\nOn an A-Road (highway) or motorway, I prefer the Tesla. In the real twisty stuff, the weight is apparent compared to an Audi RS3. The suspension probably doesn't help either, since the Model 3 is designed more for comfort on open roads in the US, but the weight is a factor.\n\nYou have clearly never driven on properly tight or twisty roads in a Model 3....",

It adds too much to the cost and complexity of the car, it's weight takes too much away from the battery capacity, and it still has to be maintained like any other ICE car engine. Volt is really the worst of both worlds in my opinion. I don't really want a hybrid, I want an electric vehicle without range anxiety.   \n\n\nIf I could buy something like a Bolt and wire a little Honda generator to the battery to prop it up during longer trips, that would be perfect.

"comment": "That does reflect the reality of buying a car, though.\n\nI think these calculations are a good illustration of why Tesla's market share has gone down in Europe, I've seen many, many posts doing a lot of dubious calculations with exchange rates, sales taxes, picking expensive models etc to try to show that the ID.3, for instance, is not much cheaper than the Model 3, but in reality the Model 3 costs £41k, and the ID.3 mid range starts from £28k, with the higher trim mid range models going up to the mid £30s, and the long range, top trim model at £36k. \n\nThis is where the new factory in Berlin is going to be important, there's the introduction of a new model, and it's going to be interesting to see how much reduction in cost that brings, once transport and import duty costs are reduced or eliminated. Or maybe it's just a lack of supply, and that will mean fewer limits for purchasers. On current prices you'd expect the Model Y standard range to start around £45k, whereas the Enyaq has just launched at £31k, and will probably have a few thousand knocked more off after dealer discounts. I do think Tesla will have to push the prices lower, rather than just booking any savings as extra margin!",

(Tesla-esque lack of baseline for these savings).\n\nThey claim 20-25% higher resulting energy density from thicker coatings. 220 Wh/kg this summer for their LFP cell. \n\nInitial factory goal is 5 GWh/year, double every year.\n\nThey have 40 people (including partner employees?). Likens their \"3D Screen Printing\" to newspaper printing, mentions one second per battery (sounds aspirational vs. actually achieved). Current 6000 sq M facility good for 0.5 GWh/year, can double that using adjacent space (doesn't match up too well with the 5 GWh/year claim above).\n\nCurrently developing NMC cathode, process is compatible with solid state, etc.\n\nI can't tell if they've really got something here or not. It sounds similar to Tesla acquisition Maxwell's DBE electrode coating process, except not fully dry. Thicker electrodes can increase energy density but usually at the cost of lower power density and other tradeoffs. Maxwell never could get DBE yields up and Tesla has also struggled with scaling the process.",

For example, watch the throttle house videos on the mercedes eqs and the lucid air - they talk about throttle response a wee bit in those.\n\nPeople often say things like \"linear\" but seldom mean it. You generally don't really want a totally linear response, as that makes the car hard to control at very low speeds and feel sluggish at higher speeds - the linear feeling is created through having the right throttle curve.\n\nThere is also the time delay and this changes the feel a lot. This can be about familiarity but also can help avoid it feeling jittery or rough - smoothing the inputs a bit can make for a nicer passenger experience but adds a bit of delay.",

I’d prefer to go somewhere like a steakhouse and tip them for the quality product and service.\n\nB. EnergySage is a valuable resource + solid starting point. However it doesn’t know how slow a companies business is or their portfolio of installations for the year, etc.\n\nC. Cost of living, America is more expensive than majority of any other countries in the world. Meaning products are more expensive, labor is more expensive, quality work is more expensive here. Also, expectations, a lot of other countries like China and Australia operate in similarity to the Tesla model, they have substantially shorter warranties on all the products, because they expect them to break and the theory is, if you purchase it for cheap, when it breaks in 10 years, all the money you saved is feasible to spend on investing for new equipment again. As an American cheeseball, you want the longest guarantee for the lowest penny cost to you, which once again…is not sustainable.\n\nYou can argue it all you want, but at the end of the day, you’re a penny pinching predator and even though they won’t publicly say it to your face, high quality companies hate you. Because when something malfunctions or goes wrong, you’ll be the first one to call them at 8:01am in the morning with a sense of entitlement to get your shit fixed…for 25 years. They’re on the hook for truck rolls, equipment replacements, hourly labor costs, insurance costs, admin costs and man hours to get your warranties filed and fulfilled, etc. for 10, 15 or up to 25 years. And most importantly to stay in business so you have someone to call. So yes, they deserve to make more than $2,000 or $200 per year (if it’s 10 years) or $80 per year (if it’s 25 years). In reality they should be expecting to spend $500 per year to service your home. So if you want 25 year workmanship, they should make $12,500. If you want 10 year workmanship they should make $5,000. Whether you actually need the $500 in service calls or not is irrelevant (kind of like paying for car insurance it seems stupid until shit actually happens and it saves your ass) but at least they covered their asses to protect you for however long you asked and agreed to and they positioned themselves to stay in business for the long term + provide high quality service.\n\nI’m not saying to get ripped off as a buyer, I’m saying be a fair buyer. You don’t work for free, don’t expect other people to.",

I can go buy a 21 E-tron with low miles for $28,000.  That’s a big drop in value. But a car that was once out of my reach is now obtainable. Why ignore the upside? If you don’t need the top trim there are lots of deals to be had with new EVs here in the US especially if you lease. Now that there is competition, Teslas are a lot more affordable.  That said cars in general are expensive. But compared to a couple of years ago, the are a lot more EV’s to choose from, new and used and you don’t have to pay markups. I wouldn’t buy one that wasn’t discounted these days. Just because you can pay $120,000 for a Cybertruck doesn’t mean EV’s have gotten more expensive.",

"comment": "Thanks for answering me, but you didn't really answer my question: a estimate of the yearly growth in world wide battery production for the case your prediction turns true. I will do that for you based on your data.\n\nLithium battery production has been growing at a rate of about 15% yearly in the past, propelled by the growth of notebooks, smartphones and tablets with ever greater battery capacity, and more recently, EVs. To put that in perspective, it is about 4 times the average growth of the world GDP in the period, and acording to [this fortune article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2013/12/29/industries-to-watch-in-2014-the-10-fastest-growing-fields/) would almost enter in the list of 10 fastest-growing industries (that range from 15% to 21% growth in a year). To be fair, those last numbers are in value ($), not useful output (GWh), so battery growth would look slower as it has been droping costs too, and would be farther from that top 10 fastest-growing industries list.\n\nThe gigafactory is slated to produce 35GWh by 2020, and that is equivalent to the world's overall battery production in 2013. This is about 40% yearly growth rate for Panasonic overall production taking as base today. Almost half of the worlds battery production then if the world's battery growth rate don't ramp up, or only 1/7 if they speedup their growth to Panasonic/Tesla levels right now.\n\nIf the world's battery production grows 40% year over year for the next 10 years, starting today, we would have about 1.4TWh by 2025. We need a 57% yearly growth rate from now to reach your 4.2TWh.\n\nIf we grow at a rate of 20% for the next 5 years, and then suddenly electric cars reach a tipping point in 2020 and the battery production starts growing at triple that rate (60% yearly), we end up with 1.2TWh in 2025. In that last scenario we would need the production more than double each year from 2020 to reach your 4.2TWh goal by 2025.\n\nNote that a industry that is already big growing by two orders of magnitude in a short time will also pressure all it's supply chain to also grow at ludicrous speed, and some areas can't answer that fast (be it for enviromental licensing, among other issues).\n\nNow, this isn't *impossible*. It is definitively something humanity is capable of, if it passionately wants. But I would strongly caution you to not bet \"all your savings\" in that. I would bet against you for a smaller sum, as it would be a win-win bet in my case (money or better world).\n\n&gt; The Gigafactory 35 GWh projection is based on current battery storage densities. \n\nI would think that a 2020 production projection is based in 2020 projected densities, so maybe 60% higher than today in your words.",

(Bus cap voltage less than, say, 200v).     \n\nPV panels deliver the voltage at dawn *before* they deliver current.     \n\n&gt;  How does the inverter manage the high voltage/available current?      \n\nPush the PV-panels into a less efficient mode by adjusting the Mppt voltage up, so the available current stays at the max inverter limit.     \n\nHigh voltage should not be a problem, as the design should be such that at -25⁰C (or whatever is your local absolute minimum temperature), the string Voc is below the inverter Vmax.",

"comment": "Contrary to some of the info shared here, I have a slightly different experience to offer.  Consider my scenario a better (if not best case) situation.  I live in TX - so there's that.  In my net metering case, I have a smart meter that reports hourly back to my provider(s).  I also have separate monitoring for my panels online and they run through a physical meter prior to hitting the grid (so I have lots of ways of measuring my solar production).  At the end of each billing cycle my electric bill line items out all of the consumption and production for me (I can post an example if it interests you). Coincidentally, my array is rated @ 7.3kWh DC and I produce somewhere around 500kWh surplus each month that I sell back to the utility company.  I am paid the same retail rate that I am billed (~10.9 cents per kWh), up to 500kWh per month, then after that I only get 5 cents per.\n\nSomething that is likely not be totally understood by someone looking to get a solar array is how their energy usage profile will match up to the the production curve of their array.  It's not something that was obvious when I did my initial calculations, but certainly needs to be thought through when determining if the investment measures up.\n\ntldr; I run a similar size system with great net metering agreement and get credited monthly.",

"comment": "But, if the whole society drops down to these kinds of energy usage levels on average, how can we build more solar cells, AGM batteries and power electronics? How could we possibly maintain the current tooling and logistics chains, if the global energy use had to go down by 75% or more? \n\nMaking semiconductors on a large scale could very well only be possible because we use exuberant amounts of energy in the first place to mine, refine and process the materials into extremely high tech components. We do this in facilities and factories that cost billions of dollars to build and operate and are powered in large part by fossil fuels. This isn't something you can do in your backyard shed with a few solar panels powering it and I think this isn't something you could do in a small city backed up by 50 MW of solarpower either. At least with the current manufacturing tech you have to go much bigger in scale and involve the kinds of energies that a carbohydron powered nation can provide. \n\nIf everyone just took their solar panels to their cabin in the woods, in 50 years nobody would have solar panels. I think it's nuts to think that one is a minimalist when one reads a book under LED lights. There's nothing minimalist about LED lights as they scream space age technology and all the capital, energy and mineral resource expenditure connected with that.",

(And not necessarily directed at you but all solar panel sales guys from all companies - solarcity, sunrun, sungevity, etc). This is exactly what I was asking the sunrun guy for so I could make my own informed decision based the data and not just \"oh you're over paying\" or \"you don't really need Sunpower panels\". That coming out of any sales persons mouth isn't enough for me. PROVE it to me with data and I'll do my best to listen and then make the decision whether I want to spend more money for sunpower or not. \n\nAgain you don't have to prove it to me here as I've already made my choice, but maybe someone else may be interested in the debate like the OP.\n\nEdit: it's your job as the salesperson to inform the customer and when the customer ask and the sales guy can't deliver then I walk. Simple as that. I'm making a $20k+ investment I want to see the data.",

"comment": "So, I will need to dig a little deeper but this is how I see this:\n\n1. It seems like \"Remote Net Metering\" and \"Third Party Supplier\" had a baby. \n\n2. Someone produces energy they don't use, it goes into the grid, and you get credited for it when you use electricity it \"counts\" that toward the usage you had.\n\n3. Is this game changing? Well it seems like a really great concept. My only concerns are: How much do they up-charge to be the middle man in this service? Are there any other fees related to this type of project? How much does the actual cost/kWh relate to the local utility? etc..\n\n4. Just to make it clear, the actual electricity generated on the roof is NOT the electricity the end user would be actually using. This is just how the grid works. If you buy from a 3rd party supplier, they supplier did make the energy you paid for, but they just shove it through the grid and SOMEONE uses it. It all balances out in the end, but you are technically not using the same electrons that were energized on the roof. This will bother some people, but if you understand electricity markets it is not a big deal and is standard practice.\n\n5. I wonder how the home that HAS the panels works. Do they just have an excessively large system that they use to power their home AND send energy to the grid? Does each house just have 1/2 extra panels for excess generation? Do they have enough to cover their usage and then have some clause about going over with extra fees? etc... My reason for asking this is USUALLY you can only \"net meter\" the amount you need for a home. So you can not just put a system that is 2x larger than your electrical needs and then sell power back. At least in new york state, and they said that the service would work here when I checked my zip. This is really the most confusing part of how it works for the generation side of things.\n\nOverall: I am curious to see how this works in the end. I think it is a step in the right direction for a \"smarter\" grid. My main concerns lie in the profitability of the company(how much do they charge for their services), the cost of the energy as it relates to the utility(is it more or less expensive) and the impact of possible tighter net metering laws in the future.",

"comment": "All the more reason to reduce the throttle on utility-scale solar IMO. Many states have caps on net-metering which amount to ~1% of the state's electric consumption, after which, the utility no longer has to provide net-metering to the consumer. Consumers deserve some rights to pursue renewable self-generation, and corporate solar can trigger policy rollbacks which interfere with those rights. Capping the ITC would benefit rooftop solar and small ground mounts.\n\nHowever, you're probably talking about net-metering limits of 100% or 120% of your onsite consumption. Those kinds of limits don't really have an impact on the ITC, and act more as a counter-balance against exploitation of net-metering policy. \n\nI think the best compromise with regard to net-metering policy is month-to-month net-metering with avoided-cost reconciliation at the end of the month. This allows solar project development, but also safeguards the utility against calamitous revenue loss. \n\nI don't see why voters couldn't enact tougher net-metering limits, but the real problem in the industry is those states which lack any net-metering laws policies.",

"comment": "The Stella Vie won the cruiser class of the solar challenge this year too and the German [thyssenkrupp blue.cruiser](http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20170712005849/en/599301/5/thyssenkrupp_photo_FINAL.jpg) was 2nd and also pretty interesting. \n\nMy response would be to call the efforts \"stone soup\". The ability to power those vehicles on panels has far more to do with the vehicle design than the fact that it has panels. A similar vehicle design with batteries would a much much smaller battery than is required for EV's today. Even a combustion engine car built at those specs would have massive efficiency. \n\nI don't currently believe there is a point in the near future where solar panels on cars will become practical.\n\nThe most efficient street legal vehicle you are likely to see on public roads in any kind of volume is probably [Arcimoto SRK](https://www.arcimoto.com) at like 230 MPGe.",

"comment": "&gt; Because the federal government doesn't have unlimited money and has 20 trillion in debt.\n\nI'm getting tired of assistance going to corporations while screwing the individual citizens in this country out of the same assistance.\n\nThe US Debt?  Try cutting military spending.  Last I checked we don't need 10+ super aircraft carriers when Russia and China have none.  There is plenty of savings in Healthcare if we go single payer.  etc. etc\n\n&gt;Residential rooftop solar turns off when central power goes out, so that's not really true.\n\nIncorrect. It depends on the system.  Battery connected systems do not require continuous grid connection and we will see a lot of those soon.  The Fed may even give residential assistance for home batteries.\n\n&gt;Pretty sure they are against all solar because it competes with their natural gas interests. \n\nIt depends on the area. If it conflicts they are against it.  The Koch brothers funded a group to pass a ballot in Florida last November that tricked people who were for residential solar PV into voting against residential solar PV.  They were caught when they were gloating on tape that they were deceiving voters. Meanwhile, grid level solar would have been untouched and actually benefitted by the ballot wording.\n\n&gt;I'm simply saying that large scale solar gives federal taxpayers more for their money than the residential rooftop systems.\n\nI'm simply saying, you have yet to prove that giving the money to grid level is a 2x - 3x better return than residential nor have you shown more appealing benefit of centralized versus distributed energy generation.\n\nI think helping all fronts to expand and innovate is better to counter man-made climate change since it advances the technology and opens options.",

"comment": "You are not taking into account charging losses (between 5 and 15%). There is also no Capex recovery, maintenance and depreciation charges in your analysis. I would expect this to be significant. \n\nSecond, you're assuming 5 and 20 trucks charging serially. This is unlikely, the entry and exit distribution of trucks will not be random throughout the day. There are more likely to be 2 or 3 trucks arriving at the same time or overlapping with long periods with no truck at the chargers (at the beginning at least). \n\nThus, I would assume that the business case with an on-site battery is more likely but the battery capacity would have to quintipled to prevent deep draw cycles and ensure that truckers could charge within a time specified in a service level agreement. This would minimize peak draw but increase Capex. \n\nI would guess that the stop would have a limited solar array to minimize grid draw during the peak power generation periods and potentially sell back to the grid during low usage periods during peak electricity rate times (sunny) . This again adds to the Capex but reduces peak rate usage. \n\nI would guess it works out to about 0.07$ but not as comfortably as your calculation.",

"comment": "&gt;Can recommend Panesonic HIT or LG NeON-R panels. Same warranty as them expensive Sunpower panels.\n\nThe Panasonics and LGs are great but you're wrong on a couple of counts here. First off, OP is getting ~100% offset with 290W panels. $3.53/W is too much for those and you're right - he/she should shop around and get a better deal than that. But if they're already getting a 100% offset, they'd be crazy to spend way more money on a premium panel when they have the roof space to use a standard panel.\n\nThe other issue is no, the LGs definitely do not have the same warranty as Sunpower panels. We sell and service both, and the Sunpower warranty includes performance, labor, and shipping for 25 years, and the degradation rate and warranty for Sunpower \"kicks the tar\" out of LG's warranty.\n\nLG: 1% degradation first 5 years, 0.4% degradation after that. 87% after 25 years.\n\nSunpower: 0.25% per year, 92% after 25 years.",

Cut those two out and your break even point is 3-4 years w net metering, but not much longer without.\n\nAdmittedly this route is a too difficult for many.

If engaged I can provide many positive to the future and beyond stories and proof we have an opportunity to save ourselves from ourselves. However with at least 50% of our country in denniel of what I call human amplified global climate change needs to be pounded into their heads that we have a real existential crisis on our hands. Not to boast but before i retired at 65, I designed and sold solar energy systems in the rainy NW for five years and sold and had installed over 250 PV systems to happy satisfied customers. Washington state now has almost 19,000 rooftop solar PV systems installed through 2018. I also have my own 8KW PV system on my roof and fully paid for in 4.5 years via the incentives and tax credits available at the time of my system installation in April 2016. That's my positive contribution to the positive future you say you are working for on this board.  \n\nHave a great day",

"comment": "Indeed. Nobody “denies” science, as you put it. But— more scientists agree that there is no such thing as “man-made global warming” or “man-made climate change”. Yes. There IS climate change and it’s cyclical. It happens just like the sun rises and falls every, single day. If this “climate change” is so drastic and so threatening, why is it that the polar ice caps are the thickest they’ve ever been since they’ve started measuring such things?\nWhy is it that these same money-grabbing Leftists who are screaming “climate change” are the same ones who were screaming that the Earth was about to have a “new ice age” back in the 70s?\nI am all for pollution control and making the air cleaner. But when the Leftists say that they are going to completely eliminate fossil fuels and make everyone drive inefficient electric cars, that is a pipe dream. What powers the plants to make the electricity? Coal burning and fossil fuel plants. Wind turbines have proven to be incredibly ineffective. And solar power is... well... solar power. Also— ineffective and inefficient.\nThe thing is— people like Leonardo DeCaprio and other “evil rich” people yell at the little people about their “carbon footprint” while at the same time flying to meetings around the world in their private jets. And at the same time leaving a MUCH bigger carbon footprint than any of us little people.\nThen— there’s the failed actors parents pushing their fetal alcohol syndrome kid out in front of the cameras so that she can give her scripted admonition of the other people on Earth destroying her childhood. It’s all a show. If anyone needs the admonition for being polluters of this planet, go chastise China and India. They both have more people than the US. They both make a helluvalot more pollution than the US. And yet both of these countries do not pay as much as the US for these “crimes” against US. Instead, everyone wants to blame the US because the US is richer than these countries. This is why I am so glad that President Trump pulled us out of the disastrous Paris Accords. Everyone needs to clean their own houses before they start worrying about the other people’s houses.",

"comment": "Are you talking for ongoing use, or for an hour here or there? And do you know of any energy efficient 12v inserts, or are we talking 110/220 v?\n\nIf you are talking about extended use, and a 110/220 v heater, let's say an electric insert uses 1,500 watts. At $1/watt, that's $1,500 for the four or more solar panels to run the insert (as large rooftop panels are 300 - 400 watts). But you would probably like the insert to run on cloudy days and in the evening. Then you would need the battery storage you mentioned and related equipment. So we are up to $3,000 or more to run your insert, unless you are very handy and can scrounge old golf course cart batteries or something. Not saying solar is a bad idea, but you could probably get an outlet installed nearer to the fireplace for less than $3,000. But you could use the solar system for other things , like lighting, when not used to the insert.\n\nHere's a thread on the topic:  [https://www.quora.com/How-much-solar-power-do-I-need-to-run-a-heater](https://www.quora.com/How-much-solar-power-do-I-need-to-run-a-heater)",

"comment": "There is no contest. SunPower is far superior to LG in every regard. The first commenter who stated that the A-series 415 is a commercial panel and that SunPower \"has fallen off\" is not speaking from a position of authority. A-series panels were developed for residential systems using the latest Maxeon cells. Maxeon technology is not new, it just keeps getting better. The LG back contact cell design is not better. It does not feature a solid copper bus, nor does it have the same number of pathways on the back. Solar cells are subject to micro fracturing. It happens to all cells. Without the solid copper bus when the cell cracks it can be rendered partially useless. \n\nIs the warranty stronger? No. LG degrades faster, does not cover the cost of removal, diagnosis, or replacement labor. SunPower also guarantees the output of not only the panel, but also the inverter to stay above a certain threshold. If you know anything about the history of microinverters and Enphase honoring their warranty you would feel better about a company like SunPower, who has been in solar for over 30 years, backing up their product.\n\nIf you have any additional questions feel free to message me. I have extensive experience and can back up my claims.",

"comment": "There is no way to do this without a giant battery(I do mean giant, 18kw at traditional battery voltages is ~360A) or being grid tied.\n\nEven if you could do this without either,  you'd need way more than 18kw of panels.\n\nBut let's say you can,  and let's say it costs $30,000 to install. How much do you pay a kwhr? $0.10?  @18kw that's $1.80/hr to opperate your heater.\n\nTo break even on that cost you'd need to run the heater for 16,670 hours. Let's assume you live in unicorn land where your 18kw array makes 18kw for 4 hours every single day, no cloudy days ever.  All year long.\n\nIt's still take you 11.5 years for you to pay it back instead of just using your grid power.\n\nNow let's be realistic.\nA panel has 2 power ratings.  One for 1000w/M2 which is perfect conditions you might get a few hours a year and the other is its nominal power at 800w/m2 which you're more likely to get more often.\n\nLet's look at solaria 360w panels they nominally produce 265w.  To power your heater reliably you'd need in excess of 60 panels and a 20kw inverter. 60 panels is ~1200 square feet of space.  \n\nYou'd be much better off rethinking this whole idea and going with a much smaller grid tied system with net metering.  The time you don't use your pool heater (I'm making the assumption you have spring, fall,and winter) you can build up a surplus with your utility to offset the cost of operating your heater.",

"comment": "The one I got is a Shelly EM3. It's got 3 clamps that go around each of the 3 live wires for each phase. It uses those to measure power consumption. As a neat bonus, it also detects when I'm pushing power from my solar panels to the grid. We have the whole thing connected to our HomeAssistant for live monitoring, and we're constantly polling the data from it to build our power generation/consumption graph. \n\nThe Shelly itself also runs a tiny web server, so you can access it directly through a browser. This is the kind of information it displays, in case you were curious:   \n[http://prntscr.com/ui3r1l](http://prntscr.com/ui3r1l). Those little arrows next to the numbers allow you to download a CSV with 5 minute interval readings of the power. \n\nIf you're stateside, there are more advanced solutions, like [Sense](https://sense.com/). But I wanted something that would keep my data local, and didn't cost me a fortune. The Sense basic package costs $299. The Shelly cost me 79€ with delivery.",

A fixed charge that depends on the size of your electrical service (a higher rate for a 200 A than a 100 A service) would be even more fair.  Making the fee depend on your monthly peak demand (in either direction) would work too, as would a per kWh fee paid on power transferred to or from the grid.  An extra fee just because you have solar panels that applies regardless of how your manage your demand or whether you have any on site storage is stupid.",

In general, solar and storage help decentralize the power grid and build stability. But in case of an absolute catastrophe where there is no point to trying to stabilize the overall grid, then being able to cut away and just power yourself and maybe your neighbors is the way to go.\n\nIn case of a zombie apocalypse, you want the solar+battery+EV set up all the way.

[If we do, the climate will stabilize](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached). \n  \n  The fossil fuel industry playbook has shifted a bit in recent years, [changing from \"there is no problem\" as the main emphasis, to \"it's too late to do anything\"](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/michael-e-mann/the-new-climate-war/9781541758223/) as a means of preventing action.\n  \n  Don't give in.

Talk with people you know.  Post on whatever social media your friend group uses.\n  \n  The big picture version of the plan for total social decarbonization is something like:\n\n  * Decarbonize the electric supply\n  * Electrify everything we can\n  * Stop doing the things we can't\n\n  Think about what you have a propensity and capability for, and whether there's a way to fit in.  If you're somebody who could be an engineer, then work on heat pumps or decarbonized transportation or better designs for solar cells etc.  If you're somebody who could go into finance, think about what it would mean to work on making money available for carbon-neutral electric generation or storage, or for homeowners to be able to install heat pumps and insulation and rooftop solar panels.  If you could be doing marketing, think about how to reach out to people about those things.  If you're out to be a chemist, think about what you might need to know in order to support the significant industrial process changes needed to support manufacture of medicines and other useful materials without using petrochemicals as a feedstock.  If you'd rather be working with your hands, think about what it means to have the skills to build or maintain a wind turbine, or go into peoples' homes and replace their gas-burning heaters with an electric heat pumps.  Etc.\n  \n  If you have modest levels of anxiety, you might try [using some of the techniques that other activists have used to limit its impact](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/climate-change-anxiety-dread-cope/2021/07/14/471eb264-e4d4-11eb-b722-89ea0dde7771_story.html). If anxiety is at the point where it's disabling, then you need not just activism and relevant work, but therapy too.

And if it did, why wouldn't people want solar panels? Some people do it because they think it's good for the environment, others because they think it's a good investment.  \n\n\nand, as far as the $30,000 tax credit, if I moved all of the vents that come through my roof I think I could install 48-50 panels, or about a 20kW system. That would cost $44,000 (before the tax credit). I could add two batteries for 20kW of storage capacity, likely not enough for a full day if I need such a large system, and it would bring my cost to $66,700 which is still only a $20,000 tax credit. I know different companies charge different prices but my current system with 24 panels made twice as much energy as I used in October and November, 50 panels would probably be enough for electric heat, AC all summer and charging electric chars for commuting.",

"comment": "A \"solar installer\" located in southern California that he doesn't know what is talking about. A whole house generator in the area is $20-30K these days plus the fuel ( natural gas or diesel)and the maintenance cost. I installed thousands of battery systems in California and i can't find one customer that is not happy about their home battery system, we educate them what battery is capable of and run loads calculation for their systems, in combination with Span, sense or other monitoring systems they understand what is happening in terms of consumption and they can adjust. Batteries are for everybody, those people leave in areas with frequent power outages and a battery saves them thousands of $$$. So don't be ignorant and check for your specific needs, as i said the battery system is not for everybody.",

"comment": "Your installer gave you a very good reason. Solar panels rarely put out their rating. In addition, over time they lose capacity..  If you go to PV Watts and enter your system size and look at two scenarios with your current and lower DC to AC ratio you may see that the impact on annual production may be very little. Also a larger inverter may max out the bus bar rating which could mean the need for a replacement main service panel upgrade, the cost of which might not be recovered from additional generation. I have had Solaredge DC to AC ratios as high as 1.5 to 1 and that  system performed according to estimates. Do you know the size of your solar panel system in kWs. Devide that by 7.6kW of your inverter and that will give you the DC to AC ratio.\n\nEDIT: I did not see all the earlier posts before i responded.",

Maybe is the labor price, maybe is the installers are just greedy and it works out for them.\n\nWhat solar panel capacity did you get for $7.5k (12k - 4.5k)?",

For leases and PPA, where Sunrun owns the system, they \"sell\" and interest in the system such that it lets the \"buyer\" claim the tax credit. It is it's own special flavor of securitizing these assets. Most of the customer facing side is installers and call center employees, but they actually have a pretty deep bench of finance and accounting types, and the compensation structure is weighted heavily in favor of the finance bros (like usual).",

"comment": "My criticisms:\n\n&gt; Then there are those, like myself, who follow the diet but enjoy the hell out of leather.\n\nThe kind of person to which you are referring is not a vegan.  They are a person following a vegan diet, but veganism is a lifestyle, not just a way of eating (cliché though it may sound).\n\n&gt; To further complicate things, there are those who don’t eat meat or fish but consume dairy (lacto vegans) or eggs (ovo vegans). Combine the two, and you get a lacto-ovo vegan.\n\nThose aren't vegans; they're vegetarians.  The words aren't interchangeable.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n&gt; Cheese-less pizza becomes your default food.\n\nNo.  Neither I nor any vegans I know eat \"cheese-less pizza\".  The author completely misses the way a vegan diet is supposed to work.  We are not trying to replace meat with things that resemble it as much as possible; rather, we seek to live without meat (and dairy, eggs, etc.).  The point is that while veggie burgers and \"cheese-less pizza\" can be very helpful for the first few weeks (or months), relying on them after that is a sign of failure in the goal.",

But I'll go out of my way to make sure I'm not contributing to the unnecessary inhumane treatment of animals. Quite frankly, I'm surprised there are so many very relaxed vegans here (I wouldn't even use the word vegan, but vegetarian). \n\nI'm obviously not of the mentality of not using \"labels\" or whatever. I think it's very important to call yourself what you are. There's nothing like confusing potential vegans by eating soup with beef broth or drinking tea with honey. What kind of message does that send? \n\nHow can you knowingly eat animals and call yourself a vegan?",

Did this for 6 years, then became roommates with a vegan friend, and tried it out. Did so for weight loss, love of the Earth and all her creatures. Didnt eat enough or balanced enough, and waved between eating meat, vegetarian, vegan, raw vegan for 6 years. I wanted to be only vegan again but waited because i was scared. My family message was that \"you will make yourself sick and youve always loved meat\". I was also moody, exhausted, brain fog. Finally in 2012 i just did it, became fully (lifestyle and food) vegan, despite living in a house with all omnivores. I loved how i felt, how i wasn't contributing to the suffering, misery, torture, murder, slavery of others. I felt free! Like a month after i made the switch, i met my now-husband, a vegan of 15 years. We eat amazing food, talk about food, and find connection of veganism as a spiritual path. I still have so very much to learn, about how to be vegan in a way that is balanced for my body. We are very clear that we will raise our children vegan (although family members have already joked/hinted they will feed our kids meat behind our backs, which is so not ok with either of us.) i want to create a family with a foundation of respect, peace, balance, and not how i was raised, on theft, violence, and blindness to responsibility.",

But there's still plenty of Vegan products that aren't actually good for the environment. Quinoa is a good example. Also, palm oil one too.",

Watched more documentaries, like Earthlings, and once I learned more and more about the animal cruelty aspect of meat, dairy, and eggs, that jumped to my number one reason very quickly. Environmental and health reasons are both still important to me, but it's the ethical reasons that keeps me passionate each day to keep on being a vegan.",

Try banana/chocolate/peanut butter smoothies with hemp seeds and vegan yogurt. Tons of protein, calories, and calcium. I try to make things like this for my partner because he is thin and gets full very quickly, smoothies help because they're more of a \"drink\" however contain the nutrients you need. For example you could make oatmeal for breakfast with a smoothie on the side, or make a sandwich for lunch and have a smoothie on the side. Cron-o-meter is super helpful - I had to use it for a project in my nutritions class. It tracks your calories, macros, and micros. Super super helpful even if you just track a couple days in the week to make sure you're hitting the important targets.",

"comment": "There are many justifiable reasons. \n\nSource: have worked in restaurant kitchens for 12 years. Including several that were vegan-friendly. \n\nIt depends very much on the operation you’re running, but it is not always easy or even possible to break your stride and improvise a vegan dish on the spot when you’re in the middle of cooking for 100+ guests. Especially when it’s accompanied by caveats like, “They also don’t like mushrooms or onions and have an allergy to black pepper.”\n\nAgain, like so many on this thread have mentioned, just do your research about the restaurant you want to visit. Also, common sense comes into play here: if you’re checking out the new hipster farm-to-table joint that just opened, it’s reasonable to expect that they employ a chef that can provide a vegan dish (if they don’t already have them on the menu). But don’t walk into your local Denny’s knockoff and expect the burnouts in that kitchen to whip up some vegan masterpiece. We’re not there yet.",

Its sad, but also unavoidable as we need to eat. \n\n  \nBut since we're trying to be a smart ass, did you know that the majority of crops are actually fed to ANIMALS in ANIMAL AGRICULTURE and not humans? Meaning, not only are meat eaters killing animals for no reason (as humans don't need meat to be healthy), they're contributing to more cruelty by using all our crops (killing those poor critters much more than vegans are). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVeganism isn't perfect, we all know that, but its a hell of a lot less cruel and better for the environment than eating meat.",

It helps to understand what they would have traditionally eaten if richer countries weren't encouraging them to grow non-native, and non-traditional commodities instead of the foods they would have before colonialism. \n\nAround the world, some tribes have managed to maintain their [culinary independence](https://inourishgently.com/himalayan-tribe-vegan-5000-years/), while other communities are beginning to [return to their pre-colonial diets](https://thisisafrica.me/politics-and-society/african-vegans-return-tradition/). Cultures world wide used to eat mostly vegan with the inclusion of [certain insects](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/5/130514-edible-insects-entomophagy-science-food-bugs-beetles/), which provide much better nutrition than the animals westerners prefer to eat, while using less resources like water, land, and human-safe food to produce.\n\nWesterners seem to think that they have some kind of monopoly on healthy food, but a lot of these cultures have traditionally relied on local, healthy plant/fungus/lichen/algae, which often got replaced by foods considered valuable to western cultures, often to be shipped back to places like Europe and North America, but also for the colonialists and inevitably ended up pushing out many the traditional foods, though some were outright (and spitefully) banned because of their religious or ethnic significance. We can than flower and  livestock farms in Africa for increasing the likelihood and severity of famines. All that land, water, man power, etc. could have been used for growing cassava or other nutritious staples for local families, rather than date night enjoyment in somewhere like New York :/\n\nThe current percentages of what we feed to who are not even close to representative of [how scientists keep telling us we should eat for improved health](https://www.pcrm.org/news/blog/how-eating-more-plants-can-save-lives-and-planet), or even of where most of the food grown ends up, since we feed [\"in **Botswana, the livestock industry consumes 23% of all water** used. Globally, 18% of greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to the livestock industry—more than is produced by transportation-related sources. And in the United States, livestock production is responsible for 55% of erosion, 37% of all applied pesticides and 50% of antibiotics consumed, while the **animals themselves directly consume 95% of our oat production and 80% of our corn**\"](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/is-the-livestock-industry-destroying-the-planet-11308007/)",

That didn't stop people from replacing HFCS with cane sugar and pretending that made their food healthier.\n\nIn the same way, there's nothing about being \"processed\" that makes food unhealthy. It just happens that a lot of unhealthy food is highly processed. Of course, that doesn't stop people from pretending that their less-processed steaks and hamburgers are somehow healthier than a highly-processed vegan burger.\n\nSame thing with \"raw food\".

"comment": "If you're only eating cheese occasionally, it's probably not contributing much to your calcium or protein intake anyway. I like [this site for sensible-sounding nutrition advice](https://veganhealth.org/daily-needs/), and it covers some of the foods that are highest in the nutrients that we might miss out on. (Not that it's hard to get calcium from plants, but let's be honest, between a cup of spinach and a cheese stick, most people are gonna pick the cheese stick.)\n\nFor protein, you could snack on a handful of nuts or seeds instead of cheese, replacing one richer/fattier snack with another. Nuts and seeds are also a great topping on lots of foods (not unlike cheese). Nutritional yeast adds a cheesy/umami flavor to foods that can help replicate some of the flavor of cheese too. \n\nPLEASE TAKE A B12 SUPPLEMENT. That's the one nutrient we can't reliably get from plant foods. Some plant foods are fortified with B12, like nutritional yeast is often but not always fortified with B12, and B12 is starting to pop up more in plant milks and similar products, but it's not there unless the manufacturer has gone out of their way to add it. We also absorb B12 really poorly, at least from supplements, so usually you'll see supplements that have hundreds or thousands of the RDA % on the label. That's normal. The recommendation I usually go by is either 50mcg/day (that's about 2,000% of the RDA) or 2,000mcg once per week (about 80,000% of the RDA).",

I still couldn't say that morality is my main reason since without the environmental reasons I don't know if would be where I am now.\n\nI just know that I'm happy I'm vegan and I don't want to ever go back. And I'm very happy for every babystepy loved ones are doing 😊",

I can't eat that product anymore.\n\nFor the \"mock meats\" I like, they tend to start and end at Chick'n Burgers - which don't really taste like chicken, but have a specific flavor that i tend to like.\n\nMock Red Meat almost always tastes gross to me, not really like real meat - just weird aftertaste and smell, I just can't get into it. Same with mock sausages.\n\nThe only mock Red Meat I've enjoyed is from a Vegan Fast Food place here called Odd Burger - but I think it's more because of how they put it all together.\n\nBut you can easily stray away from mock meat - there is so much you can do - play with recipes only! I suck at cooking, but try making new things all of the time!",

He has way more recently published a book 'why vegan?' and in i terviews ive seen him say that in theory killing happy animals could be morally defensible, but that he finds it very hard to imagine a commercially viable way to raise animals well enough in practice. The ethics of killing happy animals is genuinely really complicated, because arguing against it leads to really counterintuitive conclusions on the level of population ethics. thats why most philosophers working on this topic/ ethicists would defend the eating of happy animals in theory. i disagree with them myself but their arguments are not easy to deal with.",

And vegetarians who don't like the taste/texture generally don't eat the fake meats? \n\n\nHe then said that I'm a new vegan and don't know why most people are vegetarians.",

"comment": "I personally have no time or patience anymore to wait for someone to catch up. It’s 2022, do they live under a rock? The problem I have with veganizing someone is that they may be doing it just to be with me, there is no way of knowing. However, I did have one positive experience veganizing a potential partner. I told him right off the bat this was a deal-breaker and he immediately stopped eating all animal products. I ended up dumping him soon after for a variety of other reasons but I was extremely surprised to hear back from him two years later saying he stayed vegan for all these two years. You never know I guess. I would suggest that if you really do like someone who’s not vegan and think they may have a chance and you have the patience, have some conversations with them and see how open-minded they are towards making the switch. Many people are really not very opposed to veganism but are just too lazy/unmotivated/uneducated/feel tool much social pressure. That said, one of the most important thing in dating is not to delude yourself. Be realistic.",
