Luckily, I turned on the dashboard lights, and realized that, with my glasses, I was focusing the blue and red elements of the dash at different distances.  Talk about disconcerting!  I ended up going with an Audi A4, which has a dash awash in a single color - red.  My next car will be EV or plug-in hybrid, so I'm looking forward to less \"EVness\".",

I'm a bit of a car geek, especially for electric vehicles so if you'd like me to look up curb weight and dimensions of vehicles to add to your database, I'd be more than happy to do so.\n\nI also filled out the survey but I think I should mention that the opinion scales in the survey are set backwards from what's normal.  So it is likely to give you the opposite of most visitors' actual opinions.  For example, in the question asking if I would recommend the page to a friend, I first picked 5 out of 5 and when I reread it, I realized that the scale said this meant I wouldn't recommend the page.\n\nIf you revise the survey, I think you'll find you get many positive results.  Thank you and keep at it!",

How fast were you able to drive yours? The hills around here are pretty tortuous too. I'm impressed that the i3 can do this though and you're right, an Ampera would be basically doing it all on petrol and personally I still don't think people should be buying PHEVs but if OP is determined to go the PHEV route that would be the least bad option IMHO but he should definitely look at the i3 too. Personally, I have a MINI which does the job for long range driving and will be replaced by a Tesla shortly because I fully believe we should be off petrol entirely.",

Since the federal and state (if any) tax credits don't apply, the cost of the project would be prohibitive.  Perhaps, the school might be able to get the tax credits to apply if someone donated the system, but that's only something I've heard about and I don’t even know if that's allowed under the tax code.\n\nWithout more information, I think the best course of action is a power purchase agreement.  The school would definitely save money, but it probably won't be as much as a similarly sized residential system would save.  The state could also brag about committing more to \"going green\" . . . if that's a thing your politicians value.",

All progress is good progress and I’m a supporter of just about all things EV, but making false claims to drum up some press does everyone a disservice. \n\nThey claim in the article that they’ll have 20+ different EV models on the road by 2020. 2020!!!!! 20+!!! As of right now, VW has ONE (e-golf) EV model on their website. They now have a year and a half to produce and deliver 19 more unique vehicles.",

"comment": "As for price drop...\n\nThe 2014-2016 i3 are so cheap because people have unrealistic beliefs about their automotive needs.\n\nThey say “The BEV version only has a 60-90 mile range! What if I run out of battery??? What if I want to take a 400 mile drive across the state??! What if the battery goes bad???”\n\nThey’re scared of the range. They’re scared of potential repairs that almost never happen. They’re scared of the unknown.\n\nBut they shouldn’t be.\n\nDownload PlugShare on your phone. Look at all the chargers around your city. You can find battery charging almost anywhere if you’re in a bind... but even the tiniest amount of forethought will completely eliminate the “what if I run out of charge?” concerns.\n\nMost families have two cars. You take your gas burning car if you intend to go further than the i3 can go. Simple as that.\n\nFor the rest of your driving (to the store, to work and back, to the movies, to dinner, to grandmas house across town) you take the i3. It always has a full battery thanks to charging it in your garage. It’s always ready to go.\n\nAnd as for that 400 mile road trip you take once a year? You rent a $19/day cheap car that gets 40+ mpg and you enjoy your trip without beating your own car to hell.\n\nThe savings from driving an electric car will massively outweigh any extra costs you have in renting the occasional car. Having no maintenance expenses and damn near free driving on electricity is damn nice.\n\nAnd if you’re a one-car household... just get a REx i3 or a Chevy volt. Those will drive mostly on electricity, and have a gas backup for the rare trip you take beyond your range. Best of both worlds.\n\nZero compromise.\n\nWhy are these cars so cheap? Because people are afraid of something different and new. Because people haven’t driven one yet. Because they worry about problems these cars don’t have.\n\nI will never buy another gas powered car again. I’m driving the future of transportation. Jump in. The water is fine!",

The amount of proposed tax charged per mile is more than double what a typical conventional gas engine vehicle pays through gas taxes. This bill proposes a perverse disincentive to owning a clean energy vehicle. Almost all power generation in Washington comes from hydroelectric generation which does not create carbon dioxide or create air pollution. This proposed bill would make it more expensive to drive an electric vehicle than a gas vehicle, so it would slow adoption of electric vehicles. The bill would create MORE air pollution and greenhouse gasses. While it is fair to find reasonable alternate revenue streams from electric vehicle owners to offset the reduction in revenue from loss of gas taxes, it is unfair to charge double to electric vehicle owners. Any legislator who votes for this bill will lose my vote in the next election.",

They are mostly rich and have picked their political parties already. They don't need to be convinced of the values of EVs either. There is nothing to gain here.",

It has some more cargo room, but not as much as it should given four inches of length and no engine.\n\nCrosstrek hybrid is $9k cheaper ($7k cheaper after incentives for both)and gets 90e, so not much less than the ID.4. Crosstrek has awful electric range, but if the public CCS network isn’t built out near you, it is a much better choice for road trips.\n\nVW needs to build out more fast chargers withEA, make better use of space in their EVs, and increase efficiency (because the ID.4 battery is big enough for it to get a longer range).",

"comment": "I live on the west coast. It doesn't matter if the average trip is under 31 miles. It matters if most people occasionally take longer trips that that. The statistic says 95% of trips are under 31 miles, not that 95% of people never travel more than 31 miles. That's not at all what that means. People need their cars for more than just their average use case they need it for all use cases they do with any frequency. Obviously people go to work, the grocery store, the gym, etc way more than a some further location so obviously most trips would be short. That has nothing to do with what percent of people do take longer trips on occasion.\n\nAnd again I didn't say EVs don't work for most people's use cases. I'm not talking about people claiming to need to do super long trips without stopping. Current EVs with a longer range do work fine for many road trips or longer day trips with reasonable length stops. But you specifically said most people could make due with a short range EV and just rent for longer trips. Which is nonsense. Most people are not going to be willing to do that. Telling people to just rent will do nothing but tell people not to buy an EV.",

More money for EVs more money for Wind and Solar, more batteries, means more minking and more consumption overall.  Whereas the only real and permanent solution to climate change is to consume less, which is the antithesis to our capitalistic society and a position no mainstran politician would ever eschew, which is how I know they don't actually care about the climate.",

With the current progress of EVs it's still sometimes more ecological to use petrol/diesel tractors and other heavy work vehicles (for example in farming) - it really depends on where and how those vehicles are used.

"comment": "The issue is that the way net metering works, a solar owner can buy electricity from the grid for well below market rates.  For example, last year I took 5,400 kwh from the grid. I only paid $330 for that electricity, or $0.06/kwh, which is well below what everyone else has to pay for electricity and pretty close to the utility's wholesale price.  So essentially everyone else that doesn't have solar is subsidizing me, and this is in addition to the $8,000 federal tax credit I got. Politicians that advocate for the poor are figuring out that the net metering contracts and tax credits benefit the wealthy much more than the poor and they don't like that.",

"comment": "Looks to me like the goal is to kill net metering, which will of course significantly increase the net cost of solar by requiring larger systems to be installed to get the same net benefit.\n\nThe irony is that the whole reason solar became so popular in CA was because the utilities were ripping so many of us off with their unfair rate tiers. Those of us with big houses and/or big families were forced to pay thousands of dollars in additional fees every year to subsidize those with small families and small houses. Solar ended that.\n\nThe long term impact of NEM 2.0 and the upcoming \"super user\" electric rate will simply be to drive high volume customers off the grid completely. NEM 2.0 might delay this by 10-15 years as the cost to install solar catches back up to the cost of the grid, but one that happens, NEM 2.0 is going to accelerate the migration of of high dollar customers off the grid.  At some point, the utilities will be taken over by the state and funded by income taxes.  After all, cheap electricity is a basic human right.",

How is it essential that u/whollymoly include a qualifier about unlimited resources? Clearly this wasn't what was being talked about. Solar power was your example of an unlimited resource. There is also wind and tidal power, (which are derived from the sun). What else is there? How is that relevant to anything on this sub or discussion? Why do I waste time responding to this? The only other unlimited resource I can think of is the bullshit discussion on this sub. I see the potential of a sub dedicated to genuine skepticism of AGW alarmism, however the community of r/climateskeptics (a very small one) generates so many useless comments, like yours, leaving me with the conclusion that the only intelligent discussion on this topic is elsewhere, or there is none.",

I have yet to try the [Enphase Starter Kits](http://www.wholesalesolar.com/enphase-solar-power-systems#starter-kits) but they seem to be the most plug and play to get you started. Of course there are likely permitting issues you will have to deal with so look into that. The Enphase Starter Kits are probably your best bet assuming you do own.",

"comment": "Fair enough, jumping into the deep end in unfamiliar territory can be a bit daunting.     \n\n&gt;I can either buy *overly expensive solar kits*, or really cheap DC mains powered or battery operated ones. The DC ones all seem to listed as 220/240 volt, but I am quite sure they are all 12 volt or less.     \n\nIf you have links to those kits/parts, I can have a look at them, you just might be able to save some (serious) money.     \n\nFor some further study on solar panels, this seems to be a [40W panel](http://ecmweb.com/site-files/ecmweb.com/files/uploads/2012/07/207ecmPVfig2.jpg), it clearly shows it it a current source.     \nWith no load connected (0.0A) you get 20-22V output with a minimum of sunshine, but even a small load will drop the voltage.       \nIf you connect a 12V-12W (R = 12W / 12V = 1 Ohm) **or** a 12V-25W lamp (R = 25W / 12V = ~0.5 Ohm):    \n200 W/m², 0.6A: V-panel = 0.6Ax1.0R=6V **or** 0.6Ax0.5R=3V.    \n400 W/m², 1.2A: V-panel = 1.2Ax1.0R=12V or 1.2Ax0.5R=6V.    \n600 W/m², 1.8A: V-panel = 18V or 9V.     \n800 W/m², 2.4A: V-panel = ~20V (panel limit) or 12V.    \n1000W/m², 3.0A: V-panel= ~20V (panel limit) or 15V.     \n\n&gt;I want to ensure I don't cook my hardware     \n\nYour air pump will probably in a dry place (limited to 12V?), your water pump is likely to be submersed, and water is an excellent cooling medium, &gt;14V (battery charger) should be no problem.    \n\n&gt; I imagine whatever is powering the regular is very conservative so not to damage the pump.     \n\nThey do try to match the panel to the pump, but there is quite a difference in received solar energy between the equator and polar regions, and the angle between panel and sun also plays a big role, that 'conservative' part may not be what is needed at your location.     \n\n&gt;In order to make this effective I need an additional raised water tank      \n\nThat should work.      \nIf you let the water 'fall' out of that (highest) tank, like a waterfall, that splashing provides aeration as well, could be a backup for the air pump.    \n\n*Maybe you should rethink the use of batteries.    \nA 12V-3W air pump takes 3W/12V=0.25A, or 6Ah during 24 hours, even a 2nd-hand (40Ah) car battery (borrowed from a garage for testing purposes) should be able to do that.*",

"comment": "It's interesting that you mention that I didn't really look into TriSmart a ton except verifying their a legitimate company. The rep I spoke to told me that they essentially work with companies in local areas to compare rates for the customer. I assumed they were just like a Solar broker of some form who had relationships with a bunch of solar companies and contacts multiple companies at once with your information to offer their \"comparison\" service. Is TriSmart actually it's own solar company similar to SunRun, NRG or SolarCity? \n\nI have the email from the rep with the email of @trismartsolar.com and it's digitally signed by a trismart cert. So I'm assuming this is a legit sales rep from TriSmart. Why wouldn't they try to sell me their service? Their site says they service in NJ.",

"comment": "Although I lived in the mecca of soar when I got into the industry in 2008 (Orange County, CA) It took some perseverance. But I eventually became very successful in the industry. Head of \"engineering\"  for one of the oldest in area and even went on to help set up a solar division for an established cons't. company that ended up doing 60+ installs a month. (Yes, 60 a month)\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to get into solar right now would be sales. Nothing else maters without sales and for the most part companies will take all comers. It gets tricky there tho.. Some will give small salary and others are 100% commission.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to install, things are a little harder. Not everyone is cutout to climb ladders and haul solar panels on a roof all day. Most companies like to see some experience or some electrical background.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to design solar systems, it's even more tricky... Most companies don't have the volume to afford more than one dedicated designer. Doing 60+ installs a month and they still only had 4-5 full time designers at any given time and as the only designer for a small active company I had a lot of downtime when came to designing.\n\n\n\n\nWith that said there are a lot of other positions available in the industry.\n\n\n\n\n* Need people to do Pre-sites (Go on roof to measure, review electrical system, etc.)\n\n* Need someone versed in the Paper work. Let me tell you.... There is a LOT of paper worked involved with rebates and state programs. A person who understands the requirements and can do this efficiently is worth their weight in gold. (A lot of compines retain the rebates and give the customer direct savings. Any delay in getting rebates hurts)\n\n* Depending on size you need someone in procurement. Ordering, and verifying that all materials needed for a particular job are available in warehouse etc.\n\n* Permit/plan runners. Each AHJ has their own requirements for submitting plans for solar install. If the designer doesn't have time to go to each city to submit or doesn't know, there is an opportunity for a knowledgeable person to step in and expedite. Every time plans come back because of not knowing AHJ requirements is a lose in revenue.\n\n\n\n\nOver all I would say read everything you can get your hands on.. If you want to prove yourself an asset know what you are talking about before you walk in the door. \n\n\n\n* Know what the common type of racking is available. \n\n* Know the common type of standoffs used and on which roof types. (Customers do research too. Nothing worse than them asking and you tell them you will have to look into it)\n\n* Understand how to size a PV system for a home and how to determine output of said system.\n\n* Know the common PV panels used.

The solar roof won't provide more power than a panel array. It seems like it's an aesthetic consideration. I don't have a problem having panels, and want what will generate the most power.",

"comment": "&gt; we don't have to be austere if we got on board (or paid) for energy harvesting tech (solar panels, hydro, etc.)\n\nThe key missing tech here is the ability to store large amounts of electrical power at low cost.  Wind and solar are intermittent.  Without storage, they must be backed near 100% with conventional generation - meaning that they are an unreliable, extravagant waste.\n\nRight now solar + storage is still an order of magnitude more expensive than conventional - except for hydro storage.  So, need more hydro storage or similar, or new tech - maybe flow batteries?\n\nAll government needs to do is impose a carbon tax.  We do **not** want beauracrats attempting to pick tech ‘winners’.  Easiest way to pass the carbon tax is to make it revenue neutral - refund proceeds to consumers - more expensive gas, but lower tax bill.  But see WA state carbon tax initiatives.  Far left killed first initiative because they didn’t get to spend the money!  Second initative killed by conservatives with standard anti-tax arguments - committee got to spend billions however they felt like - ludicrous.",

Plus one revolution leads to the next). What changes the world is scientific understanding and its' technology. Do you not use the internet? We now have data tracking the problems. Dirty coal is getting cleaner. Cars went from 10mpg to 20+mpg. Are you not watching the progression from gas to hybrids to electric cars?  Have you not seen solar panels becoming cost effective? Solar panels in glass. Did you not see anything about generators which tap into the tides? Wind farms all over the USA. Are you not following the breakthroughs in fusion? What about those carbon neutral countries who are industrializing with far fewer fossil fuels? Where have you been the last decade? I will admit the damage has been catastrophic. Oceans are a mess. We still have a lot of toxins to regulate. Sure we are not going fast enough. True most of the technology I mentioned has not become as effective as it will be.

"comment": "i've only done one standing seam roof. it cost about 25% more than corragated metal roof. no idea about shingle roof, we don't do that here. \n\nbenefits are easy and fast install (save money on labor!), and no holes at all. \n\nthe reason i mention it is that there is a clip system for solar PV that attaches to the roof without poking holes through it. repairing a roof covered in panels is not an easy thing. \n\nlongeveity of your roof is important when a large portion is covered in panels.",

"comment": "&gt; Finally why not Sunpower? They seem to have better efficiency, lower degradation rates and longer warranties. Not worth the premium?\n\nLG and Panasonic are very close and considerably less.   Sunpower can only be installed by sunpower dealer/installers which further increases the costs.  \n\n&gt; My architect keeps talking about some sort of structure to bridge the gap but I am skeptical it would be allowed.\n\nIs your architect familiar with solar codes?   it doesn't sound like it.   \nAlso fire code?   you need a fire rating on anything installed on the roof and that comes from a combination of the racking and pv modules?  unistrut is not going to have that rating.   \n\nhttp://solarprofessional.com/articles/design-installation/pitched-roof-array-layout-for-fire-code-compliance/page/0/1#.Wtozz9PwZ24",

"comment": "Some of the problem may be how Tesla is rolling out their solar installs. I think to get to those lower prices they're going with a cookie-cutter model of residential install configurations. By offering only a certain number of sizes, they save on the delivery logistics for each system and save the engineers time in the on roof configurations. I think you're well above one system size and just under another system size. So even though you need the step up in size, because it's a fraction too big (probably one panel) they can't fit it on your roof. Instead of install the system minus one panel, they're downgrading you by half of the system.\n\nTesla does lots of cool stuff, but unfortunately to reach scale they keep their blinders on and ignore the market as a whole, and concentrate only on the most profitable segment of the market they can reach logistically. \n\nAlso, from my experience, their sales/support isn't always the most knowledgeable. They try to automate more than they should and if your experience varies at all from their programmed algorithmic flow chart it is easy to fall through the cracks. I've spoken with their solar team when I put in interest for the solar roof. They called immediately and said the solar roof wasn't available but started selling a traditional solar system instead. I know my house isn't ideal for solar but they weren't really listening to me. I'd be willing to pay for a less efficient system to take advantage of the tax credit. They said my barn wouldn't work because its too close to the trees (again, no discussion about whether taking down said trees was an option) and tried quoting me on solar panels they wanted to put on my house, over my skylights. Hard stop. They go on the barn or not at all. I just don't think he was given the authority or training to stray from their prescribed installations.",

"comment": "Opposition-“Well I feel like it’s kind of a strawman debate to go back and forth about whether or not a colder object can warm up a warmer object, because the alleged mechanism is that the atmosphere itself is becoming more insulated by the increase in Co2.\n\nI’d say an analogy is something like this… since I’ve been buying so many wool sweaters lol… it’s like the Earth is covered with a sweater (the atmosphere) and the additional Co2 is like adding more and more thread to the sweater.\n\nIt’s not the sweater that heats up the earth, it’s the sweater that’s supposed to just hold in more of the heat transferred by the sun.\n\nNow I don’t even believe in man made global warming, but I thought a lot of the argument was missing the point somehow\n\nNow I’d say a real critique would be to argue whether or not CO2 is an “effective thread” adding insulation to the sweater, so to speak, or whether it is enough “thread” to make any significant difference\n\nOr something along those lines”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPostma-\n\n \"What you describe as insulation with a sweater, the mechanism involved there, is the retardation of convection. The warmth of your skin, relative to the cooler air, generates tiny little eddies that wick heat away from your skin. The same thing happens to the surface of the Earth itself. Real greenhouses, and sweaters, STOP convection – they stop the air from circulating and from wicking the heat away either from the surface (greenhouse) or your skin (sweater). You heat up the sweater to closer to your skin temperature than the air is, and then you feel warmer. The sweater can be heated up by your body because it is a small mass, whereas you can’t warm up the open air because it is effectively an infinite sink/mass compared to the heat that you put out.\n\nIncoming solar radiation is capable of heating the surface to scalding temperatures. This induces air circulation because as the air, in contact with the surface, is heated by conduction/diffusion/convection/radiation from the surface, and warm air is less dense and so the warm air rises away. Since the warm air rises away, then this keeps the remaining air cooler. Witness the inside of your vehicle with windows closed on a sunny day where the air was stopped from rising away, compared to air just outside the vehicle: the vehicle interior air is much much warmer than the air just outside the vehicle. The inside of your car is the same thing as a real greenhouse: it stopped convection, stopped the air from being able to rise away or be exchanged, and thus the air inside your car or greenhouse rises to the temperature at which it is being heated – which is quite hot, from the sun, easily 120F and more. Raw solar power is actually up tp +121C, or 286F.\n\nIn radiative terms, and these are the terms of the greenhouse effect of climate alarm (the greenhouse effect of climate alarm is not about convection as per how an actual greenhouse functions, but is about radiation), then insulation is called emissivity. The poorer that a surface or object or substance can radiate thermal energy, the lower its so-called emissivity. Thus if a fixed amount of energy must be radiated, then an object with a lower emissivity must attain a higher temperature in order to be able to pump out the necessary energy. Vice versa, a substance with higher emissivity can emit the same amount of radiant thermal energy at a lower temperature.  \nThe existence of CO2 in the atmosphere:  \n1) does not change the ground/physical surface’s emissivity, since the emissivity of a substance is a property of the substance/surface itself, not a property of something else nearby or touching the object. CO2 in the atmosphere does not change the emissivity of the physical surface, hence does not alter the radiative ability of the surface, hence cannot change the temperature of the surface this way.\n\n 2) increases the emissivity of the atmosphere, because the entire point of so-called “greenhouse gases” is that they emit. The atmosphere is 99% nitrogen and oxygen which do not emit thermal radiation…so 99% of the atmosphere has very low emissive power, i.e., low emissivity. This means that 99% of the atmosphere already very efficiently holds on to thermal energy, to its temperature. But now we add CO2, which is emissive, and thus we’ve given the atmosphere a vector by which it can emit thermal radiation to space where it couldn’t at all before. So adding emissivity to something which had low emissivity previously is going to allow the substance to cool, or equilibrate at a cooler temperature then before. So the actual physics of radiation insulation would indicate that adding an emissive substance (CO2) into a non-emissive substance (N2 and O2 99%) is now going provide a vector by which the non-emissive substance can shed thermal energy, because obviously the N2 and O2 physically bump into CO2 and give CO2 their energy, and then the CO2 radiatively emits that energy. CO2 is collisionally-dominated with N2 and O2 – for every photon CO2 emits, it is bumped physically by N2/O2 something like a billion times. So N2/O2 are constantly dumping their energy into CO2, and occasionally CO2 emits that energy whereas without CO2 that energy wouldn’t have been able to escape.\n\n The point is that the entire scheme and premise of the climate alarmist radiative greenhouse effect contradicts basic physics theory, notwithstanding, and perhaps as a result of, it being based on false modeling premises in the first place.\n\nLastly, the scheme of the radiative greenhouse should actually then also explain how a real greenhouse functions, and it should predict the temperature inside a greenhouse. However, the temperatures predicted by the climate alarmist radiative greenhouse mechanics are not observed inside a real greenhouse, and the only temperatures measured inside a real greenhouse are those expected from the stoppage of convection only…there is no additional effect from “radiation insulation”. So this is empirical proof to go along with the existing theory which demonstrates that the climate alarmist radiative greenhouse effect does not exist or function.\n\nThermodynamics took hundreds of years to solve for a reason. It is still one of the most difficult fields…really. A comment from my favorite thermodynamics textbook (Schroeder, 2000):\n\n“Much of thermodynamics deals with three closely related concepts: temperature, energy, and heat. Much of students’ difficulty with thermodynamics comes from confusing these three concepts with each other.”\n\ntemperature, energy, and heat – it is crucial to understand that these are not all the same thing…for one thing anyway\n\n[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/517503241882435617/767898223430991892/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/517503241882435617/767898223430991892/unknown.png)\n\n As I discussed in that debate…the main issue here is the interpretation of that downward arrow in that Figure 2.3. In climate alarm physics that arrow is interpreted as a temperature-increasing function, as a temperature-increasing mechanism. One must ask: what is the mechanism, in physics, that could perform this function? Well, we refer to the first law of thermodynamics: to increase a body’s temperature, you require work and/or heat. The scenario isn’t about work being done here, and so, the only possibility of that downward arrow to act as a temperature-increasing mechanism is if that downward arrow is heat. That downward arrow has to be heat.\n\nHowever, we then must refer to the known definitions and mathematical expressions for heat – well, heat is not something that can flow from the colder atmosphere to the warmer surface. And so that downward arrow cannot be interpreted as heat. Thus there’s no way that that downward arrow could serve to increase the temperature of the warmer surface.\n\nWe should then consider that the only reason why that downward arrow is interpreted as heat by climate alarm, is because they treat the solar input as equal to the terrestrial output, at -18C or 255K. They begin their model of the climate under the premise that the sun cannot heat the Earth to above -18C…that the Sun cannot and does not create the climate or temperatures above -18C! So under that premise, they then desire to interpret that downward arrow as being able to heat the surface further even though heat could never flow in that direction.\n\nAnd YES, in their peer-reviewed literature, they do indeed state and believe that the atmosphere must heat the Earth at TWICE the power and ability of the Sun. And YES, indeed, they do literally believe that the Sun DOES NOT heat the Earth or create Earth’s climate.",

"comment": "This is from their website.\n\nTesla Solar Inverter\n\nYour Tesla Solar Inverter is designed for reliability, high efficiency and the ability to maintain it without needing installers to go on your roof. Tesla Solar Inverter has robust safety features, including integrated rapid shutdown, arc fault protection and ground fault protection, and no neutral wire allows for simple installation. Tesla Solar Inverter has twice the standard number of MPPTs, allowing for high production on even complex roofs.\n\nSolar Inverters\n\nWhen completing your solar system layout, Tesla’s engineers will select the best solar inverter based on your home’s roof structure and sun exposure. Tesla has found that homeowners lose more energy production — and money — from costly maintenance due to unreliable inverters than from anything else. This choice provides you with reliable equipment without sacrificing overall production.\nIf Tesla determines that your solar system requires individual panel power optimizers, such as if your home has significant shading, then our engineers will design them in your layout. While individual panel power optimizers help with shading problems, they also consume more energy to do this and are less efficient in full sunlight compared to string inverters. The best solution for solar is always to reduce obstructions and maximize your panels’ exposure to sunlight.",

When on auto the camera takes the coolest pixel in the scene and sets it to zero and then finds the warmest pixel in the scene and sets it to 255 and then scales everything else in between no matter how small. The iron bow palette also makes everything look very dramatic to human vision as we are very colour centric so changes in hue make us wrongly assume huge differences.\n\nFrom your images I’m guessing that there is only about 5 degrees Celsius difference between the area with the solar panels and without.\n\nSo there is a difference but it’s not that great.",

"comment": "1) determine your annual kWh usage. Ideally, you’d want at least the last twelve months at your current property. As it would reflect more closely to your current day energy habits and overall a good baseline to determine the solar size you’d need to get 100% offset\n\n2) determine the solar Buyback Rate of your utility company. IE what does the utility company pay per kWh of surplus solar produced.\n\n3) determine your desired offset. Certain utility companies simply by virtue of being connected to them will charge a fee, or taxes, or misc fees. If your connection fee is $30 per month to your utility, and your goal is to completely eliminate your utility bill and have them pay you for your solar surplus, and their buy back rate is $0.105 per kWh. Then you want your solar to overproduce by at least 286 kWh during the most expensive months. ($0.105 * 286) = ~$30\n\n4) validate the production guarantee from any given solar quote that you get. Production guarantees are a manufacturer guarantee. The production guarantee you are shown, can be validated as the correct amount, but furthermore (from my experience) is a lowball estimation. If your solar system doesn’t produce x amount of kWh annually you can be financially compensated for the difference, and that number is calculated using a lower than optimal case scenario factor. So in most cases, it’s a safe assumption that you would produce more than the production guarantee that you are provided. The production guarantee is allowed to decrease annually depending on the contract of the manufacturer, as the solar panels are expected to degrade in production.\n\n5) finding an installer that offers your desired system size at a fair price per watt. This is subjective to how much you want to spend and who you’re willing with. Reviews do help. Cheapest is not always best, there is always the possibility of sacrificing something such as customer service which is extremely important to have if panel or inverter fails and it needs to be fixed ASAP. You could spend more pulling from the grid than it takes that company to comply to fix your system. In terms of quotes, it is somewhat luck dependent. But knowledge is power to leverage a better deal. There are companies that offer a fair price per watt for tier-1 / excellent products. There are companies that offer the same products, however the commission structure can add $10,000 dollars (or arbitrary amount) to the total cost and adds no additional value, it’s just a paycheck. \n\nThe goal isn’t just to save, it’s to maximize those savings. I own my own solar company. I can offer tier-1 products for a fair price due to a deal I’ve brokered with the installer. I’ve come across many scenarios of homeowners considering a solar system that is too small, or can save them money but modestly and is therefore too expensive because there is a high commission attached to the price whether it’s intentional or not. Feel free to PM, I’d need more information, but I can happily validate what system size you should aim for based on which utility you have, and what a fair cost range would be for that system size.",

"comment": "Well, it depends where you live and what you have available for energy. If you have access to solar, then definitely get an electric cat! If not, and you live in a place with expensive electricity/no charging infrastructure in place/a cold climate, then maybe try investing in solar for your house (if you can) and in a few years, buy an EV. You'll want to get an EV with range if you live somewhere it gets cold, too. You'll probably want to use your EV as a daily driver, charging it at home during off-peak hours when energy is cheapest or off sustainable energy when energy is nearly free, and drive it to and from work, to the grocery store, etc. \n\nPersonally, I will be taking delivery of a used Tesla Mo 3 long-range in July, and I'm working on a solar camper that will be able to f̶e̶e̶d̶ charge it. With the poor infrastructure in my area and the fact that I'm renting and will have to deal with extremely cold climates, I have to get very creative in order to own and operate an EV at low-cost. If you are battling any of those issues, you may have to get creative and build some infrastructure for yourself in order to charge the thing. \n\nGenerally, think about it like this: If you aren't sure you want one, don't get one until you are. And don't buy something you can't reasonably afford. If you are committed to getting and owning one, you might have to be willing to get your hands dirty to make it work well. Charging sucks, but if you have a few solar panels on your roof you should be fine. Maybe have an ICE car for long road trips if you're worried about infrastructure. \n\nI have always wanted an EV, and I will do anything to make sure I can get and use one. My eventual goal is the Cybertruck- it seems like the perfect EV, not to mention truck, for me. I will be doing whatever I can to ensure I can use it, which includes making a camper that can charge it. Really think about the decision, make a pro's and con's list, think about ways you could change things to accommodate for it. Whatever you need to do, just think about if this is truly the right decision for you. You don't have to get one right meow.",

"comment": "Exactly!  It's a significant cost over the life of the system.  I haven't had this done yet, myself, but I went back and looked again at what the Google search turned up.  Here are a few of the sites where I found the figures:\n\n[https://www.paradisesolarenergy.com/blog/the-cost-to-remove-and-reinstall-solar-panels](https://www.paradisesolarenergy.com/blog/the-cost-to-remove-and-reinstall-solar-panels)This one gives the $300 per panel figure, or or $4500 for a 15-panel installation, which, yes, would be $12,000 for your 40-panel example.  \n\n[https://formesolar.com/cost-to-remove-solar-panels/](https://formesolar.com/cost-to-remove-solar-panels/)This one's a little more conservative:  $255 - $275 per panel.\n\n[https://howmuch.net/costs/remove-solar-panels-replace-roof](https://howmuch.net/costs/remove-solar-panels-replace-roof)I didn't see this one earlier today.  It's quite a bit less ($94 - $130), so perhaps your sense that the $300 figure is inflated is correct.\n\n[https://powersolarphoenix.com/cost-remove-reinstall-solar-panels/](https://powersolarphoenix.com/cost-remove-reinstall-solar-panels/)This site, citing Home Advisor, gives a range of $195 - $1236, with an average of $714.  (Yikes!!)  They say homeowners insurance may cover the cost, however, if the underlying roof needs to be repaired.\n\nApologies if that's too many links to include in a comment.  I'm a Reddit noob.\n\nIf these figures are at all realistic, they really highlight the advantages of a metal roof that's likely to outlast the solar panels.  There are stone-coated metal shingles available now that look a lot like typical asphalt shingles.  They do cost more, but you can weigh that against the cost of having to remove/reinstall your solar panels potentially every 15 years on an asphalt-shingle roof.  In my opinion, if someone's going to put a new roof on before installing solar, it's worth taking a careful look at going with metal.",

"comment": "1) Have you and the installers confirmed that the battery options will actually work to start your A/C?  Most A/C compressors have very high LRA that batteries will not be able to power, even with a soft start.  Make sure (a) the batteries have enough max power to start the a/c and (b) that the batteries’ combined energy will be able to run the a/c long enough for what you need.  Hint: probably not as long as you think.  And second hint: Powerwall has more pound for pound max power rating, and that edge could be a difference maker for what you’re trying to do. \n\n2) consider the synergies of having your entire system (micros + storage) being Enphase.  It’s quite amazing and to me quite worth it (I have all Enphase - 20 kWh of batteries plus IQ7+ micros).  Other tie breakers for me include the LFP composition (bit safer) of Enphase batteries. \n\n3) if a/c in outage is your main concern, consider not getting batteries given the crazy cost, or just a generator.",

People could dump their solar PV generated electricity into their cars instead importing petrol.\n\nRoof Solar is because it adds value to a house, the housing market is insane in Australia, but the car requirement is strong and the control / domination of the petrol industries very strong, they still get massive fuel subsidies etc. \n\nA lot of that is driven by the domination of the Murdoch Press.",

It's not about changing over the entire housing stock overnight, it's more about improving the whole situation going forward. It might well take a couple decades to get even 10% of the housing stock converted, but once we do, there's potential big benefits to the grid. \n\nTesla's Virtual Power Plant, an opt-in program where people with Tesla Powerwalls voluntarily discharged a bunch of energy to the grid during a potential brown-out situation in California, was pretty successful-- it delivered over 30 megawatts from under 5,000 homes, and the homeowners got paid something like $2.00/kWh, which is something like 400% of what it would have cost them to buy the electricity, assuming they didn't just charge it from their solar panels in the first place. That's pretty darn successful for a pilot program, and everyone wins-- the homeowners who made money, the utilities who didn't have to do rolling blackouts or brownouts, and everyone on the grid who didn't have power outages.",

"comment": "Technically true, and maybe your system is \"better\" than mine, but on a stormy December day when my heat pumps are churning away, I'm probably pulling more energy off of the grid than the little house next door that has no solar panels.  You don't really need 100% installation of solar panels, or 0% production in a region on a given day, for there to be a massive effect on the grid.  \"Most homes\" and \"very little\" are enough to disrupt the status quo.\n\nI had considered mentioning utility-scaled battery storage, and I'm glad you've brought it up.  It should be noted, however, that I was responding to a statement that residential solar reduced, or even eliminated, the need for utilities to build out infrastructure.  Those stacks of batteries, even if economically viable, are far from free and you still need the necessary transmission capacity.  Particularly since I personally expect some \"have you seen what happens when those batteries burst into flame?\" NIMBY action if the utilities try to distribute all the batteries close to the solar panels and loads.\n\nBottom line:  While I expect, and sincerely hope, that we can collectively build a grid that supports all the energy sources we feel like installing, I'm not of the opinion that the grid will fade away anytime soon, or that it won't need significant upgrading to properly support the changes to when and where power is being generated.  And that, unfortunately, somebody gets to pay for, somehow.",

Peak power is higher than a Powerwall. Has LFP already. You're in system, so one app is also convenient.\n\nOnly downside is price. I saw a quote in the sub the other day for $11k for a single 5kWh. A Powerwall with gateway is only a few grand more. You'd need 3 Enphase 5P to get about the same storage, and that's closer to $7-8k extra.",

I find pretty much all these battery systems to be overpriced (considering what the underlying batteries cost, particularly if the inverter is doing all the work.)    Would be a market for somebody to make an aftermarket one that is compatible with the higher volume brands.        Solaredge will do upgrades from the Home Wave (no battery support) to the Home Hub, but that's not useful if the only thing you can do is spend a bunch on a Solaredge battery.\n\nFor many people -- folks looking for modest emergency backup, who have net metering so don't need to move power in time, and who are happy with very limited power usage at night during major outages -- you really don't need that big a battery.   Where I live, outages are rare and usually no more than a few hours, though some day an Earthquake will come, once in my life probaby, that might knock things out for several days.",

There are already mavericks out there dumping stuff in the ocean that they think will \"fix\" climate change, without anyone else's input.  To work, anything we do in the realm of geoengineering has to be at vast scales, and doing things at vast scales usually has unintended consequences.  We will have to understand those consequences in great detail before embarking on such an uncontrolled experiment.    \n\n\nSolar radiation management:  Let's don't fix the problem (Carbon), let's introduce another wild card into the equation!  If I'm a farmer, what do I think about solar radiation management?  I think you are going to cut my crop yields. My solar panels are going to make less juice.  What does it do to winds?  storms?  What is solar radiation management going to do to wild species?  Krill?  Algae?  Nobody can answer these questions, and managing solar radiation on a vast scale doesn't fix the cause.  What happens when we run out of resources and can't put up any more of the satellites or mirrors or whatever we are using?  We get a huge pulse of catch-up warming.    \n\n\nWe've created a mess, dithered about fixing it, and I'm convinced we will be forced to resort to geoengineering to clean it up. It will have the be employed at unprecedented scales.  And also, we will undoubtedly cause another problem if we do so.  We should be pretty clear-eyed about this.",

Fossil fuels really were a \"one size fits all\", and *none* of the potential replacements we have are *quite* able to do that. So in order to replace fossil fuels, we have to deploy our alternatives where and when they make sense.

The problem, and where their brains miraculously form a barrier between their conscience and ignorant bliss, is that they think it's just a fact of life, can't be changed, and can't be worked around.\n\nIt changes.  I don't berate people about it, but it comes up and I'm clear about why, and I call people on BS.  So if they say \"why don't you eat ...\"  I tell them clearly and if they drop it, I drop it.

I don't think the kind of rapid change you want is going to happen unless all meat gets contaminated or has a stigma attached to it.  Either that or all the vegans make an army and revolt, but then there goes your war theory.\n\nAgain, I appreciate what you are trying to do and would love to live in a cruelty-free world, but demanding it 100% all the time to every group won't get you as far as you think.  I admire you, but even I have to distance myself from such \"extremism.\"  Sorry to use the word.",

They will gladly substitute vegan refried beans for meat, their guacamole is vegan, and their website lists all ingredients so you can easily tell what items are acceptable.  I've gotten tacos, burritos, crunchwrap supremes, just no meat, sour cream, or cheese.  Almost anything can be made vegan, only a few of the taco shells are non-veg.   \n\nA lot of pizza places sell tomato pie which can be naturally vegan (although you have to get it w/o parmesean cheese).",

They would tell me Jesus ate meat blah blah blah..... and one day I thought that that would be messed up if he really did do that and I didn't want to be part of that. I don't have to be like other people and I felt like a crook taking the lives of animals so I could survive. I even tried to be thankful to them and all that but it seemed so f'd up. I succeeded at vegetarianism so then I made it my goal to be a vegan even tho I didn't know exactly what that was. As I journeyed into veganism I began to read more on it and become more disgusted to the point that I was overwhelmed by all that I didn't know and wish I would have. This Crazy Vegan Life by Chritina Pirrello (she was given a few months to live but then Diet saved her life)         http://www.christinacooks.com/ and then I read Diet for a new America by John Robbins. Man all that info made me sick to my very soul. I love those books and I am glad I found them.  I was finally cleaning all the junk out of my body and I felt a new higher cleaner energy in my body but I cheated one day and ate sugar sweets and felt soo sick. I couldn't figure out why I felt that way but I went for a bowl of veggies and some vegan foods and felt like life was brought back into me. I don't cheat anymore....I learned my lesson. Veganism is the key to living a healthier, happier, longer life. I felt my depression vanishing as well : ) with the healthy vegan diet and exercise. I noticed an increase in my health....while everyone around me was getting sick I was given the gift of a stronger immune system. I couldn't believe it but it's true. Becoming a Vegan was the best thing I have done. My boyfriend of decided to become a vegetarian as I journeyed to veganism : ) . A lot of people around me are choosing better lives because I pass down all that I have learned. I am stiil learning but I am happy. Especially now that I found my LOVE Daiya vegan Cheese the best in the whole wide world!!!!! http://www.daiyafoods.com/  and my favorite Good Karma Organic Vegan Whole Grain Rice Milk (soy free)  http://www.goodkarmafoods.com/   \"A percentage of all net proceeds from the sale of Good Karma Products are donated to organizations focused on ending world hunger.\"  Plus it is soo delicious : ) There are sooo many amazingly good vegan foods out there that it makes it easy to be a vegan. : )",

On that note, I have no problem with abortion whatsoever, in fact I frequently counter-protest religious groups. I'm vegan primarily because I think the suffering we put upon animals is unacceptable and unnecessary in a late-capitalist society with plenty of substitutes for animal products. I don't see any contradiction in my views since abortion is based on the consent of the woman, and the fetal tissue is not yet sentient. Part of it stems from my bitterness towards organized religion as well, I tend to be very reactionary about religious talking points. \"Oh you think abortion is fucked up? Well, I think we should abort everyone!\"",

"comment": "Oat porridge is a good one. It has good amounts of protein and slow carbs, which is something you definitely want. Not only that, but it is usually cheap as well. I know my husband loves it and it helps him get through the day. I have always had a bit of a soft spot for it too. All you need is oats, water and a little bit of salt and then some sugar and cinnamon, jam, conserve or fresh fruits. It really is a brilliant breakfast, and I used oats as a filler with soy protein powder as a home made protein shake when I was doing vegan bodybuilding back in high school (I am a girl) and it worked wonders.",

"comment": "*They [Donald Watson and others] suggested several terms to replace non-dairy vegetarian, including dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivore and beaumangeur. Watson decided on vegan, pronounced veegun (/ˈviːɡən/), with the stress on the first syllable. As he put it in 2004, the word consisted of the first three and last two letters of vegetarian, \"the beginning and end of vegetarian.\" He called the new group the Vegan Society.*\n\nThat was in 1944.\n\n*In 1951 the Vegan Society broadened its definition of veganism to \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals,\" and pledged to seek an end to the use of animals \"for food, commodities, work, hunting, vivisection and all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man.\"* — http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegan#Coining_the_term_vegan.2C_founding_of_the_Vegan_Society_.281944.29\n\nSo the definition, from the man that invented the term and according to the organization he founded is *not* just dietary. The ethical aspects of the word are inherent in that.\n\nThe modern day definition appears in the sidebar of this reddit: *\"Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.\"*\n\nI don't see how you could argue otherwise unless you believe that the creator of a word (one that was brought into existence quite recently, as words go) is not considered authoritative as to its definition.",

And they have some pretty good juicing options.\n\n[Conflict Kitchen](http://conflictkitchen.org/about/) offers one rotating vegan option every month.\n\n[Szechuan Express](http://www.allmenus.com/pa/pittsburgh/18804-szechuan-express/menu/) is more quantity over quality. But if you're hungry for any kind of vegan chinese food (scroll down to the vegetable section to see what I mean), they'll give you a giant serving of it for ~$5-6.\n\n[Hemingways](http://www.hemingways-cafe.com/) has a good hummus app, ~~and they offer an okay veggie burger~~ (actually I just checked their site and don't see it listed. Don't know if it's gone, or just not updated online). They also offer personal pizzas that are pretty cheap, and come with your choice of 3 toppings. Tangent: now, they think they're getting away with something, because they count *cheese* as one of their toppings (they explain that every time I order) -  But joke's on them, because I don't want the cheese anyways!\n\n[The Porch](http://www.theporchatschenley.com/home.aspx) has an *excellent* vegan patty, but you have to get it with **no** aoli sauce, and on sourdough bread (which doesn't really go well on a burger). They also sometimes offer a vegan black bean soup. And their Garden Harvest salad (minus cheese) is really good. They also volunteered the information about the bun and the soup without me even asking.\n\nThere's also a ton of more places to eat, that you can explore (including a bunch of indian and mexican places, with options) - but those are the ones off the top of my head, that I know I like. \n\n^(Edit: Not sure about Hem's burger anymore)",

Look into a good vegan recipe book (Vegan Stoner, Isa Does It) or vegan recipe channel (Vegan Zombie, Vegan Black Metal Chef) and started incorporating vegan meals into your diet. If there are non-vegan foods you crave, look up vegan alternatives. Gardein fake meats, Field Roast Chao cheese, Silk soy and almond milk &amp; dairy free yogurt, Just Mayo, So Delicious ice cream are just some of my favorite products (taste better than non-vegan products imo). Stop buying new animal products like wool, leather, down, etc. Look into products that are not tested on animals (and also hopefully not harmful to the Earth). You don't have to do everything right now but start educating yourself and start phasing out animal products. And remember to eat enough and get some B12 supplements.",

I will have to try some of their products someday.  \n\nVeganz is nice, but I've only been to one of their stores once. I don't think my wallet would be able to take it if we had one where I live. ;) They're working with a big German chain store now to distribute their own products in all of Germany. Some of the prices are insane, though. One of the stores where I live is selling their burgers and steaks for 8€/pack. I can get imported Gardein at a different location of the same chain store for less than that.. It definitely seems that some companies and shop owners are trying to take advantage of the trend and it shows in their pricing, though I would still say that overall the prices for alternative products seem to have gone down a little.",

I didn’t watch any documentaries- I just said to myself, “I don’t want to eat dead animals” and didn’t think too much else of it. I certainly didn’t feel the need to do any research. On the face of it, milk and eggs don’t register as dead animals. Now I know better so I do better, but I don’t think it’s always a case of folks ignoring the truth because they love their cheese.",

Even people that think that being vegan would be good for the environment often don't go vegan because the difference one person makes is zero.\n\nAs for reducing meat intake, it worked pretty well with me for a long time. I didn't want to become vegan, but I didn't mind reducing meat intake, especially beef products. I don't consume meat or dairy solely for the environment, so just reducing beef consumption is a win in my book. I know quite a few people who consume little to no beef, though mostly for the wrong reasons, but this is evidence to me that people can be convinced to reduce intake for long periods of time. \n\nThe only way we get massive change is through legislation, in my opinion. I don't believe that we need a majority to get legislation passed, we just need to reduce the number of people that are militantly against it, not increase the number and further radicalize those that already are against veganism. The more people that are sympathetic to the cause (regardless of whether they are vegan or not) the easier it will be to get legislation passed restricting meat production/consumption, which can perhaps eventually lead to it's abolition.",

"comment": "That livestock is the largest culprit is based on a not so credible paper.   Globally agriculture emits around 24% of all CO2 equivalent ([source](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data)). In more industrialized countries this percentage will be lower due to the emissions of all other greenhouse gasses and the import of foods. The assessment \" Livestock’s Long Shadow\" of the FAO showed that 14.5% or   7.1 Gigatonnes of Co2-equiv per year is emitted by livestock. This is ofcouse very interesting but does not says much about veganism, because as vegan you will eat other plants. Luckily other scientist have calculated CO2 eq. emissions per diet (e.g.:  Scarboruough et al. 2014, doi: 10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1 ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Who:|2000 KCal diet|2500 kCal diet|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\[-\\]|\\[kg Co2 eq/day\\]|\\[kg Co2 eq/day\\]|\n|High meat eater (&gt;= 100 g/d)|7.19|8.99|\n|Medium meat eater (&gt;50-99 g/d)|5.63|7.04|\n|Low meat eater (&lt;50 g/day)|4.67|5.84|\n|Pescetarian|3.91|4.89|\n|Vegetarian|3.81|4.76|\n|Vegan|2.83|3.54|\n\n\\*The 2500 KCal diet is calculated by me and is just linear extrapolation, the data is from  Scarboruough et al. 2014.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n In [this map](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?view=map) you can find the average CO2 emission per capita for your own country. Now Scarboruough's data comes from British people, so if the average diet of your country is likely to be significantly different then this data may not apply for your case. But in my case (I am Dutch) I think it is a fair assumption that the average diet of the average person of both countries is similar in terms of GHG emissions (both are on average high meat eaters). The average Dutch citizen emits 9920 kg CO2 per year, that is 27.2 kg per day. Before I was vegan I would classify myself as a high meat eater (I ate meat every day), so before I was vegan my diet approximately took up \\[8.99/27.2=\\]33% of my personal average daily GHG footprint (n.b. I use the 2500 KCal diet). Now I am vegan, thus that is a reduction of 5.54 kg C02 eq. per day (or 2 metric ton per year), which would mean that if I still emit as much GHG as the average Dutch citizen my diet would now only take 13% of my daily GHG footprint. Ofcourse I hope that my total emissions of GHG is now lower, which I think is a reasonable assumption because with that amount of GHG emissions I should be able to drive 35 km extra by car every day or 7.2 extra flights between Amsterdam and Reykjavik per year to offset the reduction in CO2 caused by becoming vegan (additional: I do not drive a car and only take the airplane once in every few years) ([Carbon calculator I used](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx), o I think I am doing fine). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO to answer your question, we might be fine if we cut GHGs in a lot of other places, but in my opinion becoming vegan is so easy compared to other measures that the taste of meat is not worth its GHG emissions (and certainly not when you take the ethics of killing livestock into account).\n\nI hope this was helpful.",

I personally value those things very highly and I don't want things like taste, convenience, tradition, habit, etc, to get in the way of my values and morals.\n\nI only want to harm an animal (or person) if it's necessary. In my opinion killing an animal unnecessarily is wrong no matter how quick and painless the killing is. Or how well they were treated before slaughter.\n\nSo that's why I chose to work my way towards veganism and encourage others to do the same. And I never would've changed if people didn't bring it to my attention and advocate for it though. So I try to do the same. It's worth considering, have a nice day.",

On top of that, when you can’t afford a car and dont have the means to grocery shop for yourself, it’s very difficult. \n\nThe reason I often browse this sub is to continue to educate myself on the slaughter industry, find new vegan recipes, and to stay up to date with vegan news while I work my ass off to move out and change my situation. \n\nYour assumptions proved to be another reason people feel so uninvited and feel so intimidated by the vegan community. \n\nYes, I am responsibly, seriously, and actively making lifestyle strides to reduce the animals products not only in my diet but my consumerism as well.

Meat and dairy can be addictive and some people do experience withdrawal.\n\nBeing vegan, health wise isn't considered unhealthy for women by any means, according to the American Dietetic Association.\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19562864/\n\nThere was actually a study recently that showed a wfpb diet is good for hot flashes:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462449/\n\nAlso, this is anecdotal, but my periods got much better after going plant based. I really don't think plant based diets are bad for women/their hormones.",

There would be no demand, so they would no longer be bred. It's not extinction... They are not species, they're freak breeds that we created. And if they no longer exist, there's nothing to worry about. Humans shouldn't breed animals. If people get upset about not seeing these animals in farms anymore, then to me that highlights the hypocrisy of non-vegans even more.\n\nIf everyone suddenly went vegan, then we should care for these animals until their death, but we shouldn't continue to breed them. We can't expect them to live in the wild as they aren't wild animals in any way shape or form.",

"comment": "Changing your diet is something you can do today. Cutting billions of humans from the global population is not. All it takes is buying beans and tofu instead of beef and chicken. Hell, you don't even need to buy beans and tofu anymore, there are tons of realistic beef and chicken replacements already available. Many restaurants also sell vegan options with realistic mock meats for the same prices as meat options.\nYou can also have more taste variety in your diet which makes meals more interesting and enjoyable. Hell, \"sausage expert\" Mike Perry even called a vegan sausage \"luscious and lovely\" before he knew it was vegan (then tried to take it back showing how biased he is). And people generally can't tell the difference between the impossible burger and beef burgers. I know plenty of people who write off vegan options due to taste when they have never even tasted a single vegan meat replacement. No idea if this is you or not but if you haven't tried plant based meat you definitely should.\n\nReplacing animal proteins with plant proteins in your diet is also shown to reduce risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. Reducing your intake of animal products to just a few days a week would both help reduce your impact on the environment and improve your own health.\n\nI struggle to find any good reasons to eat meat. Main reason seems to be \"everyone else does\" or \"because we always have\", neither of which are very convincing on their own. But feel free to share if you think you have a good explanation that outweighs the costs to human health and the environment. Animal agriculture by the way uses 3.1 billion hectares of land that could be freed up for wildlife and alternative use if the world went plant based. For reference, Russia is only 1.7 billion hectares.",

I will clarify that  I understand why women choose to have abortions, and I think it's right for them to have that choice.\n\n \nYou can see my point with abortions performed *without medical necessity*, though. It looks like a very parallel situation to me: In performing an abortion, you are taking away the right of an (at least potential) human being to exist, just as the beef farmer assumes the right to decide to end his animals' lives. Any argument for why an abortion is justified is just another example of humans abusing their position of power. Working towards stopping humans from thinking they have the right to control and exploit beings of lesser cognition for no reason is one of the main reasons people do this vegan thing, and I'm grappling with how aborting a fetus is any different.\n\nEdit: To avoid any reactionary replies: I'm probably on your side. I'm just trying to understand an apparent contradiction",

When theyve worn out i will get some vegan friendly boots like these synthetic ones red wings sells. Theyre just hard to find and more expensive. Also, i own a work truck and a weekend car. Their tires, as you may know, have animal products in them. Many plastic products have animal products, and even your phone screen has an animal product layer behind it. I just cant help some things, but i certainly dont employ cognitive dissonance so i can eat my favorite chips. I just have to find vegan alternatives, because in my mind ignoring the suffering of animals so i can have pleasure is immoral, and i have a wide array of healthier options anyway\n\nAlso, about eating stuff people cook. No, i just tell them its against my spirituality because its true. I make sure to graciously thank them once or twice to make sure they know theyre appreciated, but i refuse to put things in my body just to please others. On an extreme level, thats how some people get hooked on drugs",

In doing so, I've been mocked, called virtue signaling, had my veganism questioned, among a barrage of other hostility.\n\nGranted, I knew what I was signing up for when I posted this so I'm not all that bothered, but it's frustrating the glee people take in verbally abusing someone who \"deserves it\". And of course if you tell people \"Hey, this is starting to look a bit sadistic, maybe let's try and go about it in a healthier way.\" You become a target yourself.\n\nI really don't feel welcome in this community unless I'm \"dunking on the murdering bloodmouths\", and I was hoping to get a conversation going about creating a less emotionally reactive and more welcoming community.
