"comment": "&gt; So are they trying to copy Tesla[1] by selling a high class, expensive version of their product before targeting lower margin markets?\n\nI would say yes, in a way, only kind of in reverse - I think they want the affordable, low-end product first. They are in phase 1, with the long game in mind. And I think it will work.\n\nFor decades, vegan products have been \"specialty\" products, relegated to the \"health food\" (or to most people, \"weird food\") sections of most grocery stores. We vegans know where to look for it, but if someone's not looking, they'll walk right past; this food isn't _for_ them.\n\nBeyond Meat wants to be behind the deli counter. They want it next to the animal meat, and they want the price to be lower than the animal meat. Electric cars are becoming more viable in part because of the rising price of gas (I mean, the long-term trend of gas prices; seems we're going through a dip right now). Meat prices are also rising, disproportionately to vegetable prices (which, yes, are also rising). A person could have no animal-rights inclinations at all, and would still choose the cheaper of the two products when they're side-by-side like that.\n\nThey aren't replacing the high-priced steak dinner; they're competing with the majority of meat, which is prepared _in_ other foods. Their chicken salad, ground-beef lasagna, chicken fajitas - people don't buy the most expensive products to fill this role. They will unflinchingly choose the vegetable-based product if it's cheaper, and right in front of them.\n\nHampton Creek is doing the same thing with eggs (starting with mayonnaise and cookie dough), and it's working very well for them.\n\nI think it's what we need. There are so many people who I'm sure we've all spoken to who, verbally, are empathetic to animals in the food industry, but can't be bothered to change their behaviour and buying practices. This takes that barrier away.\n\nAnyway, that's my thoughts on it. I think it's a huge step towards a world that consumes far fewer animal products, and I think the people / groups investing in them now see this potential too. The future of protein isn't going to be in factory farms. We obviously want it to be in plant-proteins, and right now there's a lot of money backing that solution up.",

"comment": "Totaly. It's a very functional car from a CAR point of view. It's just very mediocre from a user experience point of view. That's where Tesla blows everybody out of the water. The experience in a Tesla is like a second skin. You pull up the sunroof interface on the touch screen and drag your finger across it. Where you stop is how far the sunroof opens. Pull up the stereo interface and you can get an overhead image of the car interior. Move the target left/right/forward/backward and the pan/fade moves the audio in the cabin to center on the point where you moved the target. The Leaf has blue bars with yellow dots that say Fade and Pan. There's just no elegance in the Leaf, but it will get you from A to B.",

"comment": "Because of the high charge times of a 6 or so kilowatt (L2) station (3 hours for 75% of a LEAF's range, or 8 hours for 75% of a Model S60's range) I don't see how it helps an apartment dweller unless it is in his dedicated parking spot, and in that case it isn't pumping its product and paying its cost down for most of the hours in the day.  You want to keep a station booked to pay for itself.\n\nHigher power (DC only in the US for now--no US cars have the reasonably faster phase 3 AC chargers at the moment) stations with their 30 minute session times (if their rated kW matches or exceeds the battery kwh) solve this problem while simultaneously allowing conventional speed intercity travel as they spread to more cities.  Battery banks will be helpful for DC fast charge stations for offering utilities a standard load profile and minimizing utilties' concerns, making it easier to negotiate service from the literally thousands of possible different utilities. (And DC station battery to DC car battery maximizes efficiency and minimizes equipment.)  \n\nMake sure this company has all of that required engineering down.  See what Tesla is doing.  The industry is going to follow them, because they're doing it right.  The only hope I see now is if a charging company copied them in a non-proprietary way.  Unfortunately, their charging customer base wouldn't be much more than twice the size of Tesla's (including Tesla's own cars in that calculation of all possible non-proprietary station customers), for the time being.\n\nAn interesting advantage that car companies have in building their own charging networks is that they can get the battery packs and much of the electronics ready made in house with all the supply chain accounted for already--it's just re-use of existing effort, which is killer.",

"comment": "They should be ashamed telling them such bullshit. Climate change can be solved and life (high consumption) can more or less continue with low density alt energies that cannot be created (mined, transported, manufactured and installed) without fossil fuels? It's simply a matter of political will? Ya, physics doesn't count. The pin on the AGW grenade has been pulled and it will go off no matter what. \n\nSolar is at a whopping 1% of global electricity generation after 40 years or so. Is there any mining for the needed raw materials that is done with non carbon solutions? Nope, all diesel. How much heavy transport is solar? Every manufactured piece of hardware and/or all raw materials from overseas are delivered via bunker fuel – the dirtiest on the planet, then there are diesel powered trains and tractors. How much manufacturing is solar? Do solar panels, the accompanying hardware and the workers get transported to the site in electric vehicles?\nHow can something that cannot be produced without fossil fuels be called a solution to fossil fuels? Maybe for a shrinking portion of privileged westerners and only for some of their residential electricity demands. Certainly not for any of the electrical energy embedded in their never ending piles of consumer crap. Then there is the fact that all this tech generates a waste stream that is an environmental holocaust all of it’s own. Attempting to replace massive amounts of infrastructure with low energy density solar and wind will continue to destroy more habitat and speed up the 6th mass extinction. There is no such thing as a green, eco friendly industrial consumer civilization. Prue fantasy. Pure fucking horseshit. This was written by and for people who wish to retain their status and privilege and do not care about the truth. Use anyone.",

Americans do take trips over a hundred miles especially for vacation and visiting relatives. Even if its once a year, you'll need a Tesla for more utility, usability, and comfort. Generally less does not mean it doesn't happen. For your other evs, you're going to have to rent a gas car,  or be late to an event due to less  miles per charge and slower charging.",

"comment": "&gt; I took a 1000 mile road trip for the eclipse this year that would have been frustrating and time consuming with a Tesla\n\nYep, that's the second biggest caveat with EVs now, behind not owning a parking spot where you can charge. But I do believe that will change. Bigger batteries, shorter charging times and better charging infrastructure will fix it. And even if they don't the cost will drive people to change their mind or take a road trip with more charging stops. \n\nIf you take 3 road trips per year and spend an extra 2 hours each trip waiting at a charger then that's 6 hours per year. Where I am, EVs are already cheaper to own then ICEs and ask yourself this; how much do you have to save per year to make those 6 hours worthwhile? Not to mention that sitting in a car for hours on end is not the most fun and those hours at a charger might very well be spent doing something fun.\n\nPersonally I don't take long road trips often and on the few occasions I do I have the option to swap cars with my parents. Of course not everyone is in that position but there are a lot of households that have more then 1 car and the focus now should be on converting that city car to electric.",

It's bright, customize-able and clearly designed. \n \nThe infotainment center is alright, but it's not lightening quick. If your used to say a new iPad it comes off as slow. There's enough to keep you occupied though and it's better than any other traditional car implementation. Android auto works well enough. I find myself using that mostly.  \n\nThe seats aren't great but they're getting better. They've broken in after a while. We have the premium trim with the leather seats.",

Is that the takeaway?\n\nTell me, you say that most dealers/salespeople don't know the landscape. What's *your* experience in automotive service and repair? How many different companies have you worked with? How many repairs have you been party to? What's your experience wrenching?\n\nOr how about this question: Does one person's anecdotal experience with their 2006 Lexus equate to proof that EVs don't need brakes?\n\nNOTE: Most vehicles need rear brake pads once or twice in their lifetime, assuming they're not trucks used for hauling or towing. Most vehicles need front brake pads every 30-50k miles. So, **best case** EVs will need half as many sets of brake pads as ICEVs. That's plenty of work for dealers and most quality independents. No one is scared of our electrified future on the maintenance side of things.",

All you have to do is use the software in a Tesla and compare it to the software in any other legacy auto (EV or ICE) to see not only how far behind legacy auto is wrt software and UI/UX design but how absolutely clueless they seem to be about how bad their software actually is and what it will take to close the gap. Throwing money at the problem won’t help them unless they get a clue first. In fact, being a huge organization with a lot of cash to throw at the problem is probably more of a disadvantage. A lot of the issues, I imagine, arise because of micromanagement of software development and a too high degree of compartmentalization in their organizations, together with a healthy dose of arrogance. \n\nSource: Been in software and firmware development for a couple of decades now.",

"comment": "1. Supercharging is not regular charging.   The vast majority of charging is done at home, hence the residential rate (12 cents/kWh).\n2.   BMW 328D is not equivalent to the Model 3.  It is way slower at 7.7s/100km.  An equivalent car is the 330i, which gets 30MPG combined (premium gas).   30MPG is 3.33 Gallons/100Miles.   17% less (split diff between long and short trips) is .56 gallons or $1.68 additional for 100 miles.\n3.   I did do short trip math for the Model 3.   40% less is for short trips.   Definitely doesn't lose that much range for long trips.   Combined short/long likely around 30% however to be generous we'll stick with 40%, so my $1.20 for the Model 3 stands.\n\nIn other words, EV additional costs still cheaper.    \nBut let's back up a minute.  Your assertion was that their calculator was wrong because it doesn't factor in EV range reduction in winter.  We've now conclusively shown that that is irrelevant.  Both EV and Gas cars suffer some increased energy use in winter.  Costs less for EVs but even if you want to concoct a scenario where they are similar the conclusion doesn't change:  The calculator correctly does not factor in range reduction in the cold because it doesn't matter for gas savings calculations.",

Turkey have been smart here, they realised they have a window of opportunity to create an electric car company whilst a lot of the major players are \"sleeping\". \n\nIn order to make a car profitable, what you need is scale. If the government can create a baseload of demand by ensuring it's sold in Turkey in decent numbers by persuading various state organisations to purchase them, this will make the vehicle competitive in the international arena too where they can potentially get some additional sales.",

They aren't fun to drive, they have a complex technical set up that will be costly to maintain, their batteries cant charge fast, their batteries are so small, they wouldn't allow V2L or V2G or efficient use of roof top solar, they aren't quiet on long distances and most implementations are pretty bad, some even consuming way more when used in the real world than their pure ICE versions (most have a default setting of charging the battery with the inefficient ICE engine and most add the cold ICE motor when accelerating, causing horrendously bad consumption). Their main use case is saving taxes in certain countries, never to be charged, and counting towards lower CO2 fleet emissions by manufacturers by achieving a fake test consumption, something that can't be replicated in the real world. In 99% of cases, any PHEV can be replaced by a real EV at no real downside - and don't come with charging. We have affordable mass market cars (same price as your PHEVs) that charge to 80% in 18 minutes now.",

"comment": "1. Your EV cost figures seem solid, but are you sure your ICE figures are? In Michigan gas averages $3.199 per gallon now, per AAA. At 25 mpg (average for new cars sold in 2017), that's $0.128 per mile. So $282 for 2,200 miles a month, $384 for 3,000.\n2. This all depends on the car. But generally it takes a whole night to go from 0% to 100% on Level 2, a 240v plug you can install at home. On DC fast charging (public infrastructure), it's a bit under 40 minutes from 0% to 80%. It's rarely worth it to go above 80%.\n3. Yes, Tesla's fast chargers (Superchargers) can only be used on Teslas. There are many different networks for other vehicles, which use CCS (or rarely Chademo) charging. You might need a lot of apps, but only for the chargers you'll use. And a lot of them have roaming agreements with others, which cuts down the number of apps you need.",

They're arguably worse choices depending on your use case.\n\nAny EV is generally outclassed by an ICE of similar price ('cause cost savings of EVs mostly kick in via maintenance costs and energy prices).\n\nUsed vehicles generally have a better utility per cost ratio. That's why people buy used in the first place. So this is hardly a fair comparison.\n\nBut EVs depreciate very slowly right now. Depending on government incentives, a used Ioniq 2017 is *still* more expensive than a brand new Dacia Spring. And a 5 year old Dacia Spring will be a lot cheaper than a 5 year old Ioniq 2017.\n\n&gt; But building this low spec cars isn’t helping anything.\n\nI disagree. I really hope, when I get into the situation of needing a car, I can buy a cheap, low-spec, efficient, used EV, because I have no use for a 100+ kW-engine or 400 km range.",

It won’t bother you initially, but after a while the novelty wears off and you notice how much of your life is going to waste while you’re sitting at a charge station.\n\nHaving said that, if you rarely plan on charging outside of your home, the EV is probably the best choice. I simply drive a lot and in really random and remote places, so plug-in hybrids are perfect for me.\n\nAs for my Prius maintenance, there’s only the 10k mile oil changes and the occasional air filter to change, but that’s not too worrisome. \n\nThe new Prius Prime is hard to beat, so be sure to check that thing out!",

Got our Ioniq 5 a couple months ago.  On our first road trip pulled into a Charge Point DCFC. No CC reader, tried tap n pay with the CP app, Apple Wallet, and our RFID credit cards.  Nothing. Discovered we had to geo-locate the charger in the CP app pick the station ID to activate the session.  Why the hell isn’t there some consistency in the way these things activate? CC readers can be hacked but at least have some instructions on the charger.  BTW we have a CP L2 in our house and activate the free L2 CP chargers at an amusement park nearby via Tap n Pay.",

"comment": "No one is \"loosing money\" on EVs. It's the failure of accounting the investments correctly. Designing, developing, testing a car and building up the assembly line costs a \\*lot\\* of money. Say that costs 3 billion USD for a particular model.\n\nIf you then proceed to manufacture 20 000 cars on that line for a total duration of 5 years and earn 10 000 US profit per car from that you would have earned a reasonable 20k \\* 5 \\* 10k = 100k \\* 10k = 1000m = 1b USD as operating \\*profit\\* for the company. But if you deduct that R&D investment you'd look like instead of \\*earning\\* 1b USB, you have actually \\*lost\\* 3b - 1b = 2b USD to the company.\n\nNow if you make and sell just 40 000 cars per year and do so over 8 years at same 10k USD operating profit per car, you'd earn 40k \\* 8 \\* 10k = 3.2b USD operating profit, which turns into 0.2b USD pure profit for the company from this model.\n\nThat is just one tiny, superbly oversimplified perspective - make more of the same car and make it for longer and your profitability will grow.\n\nAnother thing is that during technology transition, your R&D for one model does not \\*only\\* impact this model, but also all that will follow. These 3b USD shouldn't only be accounted across couple hundred thousand cars made and sold now, but also across literally millions of electric cars of various models this company will sell over the next decade or two. And that drops cost evaluation dramatically.\n\nThis is why real car makers measure \\*operating\\* expenses and \\*R&D\\* expenses strictly separately. The first can be easily attributed to a sold car, the second can not. And any \"analysis\" dividing R&D across the few cars made/sold so far is deliberately misleading.",

"comment": "Okay, let's do it. \"closer to 100% than 15%\" actually means \"at least 57.5%\"\n\n**Total cars sold**\n\nTotal cars sold could rise dramatically as developing nations become developed. In this case, manufacturers will have to expand their capacity either way to meet the demand. I don't see why they would be better off doing that investment in old technology. There's also the prediction that total sales will plummet as self-driving cars make owning a car of one's own less relevant. For the purpose of this calculation I will assume cars sold in 2025 is the same as the number projected in 2015. 57.5% of [73M](http://www.statista.com/statistics/200002/international-car-sales-since-1990/) makes 42 Million cars. \n\n**Total capacity needed**\n\nA Tesla model S has 70-95 kWh depending on options. Let's say cars will average 100 kWh in 2025. A generous estimate because: \n\n1. A majority of cars are smaller than the Model S \n2. Cars will have more miles/kWh because the batteries will be more energy dense so the batteries wont be as heavy. At 100 kWh they might have around 400 mile range.\n4. Charging rates will have improved and charging networks will have expanded, making more range a lower priority compared to more space and efficiency. \n\n100 kWh in 42 million cars makes 4.2 TWh in total.\n\n**Production facilities needed**\n\nTesla's Gigafactory is expected to make 35 GWh/year. So 4.2 TWh would mean 120 Gigafactories. Keep in mind that:\n\n1. The Gigafactory 35 GWh projection is based on current battery storage densities. Suppose that in 2025 energy density is 50% higher (a pessimistic estimate considering the article we're commenting on predicts 60% improvement by 2020), a factory that produces the same amount of cells will have an output of 52.5 GWh/year. That would mean 80 Gigafactory sized factories. \n\n2. In the scale of things, Tesla is a small upstart. For Tesla, building the factory seriously drained it's cash reserves. Apple has plans to get into cars and has a cash reserve 6 times bigger than Teslas entire market capitalization. GM has spent more on dividends in a year than Tesla did on the factory, while still spending plenty on developing new products. Between Apple, GM, Ford, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Nissan and VW  it would not be hard at all to build the equivalent of 80 gigafactories over 10 years time. And they *will* want to do it before then, because it will be a matter of life and death for them.",

Power from the grid is entirely unreliable and the current solution is using a diesel powered generator that cost about $10000 to buy and incurs a monthly diesel cost of about $600. I have been thinking for a while that simply replacing the home's power supply with a solar setup would likely be more convenient, effective, reliable and even potentially cheaper. Unfortunately, I don't actually know enough about solar panels and power etc to test or validate this opinion. Would anyone on this sub be willing/able to point me in the right direction on how to figure out what information I would need to be able to determine whether or not replacing my home power supply with solar power would be a good idea.\n(Posted this as its own post but it seems more appropriate as a comment here)",

"comment": "You are close enough that you shouldn't get downvoted. Rate regulation. Offering a new rate requires a rate case. One of the principles of rate regulation is that the rate design as proposed will fairly of apportion the cost of service among the ratepayers. To prove that, you often need a cost of service study (COSS) and that can cost a ton of money to perform. If you don't, then the utility still needs to prove to the PUC that this new rate specifically for solar customers, the cost of which is dependent upon production guarantees which would be effected greatly by weather in OP's example, is fair to the other non-solar customers. That's a lot of work to develop something that may already be adequately addressed by other means.\n\nThis is the kind of realm that state legislatures have begun to occupy by enacting statewide net metering program. In my state (Vermont) a solar customer is guaranteed access to the grid to feed their excess generation back onto the grid, pending certain restrictions on size, system impacts, etc. Like a typical NM program, these kWs offset their consumption but they also receive an additional \"solar adder\" of around .02/kW for every kW they produce. So this amount is added as a credit to their bill and can be used at any time within a 12 month period. So there's a huge incentive for customers to invest in a system now through the third party PPA's, leasing programs, etc. \n\nBut, that said, utilities are constructing community solar farms which allow people to buy in and receive a certain amount of the generation as a credit to their bills. So utilities are getting into it. I think its the transition to the in-home, one-on-one sale to get some panels on your roof that is just so far removed from the current utility business model that they don't want to even think about it until they have to.",

"comment": "You are in one of the rare cases where going off grid solar makes some amount of sense, especially if your home isn't yet designed and you can design it for insane amounts of insulation.  $45k for power hookup makes solar a much, much more interesting (and reasonable) proposition than \"I live in a suburb, I have the grid, but really want to stick it to the man, so can I go off grid with a Powerwall?\"\n\nIgnore the Powerwalls, at least if you want your system online this decade.  They're proprietary nonsense that only work with inverters that will talk to them over Modbus or Canbus, so you have one or two options, neither of which is a great off grid inverter (you don't need to pay for the grid tie capability if you're nowhere close to the grid).\n\nRight now, go subscribe to Home Power with the back catalog, and start reading backwards from the most recent issue.  Buy a tablet to do this if you don't have one.  It's the best information out there.  The issues from the 90s or early 2000s is interesting, but not hugely relevant.  The newer issues, talking about modern homes, off grid with modern panels, are very relevant.\n\nBy \"traditional batteries,\" I assume you mean lead acid.  And I'd wager that somewhere between 99% and 99.99% of off grid systems use flooded lead acid, so it can't be that bad an idea.  My office is off grid and uses flooded lead acid, despite my side income rebuilding lithium batteries, because they're simple, reliable, well understood, and just work.\n\nThey don't have to be stored outside, but they will generate hydrogen when charging, so need to be vented.  Recombiner caps will help you a lot, if you're willing to pay for them, but you still need to vent them.  They like human-comfortable temperatures as well - get them too hot, they degrade faster, and keep them cold, and they don't produce as much power.  Too cold is a bit better than too hot, but you will need to avoid deeply discharging them in the cold - the electrolyte can freeze if the battery is deeply drained in cold weather, and that basically destroys the battery entirely.\n\nMost solar companies won't touch off grid - you're correct.  The good news is that it's not *that* hard to do it - you'll want an electrician to look over your work and ensure it's up to code for a house, but you can do a lot of the work yourself.\n\nIf you have enough land, consider ground mount panels.  You can seasonally pivot them easier, though \"aim the panels for winter and you'll be fine during the summer\" is also a decent policy.  Pivoting would be nicer, though.\n\nHome Power Magazine, though.  Go.  Do it.  It'll answer most of your questions.",

"comment": "Without cracking down on fossil fuels, the renewables revolution will be delayed. Consider there is a negative externality at play here, a market failure, the environmental cost of CO2 emissions. The appropriate way would be to impose a cost on it through some method (tax, cap and trade, etc) making renewables even more attractive and facilitating their penetration into the market. \n\nBut onshore wind and solar pv are definitely on their way to grid parity already in many places (some say already achieved) without these costs imposed on fossil fuels. This gives me hope.\n\nNevertheless, the damage done by not promoting renewables, by preferring fossil fuels, will be seen in future emissions.\n\nThe greatest worry is time, or the lack of it. Imagine 30 new coal fired power plants start their planning and building now. It will be several years before completion at which point, at a tremendous cost, they would have to be stopped under a new administration or legislation. So much time and money wasted.\n\nMeanwhilst the planet is heating up.\n\nIf the Paris agreement fails, then the issue becomes global. And then we are truly screwed.",

"comment": "That's not quite how net metering works.  With net metering you get paid full retail rate for excess electricity sold to the grid at any moment in time.  But...at the end of the year (true up period), if you generated more than you used over the entire year, you would get paid at wholesale rate of about $0.04/kwh.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you are actually dealing with at Power Purchase Agreement, not a Lease.  With PPA you simply agree to buy the electricity generated by the panels at $0.22/kwh with annual escalator.  You don't get any of the net metering credits for excess electricity generated, those would go to the company that owns the panels.  In fact, I think you would still have to pay $0.22/kwh for excess electricity.  In other words, if the panels generate 1,000 kwh in a month, but you only use 700 kwh, you'd still be paying for all 1,000 kwh.  The solar company would sell the 300 kwh to the utility company at full retail price and keep that money. I could be wrong, but I think that's how it works.\n\nGoogle \"solar PPA rip off\" to see what you're getting yourself in to.  Let us know how it works out.",

Imagine getting 10-15% more of a total system - for a few extra pennies a watt.\n\nEven if the bump is only 5% - it will be greater than the cost as silicon keeps falling in price as well as volume needed per watt wafer.",

It's good to maintain all forms of energy for reliability of the infrastructure in case anything happened to make one of them not operational.  For example if weather or a natural disaster blocked the sun light, solar power would be unreliable.  We would need the non green energy if this was the case.  The same for hydraulic power.  If water stops flowing for any reason, you lose that.  Also same for wind. These 3 are not renewable if the environment changes.  So I am not for completely replacing any one form of energy with another.",

It's not really any kind of glorifed work; basically just regular contract work. One job wiring could be too damn difficult, another day it's getting the panels in place on a slick roof. Inverters could be cheaper, that's for sure. \nEven if you don't put it on a roof, you build a structure instead. That takes time. I mean a standardized structure to insert into roofs would be fine, but you'd still need an array (lol) of options to take care of all the different roof types. There are so many options out there for improvements too. Micro inverters, racking redesigns... but ultimately, you gotta reduce the manhours from purchase to completion. It already doesn't take long, so you'd need to reduce people needed for installation without increasing risk. Equipment can only get so cheap. Time can only get so short. Panels can only get so efficient. So what has to be done is good financing, good ROI, and good value for cost. Maybe even something completely different! Combine multiple purposes with solar pv. Just gotta keep dling cost to value optimization.",

"comment": "Are they quoting you prices before the incentives, too? Costs have come down recently so you should look into what they're charging for each component. Panels, for example, should cost between $0.50/w and $0.75/w (roughly, I work in utility scale so my perception is skewed with economies of scale). \n\nFull retail net metering is great. It essentially means that the electricity you use is being exported to the grid and you can \"rebuy\" that electricity for no cost. You might want to see if it's monthly net metering or annual net metering. You'll be producing more than  you need in the summer and probably no where near what you'll need in the winter. If the net metering is annual, you can offset your winter dip with summer generation. \n\nBe careful with the Financing. Even though you plan on living there long term, you want to make sure you own the equipment. There are financing options (PPAs and leases) where they technically own the panels. If you ever need to sell the house, it will be a lot more work to transfer a system you don't own.\n\nThe all in cost before incentives should be between $1.90/w and $2.50/w (someone is residential solar, please correct me if I'm off here).",

"comment": "&gt;But as the solar industry has grown, **the market has been flooded with cheaply made Chinese panels that can break down in as few as five years**, according to Solar Power World editor-in-chief Kelly Pickerel. To understand the challenges of solar waste, it’s helpful to understand how the panels are built. There are different types of solar panels, but most of them contain aluminum, glass, silver, and an elastic material called ethylene-vinyl acetate. **The problem is that they can also contain more dangerous and sometimes cancer-causing, materials such as lead, chromium, and cadmium**. Functional panels are sealed off with glass and are very safe. But **when the glass breaks or the panels are damaged, those substances can leak**. **This risk is especially high with poorly made solar panels** installed in areas that experience extreme weather, like hurricanes and hail. \n\nRead the article in full first, then we can discuss the issue at hand.",

I do think however that since you want a pick-up you should consider waiting until there are more options available for electric pick-ups (like from Rivian, Tesla, and Ford). In the meantime though maybe you could invest in solar and battery for your home. You'd be able to produce your own clean energy, store it for the night time and grid outages, and when you do eventually get your electric pick-up, you'll be able to know you can charge it with clean energy and you'll know that somewhere within about ten year's you'll be getting back a return via your solar which would elevate from gas savings once you can mix solar, batteries, and the EV.\n\nI personally would try to get the cheapest yet most effective system of solar, probably one or two Tesla Powerwalls, and then wait for Tesla to reveal their pick-up in the next few months before deciding on which company to buy an EV truck from.\n\nJust trying to show an option.

An average ICE car (24 MPG) produced 400.\n\nYour pickup with 30 MPG would produce 320 grams of CO2 per mile, which is still a bit better than the worst state as of 2014, and I'm sure that Texas in 2019 is much better than the worst state in 2014 (coal is the dirtiest, and coal has dropped a lot since 2014). Note this only looks at CO2 but personally I think that everything else is pretty unimportant.\n\nYou can also look into solar panels on your house (if you own) or community solar (regardless of whether you own). In some places your utility company gives the option to pay more for greener electricity if you want.",

When batteries get to $0.065/KWh, than it would make sense to keep the power instead of sell it back.\n\nMaybe the Net metering price could also fluctuate with demand. If the price is good, dump the batteries to the grid at 5pm?\n\nTime of use thing is big too. I'm practicing it by charging my PHEV late at night, but I don't get a benefit yet.",

"comment": "Actually, all modern DC string inverters are designed to have more DC connected to them than their output. This is because solar panels only perform at their absolute max a very low percentage of the time. Typically, a 10kw DC solar system will have an actual output from the inverter of 8.8kw. During peak output times, this extra charge is \"clipped\", or converted to heat energy, in order to avoid exceeding amperage ratings of wiring an over current devices. This is why both DC charge controllers and AC inverters require adequate air circulation. If not dissipated this extra energy, wasted in the form of heat, can damage electronica and prematurely burn out inverters, if they are operated outside system parameters such as number of panels, or they are set to clip a much larger than normal amount of load. So smart  people take advantage of extra power by using a dump load to preheat water, coolant, floors, battery banks, or run an incinerating turlet. \nIn the case of a generator, which is load demand throttle control, the fuel would be decreased until the generator's rough sawtooth modified sine wave matched the range of the demand.",

Concrete tiles are difficult to penetrate for the racking structure, and they often break when solar installers are carrying panels across your roof.  Plus, the shingles are cheaper and prove more space for passive cooling off the panels.  \n\nI wouldn't remove tiles just for the sake of solar.

"comment": "$6/W for residential solar and storage is no where near close to today's rates.  GTM published national average was around $3/W.  I promise you the storage added to that does not double the system price on average.  I'll give you 2/3 of that $60000 and we're talking about a $0.238/kWh rate. And I'm willing to bet that 40k is generous.  If solar is $3/W a year ago and Tesla doesn't allow for an install to cost above 10k for a powerwall that should be a close proxy.  \n\nNSCR is not a fair comparison to the distribution charges on a customer's bill, that is the utilities calculation based on their wholesale rate to buy at the front of their grid.  You may consider grid maintenance a sunk cost, but that is that same feature of the grid that utilities consistently use to justify rate hikes annually. \n\nRecent basic schedule D SCE baseline winter (lower) itemized:\nTrans = $0.01489\nDist. = $0.08443\nNSGC = $0.00572\nNDC = $0.00005\nPPPC = $0.01288\nDWRBC = $0.00503\nPUCRF = $0.00046\n\nAfter a 2.8 cent CIA reimbursement, thats roughly 9.5 cents in service fees alone.  And that only goes up with tiers and TOU seasonal shifts",

"comment": "I’d argue it’s because plants aren’t conscious (sentient). It would be pointless evolutionarily for them to be conscious, because since they’re stuck to one spot, it’s not like they can run from predators. Not only that, they lack a brain and a nervous system, which would also indicate a lack of consciousness. A response to stimuli (such as moving in the direction of the sun) doesn’t necessarily prove consciousness. If it did, solar panels would also be conscious given that they also follow the sun. A tree doesn’t care if you stab it. It has no organs that produce emotion. It has no brain with which to think. It has no nervous system with which to feel. It will expel sap to close the wound, but tell me, do you yourself command your body to produce scabs for your wounds? Or does it happen automatically, almost robotically, without your conscious will? So it is for the tree.\n   \nI guess there is a reason people who are brain dead are called vegetables.",

Even if you had an engineer spend an entire 8 hour day, designing the system which I highly doubt a typical home requires, then that's still about $1400 at $175/hr billed rate. I was always under the impression that businesses built their costs, wages, fleet expenses, rent, benefits into that rate? That's what the rate is for, isn't it?  \n\n\n6500+1100+1400+3000 labor+ 700 materials= $12,700 + taxes 760 = $13,530 for a single Powerwall. And that's if the engineering really takes 8 hours and labor takes 10 hours for 2 skilled guys billing at $150/hr. Heck, add another $500 for site visits and permitting and still about $14,000 for a single powerwall. Does it take another 8 hours of engineering for each additional powerwall? Does it take another 10 hours for placing a powerwall in front of another and running wire through the existing conduit and breaker panel? \n\nStill don't see how these costs are justified beyond the first powerwall- I appreciate the input though.",

Add to that that there is no place to put nuclear waste currently (all nuke sites store waste on site in the US.) and you can understand why no one wants them in their backyard.\n\n* Nuclear power is more expensive.\n\nThe cost of generating solar power ranges from $36 to $44 per megawatt hour (MWh), the WNISR said, while onshore wind power comes in at $29–$56 per MWh. Nuclear energy costs between $112 and $189.\n\n(not in article but natural gas is also cheaper)\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J\n\n* No place to put the nuclear waste.\n\nFor the most part, this waste is stored where it was generated—at 80 sites in 35 states. The amount of waste is expected to increase to about 140,000 metric tons over the next several decades. However, there is still no disposal site in the United States.\n\nhttps://www.gao.gov/key_issues/disposal_of_highlevel_nuclear_waste/issue_summary\n\n* There just isn't any reason to build nuclear facilities unless you are looking for an easy way to shunt tax payer dollars to private enterprise.",

We don't offer any of that right now, in fact we are not even thinking about that yet - for now we rather regulate renewables down instead of dealing with dynamic electricity demand\". \n\nSo yes, the theory is neat.

"comment": "&gt; In  the  net‐zero emissions pathway presented in this report, the world economy in 2030 is some 40% larger than today but uses 7% less energy. A major worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is an  essential  part  of  these  efforts,  resulting  in  the  annual  rate  of  energy  intensity improvements averaging 4% to 2030 – about three‐times the average rate achieved over the last two decades.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Our pathway calls for scaling up solar and wind rapidly this decade, reaching annual additions of 630 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaics (PV) and 390 GW of wind by 2030, four‐times the record levels set in 2020. For solar PV, this is equivalent to installing the world’s current largest solar park roughly every day.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in our pathway, and no new coal mines or mine extensions are required. The unwavering policy focus on climate change in the net zero pathway results in a  sharp  decline  in  fossil  fuel  demand,  meaning  that  the  focus  for  oil  and  gas  producers switches  entirely  to  output  –  and  emissions  reductions  –  from  the  operation  of  existing assets. Unabated coal demand declines by 90% to just 1% of total energy use in 2050. Gas demand declines by 55% to 1 750 billion cubic metres and oil declines by 75% to 24 million barrels per day (mb/d), from around 90 mb/d in 2020.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Yet annual per capita income from oil and natural gas in producer economies falls by about 75%, from USD 1 800 in recent years to USD 450 by the 2030s, which could have knock‐on societal effects.\n\n-\n\n&gt;  total market size of critical minerals like copper, cobalt, manganese and various rare earth metals grows almost sevenfold between 2020 and 2030 in the net zero pathway. [See Critical Minerals Report](https://docs.wind-watch.org/IEA-Critical-Minerals.pdf)\n\n-\n\n&gt; Making net‐zero emissions a reality hinges on a singular, unwavering focus from all governments – working together with one another, and with businesses, investors and citizens.\n\n-\n\n&gt; The  net  zero  pathway  relies  on  unprecedented  international  co‐operation  among governments, especially on innovation and investment.\n\n-\n\n&gt; In the NZE, global energy‐related and industrial process CO2 emissions fall by nearly 40% between 2020 and 2030 and to net zero in 2050. Universal access to sustainable energy is achieved by 2030. There is a 75% reduction in methane emissions from fossil fuel use by 2030. These changes take place while the global economy  more  than doubles through to 2050 and the global population increases by 2 billion.\n\n-\n\n&gt;  Energy intensity falls by 4% on average each year between 2020 and 2030...This level of improvement in energy intensity is much greater than has been achieved in recent years: between 2010 and 2020, average annual energy intensity fell by less then 2% each year.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Total energy supply in 2050 in the NZE is close to the level in 2010, despite a global population that is nearly 3 billion people higher and a global economy that is over three‐times larger.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Total final consumption worldwide rebounds marginally following its 5% drop in 2020, but it never returns to 2019 levels in the NZE (435 EJ). It falls by just under 1% each year on average between 2025 and 2050 to 340 EJ.\n\n-\n\n&gt; A failure to develop CCUS for fossil fuels would substantially increase the risk of stranded assets and would require around USD 15 trillion of additional investment in wind, solar and electrolyser capacity to achieve the same level of emissions reductions. It could also critically delay progress on BECCS and DACCS: if these cannot be deployed at scale, then achieving net‐zero emissions by 2050 would be very much harder.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Without behavioural changes, 35% of households would have a car in 2050; with behavioural changes this share falls to around 20% in the NZE, and two‐car households fall from 13% of the total to less than 5%.\n\n-\n\n&gt; The importance of innovation increases as we get closer to 2050 because existing technologies will not be able to get us all the way along the path to net‐zero emissions. Almost  50%  of  the  emissions  reductions  needed  in  2050  in  the  NZE  depend  on technologies that are at the prototype or demonstration stage, i.e. are not yet available on the market\n\n-\n\n&gt; Electrification. Almost 30% of the 170 Gt CO2 cumulative emissions reductions from the use of low‐emissions electricity in the NZE comes from technologies that are currently  at  prototype  or  demonstration  stage,  such  as  electricity‐based  primary steel production or electric trucks. \n\n-\n\n&gt; Hydrogen. Not all steps of the low‐carbon hydrogen value chain are available on the market today. The majority of demand technologies, such as hydrogen‐based steel production, are only at the demonstration or prototype stage.

If you require that, then you’re disincentivizing a majority of people from getting residential solar panels. Which if that’s your agenda that’s fine but that is the result. From your perspective should solar be a part of any energy contribution to a grid, let’s say commercial, large scale solar panel?",

"comment": "Yeah I was thinking that too. Was looking at the Powerwall option, but the 3rd party availability is 6-9 months. Tesla deemed my project disqualified since I don’t have enough available roof to place their minimum amount of panels. \n\nMy original installer it was the same price for the Powerwall option and he was saying there’s more efficiency in the DC couple batteries. Also, he said the Solaredge inverter optimizes production to match demand so I’d be able to use the solar array even if the battery is full. \n\nUsing my original installer has the added benefit of easier warranty claims. I did have bad microinverters a year into my solar that they took care of quickly with good service. \n\nIs there a market for used microinverters? Can I sell those on eBay or something?",

"comment": "I'm in Arizona but most of the fees on the bill are federal fees so I'm not sure how you can get away from not paying those fees in California.\n\nYes, all the original quotes I received were at least 110% offset to prevent future utility charges.  The problem is that in order to have at least 110%, I'd have upgrade my electrical panel from 220 to 440.  And the estimates to do it were from $5,000 to $8,000 and most electricians were not even willing to take the job.  That's just not cost effective.\n\nThe most I could get with my current 220 electrical panel is solar panels covering 95% of my electricity needs.  Now, one would logically think that if 110% coverage prevents 100% of future charges on your electric bill, then 95% coverage would prevent 85% of future charges.  Apparently that assumption is wrong.  I'm just trying to figure out why it's wrong.",

If your Focus gets at least 50mpg it’ll be cheaper to run than an EV by then.\n\nI’m on Octopus Go and charge overnight for £0.075/kWh from 12.30am-4.30am and £0.35/kWh for the rest of the day.\n\nPreviously I was paying £0.035 and £0.15 /kWh. The price doubled during the last price cap rise, if extrapolate from there and expect two more price cap rises by January then it might be somewhere in the region of £0.30/kWh off peak and £0.74/kWh peak rate.\n\nAt £0.30/kWh and you do 10k miles a year with an efficiency of 4miles/kWh it would cost you £750/year in electricity. This doesn’t factor in other costs like insurance, servicing, tyres, and standing charges.\n\nYou’re also looking at roughly £1500 to get a type 2 charger installed.",

"comment": "&gt;Electric vehicle batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines result in a massive amount of waste and pollution. China is responsible for half of the total electric vehicles in the world—a number that is growing rapidly. About half of its retired batteries are not disposed in an environmentally sound way, causing significant waste and pollution problems detailed below. Batteries can be recycled but the cost is high, as it is with solar panels, which can contain hazardous materials. Most solar panels end up in landfills as do wind turbines, whose large blades are a major factor in their disposal. The United States does not have a policy for recycling these green technologies, which means that U.S. landfills can expect to see a massive increase in disposed materials from them as President Biden seeks to implement his net-zero carbon plan for all U.S. energy by 2050.\n\n###Battery Waste and Pollution\n\nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, by the end of May 2021, the number of electric vehicles in China is estimated to be 5.8 million, accounting for about half of the total number in the world.\n\nAccompanying the production and sale of new electric vehicles is the rapid development of the battery industry and the massive increase in retired batteries. The service life of new electric vehicle batteries is about 5 to 8 years, meaning batteries need to be recycled or disposed of in that time frame. In 2020, the cumulative retired batteries in China reached 200,000 tons (about 25-gigawatt hours) and is expected to increase to 780,000 tons (about 116-gigawatt hours) by 2025—a multiple of almost 4 in just 5 years. \n\nAccording to Professor Wu Feng at Beijing Institute of Technology:\n\nA 20-gram cell phone battery can pollute three standard swimming pools of water, and if abandoned on the land, can pollute 1 square kilometer of land for about 50 years.\n\nCompared to cell phone batteries, the pollution caused by the batteries of electric vehicles is far greater. Electric vehicle batteries contain cobalt, manganese, and nickel, which do not degrade on their own. Manganese, for example, pollutes the air, water, and soil, and more than 500 micrograms per cubic meter in the air can cause manganese poisoning.\n\nAnother major source of pollution in lithium-ion batteries is the electrolyte. The lithium hexafluorophosphate in the electrolyte is hydrolyzed in the air to produce phosphorus pentafluoride, hydrogen fluoride, and other harmful substances, which is a major threat to soil and water resources. Phosphorus pentafluoride is a strong irritant to human skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, and is also a very reactive compound that hydrolyzes in humid air to produce toxic and corrosive white fumes of hydrogen fluoride.\n\nLi Yongwang, general manager of Synfuels China, indicated that the batteries of electric vehicles are likely to cause far more pollution than the exhaust pollution of petroleum vehicles because exhaust pollution can be controlled, while the cost of recycling electric vehicles is high and difficult. \n\nOnce the total volume of electric vehicles reaches 10 percent of the total number of vehicles, major pollution problems are expected to be encountered. If the batteries are not properly handled during the recycling, dismantling, and processing stages, fires, explosions, heavy metal pollution, and organic emissions can result.\n\n###Solar Panels\n\nSimilar to electric vehicle batteries, the cost of solar panel recycling is high, resulting in solar panels ending up in landfills. It costs an estimated $20 to $30 to recycle one solar panel, which compares to a cost of $1 to $2 for sending that same panel to a landfill.\n\nSolar panels are mostly made of glass, which has low value as a recycled material, but they also have small amounts of silicon, silver, and copper as well as heavy metals (cadmium, lead, etc.) that some governments classify as hazardous waste. \n\nHazardous waste can only be transported at designated times and via select routes. Because solar panels are delicate and bulky, specialized labor is required to detach and remove them to avoid their shattering and polluting local areas.\n\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s official projections claim that “large amounts of annual waste are anticipated by the early 2030s” and could total 78 million metric tons by 2050 based mostly on a 30-year life cycle for the solar panels. According to the *Harvard Business Review*, the volume of solar waste is expected to surpass that of new installations by 2031. By 2035, discarded solar panels could outweigh new units sold by 2.56 times, increasing the levelized cost of solar energy, a measure of the overall cost of an energy-producing asset over its lifetime. According to the *Harvard Business Review*, the levelized cost of solar could be four times the current projection when solar waste is factored into the calculation.\n\n###Wind Turbines\n\nDecommissioning wind turbines includes the removal of all physical material and equipment related to the project to a depth of about 48 inches. Most of the concrete foundations used to anchor the wind turbines, however, are as deep as 15 feet. The concrete bases are hard to fully remove, and the rotor blades contain glass and carbon fibers that give off dust and toxic gases. While most (90 percent) of a turbine can be recycled or be sold to a wind farm in Asia or Africa, researchers estimate the United States will have more than 720,000 tons of blade material to dispose of over the next 20 years, a figure that does not include newer, taller higher-capacity wind turbines.\n\nWind turbine blades are made of a tough but pliable mix of resin and fiberglass—similar to what spaceship parts are made from. Decommissioned blades are difficult and expensive to transport. They can be anywhere from 100 to 300 feet long and must be cut up on-site before getting trucked away on specialized equipment to a landfill that may not have the capacity for the blades. Landfills that do have the capacity may not have equipment large enough to crush them. One such landfill cuts the blades into three pieces and stuffs the two smaller sections into the third, which is cheaper than renting stronger crushing machines.\n\nIn Minnesota, Xcel Energy estimates conservatively that it will cost $532,000 (in 2019 dollars) to decommission each of its wind turbines—a total cost of $71 million to decommission the 134 turbines in operation at its Noble facility. \n\nDecommissioning the Palmer’s Creek Wind facility in Chippewa County, Minnesota, is estimated to cost $7,385,822 for decommissioning the 18 wind turbines operating at that site, for a cost of $410,000 per turbine.",

"comment": "It’s really more about the tax benefit as to whether or not the solar installer should be coordinating the sub. We work with roofers more often when panels have to be taken down and then reset after a re-roof. In that instance it’s vital that the installers and the roofers coordinate well so that you don’t have a bunch of holes in your roof after the system is taken off, but before the new roof is put on. But for an initial install, I don’t know if it matters who coordinates what, so long as both the installers and the roofers are competent at their particular task.",

"comment": "We might be bias here, but I have some additional insights to consider when looking for an Oklahoma installer:\n\n1. We've installed more solar in Oklahoma than any other company, and it's not even close. 120,000 panels and counting.\n2. Just last month we were named the #1 solar installer in Oklahoma for the 5th year in a row (in terms of total kW installed). The other companies in your excel sheet did not even make the top 10.\n3. Most QCELL panels are manufactured in Asia, but they are technically assembled in Atlanta, GA.\n4. We just got a new financier that has no dealer fee and is extremely competitive. \n5. We're never give you up, never going to let you down. We are a customer-first company. While a lot of these out-of-state door knocking companies are leaving people high and dry we will be here for decades to come.\n\nHappy to answer any more questions you might have.

The longest would be a 2-hour trip the destination in all cases would have EV chargers.  Currently driving an Audi A4 Allroad and we love the cargo room.  Very seldom do we have more than 3 people in the car. Mostly just my wife and I and the dogs in the back.\n\n  \n\\[1\\] Your general location - Okanagan Valley, BC Canada\n\n\\[2\\] Your budget - $65000 CDN \\~ $48000 USD\n\n\\[3\\] The type of vehicle you'd prefer - SUV or Wagon - I have $5000 with Audi plus my trade-in.  I bought an extended warranty with my current car, and did not use it so I get it back as a 'discount'.  \n\n\\[4\\] Which cars have you been looking at already? 2019\\~2021 Audi e-tron, 2021\\~2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E\n\n\\[5\\] Estimated timeframe of your purchase: 3 \\~ 6 months - Maybe sooner depending on whether I can get a deal.\n\n\\[6\\] Your daily commute, or average weekly mileage - On average 200km/week\n\n\\[7\\] Your living situation — Own a single-family home\n\n\\[8\\] Do you plan on installing charging at your home? YES, if it makes any difference, I am also looking to install solar panels on my house as well.  \n\n\\[9\\] Other cargo/passenger needs — We have 2 dogs and a cat.  The A4 allroad has amazing cargo space and we love it.  So anything we buy needs to have the same space if not more.  Leaning towards the Audi e-tron for 2 reason, one the discount I have listed above and two being the cargo. :)\n\n  \nThank you for your time looking forward to any feedback.",

That said, cars should have a solar roof, even if to just trickle charge the battery and run a blower fan in the interior to keep it cooler in summer when parked. A regular car roof could make 500W if we bonded PV silicon under a glass roof like on a model 3. It's something and it would weigh very little.  500W means thin wiring, a tiny charge controller. It would add 10lbs.",

So many innovative features and options. They’re even going to offer individual cell replacement here soon. They’re going to establish a manufacturing plant here in TX within the next few years so the support will be ramped up even more than it already is. Their main panel is a SPAN competitor but way cheaper, which is huge. \n\nWarranty on the tesla powerwall is short. You’re paying for the name, and in a couple years it’s no longer going to be the industry leader. The enphase batteries will take up so much space in your home for the same if not less capacity than the point guard batteries. Their EV charger (not sure if you’d need it) is bidirectional which is awesome as well. \n\nThis is all my opinion and from what I’ve learned about the company, so, please take what I’ve said how you want. But, I’m really excited about it because Tesla won’t sell to a small distribution company like mine. Pointguard is going to be big fast, they’re already selling like crazy worldwide.",

While most of us don't go out of our way to evanglize about veganism, if it's brought up in conversation, why would it be a bad thing to discuss? What if you gave someone new information that led them towards making healthier choices for themselves, the enviornment, and of course, the animals? We're supposed to not even mention being vegan just in case someone is offended by our choice? \n\nI would wager the best thing to do in a situation like that is to say, \"I'm not trying to make you a vegetarian, I'm just explaining why I can't/won't eat (insert product). If you are ever interested in why I'm vegan, feel free to ask, but it's my choice, not yours.\" Or, something to that effect.",

"comment": "I never buy it. It's just too easy to make. Here's my recipe:\n\n2 cups vital wheat gluten  \n1/2 cup nutritional yeast flakes  \n1-2 tsp each black pepper, paprika, thyme, sage (pretty much whatever spices you like)  \n\n1 cup vegetable broth  \n1/2 cup soy sauce  \n\nCombine the dry ingredients then pour in the liquid. Stir until the liquid is absorbed, then knead for about 10 minutes. The way I know the kneading is done is when  the surface of the dough starts to look smooth when stretched. After finished kneading, form the dough into a ball and then cut in half.  \n\nSimmer for an hour in a combination of boiling water and vegetable broth with a bit more soy sace. I think this is impossible to overcook but give it at least an hour.  \n\nAfter cooking, it can be sliced for sandwiches. Another option is to roughly chop it before boiling. Then you'll end up with a bunch of irregularly shaped pieces which can then be grilled or fried or thrown in with rice and vegetables.  \n\n  Here's a few pictures of what it'll look like:  \n\n  http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulcole/4156240269/  \n  http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulcole/4156240459/",

"comment": "The issue of feeding animals vegan food is difficult though. My dog has TONS of allergies (she's even mildly allergic to humans!). There is no doubt in my mind that she came from a puppy mill, and that her allergies are a result of poor breeding. But I can't feed her a vegan diet because she is allergic to almost every grain and a lot of vegetables. She also has digestive issues so I have to make sure I give her the plainest, easiest to digest food that I can. On top of all that, she is a picky eater. She would rather starve than eat some things. So what am I supposed to feed her? \n\nWe've tried so many different foods with mixed results. Some make her sick. Some she doesn't like. Lately, she's been being fed organic chicken that's cut up into tiny pieces. She gets organic baby food made of the vegetables that she can have (baby food is easy to digest). She also gets a multivitamin. But I worry that she's not getting all the proper nutrients.\n\nSo yeah, I agree that the issue with food is difficult.",

The caveat being that you should have more avocados than you can make guac out of (because guac &gt; pudding, and I love pudding) and that they have to be perfectly ripe. \n\nI haven't made these in a year. I should get on that. I'm on a waffle kick right now because I got a waffle iron from Black Friday. Except I use chappati flour instead of All Purpose, so now all my waffles taste like pooris/puris.

"comment": "First, I'd like to say that I wouldn't use this approach: I think it's ineffective precisely because it will just offend people and make them shut down.\n\n*However* as far as accuracy goes, I don't think it's completely off the mark. To start with, there are two different ways to interpret it:\n\n1. An attack on a specific form of argument: \"Even if you believe X to be morally wrong, you should still respect my right to engage in X and refrain from judging/criticizing/interfering\"\n\n2. An actual comparison between the meat industry and racism/Nazis.\n\n***\n\nLet's start with #1, which is fairly inoffensive. Most would agree that a good person doesn't sit by and watch something wrong occur without attempting to prevent or mitigate it. So the argument \"It's fine if you want to be vegan. I'll respect your right to be vegan and you respect my right to eat meat\" fails at the get go because that same person would absolutely interfere with a rapist/robber/racist and so on. So the argument isn't really about whether people should respect each other, but whether eating meat is in fact a moral wrong. \n\nFor the criticism implied in #1 to succeed, it is only necessary to show that the form of the argument is invalid. If you cannot substitute any action for \"X\" then it's actually about what \"X\" should not be respected.\n\n***\n\nNow for the more sensitive issue. Can we compare the holocaust and the meat industry? Well, the holocaust was not inherently wrong in and itself: it was wrong because of the actual harms it caused. People suffered, people died and were deprived of any future pleasure they might have had in their lives, and they had their preferences violated (if that is something you recognize as a harm in and of itself). To inflict those harms to people is a wrong thing to do.\n\nGiven the similarities in physiology and behavior, it is apparent (and I certainly can provide a much more detailed support of this argument if necessary) that many animals can experience physical pain/pleasure as well as emotional states in a way that is comparable to humans. They can experience physical and emotional distress, and can be deprived of pleasure. Similarly to humans, they can be deprived of all future pleasure by being killed. Additionally, they show preferences and there is an implicit preference to remain alive: pretty much any animal will try very hard to avoid death.\n\nThere are perhaps valid reasons to consider animal lives less valuable than humans: they live less time for the most part, and are so deprived of less when killed. They have smaller/less intricate social networks and so causing suffering or death to one incites less suffering to those in that individual's social sphere compared to a human. However, these are not categorical differences. They are differences of magnitude.\n\nLet us just arbitrarily suppose that an animal's (chicken/cow/pig/sheep) life and suffering is in general 1,000 times less valuable than a human. Personally, I believe this is an enormous underestimation, but let's use that arbitrary value anyway. \n\n*In the United States, around nine billion animals are slaughtered every year. (this includes about 150.4 million cattle, bison, sheep, hogs, and goats and 8.9 billion chickens, turkeys, and ducks; in 2009, 13,450,000 long tons (13,670,000 t) of beef were consumed in the U.S. alone. In Canada, 650 million animals are killed annually. In the European Union, the annual figure is 300 million cattle, sheep, and pigs, and four billion (an unverified number) chickens.* — http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse\n\nThat is roughly 10 billion animals per year. (Not including animals slaughtered outside of the US/Canada/EU, which no doubt would add at least several billion to the figure.)\n\n*An estimate of the total number of humans who have ever lived was prepared by Carl Haub of the nonprofit Population Reference Bureau in 1995, and was subsequently updated in 2002; the updated figure totalled approximately 106 billion.* — http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#Number_of_humans_who_have_ever_lived\n\nIn roughly 10 years we kill more animals that the amount of humans that have ever lived. If the harm caused to an animal through suffering and loss of life is even *slightly* comparable to a human, it seems like this would result in much greater suffering and death than humans have *ever* experienced.\n\nIf we look at this objectively I think it would be fair to say that the amount of animal suffering that humans are responsible for vastly outweighs that which was ever caused by racism or Nazis. Really, the only way to avoid this conclusion would be to prove somehow that a pig's suffering or distress simply cannot be compared to a human's.",

"comment": "I have a page long compilation of health studies that I prepared for a post, they included vegan &gt; vegetarian.\n\nMy 98% number is through talking with a director of Friends of Animals and Gene Baur at Farm Sanctuary.  \n\nIf you think about it: \nAnimals in: \nEntertainment (some *may* be considered abuse): i.e. Circus,\nResearch: Medical, cosmetic\nClothes/Acessories: Feathers, crocidile skin, fur.\nIllegal: Dog Fighting\n\nOther use of animals:\nOccupation: Police Dog\nLabor: Carriage horses\nPets: Breeding\n\nWe by far consume way more animals by food.  Let me randomly google:\n\nSome numbers:\n&gt;(nearly 10.2 billion) land animals were raised and killed for food in the United States in 2010\nAquatics outnumber land by like 7 to 1.  So that is about 80 billion animals a year in food.\n\nFor 2009: \n&gt;2009 amount to 8.3 billion land animals and 51 billion sea animals. (So, a total of about 59 billion animals.) \nThis is in the US\n\nWorldwide:\n&gt; 58 billion are killed worldwide. (this is only land animals, so we can perhaps apply the 7x to add aquatic?)\n\nThough another site has 150 billion world wide.  This seems low if 58 billion of them are land animals.  The site that states 150 billion also says:\n\n&gt;According to these statistics, about 53 billion land animals are slaughtered annually worldwide. (It should be noted that at the time the numbers were compiled, they were the minimum numbers of animals killed each year. The actual numbers may be significantly greater insofar as some countries or territories either did not report, or deliberately excluded, some statistics\n\n&gt;It's important to note that, since most of the available data are now eight years old as of 2011, these estimates are extremely conservative. It is now quite likely that in many of the categories noted, the current kill rates are as much as 10 percent higher than what is indicated here\n\nhttp://www.adaptt.org/killcounter.html\n\nBut then for fish, there is also:\nOne organization has tried to create an accurate calculation for fish, and has estimated that about **1 trillion fish** are caught each year\n\nhttp://humaneeducation.org/blog/2011/06/29/food-for-thought-infographic-on-number-of-animals-killed-for-food-worldwide/\n\n\n\nVivisections:\nEstimates range from 17 million to 70 million to 100 million.  \n\nThis does not mention if it is worldwide or US\n\nEvery year, over 40 million animals are killed for fur worldwide. \n\nhttp://animalrights.about.com/od/animalrights101/tp/How-Many-Animals-Are-Killed.htm\n\nSo food we have 100's of billions to trillions.\nFor others,  100s of millions\n\n\nAnd this is from our friends at ALF\n&gt;**Animals used for food production account for 97% of all animals killed** in US slaughterhouses, labs, pounds, and open spaces. Although they are capable of experiencing most feelings that we and our beloved companion animals do, farmed animals are view and treated by the meat, dairy, and egg industries as mere tools of production.\n\nhttp://www.animalliberationfront.com/Practical/FactoryFarm/USDAnumbers.htm\n\nSorry for poor formatting, I am not too interested in making a giant post about it.  It is a pretty hard stat too come up with, but it looks like high 90s is not off.",

I'm curious though as to what some omnivores would say about it because one of the \"arguments\" against going vegan is the \"If we don't eat meat then cows will go extinct!\" (which I also find odd because another \"argument\" is if we don't eat cows they'll become over populated...which is it?) So if given the option of affordable lab grown meat that doesn't harm an animal, but like going vegan reduces the amount of cows bred into existence just to be killed, will they make the same argument against it of, \"but then cows will go extinct!\" or will the ridiculousness of that argument be seen?",

It's not that hard.\n\nIf there are animals on the island there are most likely edible plants anyway, just hang out and follow a boar around until (s)he shows you their stash. Then once you bond with the boar over the vegan food you leave the group of dramatized contestants and live a stress free life with the boar, (s)he is probably more fun to be around than the group of gossiping humans anyway.\n\nEdit: update: I am now heading off to live a life on an island. The imagined scenario seemed a lot more fun than fighting omni fallacies all day",

Do not bring your eating habits up unless asked about it (as you do). Do not be judgemental, this alienates non vegans. While being judgemental seems to make some vegans feel better about themselves it is polarising and push people away from veganism and as such hurts animals, the environment and people's health.",

If they say no thanks, you could persist and say that you'd be happy to make them something that is familiar to them (like burgers, mac n heese, something like that) and that it would mean so much to you if they would try it - or, just say okay and try again next week. I think eventually they'll say ok, and if they like it they may be open to doing it once a week, and so on. Not sure if this is the advice you are looking for, but my wife was vegan for many years before me and this is something she did with me and now we are both happily vegan. I love her mac n cheese and burgers more than anything I used to cook!",

"comment": "So microplastics are the answer?\n\nThis would seem to suggest there are vegan type people and non-vegan type people and that it's not simply an opinion that can be changed. Chemical warfare will be necessary if the elites want compliant masses. They left that trait out of the title, but it would seem to me to be the one with the political relevance for funding something like this.\n\nI would think actual vegans tend to be more rebellious than that, having consciously chosen a specific diet to set themselves apart. Maybe it's more like being the food police. Vegans get pushback from other individuals, but the institutional power is behind them. Is it still trendy or passé already?",

"comment": "If someone hasn't had to deal with IBS then they probably know nothing about it. It's a poorly understood condition to begin with, and the potential trigger list is huge.\n\nYes it's frustrating that practically nowhere caters to vegans with IBS. But it's also understandable, because these places are businesses and they do need to have a market to continue existing. I'm not sure on your 20% stat, I've always heard it's 5-10% of the population, but you've also got to remember not everyone with IBS is triggered by allums. So leaving garlic out might only cater to 1% of people.\n\nBuddhist places and Japanese places will be your best options for avoiding triggers. But they're not always easy to find. \n\nLike I totally get that it sucks, because I've had to deal with this too. Unfortunately being a minority within a minority, you're not going to be catered to very often. Something I found useful for going out was putting the ingredients for miso soup into a Thermos, then adding hot water at mealtime. Rice noodles cook fine in water from a kettle.\n\nAlso see if any bakeries near you sell low FODMAP bread, and if any stores stock low FODMAP flour. Those two products were game changers for me. \n\nA lot of Asian grocers will stock Buddhist seitan products that are onion/garlic free also, which are awesome for high protein meal prep.\n\nChoosing a medium FODMAP dish can work too, and then rationing it over a few hours. So you're just having 1/3 size serves. Often that's enough to prevent a flare, since IBS triggers are dose dependent.  My partner is able to eat beans this way, just by having smaller portions spaced out.\n\nRemember that being vegan isn't about being perfect, it's about doing your reasonable best. For you, with a medical condition, your best may look different to someone else's and that's OK. Veganism isn't about starving yourself, or flaring a medical condition. Just do your best and learn as you go.",

But those images are to show people the bad and make them care and either go vegan or demand change. You don’t need this as you are already there.\n\n2. Try and use your anger and sadness as a force for good. Accept you cannot save them all, but can you help one animal this month? Another next month? You can help by helping one single cause on social\nMedia, or by going the local shelter and taking one dog for a walk. \n\nHey, hurting yourself will not help any animals and won’t help your 3 dogs who you must love lots. So when you see bad things remember you have to be brave and take this pain so that an innocent animal in the future doesn’t have to. Peace and love to you.",

It's similar to the non-heme iron, we need to eat more to meet the recommendations, because most of it is excreted by the body in form of waste.\n\nThere are different kinds of supplements, those soluble under tongue should bring the best results and nutritional yeast might be better than some capsules, but it's hard to generalize.\n\nI looked into the Bjäst (is [that](http://www.alfafood.no/bj_st_b12_produktinfo) it?) and it has very low B12 content, I wouldn't rely on that and get myself checked from time to time.
