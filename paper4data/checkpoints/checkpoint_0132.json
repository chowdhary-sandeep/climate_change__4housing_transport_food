"comment": "I think the article is very overoptimistic regarding the potential that electric cars have for positive change on a societal level. I'm a huge fan and proponent of electric cars - I think they're superior to antiqued ICEs in every possible way, and they hold so much potential for the future. But anyone who thinks that getting people to switch from ICE cars to electric cars will solve all our problems is unbeleivably naive.\n\nWe need to be questioning the neccessity for having personal vehicles in the first place. We need to be getting people out of cars and onto bikes and buses, freeing up our cities for more efficient use of space and resources. Cars will always have a place - in rural areas, for disabled people, or for transporting goods, but single-occupant cars have no place in cities, electric or otherwise.",

"comment": "Thanks robertbowerman. You're probably right about those two groups. However I think there may be more to it than that, and hopefully the research will be quiet revealing. \n\nThe suggestion about the charging infrastructure is an interesting one, and I think there could be merit in doing something on this in the future! If downed infrastructure is preventing people from using EVs it would indeed be a serious issue that would need resolving. \n\nSure I have said on other forums that I can't share the raw data for obvious ethics reasons, but any publications or presentations that come out. As soon as they are finalised I will post on here.\n\nScott",

When renewable energy is available and affordable price, I would buy it wherever I live. If it isn't, I won't. But I will advocate for it to become available at an affordable price.\n\nLuckily, people in my geography did that a long time ago, so renewable energy is dominant here now already.\n\n&gt; And if solar was cheaper, better, then say \"SHIT\" then explain why solar plants are filing for BK when they were subsidized by tax payer money? I mean, if it's so good, then why are they doing so bad??\n\nI'm not knowledgable about the business side. Part of it is probably that China is making solar panels very competitively and people who try to compete with them are getting their clocks cleaned. \n\nIt really doesn't matter. When one company goes bankrupt, another grabs its market share. The point is that the market keeps growing and that is undeniably happening. The Game of Thrones behind the growth is irrelevant to me.\n\n&gt; Solar, given tax breaks, and tax grants to build... Go bankrupt.\nFossil fuels, taxed to death, regulated to death, and still turning a profit...\n\nFossil fuels also have huge subsidies and fossil fuel companies are also going bankrupt.\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/09/fossil-fuel-subsidies_n_5572346.html\n\nBut the biggest subsidy is that other people pay for the healthcare of those damaged by the pollution in the air.",

"comment": "&gt;We also have net metering. Offering about 6c/kwh.  \n\nThat sounds more like a feed-in tariff than net metering. \n\nI make way more power than I use during the summer. For each kWh I send back to the grid, I receive a credit good towards another kWh that I can use at any time up until a certain date. When that date, called my anniversary date, comes, anything extra I sent over the prior 12 months is credited at the utility's avoided cost rate. If my solar production wasn't enough to cover my needs, I have to buy at ~14¢/kWh, unless I have banked credits, which I pull 1:1. But if I over produce for the year, the utility only buys the excess at ~2¢ (the same rate they buy from a megawatt coal plant). I think in some states/areas, you just lose the extra credits. And in some states, feed-in tariffs exist.\n\nI guess the biggest difference between the two is really when you get paid, and that net metering gives you full retail value of anything you produce and use. Net metering is good when you have a large difference between summer and winter production - it's basically using the grid as a lossless battery. My anniversary date is April 1, so that's when my clock resets. Last year, I produced 1912 kWh more than I used and got a check for about $40. Not going to get rich that way, but I plan to eventually use the extra power for an electric car.\n\nThis is getting long and I don't think I'm explaining it well.

"comment": "Eh, no more than your last smartphone was obsolete. It still did everything you needed just fine, even if it doesn't have the new shiny.\n\nI bought a 2015 Leaf S w/QC pkg last November knowing perfectly well about what improvements are coming. More range is nice, but I already only use about 5-25% of my battery per trip right now, and it covers 98% of my trips (everything except a road trip every 3-4 months). I don't even charge nightly anymore, just when it gets below 50% (and even then sometimes not, knowing I can get a free quick charge from 25%-&gt;80% in 20 minutes for free).\n\nMore range is nice, but it doesn't really buy me much additional utility for the cost.  With my brand new Leaf being $11.5K + tax/title/reg after fed/state credits, a new Bolt or Model 3 would be around triple the price for what? Maybe covering 1% more of my trips? I'd rather maintain my old '93 Maxima for next to nothing (mostly sits idle) for those remaining trips, which I'd probably still have to do even with a Bolt. I drive my cars until the wheels fall off, so depreciation isn't a concern, and at $11.5K there's not that much of it anyway.\n\nMy biggest concern was not whether the car would be obsolete, it's whether range degradation over the years would affect what % of my trips it could make. I determined in my case that even if in 10 years I have 50% of the range, it'd still make 95%+ of my trips, or the same 98% if you include one 20-minute quick charge.\n\nCertainly the Bolt and Model 3 will be game changing for many folks, for whom their daily driving stresses the maximum range of the Leaf and current gen vehicles, or who really want to stay single-car and need to be able to make 200+ mile round-trips every few weeks.  Though if a Leaf works well for you today, it's not going to stop working well just because the Bolt came out.\n\nedit: Also, in a few years we may still see significant battery pack upgrades available to older cars. That would be a nice perk, but even without, the car will do what I need of it.",

"comment": "I recently disvovered that right now there is a disconnect between solar panel, battery and inverter companies. Yes you can get all three but there is not one vertically integrated company offering a product/service with all three combined designed from the ground up. I believe that by tesla bringing solar into their control they can perfectly match the battery, inverter and solar to work together in a way that will provide a service that will revolutionize the way we think about electricity in homes. Being able to do it in a way that replaces the need for a roof basically kills two birds with one stone and can subsidize the upfront costs as the home owner is saving the amount of money a roof without solar would cost. \n\nThe keys to making this work is cost, effectiveness, and longevity. I think costs will be too high for most initially until economies of scale can be implemented ( both batteries and solar products of tesla and solar city are in the last leg in their mass factory building, so they saw this coming). Next, longevity with battery tech is probably pretty much solidified with teslas ( and Panasonic) many years experiance implementing large battery packs with vehicles. Inverters are a bit of an unknown as tesla is switching to an in house inverter. Lastly, most concerning is the solar panels replacing a roof. There are heat concerns with this application which i understand significantly impact efficiency, also the robustness of the panels and ability to stay water tight while surviving hail, debris, snow, leaves and more. Installation costs are also an unknown but considering that is up front cost and should this really take off there will likely be healthy competition tv's keeps these costs down. \n\nAll in all, i think in 10 years time we could see a significant number of new construction homes Being built with tesla energy on the roof with battery.",

The farthest my wife and I go for errands is to a wholesale place 25 miles from our house. Even with an older Leaf, range isn't a concern. \n\nI honestly think Sheetz is best poised to have quick-charge stations. They're mostly off big highways, and they have food and drinks with dining areas. So you plug up, go in, order lunch, eat, and be on your way. Such a model makes road-tripping more viable for EV drivers, giving them something to do during the recharge. Maybe not enough to occupy them for 2 hours yet, but it's something.",

"comment": "I have mixed thoughts on this. On one hand, I firmly believe that CHAdeMO needs to die so that everybody uses CCS. On the other hand, there are a huge number of CHAdeMO installations, especially in Japan and even some here in North America, simply because 1) CHAdeMO was ready well before CCS, 2) the LEAF was the first really widespread EV, CCS models came way later, and 3) Nissan/Mitsubishi/Kia worked to install a good number of these at their properties and other locations.\n\nSo, what happens to all of those sites? And if we get rid of them and go CCS only from now on, what happens to everybody with the 1st generation Leaf/iMiev/Outlander/Soul EV?\n\nDual-standard L3 stations are great, so I'm wondering if we can't start doing the same thing with Japanese EVs: have a J1772 L2/CCS L3 combo port and a CHAdeMO port. It won't require significantly more space under the charging door(s) since CCS just tacks on to the bottom of J1772. If they're right next to each other a la the Leaf or Soul EV, presumably the wiring can join together just a couple of inches in, since only one will be allowed to be active at a time you just use a splitter basically.\n\nEdit: just saw the additional photos and I'm 99% sure they'll be going with the same (per region) charger config as the 1st gen, i.e. J1772+CHAdeMO in NA, it looks identical to the existing Leaf under that door. Pity, another 5+ years of that nonsense.",

"comment": "post text for posterity:\n\n&gt;Non plug-in hybrids, such as a Ford Fusion Energi, or the Toyota Avalon Hybrid, have a small battery that is really meant to be used as a buffer for the engine generator. However, the battery can be used to drive in EV only mode, albeit for a very short period.\n&gt;\n&gt;After depleting the battery, the engine kicks on and will recharge the battery. This is doable and practical as the battery is small and it doesnt take too much to recharge to begin with.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Chevrolet Volt is a plug in hybrid. The battery is larger and allows for a greater EV only travel range, but it needs to be plugged in externally to be recharged. When it runs out, you do have a standard engine to extend the range though, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt;But, the thing is, in the case of the Volt, its a series configuration, meaning the electric motor is all that drives the wheels, and the engine is PURELY a generator. Meaning, under high load, you kinda have to have some good battery charge to give the motor the power it needs to carry you.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, of course, the battery really has a bit of charge left when it kicks off to engine mode. And, theres a \"Mountain Mode\" that you can select ahead of time, and the engine will recharge the battery to around 30% (i think) if its below that, so youll have plenty of charge to pull you up a large incline.\n&gt;\n&gt;But that only works to 30% or whatever the limit is.\n&gt;\n&gt;I understand that its kinda pointless to have the engine spend all that time recharging a large battery. It defeats the purpose of efficiency and gas savings.\n&gt;\n&gt;But, especially since the Volt is series configured, why cant you have the engine recharge the battery more, or even fully, if you had to?\n&gt;\n&gt;In the case of the Volt, since gas stations are still a LOT more common that charge stations or public outlets, if my battery gets low and I have to use engine mode, am I simply unable to really use pure EV mode until I finally find a place to charge? Mountain Mode only goes to 30% or so, so Id be stuck going back and forth as 30% is only like 15 miles at a time (based on the Volts normal full EV range of about 50 miles.)\n&gt;\n&gt;Is there a way to force the Volt to use the engine to charge above 30%, or are there other hybrids that let you do this?\n&gt;\n&gt;Again, cars like the Avalon Hybrid do let you do this, but only because the battery is small anyways. It takes like 10-15 minutes to recharge it. And you get like 2 miles of driving out of it.",

But Panasonic it's going to be around for a while.\nThe typical story here is that SunPower systems are expensive and luxury. My experience though they came in cheaper than Tesla, SunPower were also clearer on the warranty and exact hardware they will use to install the system.\nI don't have my system installed yet and don't have experience with the monitoring software. I don't really see my self using it all that often.",

The difference is that the little delivery vans require comparatively much smaller batteries, so they can make 10 of them for every semi battery, because we already have enough supply issues.\n\nPlus the semi doesn't even make any sense. They're going to be so heavy that they're going to limit the cargo capacity. Doesn't do you any good to save money on fuel if its offset by a loss of cargo capacity.",

"comment": "&gt;and compare it to a BEV of the same price\n\nI don't think that's what they're saying though - they're saying they've compared a conventional car with one of the same or similar shape/class/model/trim as an EV, and are comparing those costs.\n\nFor example: here in Australia, I can get a Hyundai Ioniq in Hybrid EV, Plug-In EV or Battery EV guises.\n\nEach is available in two trim levels (the higher trim level is $5K for hybrid or plug-in, $4K for BEV), and apart from a couple of exterior garnishes, bumpers and wheels, appear identical. Interiors are very similar too, the hybrid missing a few EV only features (regen variability, push button shifter &amp; e-brake, slightly more luggage space and a slightly larger screen in the instrument cluster) but for the most part they're the same, down to the infotainment screen.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, they're as close as we can get to an apples-to-apples comparison of the same car with three different drivetrains. In terms of price (pre-onroads) the hybrid comes in at $33,990 AU, the plug in at $40,990 AU, and the Battery EV at $44,990 AU.\n\nIt's reasonable for a customer to wonder how long the Battery EV would take to recoup the $11K premium over the hybrid, and that's where the value metric falls down for many people still today.\n\nIt's also reasonable to say \"I can afford an Ioniq, but I can't afford the EV version\" - which ultimately is the issue for many buyers; the EV version *does* require a substantial premium, that requires keeping the car for a decade (and consistently doing high mileage over that time) to recoup the costs.\n\nFor some people that equation works in favour of the EV - but for many it doesn't. I don't really understand the idea of arguing with people to tell them their circumstances are \"wrong\" and a BEV is always the answer - we're still early in the maturity of EVs, so it's hardly surprising they don't meet all circumstances of all people.",

"comment": "It’s only about 4inches shorter than the rav4, but it definitely looks like it’s not as tall as it is from the outside. A lot of it is because of the battery that goes underneath what would be the traditional chassis really reduces ground clearance. But where you’re sitting is still elevated and give you a good view of the road. So from the inside I’d say the ride height feels comparable to a crossover like the rav4 or an escape. There’s a lot of space inside as well for storage, especially when you factor in the frunk (which is actually a lot more useful than I expected).\n\nYou should go test drive one and see what you think and if you like it though. Personally, I hated the Mach e until I went to see one in person and it looked amazing and I immediately knew it was what I wanted. There’s a lot of other good electric crossovers out or coming soon as well though, so you should definitely check them all out (Mach E, ID.4, Model Y, EV6, Audi Q4, Ioniq5, Ariya just to name a few - all great in their own ways). I just think in general you’d be happier with an EV than the Prime. Just research and see which one makes the most sense for you.",

A quick google showed a patent to circulate cold oil.\n\nIn a hybrid/PHEV, you run the ICE less than you would in a pure ICE car, but unless they are doing something for this it seems when the ICE is running it would be harder than a pure ICE.\n\nJust dawned on me that pure ICE sounds healthy. Pure natural foods :)",

For example enforce our constitutionally recognized right to privacy.

"comment": "EPA has always been terrible and for EVs it’s 10x more useless than in a gas car. EVs are the exact opposite of gas cars and get less efficient with higher speeds and EVERYTHING affects their range. Ignore it and just lookup the max range test @70mph for the EVs you’re interested in. This is still pretty useless but the one thing it’s good for is comparing the max range between EVs.\n\nThe AWD Ioniq5 and EV6 have just enough range to work well but it’s a near thing.  At 200 to 220 and the lack of charging in some areas it can be a bit challenging.  The good thing is it charges fast and long term that is WAY more important than range.  Still would be nice if they got closer to 250 miles.",

In the past year, our total kWs charged at home were 8,244 - I know this because that’s what my EVSE reported.  We took several road trips and charged commercially to the tune of $378.13.  I know this because I tracked my expenses for business.\n\nAll in, my total out of pocket for charging my two EVs was $1,120.09 for 20,234 miles.  That is $.055 per mile.  \n\nOur previous cars averaged over $288 per month in gas for a bit less distance.  And that’s a 5 year average not taking into account the huge bump in costs in 2022.\n\nSo, tell me how $288 is less than $93?\n\nOh and I have solar on my house and 90% of my electricity bill is covered by that.  But I’m not taking that into consideration.",

When I started reading this sub hoping to get insight into which are the best EV vehicles so I could get my own, I realised a lot of people give zero shits about the environment. Just this week there was a post about people talking about how many EVs they’ve had and how they had acquired 6 different ones in the last 8 years and currently own 3. I was a little shocked. I thought well, what’s the point then if you still consume a bazillion cars.",

"comment": "If your water pump consumes 3*12=36W  continuously then thats 864 Wh a day. You would need 8.6 effective hours of sunlight to harvest that much energy with a 100 W panel, where as it is more typical to get a yearly average of just 1 or two hours. When I say \"effective hour\" I mean accumulated solar irradiance over the course of the day (in kWh/m2) divided by the STC irradiance at which the panel is tested (1 kW/m2).  Since it is a division by one, it might be more common to just call this the average daily radiation (in kWh/m2/day).\n\nInput your latitutude and longitude [here](https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/sse/grid.cgi?email=skip@larc.nasa.gov) and then tell it to give you \"Radiation Incident On An Equator-Pointed Tilted Surface\" under \"Parameters for Tilted Solar Panels\". That will give you values for average daily radiation\n\nTLDR you probably need at least 3 or 4 panels for this load to ensure that it runs continuously all year long.",

"comment": "Unfortunately it's not a good idea unless you are great at soldering, if your time is worth no money, and you get an excellent deal on cells, tabbing wire, flux, solder, encapsulant, and glass.\n\nHere are some prices you'll be looking at:\n\n* http://www.ebay.com/bhp/solar-cells\n\n* http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&amp;_nkw=solar+encapsulant&amp;_frs=1\n\nYou would need to find cells under 10 cents/watt for this to make any sense for you. Wholesale solar panels are going for between 50-100 cents/watt, and they are high quality packages -- factory tested, sandwiched with encapsulant between two layers of tempered glass -- you will not be able to achieve that unless you are a secret electronics genius with a friend who works at a glass company.\n\nBuy a little kit like this to test yourself, see how far you get:\n\n* http://www.ebay.com/itm/40-WHOLE-3x6-Solar-Cell-Solar-Panel-KIT-Rough-Edge-USA-/180660441247\n\nWhen you see the price of encapsulant and glass, and reflect on how long it takes to solder the cells and how many mistakes you make, you'll call it quits.\n\nYou'll see immediately that most cells are 30-50 cents/watt, whereas a lot of wholesale panels are 50-60 cents/watt now -- the bare cell market made some sense 3-4 years ago, but it has lagged way behind the wholesale panel market and is now strictly \"craft/science experiment\" territory.\n\nYour best bet is to find a local installer and work through them for a grid-tie system. \n\n* https://www.energysage.com/\n\nIf you want to build your own system, start with wholesale panels:\n\n* http://sunelec.com/solar-panels\n\n* http://sunelec.com/solar-panels/sharp-121w.html\n\nIt's not really reasonable to remove more than one or two panels from your roof due to weather. 5kW of those Sharp 121W panels means 48 panels -- 850 sqft just for panels with no spacing or roof margin. That large of a system needs to stay in place permanently. Your mounting system needs to be able to handle the high winds. If you're out in the country, you can mount your panels on pylons close to the ground. You could potentially cover the whole system in a bubble wrap tarp if hail is an issue. If hail hits and cracks a tempered glass panel, the panel will still operate, potentially with no decrease in lifespan. Some panels actually operate better with millions of cracks because of how light bounces around in the glass. They are just unsightly. A lot of solar installers or wholesalers have cracked panels for sale at a discount.",

On the whole 75 acres that is the only area we were allowed. Additionally, our company - because of the high levels of incentives in Massachusetts - tend to sell premium modules (SunPower) for smaller installations (44kW is smaller for us). The higher premium on the modules helps our margins. We're not really tuned for residential/small business sales. More engineers/installers than salespeople by a fair number.",

"comment": "&gt;Even if you thought it was fake, would it hurt to change to renewable energy?\n\nSince most people here are focused on your titular question, let me address this one:\n\n1. Renewables still cost more than traditional fossil fuel resources. That reason is bigger than all the rest combined.\n\n2. Some renewables, and the ones most people think of when they hear the term, are intermittent. This is a bigger deal than most people realize.\n\n3. There are some nasty byproducts created when producing the machines needed to capture renewable energy.\n\n4. Not all areas are suited to all renewables. Look at maps for insolation, wind, geothermal, etc.\n\n5. Political stupidity. For example, the UK is deploying solar panels, against the advice of their own scientists. \n\n6. Renewables mostly generate electricity (though geothermal could be used for minimal process heat). They don't do much to replace oil. You would also need EVs to become much cheaper before oil usage can be reduced by much, or see PRT systems like [SkyTran](/r/SkyTran) become widely used.\n\nIncidentally, some of those problems could be solved by nuclear power.",

"comment": "Under some scenarios, there might be a higher spot price for energy curtailment or on demand generation than the current market rate of that energy or avoided energy demand. Net Metering, for the most part, is already avoided energy demand under daylight hours. Demand-side curtailment response is generally applied equally to all effected parties (i.e. residential) as an incentive payment for reduction of load. For now, these are voluntary programs that pay more for the avoided energy than it would cost the consumer as demand, with the premise that the grid operator is maintaining equipment that is already capitalized rather than endanger said equipment. The avoided cost of additional infrastructure would be more expensive than cost of the demand response programs in aggregate.",

So even if you're in the market for new solar panels, it may be prudent to wait for the new models to be announced, which is supposed to be soon (beginning of 2017).\n\nWaiting on technology is not necessarily always waiting. If you're looking to get a new phone, and you know that apple/samsung are announcing a new phone next month, are you going to just buy one now because you don't want to wait for new technology?",

If each of these panels had solar panels the surface area of the array could reach ~5x the small single surface on the Prius. Granted you'd lose the rear window but that can be counteracted somewhat using a camera, and will become less relevant as self driving improves.\n\nI also think that what makes a solar panel desirable is being able to return to the car with charge with more than you left it with, for instance when parking at an airport. A realistic design goal in my mind would be to target 100% charge in a week (60kWh with 8 hours usable light a day works out at about 1kW required).",

"comment": "We’ve only got a small garden so far, and it is astonishing how much fresh veg we get. I’m doing it by hand so it expands more slowly than it would if I’d invest in machinery. I’m more interested in going slowly and learning sustainable no-till methods than expanding quickly and poorly – so am taking it slow.\n\nThe only grains that I'm growing are corn, which is fairly easy to harvest and amaranth, which has excellent green leaves - good in salads and cooked – I haven’t figured how to work amaranth grain into anything yet. I probably should have said “as self-sufficient as practical,” rather than “as self-sufficient as possible.” I’ll probably never attempt to grow my own bulk grains, or mill my own flour.\n\nGood advice on the fruit trees, thanks. We’ve got a few peach trees and grape vines, presumably left over from when the house that previously stood here burned in the 1990s. We’ve also got papaw trees growing here and there in the woods, but have been talking about adding some dwarf apple, and nut trees.\n\nThe rabbits weren’t a serious attempt at animal husbandry – more like a test effort. and had an idea that I’d have a problem with killing anything for meat. When I was a kid, hunting was a big deal in my community – kind of a rite of passage, I suppose. I went once – then ever afterward only used a camera to shoot things. Anyway, best to find out if I was going to be able to do it before we’ve got a herd of goats or a cows.  I think we’ll just forgo farm animals. As far as crisis food goes, I’d be more likely to rely on dry and canned goods. We’ve generally got about 2 – 3 months of food on hand. \n\nI’ve been a geek for renewable energy for as long as I can remember. This is the first place we’ve owned where I can play around with it.  The house on the property is all electric, a terrible choice for living way out here toward the end of the grid where our electrical service is spotty at best. I’ve got a small 24V solar power system that powers my shed. I use it to charge power tools and mobile devices and use it as backup power for lights and communications during an outage. I plan to expand it next spring and take my communication and lighting circuits off of mains power full-time.",

"comment": "Hmm. Good point. You might have trouble sourcing microinverters that work without a grid frequency to trigger them to switch on.\n\nOP: normal on-grid solar systems are designed to generate power in sync with the 50 or 60Hz frequency of the mains grid. If the grid voltage disappears during a power cut they automatically switch off. This is known as 'anti-islanding' because it stops you becoming an island of power in a sea of blackout. The reason for this is to protect anyone who might be working nearby on supposedly dead grid wiring but gets electrocuted because your system is putting power back onto the grid.\n\nUnfortunately this means that (almost?) all of the cheap domestic solar kit will not work unless it sees a suitable signal coming form the grid. people have played about with simulating the grid input using battery powered signal generators or inverters to kick the solar inverters into life, but it's not trivial to do and sounds like way more complexity than you are looking for.\n\nThere are more systems coming out now which have battery backup built in to allow for storage of any over-generation you might do during the day or for backup during power cuts, but these are scaled for whole house use and pretty expensive. Not a valid option for your chicken shed.\n\nI would say in your case the best bet is to look at a solar PV system consisting of a panel (or several), a large 'leisure battery' and a solar charge controller - this is what controls the battery charging to avoid any overcharging or roasted chickens.\n\nFrom that battery you then get a nice stable 12V supply from which you can run fans and lighting nice and simply. You will need to calculate how much power is actually required to run what you want for as long as you need it to run and get a suitable large battery (bearing in mind they don't like being constantly charged and discharged by a large proportion of their capacity).\n\nIf you then also want heaters to run in colder weather, the system will probably need to be a good bit larger. At the same time as the colder weather you often get less sun, reducing the solar power even more and needing an even bigger system to give you enough power. Solar heating may not turn out to be be very practical.\n\nHowever: once you have a solar battery based system, it's quite possible to get a charge controller that will also accept power from a wind turbine, and wind *does* tend to be wisely available when the weather gets colder.\n\nSo the final system shape would be: \n\nSolar panel(s) and a small wind turbine...\n\n...feeding variable power to...\n\n...a wind/solar charge controller...\n\n...charging a battery (or several)...\n\n...powering fans/heaters/lights as needed,,,\n\n...or even a small battery powered inverter to produce mains power if you need it. I don't think you would.\n\n\nTL;DR: just get a small 12V solar panel and a big 12V computer fan, mount the fan near the top of the chicken shed venting to outside and wire the two directly together. It'll take out an amazing amount of heat and cost very little. That's what we did in our large conservatory and it dropped the peak sunny-day temperature by about 40^o F.",

It will cause a problem even in a controlled environment because simply put, there is nothing actually controlling it.\n\nThe GT inverter has provisions for anti-islanding, as per regulations.  You're right, in that this is similar to the kind of situation it's trying to prevent.  Particularly, if someone else had a backup generator improperly wired and energizing the line, in which case you don't want the GT inverter to join in - I think it detects this based on the voltage/frequency regulation of the line.  However, I would think that a good quality sine wave inverter, wired directly to the GT inverter (perhaps via the same bus bar) should be able to fool it.  This is what the bimodal inverter effectively has to do anyways (although as you point out in that case it is actually designed to absorb extra power).\n\n&gt;because for seconds ore more the Grid tie and off grid are both putting out 300W.\n\nI don't follow you here.  The off-grid is acting as a voltage source, and its controls are concerned with maintaining a constant *voltage and frequency*.  The GT, meanwhile, is trying to maintain a constant power (as determined by the capability of its source, presumably a PV panel).  With a load there, shouldn't injecting more power should just reduce the load on the off-grid inverter?",

You might damage the phone due to over voltage. \n\nYou are much better off charging a battery and using that battery to power your charger. \n\nYou probably need a minimum of 100W module to do it right.",

Say a value that it is equivalent to the generation and transmission cost, but excludes the distribution cost and any licensing and compliance costs. If they want to appease the scientifically impaired demographic of voters/lobby groups that they are clearly trying to appease, then they should put a cap on system sizes that receive export tariffs. 30kW (10kW/phase) would be a good point, as that will only affect commercial installations who are using considerable amounts of power during the day, and it is not hard to size systems to limit the export of energy, and keep a good ROI.",

"comment": "&gt;If climate change is so serious why aren't we moving to renewables like like and wind ? Is it really difficult to do that ?\n\nWe are, to some extent. The only problem with renewables is that they are unreliable. Windmills have a range of windspeeds at which they are operable. If the wind is too slow they don't work, if the wind is too fast they don't work either. For solar panels, there are also conditions during which they don't deliver.\n\nAll that capacity has to be guaranteed, so renewables are always substituted by fossils in the circumstances where they don't work. At best, I think the prognosis is like 40-50% renewables and the rest gas plants (barring specific locations like Iceland). The current situation is roughly 10-90 or something worldwide. We can move to that 40-50% but in the meantime energy consumption in total is rising, and the move towards renewables simply can't even keep up with consumption growth.\n\nWe could go to 10% fossils only, but that requires nuclear, and it's not a popular option among politicians.",

"comment": "Yeah, my costs go up with a battery.\n\nWhat hear are they quoting you?\n\nI'm leaning heavily towards Tesla.  Tesla is technically cheaper, but I'm leaning on them a bit more to try and get a \"Costco Cash card equivalent\" discount.  They got about $6 cheaper than SunRun, and I was like \"Sure, that's 1,500 over 20 years, but SunRun is gonna give me $1,500 now.\". Tesla guy saw the issue, so he's seeing what they can do.  Heavily leaning towards Tesla though.\n\nSunRun quoted an LG Chem Resu10H battery, which in looking online appears to take about 5-6 seconds to kick in, while the Powerwall kicks in right away",

"comment": "Sorry but I have to disagree, \n\n1.  The Powerwall 2 has 13.5kwh of capacity with 100% DOD v the LG Chem 10kwh at 90% DOD (effectively 9kwh) giving the Tesla a capacity advantage that is almost 40% greater than the LG.\n\n2. The Tesla is compatible with any standard inverter in the market no matter what brand or age (including microinverters), whilst the LG chem needs the customer to either have, or buy a hybrid inverter and BMU adding to the cost.  \n\n3. The Powerwall 2 comes with a gateway that has an inbuilt backup module and its own management software which allows 20ms response time to grid power loss. \n\n4. The Pw2 is also capable of working on the 3g cellular network and doesn't require a wifi connection \n\n5. The PW2 is the only liquid cooled battery on the market. \n\n6. The Tesla's longevity and degradation is one of the best on the market with testing showing that the battery's degradation seems to be plateauing at 90%.  This is certainly the case with the vehicle batteries which are the same modules used in the Pw2.\n\n7. Despite all this, the Tesla is the cheapest battery on the market on a price per watt basis even before you factor in the superior depth of discharge and the inverter compatibility advantage. \n\n8. The Tesla phone app and monitoring software is the best I have seen to date. \n\nEvery other manufacturer is playing catch up.",

The new 7.6kw package looks like it has 2 fewer panels but the price per watt is still basically the same.\n\nWhen I ordered, there was no option to get something in between, like 6kw or whatever but that might have changed. I really only needed 6kw but the price they were offering for the 8kw was still cheaper than what sunpower was giving me for a 5.5kw system so it was still a good deal. The warranty with Tesla isn't as good but it isn't horrible and there is excess capacity to fall back on just in case. \n\nThey also seem to be using the Panasonic panels exclusively now coming out of Buffalo instead of the HanWha panels from China or South Korea.",

In about 6 years I'll have paid back the solar system and be driving for almost free (just the cost of maintenance) and not have a power bill. \nI can easily set my charge timers (or EVSE timers) to only charge when the sun is up so I'm actually using what I'm generating. Eventually I'd like to have ~40kWh of battery storage on the house too. Then I can run off grid.",

"comment": "Not happening any time remotely soon. The only cars they currently work on are ones designed for the solar car challenge. And those are essentially carbon fiber or aluminum shells with bicycle tires, no safety features and hundreds of thousands of dollars satellite-grade solar cells on them. \n\nLook at home solar panels for example, which are reasonably priced. I have 13 of them on my house--way more than you could ever fit on a car--you couldn't even fit one of those on the roof of my car. And even though those are above-average efficiency sunpower brand, it's still just a 4.25kWh system, much less than my Chevy Bolt can handle from a L2 charger. And that's the power if all 13 panels are getting direct sunlight. So maybe if all things are perfect and I had 13 panels on my roof (let's ignore the weight and aerodynamics for now), the most I could add to my Bolt battery while driving would be at 13 miles each hour. If I can't drive faster than 13mph, I'd be much better off with a bicycle. \n\nThe few cars that do actually have solar cells on them right now generally only supply power to the 12v battery and in the example of the Prius, run fans to vent hot air when parked. While car companies are teasing cars with bigger panels that charge the drive batteries, it's still just a tiny amount. \n\nYou'd be much better off getting a large solar array for your house and charging there on sunny days.",

"comment": "Why wouldn’t their behavior change? It’s driven entirely by greed. Why not make that align with what we want by making fossil fuels expensive? \n\nDid you know that increased use of renewables goes with increased use of natural gas? Because right now, renewables cannot ramp up quickly enough as demand increases, and blackouts would occur. I only say this because making lots of panels is a bandaid. A price on carbon changes the framework of the game, in our favor. \n\nBy all means, let’s make shitloads of panels. Putting a price on carbon would make that a better investment for the taxpayers funding it, and an easier legislative sell. \n\nCrucially important to me about carbon fee and dividend, it would also put economic pressure on China and those who want to trade with us to adopt a similar price on carbon, and that will lower emissions there as well. We can’t tell China to only make solar panels and stop using all the coal plants they have been making. But we can make it expensive for them to use that coal to make the goods they want to sell us. Just like how Europe is doing to us as per the article here.",

Certainly does not include a utility heavy-up (100A-&gt;200A), which may be what people are actually being charged extra for.\n\nTurning your existing panel into the critical loads panel is a good idea, but it could be difficult to move the heavy-gauge wires if they are not long enough.\n\nThe [installation videos for the Backup Gateway](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/more/installers/installing-powerwall) are very interesting.   Typically, the solar and PW go straight to the Gateway, and loads get fed from there.  They can be configured with several breakers inside them, and both backup and non-backup loads or panels can be fed by them.",

What's the cost of doubling the install? Will that increase the net metering / SREC income?  For some of this modeling the NREL SAM tool is pretty cool in modeling some numbers.

"comment": "u/djcambomb This right here looks like exactly what you want.  This is probably how you achieve \"virtual net metering\".  There are a few more details on https://www.mass.gov/guides/net-metering-guide.  Definitely contact the utility for more details about how it works.\n\nIt looks like you can have each unit on their own utility meter and billing account, and then tell the utility to allocate solar credits between whichever accounts you choose.  It looks like the solar meter itself could be on the common area meter, the unit 3 meter, or a separate meter maintained by the HOA.  It would be up to the HOA to price and collect the \"buy in\" amount that would prompt a change in how the utility allocates credits.",

"comment": "This is a great reply since you're in roughly the same geographic location and climate, so I can talk Jersey with you.\n\nIn summer, when we go down the shore for the weekend, I'll have to occasionally do one or two trips depending on my work schedule if I can't get the day off.  There aren't many DCFC options down there, so I'd likely be relying on the Tinton Falls Outlet EA chargers at exit 100 either to or from work enroute back to the shore.  There are some other options that are a little less convenient and will be dependent upon just how low my charge is.\n\n80 miles is a stretch for sure - I have 2 main routes to work.  A city/freeway route which is about 55 mph on the highway and 35-40 on the city route, which is 10 miles each way.  Or, I can take the turnpike which is around 15-20 miles each way but probably closer to 65-70 to keep in the flow of traffic.\n\nAgain with the means of charging 12 hours a day at a minimum, I'm looking at around 12 kW gained after efficiency losses on 120V.  That should be enough for what I'm doing, but probably might need the occasional top off if we had a soccer game in another part of the state.  Not worried about a couple minutes every week or two at an EA since I'm shopping at those stores anyway.\n\nGood suggestion about using seat heaters rather than the whole climate.  That might be something to consider if I'm by myself. I don't think I'd force my passengers to freeze if the whole family was in the car!\n\nFrom what I've seen on Tesla posts/boards, it looks like the EPA range is terrible for the first couple minutes until the climate stabilizes to your settings, then will level off.  So, I believe you when you say it would be like 500 W/mi for the first couple minutes and then stabilize around, say, 350-400 W/mi thereafter with the climate running.  Currently, half of my drive now is \"cold\" because I'm half way to work before the climate actually starts pushing out heat.\n\nSolar panels are something to consider once we have to redo our roof in the next 5ish years, but I believe NJ no longer offers the good incentives, making it a more expensive endeavour.  Why spend 30k on solar panels when it'll now take 20 years to recover the cost?  I won't be in this house in 20 years (I hope!) and hopefully will be back down the shore.",

"comment": "Ok, so I think there's some mis-information here. \n\n1. Yes, SolarEdge is partnered with a DC battery for their storedge system. They are likely saying that their STOREDGE inverter is not compatible with Tesla (because it isn't, it relies on DC). The regular solaredge inverter is absolutely compatible with the Powerwall2. Tesla itself has utilized SolarEdge inverters on the East coast for years to comply with NEC 2017 RSD requirements.  \n2. Tesla gateway doesn't need to use the solaredge control mechanism, the gateway/powerwall use frequency shifting to control when the solar is producing. Basically, in a grid outage scenario the battery can shift the frequency above the allowed range for solar kicking the solar off but keeping the power on to your home. \n3. If the grid goes offline, a solaredge inverter will still function with a PW2 as long as the battery has enough capacity to accept the power being produced by the solar. You are correct that this is the \"algorithm\" portion of the design. However, as long as the PW is kept above 90% does it really matter? The solar generation should still be captured in the tesla app so you stay fully in the loop with  how everything is functioning. Is this not happening?\n4. Clipping is standard industry practice. I know customers don't want to hear it, but it is almost always intentional and is considered beneficial in the industry. There are LOTS of good articles written on this subject so I won't go into it here. \n\nI'm a C46 Solar Contractor in CA and started my career as a Tesla design engineer.",

"comment": "OP:  I suspect from your question(s) that you're really new to the topic, so here is a quick primer.  \n\nIf your building is already connected to the grid, the simplest way to add solar is to use a grid-tie inverter (or microinverters).  This way, the solar power is simply supplementing / replacing the power you would have been taking from the grid.  If your array is big enough, such a system is gonna supply most or all you need, and surplus is \"sold\" to the utility for others to use.  This is by far the most common type system in the US and most other places.  \n\nIf your building is already connected to the grid, you may also - for more money - use a bimodal inverter that can either act as a grid-tie inverter when there is grid-sourced power available or work as a stand-alone inverter (islanding, so to speak) when grid power goes down.  This kind of system should also have a battery bank, together with charge controller(s), etc., so that your loads can be supported when operating independent of the grid.  \n\nIf your building is already connected to the grid, I guess you can also install a completely stand-alone system that supports its own loads and essentially would be functionally independent of the grid altogether.  I have designed, inspected and/or installed a couple hundred systems over the last 20 years (large metro area, central US), and have seen exactly one such system - installed on a farm - and that more than 15 years ago.  Not to suggest you can't go about it this way, but suggest you'd want to have a good reason to do this.  \n\nIf your building is not connected now to the grid - perhaps you're located too far from a grid/utility line - then yeah, installing a stand-alone system might make lots of sense.  However, if there is a decent possibility that grid power is coming your way soon or maybe you want to operate conventional retail appliances/loads (lights, washers, HVAC, etc.), then you ought to make sure your PV system is delivering good quality 120/240V 60hz AC juice.  \n\nIf you're operating in some way off-grid cabin for example, though, you can put in a system that is not 120/240 AC juice.  You're free to come up with some 12V or 24V or 48V DC system - but then most your loads have to conform to function on such power.  And this is very feasible, since people living on lots of boats and and some RVs do this - there are lights and all manner of appliances available.  But to go this route, it would be very helpful to know what you gotta know to maintain battery banks, fusing, other safety features, DC wiring, etc..  I have seen such systems, but in all cases, the system owners knew lots about their systems and were handy enough to deal with their systems themselves.",

"comment": "That 1.49% loan with goodleap or mosaic is charging an extra 25-30% in hidden finance charges. You “inked” the deal doesn’t matter. You can cancel a solar project until the panels are installed. Once installed you’re locked in. You’re getting a terrible deal. $2.8 ppw after tax credits is getting smoked. Specially in Texas. I’ve sold 100 loans in Texas and I usually price it a $2.4-$2.8 price per watt. Sunrun must be selling you the Mercedes’ Benz of panels haha. They use longi panels and a solar edge string inverter on 95% of their projects. Cheap system to pay $10,000-$20,000 more than everyone else in your area. Almost all credible installers have a 25 year power production guarantee and 25 year warranty’s on the systems individual parts. With sunrun you have to buy protection plus for $3,000 for them to further warranty your system. Long story short you’re getting ripped off.",

"comment": "If you're in Wisconsin where Wolf River has a facility (and where I live) then I will be blunt and tell you that from a strictly financial point of view it almost certainly isn't worth it. The weather here in Wisconsin is too cloudy, for one thing. From about late october thru early March I got so little solar power the system could hardly keep the batteries topped up much less supply power to the house. So far spring through mid-July now it's been raining almost every other day here so solar production has been a fraction of what it was last year.\n\nSomeone mentioned 1:1 net metering. Good luck with that. We Energies, my utility, will give you a credit of about $0.04/kwh on your electric bill for home generated power. I finally put in an off-grid system instead of grid-tied because it wasn't worth the extra cost for the additional equipment and wiring changes that would have been necessary.",

If I were to move out to the country and get a reliable setup of solar panels I would be 100% off the grid as far as energy is concerned, while gas cars will always be beholden to the energy companies, refineries, domestic & global politics.\n\nAs i said I dont give a fuck about emissions or the climate scam, I dislike the existence of EV subsidies, I am totally opposed to carbon budgets and 15m cities & global centralization & commie bullshit ... but I think when it comes to EV there is another perspective worth looking into.",

And zoom in even further and there are parts of SoCal where there’s even greater disparities between the $/kW charge where the further south you go, the more you’re charged (no pun intended).\n\nThis isn’t to be snarky, smarmy , rude or mean, it’s just that the US is **huge** and the inter/intrastate variances are such that it’s hard to get a true understanding of the cost of electricity from just what country you’re in. And some people don’t care to intentionally dox themselves either.\n\nIf I didn’t invest in solar panels on my SFH when I did, the economics of driving electric just wouldn’t be there for me, unfortunately.

"comment": "**Looks like you did your homework here, and you have weighed the most important factors. I guess solarsme will be better choice based on following points**  \nHigher Output: While with 54 Canadian Solar panels combined with Enphase IQ8A microinverters, the system that Solar SME offers will give you 24.57 kW, slightly above Sky NRG at 22.05 kW. That will mean more power and potentially faster payback, especially in south-facing roof orientations.  \nUnder the third party insurance coverage will certainly provide peace of mind. This coverage can really help when issues arise down the line and adds considerable cost in service calls. Please make sure this insurance is an additional backup and not substituting solarsme warranty. Especially recently solar industry has been through much crisis causing alot of companies closed down their doors. I must insist to only select a company thats offering third party backup insurance from credible company.  \n**Guaranteed Timeline: With a December 31st deadline install guarantee this is really unheard of. If they are going to such an extent then it certainly means they have in house install team with capacity to expedite install before year end.**   \nfor the arbitration clause, I think it’s fairly common in solar contracts. While mixed reviews can be concerning, but I see its fairly common in home improvement industry also I will be very concerned if I see only good reviews that might make me nervous about legitimacy of those reviews.  \n**Good luck with the choice!**",

It's not rocket science.  You could possibly forgive someone for using an ostensibly vegetable-based product with \"hidden\" animal products in it (like that dye made from the beetles - cochineal?), but to bring something out with cheese is just ignorant.",

Just don't be stingy and if you've got some brown mustard that'd be awesome.\" This is a very easy request for just about any restaurant and you don't have to awkwardly interview the server about vegan options, explain your veganism, etc. \n\nI've also found that if you look at the menu as though you are going to order from it you can get an idea of what they have in the kitchen. When you confidently place an \"odd\" order, it might not even come up that you don't eat animals. \n\nEdit: Damn you autocorrect!",

You don't know that I'm sitting on my ass doing nothing, it's unkind and presumptuous of you. And if I am, that's my business. You don't know what's going on in my life, and I have personally swayed at least 2 people to vegetarianism since going veg*n myself less than 2 years ago, which I believe is a result of speaking about the issues calmly and rationally, and living by example so they can see it's not as hard as they think it is.\n\nSocial change as major as this cannot and will not happen in a short time span. You should be doing things like calling congress, working with activism groups who use LEGAL methods to change things for the animals, supporting methods of meat production that cause fewer animals to be harmed (because meat eating will never come to an end) such as petri-grown meat, and distributing fliers. I became vegetarian because I saw normal, level-headed, kind human beings doing it and realized it wasn't something that only crazy people do. They told me some things I didn't like to hear, I did some research and stopped eating meat. I continued doing research and now am a vegan.\n\nWhen you see Westboro Baptist Church being psycho, does that make you want to join them?",

You are putting a sensory preference over their right to exist. \n\nYou will justify this to your a dozen different ways,  I imagine.  But this is a vegan subreddit and most of us will not agree that liking animals and the stuff that comes out of them entitles us to it. Most people who believe in something that is contrary to conventional wisdom,  and live their lives that way without shame,  are called self-righteous.

I use Vega One, natural flavor (don't like the taste of the flavored ones), personally I like the taste and it's much lower-key than the other powders, and has not only 50% of iron but 50% of calcium, B12, has around 15 grams of protein and is good all around.\n\nhttp://myvega.com/product/vega-one-nutritional-shake/\n\nYes, yes, /r/hailcorporate.\n\nClif bars have 15% of iron I believe, if your friend likes those, and taste really good as well. All of them except 1 type are vegan. Some people don't like it, but I find it to be a good way to get some extra calcium, protein and iron :)",

So first step would be to cut your meat and dairy down 99% to get inline with your stated ecological stance!\n\nBut what about that 1% from happy \"sustainable farms\" let's look at an example of their environmental footprint:\n\n&gt; Increased productivity (slaughter weight and growth rate) in the CON system reduced the cattle population size required to produce 1.0 × 109 kg of beef compared to the NAT or GFD system. The CON system required 56.3% of the animals, 24.8% of the water, 55.3% of the land and 71.4% of the fossil fuel energy required to produce 1.0 × 109 kg of beef compared to the GFD system. The carbon footprint per 1.0 × 109 kg of beef was lowest in the CON system (15,989 × 103 t), intermediate in the NAT system (18,772 × 103 t) and highest in the GFD system (26,785 × 103 t).\n\n[Source](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/2/127)\n\nBottom line: The most sustainable farming is factory farming, which makes sense. Do you honestly think we developed an industrialized system of agriculture because it isn't the most efficient thereby utilizing the least amount of resources? \n\nAnd that happy cow I'm afraid doesn't exist my friend. I grew up around my grandparents dairy. They genuinely cared for their animals but the animals still suffered while alive as they were kept constantly pregnantly, kept in rough conditions, and had their calves removed and the male ones slaughtered. And  finally they all were slaughtered at 25% of their life to make hamburgers when they weren't producing sufficient milk to justify their feed.\n\nI have no opposition to animals living their natural lives how they would just like you say. I have extreme opposition to people consuming animal for no reason whatsoever beyond it tastes good and they've always done it meanwhile that animal production creates billions of animals to live a life of pure torture all while destroying our planet.\n\nThis isn't a fairy tale this is real life. \n\nI'm afraid you've bought into the fantasy and I can only encourage you to look into further.",

I am also allergic to a lot of nuts (hazel, wal, almond) so its challenging for me as well. I found once I purchased the basics I was able to do it really easily and when im tired and lazy I throw some veggie broth on the stove, throw in whatever veggies I have around the house (lots of frozen ones), some beans and rice noodles, add sriracha for seasoning and you've got a nice little soup. If you want simple meals I'd be happy to give you tips, its all about making sauces. My alfredo sauce will have anyone convinced its not vegan :)",

We should tax the shit out of slaughterhouses because they're bad. Which will increase price of meat.

Your anecdotal example is very interesting but I could easily counter with people I know that have been vegetarians since birth because they were raised like that. It's one thing to *forbid* your kid from eating meat and *explaining* why he shouldn't.\n\nIn the end, the basic goal of reproduction is to create a \"little you\" and artificially extend your life by passing on your beliefs. The fact that to this day we still have things like hundreds of different religions is proof that most people will stick to the way they were raised and I like to believe that it's easier to convince that veganism is a good thing than to convince that gods exist because we at least have proof.\n\nI'm sorry that not everyone subscribes to /r/childfree. Having children doesn't have to suck and having a child can actually have a positive net result if they also educate other about veganism after you hit the dust.",

A joke or a scientific claim? Or both? Still not sure. You do seem to be 100% certain of yourself at least so may I ask for some sources for all these claims of yours? And your statistical claim that vegans are somehow malnourished or underweight. Is that also a joke? Who can tell? You can't just assume that since they are pretty outlandish and uninformed comments everyone will understand them to be jokes. You wanna know why? Because they have ALL been presented in full earnest a thousand times before in this exact forum by other meat eaters.",

"comment": "I contest that it's \"mostly\" anti-vegan.\n\nIt's just that folks tend to downvote topics they feel are \"butting in\" to places where they aren't relevant.\n\nThe question of \"is it relevant\", of course, *is* a controversial thing. Picture of a cute cow? Most probably don't want to have fingers wagged at them about how eating cows (or dairy products) are evil. Whether it's straight denial or simply a case of \"just let me enjoy the picture\" or some other reason, the commentary can be viewed as \"butting in.\"\n\nWhen the inevitable \"what's your unpopular opinion\" / \"what's something hurting the world that we can change\" topic gets reposted, the reposted answers are often settled into the same buckets. \"Overproduction of plastic\" is near the top. \"Veganism\" \"abortion\" etc. always mill around the controversial section or are otherwise not upvoted all that much. Reddit repost ruts aren't very indicative. (And sometimes the wording of the post can be very poorly done to the point where the user comes off as /r/iamverysmart, diluting the actual vegan message and is the real cause for downvotes.)\n\nThe effect of collecting and linking to lots of instances of anti-vegan sentiment can also produce the resulting thought process of \"wow tons of people are anti-vegan!\" When the news only reports plane crashes, that doesn't mean they happen all the time. It's just that regular plane travel isn't newsworthy.\n\nSimilarly, most of the topics here concerning non-vegan reactions to vegan posts are \"wow look at this downvoting, nobody really cares about the message / why is everyone so hateful?\". Seldom do you see \"well this post got a normal number of votes\" because it's not really worth pointing it out. And when you get a collection of said \"lookit the anti-vegan\" posts all together, it can definitely make it seem like it's an \"us vs the world\" sort of scenario.\n\ntl;dr there's definitely anti-vegan sentiment on Reddit in circles, but I think it's a bit reaching to claim that essentially \"everyone but those in /r/vegan for the most part are staunchly anti-vegan.\" Reddit *is* rather progressive, and is honestly probably more accepting of the vegan lifestyle than a lot of other online communities of similar size.",

It is not “infused” in any way.\n\nMeat is also almost always aged before sale, as freshly slaughtered meat is tough. Aging (“controlled rotting”) tenderizes it.\n\nYour arguments are very poor. Vegetables and fruit are also “literally rotting” once picked from the plant. Ripening is a form of decay. There is nothing inherently wrong with decay and we eat all kinds of decayed or semi-decayed food all the time.",

We are human, we enjoy sweet and salty foods, it's just part of who we are and while some can cut these out, most of us enjoy our food and dont want to give it up.\n\nBeing vegan has nothing to do with giving up taste and we need to remember this especially for new vegans who often find it hard coming from all their salty food.\n\nI celebrate junk food vegans and I truly think that most of them will be much more successful than those who try and hold themselves to some unattainable standard!",

The only discernable differences are that flesh itself gives them the ickies and they morally grandstand about something they have no high ground on.\n\nAbolitionism is the only correct stance. This isn't a matter of perfection being the enemy of \"a start.\" Vegetarians fundamentally tend to recognize that animal abuse is wrong. They correctly associate the meat industry with animal abuse. They then proceed to support industries that are still the meat industry. I absolutely fault them more than someone who was raised to eat meat that continues to eat meat. There's more moral accountability when you fundamentally recognize that what you're doing is wrong but continue to do so.",

I will either request a restaurant where I can eat well, or if that isn't an option then I won't go.

"comment": "&gt; I'm certainly no authority on the diet of Paleolithic era humans, but grains had some presence in their diet.\n\nSure, but 55% of of calories year round?  I doubt it.\n\n&gt; I don't see how they should be excluded because they didn't have \"enough\" of a presence when meat is a staple of the Paleo DietTM\n\nThere's a recommendation on the Paleo Diet TM.  Try it for 30 days and then have some pasta/pizza/etc. and see how you do.  If you're OK with it, have some now and thien.  This is more to convince you not to have it in the future because you more than likely won't like the reaction.\n\n&gt; yet paleolithic humans might not even have eaten meat daily. \n\nSure, they hunted and then maybe didn't eat for a day.  I eat one meal per day and have gone 6 days without food and felt fine the whole time.  There's nothing wrong with gorging on food and in fact, you have to when the caloric density is low.\n\nWe also know that modern tubers (the other major sources of calories) have much less fiber than they used to.  There are estimates that paleolithic man got upwards of 120 grams of fiber per day.  If your gut can handle that, by all means.  Mine can handle ~50 grams, which is still 2-3x what most people get.  I've done 100 grams.  It's rough.\n\n&gt; Many tools for hunting\n\nThe hand axe was the major tool and existed in more or less an unmodified form for 4+ mllion years.  Bows are new (e.g. 50,000 years).  Spears 1-2 million years old.  That's pretty much it.\n\n&gt; control of fire \n\nFire is 2+ million years old.  Humans actually have adaptation to smoke inhalation.  It's still bad for us though.\n\n&gt; Not that the premise isn't silly to begin with.\n\nThe \"paleo diet\" is an attempt at what our ancestors ate.  It's not perfect and as the science changes, so does it.  There are vegetarians and vegans that try paleo, so to say you can't do it without meat is wrong.  There are many do a paleo diet and not all of them are high in meat or fat.  However, a high fat diet is one valid paleo diet.",
