The $7,500 federal rebate is still there.\n\nAlso, maybe there is a silver lining to America not forgetting this time...like saving the planet :)",

"comment": "&gt; Once you have the motors in the wheels, it would seem the rest of the conversion get reduced in complexity\n\nThe problem with such a design is twofold.   First, that is a fairly substantial increase in unsprung weight, which lowers performance and makes the ride rougher.\n\nSecondly all that vibration is going *directly* into the motor.  You know the \"road noise\" that you get when you're coasting down the road?  All of that is vibration that is directly put into the wheel.  At the end of the day, it just isn't worth the hassle of having to engineer it strong enough to take that vibration (increasing weight, decreasing efficiency and worsening ride quality) or having to rebuild it constantly.\n\nIn Wheel Motors seem like the holy grail, but [several companies have been working on the idea for a while](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_hub_motor#Concept_cars) and while some of them currently sell electric motor vehicles (Ford, GM, Mitsubishi), I'm not aware of any which use hub motors.",

"comment": "&gt;The next time your friend mentions that he or she paid a “zero” electric bill thanks to a solar array, the friend may also want to thank you.\n\nI'll hit my neighbor up as soon as the utility thanks me for involuntarily paying for their coal-based fuel services. Then I'll go demand thankyous from Tesla drivers for paying for their roads. Then I'll go throw some trash in the street and thank my neighbor for cleaning it up maybe. \n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;Net-metering is capped under current law to contain costs. \n\nOne easy solution would be to lower SREC prices and expand net-metering rights. That's sound policy that everyone should be able to get behind. But I suspect the dissent would oppose Massachusett's renewable portfolio standard.\n\n&gt; It costs the utility the same amount to service a solar customer as it does a non-solar customer. \n\nFine. Charge a fixed \"connection fee\", and reduce the price per kwh of electricity.\n\n&gt; Solar customers are never “off the grid.”\n\nMany more solar customers would be off the grid if connections fees increase. And massive gird disconnections would raise the price of electricity for the non-participant. So that's not really well thought out is it?\n\n&gt; Solar users typically pay little or nothing to maintain their share of the electric grid.\n\nWhat is the solar user's share of the grid? The fact is that utilities have grossly over-estimated this cost, and have been slapped in court for this. Utilities need to cough up definitive numbers before such statements can be made. Or are we just spit-balling numbers to serve our agenda?\n\n&gt;In a state where electricity costs are almost double the national average...\n\nThat couldn't have anything to do with living on the most densely populated electrical peninsula in the United States could it? If only there were a way for Massachusetts to generate its own electricity, one which consumers would voluntary build out themselves....",

Longer range EVs (200 EPA miles+) don't typically need DC fast charging in urban/suburban areas unless you're dealing with a really insane commute, which makes much of the CCS/CHAdeMO network useless.\n\nTesla's network and the CCS/CHAdeMO networks are operating under two different mindsets right now: one is being built out for use when you need to drive really far (you're primarily charging via L2 at home/work) and the other has been built out to enable short range travel. The nearest Supercharger being 150 miles away is because that's within range of Tesla vehicles. Location and plug density (number of plugs at each location) is more important than total number of plugs once you cross a certain threshold.\n\n*edit* Hasn't GM also stated that the Bolt will be capped at 50kW max for DC charging?",

"comment": "Sometimes if I have a few spare minutes, and happen to be near my local(ish) supercharger I'll stop by and plug in.  I'm not in California so overcrowding isn't a issue where I am (yet).    Usually when this happens I'm not \"Running on fumes\".  My battery will be about 50-60 percent full, so even when I plug in I only will be pulling 60kW or less.  I usually will on purpose plug into a paired stall knowing I won't affect the other guy/gal and that way I leave a bunch of unpaired stalls available for people who really might need the fastest charge possible when they roll up.\n\nMost times the other people get out of their cars and make the effort to \"educate\" me about paired stalls, and I have to politely say, \"Yes, I know what you are saying,\" and \"No, my plugging in doesn't change your charge speed since you were first.\"  And then I literally will say go sit in your car and watch as I unplug, you won't see an increase.   They always assume it's just a dumb split when two cars are plugged in.\n\nFun fact, the Tesla HPWC when properly wired can run 4 chargers on a single 100amp line.  The four chargers talk to each other like superchargers and will dynamically assign  the load to cars as they fill up.   If 4 cars are plugged in each gets 20amps while they all are charging, but as soon as one is topped off and full, that excess power that's now freed up gets dynamically sent to the other cars.",

These people are doing what I thought, I would like to see a video or more detailed drawing.\n\n Our new in-wheel motor system, which we call ProteanDrive, is a complete drivetrain in the wheel. But maybe drivetrain isn’t the best word to describe it: There are no gears or transmission. Instead, the rotor of the electric motor connects directly to the hub, delivering torque from the motor to the wheel. This results in maximum efficiency and compactness.",

Tesla says they have 400k reservations for Model 3, but that is few years of pent up demand and when they opened reservations there was no competitors. \n\nThey haven't advertised the cars yet, most people don't even know Tesla is a thing if you ask an average person on the streets. I agree to disagree. The specs and price have to be there, it's enough to start mainstream adoption. While I can agree that if there are say 70 million potential car sales in the mainstream per year, such a car wouldn't satisfy even 50% of buyers, but the first 10 - 15 million should be more than content given the value, all things considered.",

I don't want lane assist, autopilot, automatic doorhandles, automatic park brake, satnav, glass roof, automatic seats, luxury materials etc etc. I just want an EV without the expensive trimmings!  \nAccording to Tesla and rumours the Model 3 standard battery with no options should cost around AU$51k (with 350km range) compared to 250km for the Ioniq for the same price so that might be good. So down under we still have to wait a while for something truly 'affordable'.  \n(Also we have to pay import taxes on cars, which pushes up their price, but no govt will get rid of that money maker)",

Anyway, if you're keen on getting something free from the government, in regards to Home Charging Infrastructure.. there's your golden ticket!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still suspect the Plug-In BC program will get additional funding.

Already in Canada, EVs make up [8.3% of new passenger car sales](https://www.fleetcarma.com/electric-vehicles-sales-update-q3-2018-canada/). This excludes SUVs and pickups whose owners are not in the market for used cars. By 2025 there will be at least [30 new EVs on the market](https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-cars-that-will-be-available-by-2025-2018-1). People will be very familiar with their reliability, performance and cost savings. The used car market will be filled with 2nd generation long-range EVs that are still covered by the OEM 8year/160,000km warranty. The charging infrastructure has grown exponentially. \n\nLet's consider gasoline cars. By 2025 there will be millions upon millions of ICEVs that are out of warranty and on the verge of expensive engine repairs. They are less fuel efficient, gas most likely costs more and [stations continue to disappear](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/national-gas-station-count-growing-thanks-to-stronger-profit-margins/article35006524/).  Noisy polluting cars won't be welcomed in cities already suffering poor air quality. Resale values will plummet as buyers demand a discount for these future expenses.",

"comment": "Even if putting the panels on your back (north?) roof would offset your current usage, you would be overpaying the solar company for that production.\n\nInstalling a little more solar than you need right now is smart because once you've changed out all the bulbs and have decent windows, your needs will only increase as you get more equipment and convert fossil fuels to electric.  Small additions cost way more on a per watt basis.\n\nIt sounds like you are not really in danger of generating way too much power.  That 13MWh from the back roof will barely get you through five months of running the A/C.  So get as much as you can afford and tolerate aesthetically, and see how it pans out.\n\nOr you could spend this year doing your own energy audit, install a smart measuring device and look into ways to reduce your consumption.  You might benefit from zoned HVAC control for example.  (Though you're not so bad, my retrofitted 1100 sq ft house uses ~1000kWh including water heater and electric car.)",

"comment": "Hi there, I'm shopping for a solar system in Olympia, WA. I'm leaning towards the green one on the pic (15.17kW SilFab panels + Enphase micro-inverters + 2x10 kWh Enphase batteries for $82,346 total pre-credit).\n\nMy main goal is to be resilient to power outages in the summer/winter, and keep food and medicine cold. Enphase as a company gives me good vibes compared to SolarEdge, Tesla, etc, though I know I'm paying a small premium. I like that the system doesn't have as many single points of failure, that all the components would come from one company, and that the battery tech is less volatile.\n\n15.17kW is in theory enough to get me to 99% of my energy needs today. I plan to add an EV charger in a few years, but barely drive. I plan to get a heat pump water heater next year to reduce electricity use. I also plan to get a pellet stove for emergency heat in the winter so my batteries won't have to be used to heat the home in case of an outage.\n\nThese are the top 3 companies in the area by reputation. The first two companies seem relatively similar. The second one actually seemed slightly more knowledgeable, but the first one had a better guarantee and was willing to do an Enphase battery. The third company was much lower tech in their estimation process and oddly proposed fewer solar panels and more batteries than the other two. I'm waiting for more details from them. Also I don't really have an opinion about Sol-Ark as a company.\n\nAnything I should consider or dig deeper into before deciding?\n\nUpdate: The Panasonic panels are now no longer available. So my choices are:\n\nChoice 1 (preference)  \nArtisan Electric  \n15.17kW SilFab panels + Enphase microinverters - $49k  \n20kW Enphase batteries - $33k  \nTotal: $82k\n\nChoice 2  \nA&amp;R Solar  \n14.8kW LG panels + Enphase microinverters - $54k  \n27kW Tesla batteries - $33k  \nTotal: $87k\n\nChoice 3  \nSouth Sound Solar  \n11kW SilFab panels + Sol-Ark 12k inverter  \n37kW Fortress eVault batteries  \nTotal: $73k",

Normally I wouldn't be concerned as most of my purchases come with mileage that high, but a) on an ev, does that mean the battery is shot to heck? and b) I've heard friends who deal with used cars say BMWs are great until you hit 100k and then everything @%\\^#s the bed all at once.

"comment": "That's true in general, but in practice dealers also act as a giant buffer where the OEM can offload the cars they produce. Yes by acting as the middle man the dealers take a small cut, but it also lets the overall supply and pricing of a new car on the market to be smoothed out. Look at what happens when Tesla starts selling a million cars instead of tens of thousands of cars, and have no dealership middle men. You can get wild shifts in pricing, both up and down, because Tesla has no other way to manage its inventory of build cars on hand. It wasn't as big an issue initially when they built fewer cars and demand was through the roof, but now that they are building a million plus cars a year and competing models come onto the market, you can expect to see more huge fluctuations in pricing.\n\nAlso beyond the last few years when the car market was crazy due to the chip shortage and whatnot, almost no mass market cars sold above MSRP, or even at MSRP. Dealers would buy these cars, often not be able to sell them quickly enough, and then the manufacturer would have to step in with incentives to help dealers move inventory. Large volume dealerships in the US typically sold most of their cars with very little profit, and even at a loss, since their main source of income is used car sales, service department, and lump sum monthly bonus payment from the car OEM for selling a certain number of cars (as described in the brilliant This American Life episode called \"129 cars\").\n\nDealerships can, of course, be highly predatory, and upsell a vulnerable customer on warranties, cosmetic packages, maintenance packages, and also steer them into high interest loans, but anyone with good credit and basic knowledge of how they operate can usually navigate buying from a dealer without getting ripped off. And typically if you are savvy enough, you can pit them against each other and get good deals way below MSRP.\n\nThis is mostly how US dealer models work though. I think it is somewhat different in Europe and China with their \"4S\" dealerships, which seem more tightly bound with the OEM, and largely sell their cars at MSRP pricing. For instance you see all these cars launched in China with the pricing front and center, along with initial promotions heavily featured to try to get good initial sale going. People who are interested in ordering the bZ3 will essentially be buying it at that exact same promo price all over China.",

"comment": "Minor build issues are one thing, reliability on the road is another. Right now, every Mach-E has 2 MAJOR flaws that can cause any one of them to shut down on the road:\n\n1. HVBJB (High Voltage Battery Junction Box) failure because of a poorly designed part. And yes, the newer updated parts are still failing. \n2. LV battery drain issues that can happen very quickly when the car is parked for a relatively short period of time. \n\nBoth of these have NO real fix as of yet and as far as I'm concerned puts the Mach-E in last place for reliability. \n\nAs for Tesla build quality, I had 2 issues, one them you touched on. And they were both fixed in my driveway in literally less than 15 minutes. One was the plastic cover on the driver's side pillar. It was a clip that needed to be replaced. The other was rear light moisture issue which was also replaced under warranty. \n\nTeslas are not perfect cars by any stetch of the imagination, but overall, they are reliable, even with their exterior panel and other cosmetic fitment issues. I know that when I step in mine, I'll can depend on it to reach point B with little drama. A Mach-E on the other hand is a toss-up. \n\nI never had the window problem and I do agree with you about the Phantom Braking although the newest FSD update seemed to be a lot better. Yes, this is an issue Tesla needs to fix ASAP. With that said, PB happens with BlueCruise as well so it's not like it's isolated to Teslas.",

At least from what I can tell. I've done a fair bit of research on the company both in terms of the work experience and the service they offer customers (lots of looking over BBB, Yelp, and Glassdoor reviews), so I am confident that they are legit and here to stay (unlike most companies you'd typically associate with door to door sales). \n\nAs for my other job, I already spoke to my supervisor and will be using 2 weeks paid vacation during my training at Sunrun (which I think lasts like a week and a half). So that will buy me some time to make a decision. I will be sure to double check how they define an appointment as well.",

"comment": "Took a look at the battery spec sheet and it looks like your right on the life of the Pb battery.  Actually they say at 50% you get about 1300 cycles which is roughly 3.5 years.  Not even the 5 let alone 10 years in my initial calculation.  Let assume that I get the 5 years as I probably won't hit 50% all that often.  It does however drastically change the results of the equation.  Also for Li batteries I see 80% draw a lot.  The new Sony batteries they are saying all the way to 100% but we all need to see some real life testing to believe that I think.  \n\nSo to redo the calculations.  Assuming I still want 30kWh usage a day.\nPb = $9438 initial cost and 1500 cycles would be $2296 a year usage\nLi = 6 PowerWalls (42kWh) and 10 years would be $17,400 initial cost and $1740 a year.  So Elon's sexy plastic box would actually be almost $500 a year cheaper or almost 30% cheaper.  \n\nI like it.\nNow we just need someone to buy them, go 10 years in the future and tell us if they still work.",

"comment": "&gt; it seems silly to me that they pay out up to retail cost to begin with. \n\nConsider the utility's point of view: They pay for capacity and power plants that they only use 50 hours a year, and it's not like they can say to GE \"We hardly ever use it, give us a discount.\" Those same 50 hours tend to be hot, sunny July weekdays, when they can buy solar power at baseload cost. \n\nThere will come a point - it might be there in southern California and hawaii - where there is actually enough distributed solar that the 50 worst hours are NOT July, midday, midweek, when the fossil-fuel plant tripped, but you have to put in a hell of a lot of solar to get there. \n\nNationwide averages are somewhat misleading, but solar generated about 1% of all electricity (in kWh) nationwide last year. \n\nThe rooftop people are still doing the utilities a favor.",

"comment": "1. There is a difference in hardware. Modules - you can go standard or premium. Premium (SunPower) has a higher efficiency and higher  lifetime production. You'll pay $.60/W more - however - you're ROI will only increase from about 5 to 6'ish years. Inverters - stay in the major name brands. SMA is your best residential hardware.\n\n2. Don't do a lease. Meaning - make sure you OWN you system, otherwise, you get ZERO incentives, and really only save 10-30% off of your electricity bill. You only lease if there is a reason you shouldn't own (low on cash, no tax liability) - but you still want to be part of the movement toward not killing our planet.\n\n3. You can install on the ground. However, price will be roughly $.30-.50/W more depending on the wire run lengths, etc. Production will be higher (perfect angles 30 degrees, and due south).\n\n4. You will have to redo your roof before you do the solar. I'd suggest you do the ground mount - and do it NOW - before the SRECII 25kW and lower incentive is gone. This incentive is probably worth 35% of the overall system cost spread over ten years. This incentive will be gone with a month and a half. It will probably be replaced by SRECIII - however - we're not expecting that until 2017.",

"comment": "I live in Maryland and have 18 Solar City panels on my townhouse. We buy the power we use from solar city and SC sells the rest back to the grid. The rest of our power comes from BGE. Solar city would have cost about $25k, but I know somebody that got the same setup with a different company that was about 8k cheaper. Since he sells his electricity he has had months where his bill from BGE is zero. \n\nThe one thing fossil fuels are good for is making heat, so don't worry about using them for that purpose. My townhouse uses natural gas for heating, drying clothes, and cooking. Solar panels are really great in the summer. My 18 panels are enough to run the whole house AC on the brightest hottest days of the year. \n\nI have had these panels for less than a year but clearing snow off was not a problem. This past winter had some heavy snowfalls, but it all slid off. In fact it slid off too quickly and damaged a hedge in front of my house. \n\nIf you have any questions you can ask me. You can also direct message me if you want to know more or would like my referral code.",

They took a bad decision and removed it, but I think that it has shaken the public's trust in banking on future savings of a solar array by proving just how shaky any projections can be.\n\nI would also say that it is more like hundreds of jobs back.\n\nIf you don't want to click on the link, here is some details of the new bill \"surplus electricity generation credited at 95% of the full retail rate until the installed net metering capacity reaches 80 MW. After that it will fall to 88% of retail rate for the next 80 MW, and then fall to 81% and 75% with each additional 80 MW deployed.\"",

My initial argument was, and I quote:\n\n&gt; I'd get a benefit from it in that I can leave my car in airport parking for a three week vacation and not worry that my battery's run down to zero charge and bricked a six figure car while I was gone. I might pay an extra 1-2% on the car's price tag for that.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt; The benefit of the solar roof is that it keeps your battery from draining itself over time, not simply that it could save you money or extend your range.\n\nYOU continued making arguments about cost, and I decided to rebut your argument that taking a cab is cheaper than parking at the airport because it wasn't. That has little to do with the reason I'd pay for a solar roof.\n\n&gt; If you get more peace of mind from leaving your expensive car in a airport rather than plugged in at home, then I accept that we are fundamentally different people\n\nObviously we are! The long-term lots at my airport are gated, lit and guarded 24/7 and insured against damage or theft while your car is parked there. It's a non-issue.",

The basic science has been the same for 100 years, and the models have been accurate since the 60’s.  All that matters now is over coming the political deadlock over renewable energy and coming up with better energy storage tech to support solar power, as well as reworking the grid to handle intermittent distributed power sources.",

"comment": "I think people like you are the problem overall.  \nMaybe you have not read the link I showed you, but as said people call any kind of battery system, and this includes the battery and all electronics a powerwall.   \nPlease read the article I showed you about it. It's easier and more efficient to call the system    \na powerwall vs saying a    \n\"battery pack consisting of 18650 batteries that are in XS and XP configuration, whatever balancing circuit, inverter and such.\"   \nSo you could use the world powerwall and everyone knows you include everything in it, or you name them all one by one like you prefer it. Very inefficient.      \n    \nAnd you show another problem, just because it's 12 volt doesn't mean it's tiny. If we would go this way, why does the USA use 110 volt vs European countries that use 240 volt one phase. Seems the whole USA has a tiny power grid.   \n    \nWhen it comes to a power system you should try to stay in it's voltage, so if you want to get away from grid tied, and want to switch everything, you can without too many problems switch everything to a 12 volt system. You of course need to use different connectors for the 12 volt system and run bus bars or right sized cables through the house but this is possible. I know a couple of houses that run 12 volt for all lighting applications house wide as they use LED's and LED stripes.",

"comment": "According to [https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/georgia/](https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/georgia/) a 5 kW system in Georgia has a payback period of about 10 years (which is mediocre) and an internal rate of return (investment return) of 11.7% (which is pretty good).  However, it appears that these calculations are based upon participation in (subscription of) the Georgia Power Solar Buyback Program:\n\n&gt;Even without state regulations, the utility companies are buying solar power from homeowners, sometimes at a premium. For example, Georgia power has what they call a solar buyback program that pays (at the time of this writing, $0.17/kWh for solar power connected to the grid. That’s more than $0.04/kWh above the average retail rate. They’re not obligated to do it, but with people all over the state interested in  buying it, your solar roof is an asset in this way, too.\n\nUnfortunately for OP, the solar buyback [program is fully subscribed and is not accepting new customers into the program at this time.](http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/3457) This means that the payback period probably increases and the internal rate of return probably decreases.  Without more information, I would guess that solar is not \"worth it\" for OP.",

"comment": "I'm not looking at using physical trackers - I'm planning on a fixed panel mount, virtual tracking system, to extend the useful solar day and to produce power when it's of most value to the grid (morning and evening, less focused at solar noon).  Part of that is also based on lead acid charging requirements for sustained grid-down use, if required.  I'm aware of the difference in generation between east-west and south, but I'm also quite aware of the difference in generation on cloudy days from the increased panel area, which is of interest to me.\n\nThe system will be grid tied, but with the likely upcoming changes to net metering agreements in Idaho, I want to be able to both self consume, and time shift exports if needed (if kWh exported in the evening are worth more, I'll store during the day and export some during the evening by adjusting voltage setpoints).\n\nI'm quite familiar with the behaviors of lead acid.  My office is purely off grid with lead acid, and I've done quite a bit of research into their quirks, as well as lifespan issues.  My intent for the initial design is a somewhat smaller battery bank, still relying on grid for some power, but also a backup generator if needed.\n\nWith AC vs DC coupled, I'm still quite skeptical of AC coupled systems, and I've yet to be convinced they're anything but a bit of a cute hack for microinverters, as opposed to the DC coupled system I'm interested in building.\n\nAs for a professional, I can't find one who is willing to even consider a DC coupled system.  It's not something anyone around here does, apparently.",

"comment": "Are solar hot water panels cheaper than PV panels?  I've heard the opposite.  Usually hot water panels are expensive up front, and don't have great performance in the winter.  Plus, the sheer amount of piping you need to do, and if they fail, it could be a rough fix.  With PV panels coming down in price so much, I'm curious what the price comparison is. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong though, which solar hot water module are you thinking of?    If you live in a warmer climate and don't have to worry about poor performance or freezing, then it may make even more sense.",

Looks like about the same efficiency as the 345's, but with a physically larger panel.  Personally, I prefer the DC panels with string inverters. However, those may not be available in your area or through your dealer. If you do have problems, SunPower will take care of you, so not much risk with those A-series  panels.",

I am not one that is for more regulation, but if they are going to make rapid shutdown a law to support solaredge and enphase, I would think critter guards would be required. Unfortunately, no manufacture would profit enough to push that requirement through which is really what the NEC is all about at the end of the day and local AHJs dont seem to care enough.\n\nI have had to work through pigeon infestations so bad it literally makes me nauseous. When you are up in the baking roof with plump little babies rolling down the roof, dead birds everywhere, nests made of bird sh!t across the whole array. Gutters completely overflowing. Their droppings are so acidic it eventually corrodes right through gutters, siding, and roofing.\n\nIt may be unbelievable, but out in areas where the pigeon infestations are particularity bad, the hawks have learned to watch for us removing the solar. When we start removing the modules we will see hawks start to cycle. All we need to do is step off the roof for 10 mins and by the time we are back all the chicks are gone.\n\nIt is incredible how much damage to electrical systems, roofs, and peoples health I have seen do to the lack of installing a simple screen around the perimeter of an array. On the other hand, I have seen nearly NO damage or pigeons for systems that are greater than 8 inches off the roof deck. By none I mean like literally none. IMHO, if a solar array is going to be flush mounted less than 8\" off the roof deck this should be required.",

"comment": "A long duration thermal storage tank is the way to go if you have the space.  I'm at 43S latitude and need heating for most of the year and cooling for a few rare warm days.  I have an air-to-water heatpump that is used to heat water with hydronic fan-coil units in the house.  Heating water in a storage tank during the day when it is warmer (higher heat-pump COP) and there is PV power being generated is much more efficient and cost effective than up-sizing batteries to allow running the heat pump at night when the air is cooler.\n\nFor my heating requirements and heat pump efficiency, a 2000L 50C storage tank was roughly equivalent to 100KWh of battery storage if the battery was used to run the heatpump.\n\nNewer EVI heatpumps can work well down to -15C and some can go lower, so places where heatpumps were not an option 10 years ago are now an option.\n\nTake a look at [https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/energy-storage-water-d\\_1463.html](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/energy-storage-water-d_1463.html) for energy stored in water.\n\nAs for using the heat from the panels, if it is below freezing outside, you will need to add glycol which reduces the heat transfer ability.  In addition, even if the bottom of the panels are well insulated, the surface through the front glass and PV cells is essentially uninsulated, so you will likely lose a lot of heat that way.  I suspect if it wouldn't be financially viable.",

They simply don't know the product. \n\nIt's the equivalent of going to a luxury dealership and complaining about price. It's friggin stupid. It's a stupid thing to bitch and moan about, with respect to the product in question. \n\nIf you have problems with the pricing, you can literally go to any other solar company. Just like you can go to the Hyundai dealership instead of Mercedes. Same energy.\n\nSunPower is worth what it charges because of the headaches they eliminate by being good quality solar panels. I haven't seen anybody do what they do, and I've mingled with quite a few Solar companies. No one else has a panel or a cell that will still work even when [snapped in half](https://youtu.be/JZR9_ImN6qU).\n\nSo if those figures work for you, I'd say pull the trigger. I'll hazard a guess that this is a lease though, because I wouldn't sell E-series panels to anyone. If you're considering financing, or buying with cash, I'd recommend the M-series. Either their M-425 or M-435 panels. Those are the cream of the crop right now. You'll need fewer panels to get to your offset, which may drop the overall system cost.\n\n\nSource: I am a SunPower dealer, amongst other solar companies.",

Because the IRS has no cap on the PPW of solar. I could charge someone $8ppw and they won’t bat an eye. \n\nIt’s just like how business people can find out ways to write of lambos and jets in on their taxes. There is no way to prosecute it regardless of how sketch a few Karens think it is.\n\nAnd for clarification, if you actually pay for the roof yourself, you shouldn’t claim it as the tax credit. But if the solar installer offers you a free roof and just adds it onto the cost of your solar, there is no problem with that.",

Net result was $3.10 per watt for additional modules. I estimate your 13 KW system with a Sol-Ark 15K at $45,500 without batteries. Homegrid 19.2 KWH battery is $12,000. from online stores. ESS UL9540 listed.\n\nMy original system of choice many years ago was Xantrex, now Schneider.\n\nI'm not opposed to microinverters, but IMO AC coupled batteries are inferior.",

I tried to install a cheaper solar water heater in my building, but the roof isn't strong enough to bear the weight, and the pipework to reach my apartment would have been too invasive and expensive. \n\nAbout the horrible heatwave, it's called a Mediterranean Summer :-) it seems to me that the guys in Karlsruhe will surely be great scientists, but they have never set their foot on Italy. I live in Rome, and in the second half of July the top temperature I've recorded was 38°C... which is surely very hot, I have no A/C and I hate summer heat... but it was nothing that we've not already seen in the past... then on the media they cherrypicked the most sensational recording (43° LOL) to make the news, as they do every summer. I can show you an headline from a 1967 paper written like \"deadly heatwave in Rome, temperature hits 42°C\"... it was BS then and it's BS today.",

They can then sell that energy into the spot market when rates go up in early evening. Apparently battery storage is more cost effective than Hydrogen storage. A new battery storage facility is being built in Petaluma CA.",

If they lose a few contracts, it doesn't matter - they've already suckered in enough other people with their false promises and slick marketing to make up the difference.",

Otherwise 3-4 thousand is probably accurate for the remove/reinstall.",

Local generation and local storage mean no need for \"grid\" expansion.  Urban roof tops are 72,000 square miles.  Amount of area needed for solar panels to provide 100% of US power, 5,000 square miles.  \n\nPower is generated locally and stored locally with 25% of existing grid converted to wind and solar farms also with battery backup, the grid actually shrinks.  Windpower on Columbia can produce as much as hydropower for Bonneville Power allowing BPA to breach all the destructive dams which are even more destructive due to lower flows and hotter water.\n\nSo dump all the \"Grid is Failing\" stories promoted by GOP and oil companies to protect fossil fuel industry.",

"comment": "I don't have a citation but I read a CO2 footprint report and that stated that EVs really started generating a CO2 payback. It stated two years assuming the electricity to charge the car was produced with 100% renewables.\n\nAlso, if you look at things like wind turbines, if the turbine can make it to it's max lifespan of 25 years it will have a CO2 footprint of 20-30%.  Mostly due to the concrete base and fiberglass.\n\nWhile things may look like they are going green, everything has a payback and an upfront CO2 cost to overcome.\n\nEven solar panels take 2 to 4 years to offset the CO2 used to construct them and one hailstorm can wipe them out.\n\nHere is a report from MIT\n\n[https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/are-electric-vehicles-definitely-better-climate-gas-powered-cars](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/are-electric-vehicles-definitely-better-climate-gas-powered-cars)",

"comment": "Personally, I think that people who can't appreciate this sort of work are hypocrites. Because unless you're growing your own food and making your own wares, you're supporting someone who uses animals. Shop at Wholefoods, Henry's, etc? They serve and make profits off meat. There was a guy on here a while back who self-righteously declared he wasn't a victim of this, and all his bath products were from vegan companies, including that Dr Bronner's stuff &amp;#3232;\\_&amp;#3232; \n\nMy feeling is, if you support a subsidiary of a larger company that wants to devote certain products to vegans when they traditionally weren't vegan, and the public and vegans alike buy those products and they sell well, you're sending a message to a company that they can indeed profit off vegan ventures. As consumers, we vote with our dollars. Companies only want to produce what we'll buy. Next thing you know, people start to realize that all their favorite things are or can be vegan, and suddenly being vegan doesn't seem like such a huge leap. Shunning these ventures only shuts people out.\n\nOf course, I believe we should support quality products by vegan companies if we can, that's not in question. But do I think she's supporting leather? Nope. She's very clearly saying that companies, if they want her business, need to recognize a growing subculture of consumers.",

I mean, day four it looks like she consumed *maybe* 500 calories. It looks like on most of her days she's maybe hitting 1000 calories. As I said in another comment, while everyone is obviously different, I think most people need more calories than that to maintain a healthy body weight.\n\nThat said, had she been interested in consuming more calories, she could have eaten a peanut butter sandwich instead of an onion and mustard one, and spent even less money and thrown the extra onion and lettuce into something else (in the spirit of nutrients). Or, for example, she could have been eating oatmeal instead of waffles and been saving copious amounts of money and getting more calories.\n\nI just hope people don't walk away from this article thinking that eating as a vegan on a $21/ week diet, you won't be able to meet your caloric needs.",

"comment": "&gt;Ok, this is why the disagreement occur. People actually disagree with you about that definition. Most vegans will not mind if you go find a feather in the forest that some bird lost, and put it in your hat. It doesn't hurt anybody, and nobody would ask you not to call yourself vegan if you used it for decoration. If, however, you raised birds in a captive state, plucked their feathers off them, and turned them into clothing, then most vegans would object.\n\nFair enough. Finding (and even using) discarded body parts of animals is not directly going to hurt an animal. It may certainly give the wrong message if others see it in public (as the great majority of feathers used in fashion are culled from the slaughterhouse, and strengthens the notion that animal parts do serve well as fashion accessories), but *this is not what we are talking about.*\n\nWe are talking about the notion of intentionally subjugating sentient animals (e.g., bees), and referring to a substance that they create as **vegan**. Pay special attention here. I am not even talking about the person who decides to eat such a substance. I am merely speaking about the 'foodstuff' itself...honey. To call the substance honey 'vegan' is definitionally inaccurate.\n\n&gt;Veganism is not about some arbitrary definition, or the linguistic roots of a word, it's about not contributing to animal suffering.\n\nI firmly disagree. Language is EVERYTHING! Without a firm definition, then veganism does not exist! Follow me here. As has been mentioned in this subreddit countless times, the word vegan was coined by Donald Watson in 1944 to describe a lifestyle that excludes, *as far as is possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.* Now, if you have come up with a logical framework under which honey meets these criteria, then please let it be known.  Furthermore, when used to describe food ingredients, the word *vegan* is used to describe ingredients that are not of animal origin. Honeybees (of which there are several species under the genus Apis) fall under the kingdom Animalia. Bees create honey, therefore honey is an animal product. Animal products are not vegan, and likewise honey is not vegan.\n\nEnglish is a *living language*. This means that the meaning of words drift and evolve over time. Sometimes, this drift has unfortunate consequences. In terms of the word \"vegan\", there is tendency fueled by speciesism, ignorance and human self-interest to dismantle the word vegan, and expand it to include animal products. This is an extremely dangerous trend, and will only serve to harm animals. Why do I care? The misusage of the word vegan has a direct detrimental effect on animals. How so? The production of honey for human consumption harms bees. Bees are sentient, intelligent creatures with central nervous systems. They actively discourage humans from taking their honey. They produce honey for their own needs, not yours. Even careful, homegrown honey production causes the aggravation and death of bees. When people hear that honey is \"vegan\", this increases the market demand for honey. Using the word \"vegan\" in the context of the word \"honey\" increases animal suffering, pure and simple. Since increased animal suffering is a trend that I wish to abate, I do all I can to reverse the unfortunate erosion of the word \"vegan\".\n\nAnd honey is just the beginning. I can use the same logic that allows honey to be termed \"vegan\", and apply it to eggs, milk and even meat. If honey is \"vegan\" then so are eggs, milk and meat. By calling an animal product \"vegan\", you have rendered the word itself meaningless.\n\n&gt;Now when it comes to honey, the reason it ends up causing debate is very simple. People are in disagreement about whether insects, and bees in particular, can sense and feel the way many other animals can.\n\nInterestingly enough, most of the people who side on the \"bees can't feel or sense\" argument are those who still want to eat honey. Believe it or not, I used to eat honey, even for a brief time after becoming vegan. Of course, this action was fueled by ignorance. The moment I learned the truth, and connected the obvious dots, I gave it up forever. Would my life be easier if I could eat honey? Sure. It would be easier if I could eat eggs, milk and meat as well.\n\n&gt;With things like Oysters , bacteria or amoebae, there is little doubt that they are not sentient in any meaningful definition of the word, so they don't tend to cause controversy.\n\nOysters? [Says](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201006/vegans-and-oysters-if-you-eat-oysters-youre-not-vegan-so-why-the-questio) [who](http://supervegan.com/blog/entry.php?id=1472)? You say this like it is a well known fact--Like it is a given. The fact is that it has not been proven that oysters are free from pain. Unlike plants, they exhibit bodily structures that are much more in line with animals that clearly do feel pain. Why not give them the benefit of the doubt?\n\n&gt;I guess what I am trying to say is that to most vegans it is not the literal semantic meaning of the word \"vegan\" that is important, but rather what consequences your actions have, and whether it causes animal suffering.\n\nExcept for the fact that these two are inseparable. There is an immediate and direct correlation between the dilution of the word \"vegan\" and an increase of animal suffering.\n\n&gt;I guess if you want to use your astronomer analogy , it's more akin to the furore you had over whether Pluto should be a planet or not, and now that I think about it, the debate about that was indeed full of name-calling and similar nonsense.\n\n1. The planetary designation of Pluto was not arbitrarily changed based on the whims of a few renegade astronomers.  In 2006, after much debate, the International Astronomical Union came to the conclusion that Pluto no longer met the well established criteria to be designated as a planet, and gained the new designation of \"dwarf planet\". An equivalent move in relation to the word \"vegan\" would be shown by the Vegan society coming out and formally changing their stance on honey. Until this happens (and I doubt that it ever will), the independent misdirections of individuals is not force sufficient to magically transform the animal product \"honey\" into a vegan substance.\n\n2. Name calling? Outside the actions of the rare troll, I have rarely seen any name calling. If you are going to bring up the topic of name calling, can you at least substantiate your assertion with a link?\n\n3. Nonsense? If defending the plight of the innocent is \"nonsense\", then what exactly are you doing in this subreddit? (Honest question)",

"comment": "I completely agree 100%!!! And to add to this concept, I'd say it applies to most lifestyle changes. I know for myself and my spouse, we came to veganism on our own and after years of being vegetarian. We knew other vegans, mainly my wife's sister, and even with all the reasons to become vegan, the tipping point came (for me especially, and I think I can say the same for my wife) when I volunteered at a farm sanctuary and helped feed and take care of bull calves saved from incineration at the hands of the dairy industry. We naively assumed the babies were just raised and used as meat, not just disposed of like trash.",

However a large part of veganism is ethics: the issue of the *exploitation* of animals. In a manner of speaking, this could be constituted as a type of exploitation. Raising bacterial strains for use to make tea and other by-products. However there comes the issue of if that's a big issue. There's a vast difference between bacteria and animals, even simplistic animals like bees (which their product, honey, is not considered vegan).\n\n\n\nSo I believe that's his question: in conjunction with ethical veganism, is this really \"vegan\" (as in is it okay to exploit these bacterial strains in this manner)?",

Raw is not any healthier and is in many ways less healthy (your body can't absorb nutrients fully from many raw vegetables, and beans need to be cooked)\n\nThe best way to be a vegan is to just be one.  Just take the plunge, you'll thank yourself :)\n\n&gt; not eating meat is almost blasphemy.\n\nMost cultures have an addiction to meat, though.  You're hardly alone.  I'm Irish / English / Lithuanian.  Growing up every single meal was meat-centered, even breakfast.  It's not as if non-Portuguese people grow up borderline vegetarian.  All people obsess over meat.\n\nJust remember it's not about *you* and it's not about *your family*, it's about the animals.  Be polite, but be firm.... it's your body, your choice.",

Making your own milk out of nuts and beans is quite easy if you'd like to try: [here's Mary's video teaching a cool soy milk recipe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDdzSr7RqC8) If you like it, check out some of her other recipes, there are a lot of nice things you may find in her channel.\n\nSo let's tackle yogurt now! I live in a small South American city, so finding soy yogurts is a bit of a hassle, if you can't find them in local markets like me, just do it yourself. Mix the milk with a starter and voilà! Also try out preparing it with coconut milk for a more creamy texture.\n\nAlright, now ice cream! My absolute favourite recipe is a pineapple one that I make whenever I can. You're gonna need:\n\n* 2 cups of chopped pineapples\n* 1/2 cup of crystal sugar\n* 1/4 cup of coconut milk\n* 1 package of soy milk cream (200g)\n* and 1/2 teaspoon of emulsifier (this is completely optional, it works fine without it.)\n\nCaramelize the pineapple cubes with sugar (I usually use crystal sugar for this, but any sugar works), then add up the soy milk cream and the coconut milk. Mix everything on a blender. Put it on the freezer. Tah freaking dah!\n\nYou can also use a mixer after freezing the ice cream for the first time and add up the emulsifier to nail the texture perfectly. [Here's a video of the whole process!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88FEY0xWo5w) (It's in Portuguese, but if you need assistance understanding the whole thing, I'll be willing to help you in every step.)\n\nAye, now for the cheese. Tofu is your new god. Really, it's the most versatile piece of food ever. I'd recommend[ Mary's video on how to make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdGwL5dFgCQ).\n\n[Once you taste it grilled, you'll never go back.](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/02/the-food-lab-how-to-grill-tofu-vegan-experience.html)\n\nThere are a LOT more recipes out there, I'm a pretty crappy cook but even I can make some tasty vegan treats. Just be curious and look around the web for more recipes.\n\nWelcome to the club, OP! I hope you enjoy the food and keep saving animals.",

My argument is that we if there is an alternative to palm oil that is less destructive to the habitat of a specific animal, then there is an ethical implication to try our best to use that alternative. Unfortunately there may be no alternative to modern farming practices that DISPLACE animals that we can support. We cannot always avoid that, but we could avoid palm oil. That is why I said that veganism is not black and white, and we need to be able to identify when we can limit this impact and when it is unavoidable given the current state of the agricultural industry.",

"comment": "&gt; I however subscribe to negative preferential utilitarian thought so I would disagree on grounds that wild animals have a strong preference to stay alive and therefore have a net-positive value for staying alive. I think a living being that is suffering beyond imagination but which stubbornly refuses to want to die should not be killed. That is, there is no euthanasia without consent. If there is no consent the act of killing is murder.\n\nNegative preference utilitarianism is still utilitarianism. There are certain cases where allowing the preferences of a minority to be thwarted is worth it to prevent greater thwarting of preferences down the line. So, even if reducing habitat violates the preferences of existing animals to survive, it might be overall justified under NPU because it prevents a much greater number of future beings from coming into existence and inevitably having their preferences thwarted. It's fine if you disagree that this applies in the case we are discussing, but just asserting that you are a preference utilitarian doesn't really address the argument. If the part you disagree with is the claim that preventing future wild animals from existing is good, then it seems like you should also oppose veganism (for reasons discussed in the OP article).\n\nBtw, I lean more towards classical (non-negative) hedonistic utilitarianism, although I wouldn't say I'm committed to any one ethical system (due to moral uncertainty).",

To paraphrase his explanation, he said something like \"It's unlikely that one person's vote will change anything, and so economist's who realize this fact usually don't vote,\" and he used this argument to say that my change to a vegan lifestyle was unlikely to change anything. \n\nIt's weird though, because he referred to the phenomenon as a fallacy, but it failed to register that what he was arguing was therefore untrue. \n\nIt was, and still is mind boggling. He was also an engineer, and other engineering friends of mine essentially said the same thing. Even the vegan ones. \n\nI think it's because they don't realize what a huge effect it has in aggregate, over a long period of time; they only see the \"instantaneous\" short-term outcome.",

"comment": "I agree for the most part, but I'm a vegan and an ecologist, and this isn't painting the whole picture. Hybrids cause uniformity in the local population, which increases the whole populations sensitivity to disease. In addition, many hybrids behave more like a new species than a mix of the two starting species. Hybrids often outcompete their ancestors in the worse cases (think hybrid geckos in Florida) or have conflicting instincts that put themselves in danger in the best cases (think mule deer/ white tailed deer hybrids). The result is a less stable population more at risk for extinction than the previous population. Some invasive species are also capable of destroying a whole ecosystem themselves. How many species of birds would still be around if we hadn't introduced cats, mongooses, or rats to their nesting sites? Would the tuatara and kiwi still be endangered if they didn't have to deal with the invasive mammals humans brought to New Zealand? That isn't to say we should haul off and kill all of the invasive species we find. Apple snails are invasive in many parts of the US, and detrimental to most ecosystems, but they also managed to bring an endangered species of snail eating kite back from the brink of extinction. Pythons and anacondas are both invasive to the everglades, but due to the low variability in the ecosystem before their introduction they have actually increased the biodiversity of the area along with a number of other invasive reptiles, and the native alligators don't seem to be suffering. Invasive control of plants is often managed with invasive insects, which often target only a specific species making them wholly beneficial to the invaded ecosystem. In short, invasive management is complicated, and killing the invasive species isn't always the solution, but many times its the only thing we can do to save another species from extinction. Veganism is about not harming animals, and since leaving invasive species be is harmful (and our fault) it's often times not very vegan to just let them be.\n\nTl;dr: invasive species often cause more death than we do by removing them, so removing them isn't always a bad thing.",

I like this because you just mix it all together, bake it for an hour, and then you have a yummy dinner for the next few days. You can sub in cooked rice or breadcrumbs for the cornmeal if you like and it turns out amazing still \n\n[Here’s a white chili that I absolutely love](https://www.vegetarianventures.com/creamy-vegetarian-white-chili/), use plant milk instead of regular milk, obviously. Soups/chilis/stews are actually a really great place to look for easy recipes because most of the time it’s basically just sauté vegetables, throw in some spices, add in broth, and simmer until it’s hot.\n\n[Thai curry seems impressive, but it’s actually super easy](https://cookieandkate.com/2015/thai-red-curry-recipe/) This one is nice, but it can actually get way easier. I simmer the red curry paste, coconut milk and soy sauce on the stove; and literally just toss in a bag of microwaved frozen vegetables.\n\nThe best tip I can give you though is to really stock up on condiments. The best sauces &amp; dressings can make *any* meal taste delicious, even if it *is* just “beans and rice”. [Teriyaki](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/259887/simple-teriyaki-sauce/) (minus the Honey of course), [Pesto](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-pesto-5-minutes/), and [Peanut sauce](https://www.yummymummykitchen.com/2018/02/simple-thai-peanut-sauce-recipe.html) are a few that are quick and easy with a little practice.

This past year I lost almost 30 lbs! \n\nI basically tracked how much I was eating without changing my diet at all (I did this so I could see how many kcalories I needed to eat to maintain my weight). After I got my rough average, I just cut my kcalories from there. In regards to carbs, I cut them down a little bit just to put a greater emphasis on protein (more filling, higher thermogenic rate), but you definitely dont need to cut them too much! I still have potatoes, rice and pasta. Carbs are still important!\n\nI also aimed to walk more instead of driving. Even prior to veganism I enjoyed going to the gym so I kept working out mostly the same.\n\nGood luck!",

"comment": "Hey, Alex. I'm a YouTube subscriber, of yours. I have several questions regarding the finer points of your vegan values.\n\n1. You've said that your justification for veganism is that animals are part of our moral community. Is that all members of the clade Metazoa (Animalia)? Is it based on some derived characteristic that not all metazoans (animals) share? Is our moral community even a monophyletic set of organisms? Do different sets of organisms have different rights?\n\n2. The way most governments implement right to life is beyond simply not killing- it also involves intervention when a citizen is in danger. For example, rescuing a person from a fire, or a bear attack, or active shooter. With animals being a part of our moral community, would consistency call for such interventions when animals are in danger? If yes, does this mean governments should be intervening when animals attack and eat each other? What if one of the animals is an obligate carnivore? Or should only humans be afforded the right to be rescued?\n\n3. In most civilized countries, right to life also includes right to medical intervention. In your country, that's implemented through NHS. With animals a part of our moral community, if we assume that the British government has an affirmative duty to run something like the NHS, does it follow that animals also have a right to NHS-like medical care?\n\n4. How do you feel about pest-control measures like removing termites from houses? Is this murder? Can it be justified under self-defense?\n\n5. Am I correct in guessing from your reddit handle that your birthday is the 27th of March?",

"comment": "&gt;there is a difference in discussing crimes against animals as a personal choice and as a societal choice\n\nCare to explain what you mean here? \n\nI absolutely agree that there are people who can't help but eat animal product - such as children who live with douchey parents/carers/guardians. In a similar sense, I don't blame people for ever having ate meat - it's ridiculously normalised. That's fine. \n\nOnce you know and can, change. And most people on Reddit definitely can. \n\nMy problem is with those who claim it as a personal choice or claim that they can't change because it's societal/cultural. \n\n&gt;it doesn’t help to reject those who are already aware of the crimes but can’t transition to full vegan just yet for a variety of reasons\n\nWhat are the reasons though? There definitely are valid reasons but \"I just love cheese\" isn't one of them. It should be taken on a case by case basis, which I would argue it is. \n\nThere was a post the other day about someone recovering from anorexia who had to drink a calorie replacement shake that contained dairy - the responses were overwhelmingly positive. When young teens eg 13/14 post about how they want to go vegan but can't, the response is always \"do what you can\". \n\nBut when someone says they just can't give up cheese, what that actually means for the cow is -very rightly- pointed out to them. \n\n&gt;calling them lazy murderers just instills more guilt into someone who i am sure is already feeling it. \n\nIf someone is genuinely making a change, I completely agree with you. Providing practical help is probably more useful. \n\nTho, tbf, shame is arguably a very effective societal tool at time - altho I'm not certain if I find it all that ethical but I don't actually use it so, meh. \n\n&gt;for the young vegans who have their diet decided for them via school, parents\n\nAgreed. \n\n&gt;for the ostracized aspiring vegan who is afraid to tell their SO/parents/roommates that they don’t eat meat anymore \n\nSlightly less agreed. This can absolutely be a real concern, but sometimes people do just need to grow a pair (if they are a functioning adult in a safe environment - obviously there are mitigating circumstances). \n\n&gt;i’m not arguing from the point of a meat eater\n\nApologies for the assumption, your first sentence threw me for a loop I guess. \n\n&gt;i’m arguing from the point of someone who is doing or at least trying to do the right thing,\n\nWhich is good, and I do believe should be encouraged, especially if veganism is the end goal. Otherwise I have a problem - I'm not gonna pat someone on the back for contributing to 50% fewer murders if they literally believe that's enough (when they have the option to do more). \n\n&gt;only receiving malice from a community who should be supporting their decision but doesn’t because they aren’t “doing it well enough” \n\nYou've received absolutely no positive encouragement, whatsoever? \n\nI tried to look, and I can't even find where you've posted/commented on r/vegan so I'm confused by that. Could you provide an example please? \n\nAnd, assuming that that's true, then I'm sorry you've had such a bad experience here. I'd urge you to look into the links I've provided to perhaps try to understand the opposing point of view, and I would be happy to provide you with any info you may be looking for - be it on the moral/enviro/health aspects of veganism and a plant based diet, or simply tips and recipes. Just let me know what you're looking for. \n\n&gt;being an asshole to people is not vegan\n\nThis is a hard no, tho. Being a dick is being a dick, sure. It's dickish. But bruh is calling it non-vegan stretching a [definition](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) more than I've ever seen.\n\nEdit: spelling.\n\nEdit 2: seriously trying to look for when you've been active on r/vegan but I found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ijksdi/guy_lighting_his_blunt_from_the_flames_of_a/g3fc7a0?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) instead. Vegans can't even call people \"lazy murderers\" for paying for the abuse and deaths of non-human animals, but you can wish for the deaths of people? Lmao.",

If you have the patience, you can also look up recipes for nut-based cheeses to make yourself! \n\nFor dessert? You could make a cake, or pudding, and whatnot. Just omit the eggs (or use an egg replacer) and use a non-dairy milk like soy milk. Noracooks has some great recipes, just look out for the vanilla extracts if you avoid the pure ones w alcohol. https://www.noracooks.com/category/vegan-desserts/",

We’re not stereotypes. If this lifestyle looks accessible and easy (and just otherwise worth it), people might become more open to it. I have a theory that people generally know deep down that they *should* be vegan, but they reject it out of fear of the unknown (i.e. new ways of eating, socializing, etc.)\n\nWhen people ask me why, I just tell them very honestly: “I love animals and care about the environment, and I feel better physically this way”. If they ask more questions, I answer. If they want to argue, I change the subject or leave.\n\nI hate this idea that if you aren’t supergluing yourself to a Starbuck’s counter, you’re not doing enough for the movement. Just living the truth should be enough.",

"comment": "Yeah, but cheese doesn’t result in as many animals being killed as consuming cows. https://animalvisuals.org/projects/1mc/\n\nI’m basing my opinions off the above, mostly. If someone cuts out eating chickens and eats chicken eggs instead, for example, they are undoubtedly resulting in less animals being killed. \n\nOverall, becoming vegetarian is a good, positive step forward in my opinion. Vegan is better, but vegetarians are still better than people who eat animals in terms of animal protection. It may be annoying communicating with someone vegetarian, depending on what they’re saying or doing, but generally, they’re doing better than someone who eats animals imo.",

They say they collect the feathers from what they lose naturally, which doesn’t directly hurt them. However, it raises the question of if it is ethical to keep caged animals. \n\nAs far as Canada Goose, they treat the geese horribly and seriously harm/kill them to take their feathers. They are also in i humane living conditions. The fur around the hood is an entire fox. I’ve seen varrying information about where they get it, but they’re oftentimes trapped or farmed. \n\nI can’t remember what the movie was called, but I remember watching a movie about how foxes are raised in tiny cages and then skinned alive. They electrocute them rectally (sort of like the vet taking temperatures) which stuns them and then they skin them alive. If they killed them another way, it would create holes in the fur. This was long before I went vegan, but seeing such sweet animals just sitting there struggling without their skin was horrifying and turned me off of wearing any animal products forever. If I can find the documentary I’ll add it!",

"comment": "I've been an activist in the animal rights/environmental protection movement since the early 1970s when I was hired to make a documentary about the Canadian 'baby' seal hunt for an animal welfare organization.\n\nI've found there are many people who put assuaging their own emotions ahead of demonstrable progress for animals and/or the environment. It's not unique to 'veganism.' It seems to be prevalent in most social issues. Many people consider their personal state of mind more  important than achieving the social objective. It seems to be very human.\n\nTo this day, I develop and implement campaigns to protect animals and the environment. In all campaigns, I tend to avoid recruiting people to decision-making positions who put themselves and their state-of-mind ahead of the objective. They tend not to be helpful or have   perspectives that aid being effective.",

That is what gives them value, not the label of \"animal.\" If certain plants were sentient and could feel we likely wouldn't eat them because they hold those same characteristics that made vegans stop eating meat. On the other hand, if oysters were for all intents and purposes completely void of sentience or feeling in the same way that most plants are, claiming it is wrong to eat them and not plants is in and of itself a speciesist (or kingdomist??) stance. I don't see what trait inherent to the label of being an \"animal\" separates those things morally.",
