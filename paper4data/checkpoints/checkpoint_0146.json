"comment": "I have some experience with hydrogen vehicles, there is a filling station in Coventry UK i have used its was very simple (used mainly by Microcab H2 vehicles who have a factory nearby). Its being pushed mainly because from the manufacturers point of view its far far easier to build H2 cars at a decent selling price than battery EV. \n\nI don't think it will be easier to develop hydrogen stations i just think the business model for selling hydrogen fits the existing fossil fuel sale and distribution network well so i can see more routes for investment. Eventually companies like Shell are going to have to invest more into alternative fuel and i don't think they will be interested in building a huge network of EV chargers. I think its much more likely they will develop existing fuel station franchises to offer H2. For a proper EV network we are going to need hundreds of thousands if not millions of charging stations and i don't see who has that kind of money who would also be interested in doing it.",

It really is worth it, especially after spending so much money on a computer with 4 wheels.\n\nI  have to admit tho, this is a weird schedule, and the differences with the Nissan LEAF schedule are interesting.\n\nNissan requires a mandatory battery pack check once a year, so this is either a rip off on Nissan's side (to keep the dealers busy, although the first few years are free), or Ford really doesn't care or is as worried as Nissan about the battery health.\n\nNissan also insists on doing brake fluid changes on a regular basis, don't see a mention of that on the Ford schedule.  Changing the brake fluid is a good idea, even if you don't drive an EV.\n\nI would also rotate the tires sooner than that, as they are usually more expensive, and don't last as long as regular tires (assuming Ford installed LRR tires).",

That's just not true electric drivetrain are just that, drivetrains. Every other part of the car stays the same. And the OEM's drivetrain know-how largely won't obsolete soon either, just because an electric motor generates the torque that goes into one end of the drivetrain.",

"comment": "Oh ho, trying to hide the elephant in the room, what's the engine efficiency?\n\nA fuel tank with 685 liters of diesel contains about 6.64 MWh of energy. With an engine efficiency of say 10% (I'm being generous), that's 664 kWh of energy transformed into physical work. Good thing too, that's around a Proterra top of the line bus. So it's possible after all.\n\nI don't know the weight of the 100 kWh pack for Tesla, I can only find the 85 kWh pack weight of 544 kg, but let's say it weighs 800 kg, that's around 5.31 tons for a 664 kWh pack. The weight of the tractor you linked is 14.82 tons.\n\nIt's trivial to build it, now on the economic and charging part which are more difficult. The current quote price per kWh at the pack level is around $200, some are lower, some higher. A pack with 664 kWh would cost $132800. On the charging side, Proterra's pack can charge up to 1 GW so the charge time would idealy take under one hour, however these chemistries can't sustain that from almost depleted to almost fully charged, so let's say it takes one hour, maybe two. At a price of around 20 cents per kWh it would cost around $132.8 for a complete charge compared to around 8 times more for diesel.\n\nGiven the battery price, this won't likely take off until it's way cheaper. How does $66400 pack cost sound like? That's what will be possible in a couple of years when the cost is expected to drop to around half of what it is today, or $100/kWh.\n\nSource of energy density of diesel\n\nhttps://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/TatyanaNektalova.shtml",

"comment": "The LEAF has always been mid-20s after the federal tax credit - it's misleading to compare MSRP when no customer is really paying that. Nissan is manifestly able to offer generous incentives on top of tax credits right now, so it's reasonable to infer that the LEAF has enough profit margin to remain in that range as the tax credit phases out. We'll find out in a month, but it also sounds like there are plans for a larger battery option to compete in the $30K category too. Tesla and Chevy also seem to be planning for MSRP adjustment after exhausting tax creditsand other manufacturers like Fiat and BMW seem to be aiming for a near-term change up or down price categories once their supply chains &amp; production have matured - right now it's best to chase maximum volume in the mid-market over the phase-out period, but over the next few years that will cease to be the case. In general, BEVs are priced very competitively in the mid-market compact category today and are squarely aimed at the subcompact and compact crossover markets in the next 2-5 years.",

This is a variable amount that *declines* over time the more people use it. \n\nIn order to be eligible for these incentives there are certain requirements..\n\nFor the Income Tax Credit you need: \n\n* to be a NYS Resident\n* Must have NYS tax liability\n* If you went with a PPA/lease you must have a 10yr+ contract\n* Must be your primary residence\n\nFor the NYS Rebate you need:\n\n* To be in NYS\n* Have losses less than 20% (if greater, incentive is lowered)\n* Be residential and less than 25kW (no incentive beyond 25,000 W AC)\n* Be commercial and less than 200kW (no incentive above 200kW AC)\n\nGood link on NYS Tax Credit: http://news.energysage.com/new-york-state-solar-tax-credit-how-does-it-work/\n\nGood Link on NY State Rebate: https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Funding-Opportunities/Current-Funding-Opportunities/PON-2112-Solar-PV-Program-Financial-Incentives\n\nA look at the current MW block for NY Rebate: https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Programs/NY-Sun/Megawatt-Block-Dashboards/CI-Dashboard",

As far as best value, I've heard that LEAFs are good leases because Nissan rolls the tax credit into the lease, lowering the cost... if you're in the US.  I don't know if they're currently doing that with the new '18 since there is a lot of demand currently.\n\nSo it will probably come down to personal preference of the cars you listed.  I've heard the i3's tires are pretty expensive, especially if you're in an area where you need snow tires during the winter.  They're a very odd size.  Some people have big issues with the Bolt seats, I can't remember if it's both the leather and cloth versions, or if it's just one of them.  Something for you to research, or go and experience for yourself.",

That is a grossly held misconception. \n\nIn fact unless you are where BYD was making batteries first, most automakers are finding it more economically and technologically superior to find a seasoned battery manufacturer like Panasonic, LG chem, Samsung SDI or CATL to partner with and build EV using their batteries &amp; cells. Nissan learned that the hard way from AESC.",

"comment": "I love my bolt. I was so excited for the EUV. Couldn’t wait to get a slightly bigger bolt with 150 charging. And then they did what I thought was impossible. Left it at 50. \n\nBut don’t worry they made l2 charging go up.... I’ve never even seen a l2 charger that did over 6.6 but I’m so glad the new EUV will be able to charge at 11 (or whatever the hell it is). Just getting a Tesla like I should have last time. Leave it to Chevy to create a great car, with a great battery, and put it in the ugliest body and slowest DCFC. They legitimately make an incredible EV at an insanely good price. A few tweaks and they could give Tesla a run. But no, let’s GM totally focus on making the hummer EV and keeping the bolt to a commuter only car. \n\nSorry for the rant, they just really piss me off.",

"comment": "Don't listen to the people telling you to take it to a backyard \"body shop\" and hide it from your mom's insurance plan. there are all kinds of sensors and wiring back there, it could be damaged, you have no idea. The structural elements could be compromised, etc.\n\nJust call her now, tell her without any delay. Be calm, start by telling her that you are okay, and that no one was hurt.\n\nyour mom will report the accident to her insurance, they will recommend a body shop, or she will pick her own. She will take it there, they will do an assessment and find all of the damage, do a quote, most likely it will be more than the deductible. She will pay the deductible and get her car back in \"as-new\" condition. She may ask you to help her pay the deductible, or if she is really nice, she won't.\n\nyour mom will handle all that. but just as a lesson for you in the future, always take your car to a reputable body shop (research it), and suck it up and pay your deductible. If you don't want a high deductible in the future, then pay a little more for insurance and get a lower deductible. It can be a good idea for a car that is driven a lot in cities with a lot of traffic.  If you decided to take the cheap route and try to attempt a home body/paint repair or someone's back yard \"body shop\" you may miss something crucial and it can come back to bite you later on. If later on you discover more damage, perhaps something electronic like a sensor, but the case is already closed, you are out of luck. If it wasn't on the initial assessment by the body shop, it will never get covered. If the shock absorbing materials are compromised, it could seriously jeopardize your ability to re-sell the vehicle. Many people underestimate the amount of damage that can be done to a vehicle even at low speeds. A Model Y is a really heavy car. The momentum, even at low speed, can be significant and the damage can be much more extensive than it appears on the outside.\n\nIf this was a stripped work truck/pickup with a burly steel bumper that just got dented, yea, who cares, don't report it. But any expensive, modern vehicle with advanced safety systems...needs to get seen by a legit body shop. Not to mention, only a legit body shop will give you a good paint job.",

"comment": "Absolutely, and more and more people are working from home all the time.\n\nReminds of the guy who posted about their household going fully electric after replacing their second car with an R1T.  (Other EV was model S I think)  Great, right?  Then come to find out in the comments that they had no kids and both worked from home.  🤦‍♂️  lol!  \n\nIt's like, of all the people that could have used that massive amount of battery cells to reduce their annual emissions, this household was pretty much the textbook worst case of needlessly sequestering about two tons of cells for ... who knows, 10-15-20 years...?  😂😂😟😟😭😭  These people rarely drive their vehicles!!  The irony is that people like this actually drive up the price of BEVs.  They're paying high prices to sequester a limited supply of cells, worsening supply shortages, and driving prices up.  \n\nThe 0-60 time craze has DEFINITELY been over hyped.  No one was demanding sub 4 - 5 second acceleration speeds in their daily commuters, and most would have been perfectly happy with an affordable EV that could do 0-60 in 7, 8, even 9 seconds like their previous car.  Acceleration just came as a side effect of longer range BEVs w/ larger batteries, allowing for higher energy discharge potential.  The OEMs offering long ranges with huge batteries leaned on the rollercoaster-esque 0-60 times to justify the high prices they needed to sell these vehicles at to make a profit... all while skimping on things like sound insulation, quality build practices, and high end materials that would normally come at these price points.  Ironically, in one brand's case, it was the cheapening out that helped them reduce weight in the vehicle that helped its 0-60 time!  🤦‍♂️ lol...\n\nEven shareholders got in on the action, going on forums and constantly creating pissing contests about which car could accelerate faster, and insisting the only spec that mattered when comparing cars is 0-60 and quarter mile times.  Right, it only matters when that particular car's specs on passenger comfort suck...\n\nIt's definitely rare for people to transition from a BEV to a PHEV though.  IMO, I wish the choice had simply never been given.  The government should have stepped in a long time ago and stopped prioritizing BEVs.  The EV credit and ZEV credit programs have been terrible for pushing customers to make nonoptimal choices; pushing them to buy BEVs with huge batteries / range that they absolutely did not need.  \n\nA few years back, some big name economists and politicians put out a letter stating that the best way to reduce global emissions rapidly was to implement an emissions tax that rose over time.  For vehicles, that would manifest as an additional gas tax.  To keep it from being regressive, we would refund the extra costs created from that tax to lower income people.  This would have allowed the market to work out what the best solutions were for reducing fossil fuel use and emissions.  And not just for cars, but for everything!\n\nHad this happened, I think demand for hybrids and PHEVs would have soared early on and it would have pushed OEMs to invest huge sums of money in a race for the best solutions to drive down fuel use.  Fuel use today would already be much lower.  It would have also put pressure on customers to use alternative modes of transportation, putting even more pressure on OEMs to drive down costs of efficient personal transportation.  Tesla would have never had a leg to stand on without the huge subsidies they'd received and favorable market conditions... and BEV adoption would have likely gotten pushed back another 10-15+ years AFTER battery tech had matured and we had a solid strategy in place for charging infrastructure and responsible cell production.  \n\nAn emissions tax and lack of tax credit would have also stopped all the (false) complaints about \"PHEV owners never charging their cars\".  First off, they wouldn't be getting subsidies to buy the car.  Second, high gas prices would require a person to be crazy (or really rich) not to charge at home.",

"comment": "I don't think so with US market. The EV infrastructure (non-Tesla) is still in infancy and have quite a lot of problems with it. A mass transition to EVs will be slow mainly for that reason. Tesla opening their superchargers to non-Teslas will hopefully help. But, there will be many many Teslas on the road in coming years, so I strongly believe that Tesla will figure out a way to repell non-Tesla EVs from their superchargers - either by opening up only a fraction of their network, or by charging an unrealistic price per charging session. \n\nNow, coming to PHEVs, it makes sense for most of the population who drive just 30 miles or less a day. Also note that  DC charging cost is nearly comparable to gas price(before all the gas price increase in recent months) during road trips for most comparable EVs and hybrid/phev vehicles. So, why should anyone bother waiting at chargers when they can fill it up in five minutes and be back on road with a PHEV/HEV. Needless to say charging infra is still not good - including Tesla -  in many US National Park locations. \n\nHowever, the scenario for 2025-2030 will be interesting. I believe that ICE vehicles will be quite low in numbers by then, mostly getting dominated by HEVs or PHEVs. If you saw the recent CRV update, they expect 50% of vehicle sale to be their HEV. So, it's the time for transition from ICE to more efficient HEVs and PHEVs. Personally, I feel that people will transition from HEV to EVs directly too since most automakers are motivated to transition to EVs quickly rather than sticking to PHEVs for a longer period.",

The only thing I’ve had to replace in the 8 years I’ve owned it are the 12V battery (twice) and the tires — both of which would have been replaced on the ICE version, too. Never had to pay for any other maintenance other than tire rotations. No oil changes, no fluid changes, no brake maintenance; nothing. I’d say the reliability is not much different, but the maintenance is, which is probably what you’re asking about. All cars are pretty reliable these days, but there’s no denying that EVs require less regular maintenance than ICEVs. \n\nI did run out of juice in both batteries once, which was the only headache I’ve had with this car because it took the dealer (and Ford EV engineers) a long time to “reset” everything and get it back into working order.",

Meaning they just take those incentives and inflate their margins with them. We even have examples of this going on long before the COVID supply shock.\n\nAt the end of the day, these tax credits are designed to benefit manufacturers and and dealers primarily. Hell, EVs have never even had a demand problem, so what point do incentives even serve other than inducing even more demand in an already low supply market? As you’d know through Econ 101 that induced demand inflates prices, and that price inflation benefits manufacturers and dealers, not buyers.",

"comment": "Translation:\n\nVolkswagen is working on a new platform that will form the basis for the majority of the Group's future electric cars. The Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) is currently scheduled to launch in 2028 - two years later than originally planned.\n\nAccording to Handelsblatt, VW brand boss Thomas Schäfer recently explained at an event relating to the SSP: ‘This is our new architecture, which we are planning to use from 2028.’ He is thus increasing the pressure on the developers, writes the business newspaper. Its editorial team was able to view internal VW documents, which are also said to show that the target date for the SSP is 2028.\n\nElectric volume models from brands such as VW, Audi, Skoda and Cupra currently use the modular electric drive matrix (MEB). The first large models based on the Premium Platform Electric (PPE) developed by Audi with Porsche have also recently been launched. An improved version of the MEB, the MEB+, is due to be launched next. There will also be an adapted version of the MEB for small electric cars, initially from VW, Skoda and Cupra.\n\nThe SSP future platform is to be used in all vehicle segments as an in-house development of the Volkswagen Group. The architecture should enable charging times of around twelve minutes and enable automated driving at level four, the preliminary stage to fully autonomous driving. According to the report, VW, Audi and Porsche are likely to use different variants of the platform. VW's commercial vehicles are also set to receive their own customised SSP offshoot.\n\nIt remains to be seen which car will use the new architecture first. At the last planning round in autumn, VW announced that the first vehicle to run on the SSP will be the former prestige model Trinity. This was to be built in Zwickau, Saxony, after a completely new plant in the Wolfsburg district of Warmenau was rejected. However, the plans have since been cancelled and Group CEO Blume and VW brand boss Schäfer have completely revised the concept, according to the report. Instead of a saloon, VW is now planning a self-driving crossover SUV. The next generation of the Golf, which is to be fully electric, is also to be based on the SSP.\n\nAccording to the Handelsblatt, the SSP architecture will continue to be based on the latest generation of software from the Group's own IT subsidiary Cariad. However, this is currently being reorganised from scratch and will be called ‘SDV 1.0’ in future. SDV stands for ‘Software-Defined Vehicle’ - the digital car of the future. A spokesperson for Cariad confirmed the relaunch of the electronics architecture to the business newspaper and explained that the company would fulfil the Group's delivery specifications.",

Every single one of these test don’t including the MSRP of the car\n\nAs soon as you add the MSRP the savings are gone.. the tesla ends up being more expensive. \n\nQuick math \n\nMsrp Toyota Camry hybrid is $28,080 fuel tank capacity of 13.2 gallons, MPG 51 city and 53 hwy. a full tank has a range of 663miles. It’s also much bigger car, midsize \n\nMsrp tesla model 3 LR dual motor $55,990 with a range of 358miles. 82kwh battery. It’s a compact car. Small car.\n\nI Will use 250miles as are anticipated mileage per day.\n\nTo achieve 250miles it will take 60kwh for the M3LR, (this is a rough estimate) if you do strictly supercharger, the cheapest rate in my area is $0.17 a kw, it will cost tesla $10.20\n\nTo achieve 250miles in a Toyota Camry hybrid, 5 gallons. Of Gas, in my area it’s $2.90 it will cost $14.50 to achieve 250 miles.\n\nTesla on average consumes tires fairly quickly, with all the information I found, it will be safe to assume at 30,000 miles you will need 4 new tires at a cost of $1,300 average. Alignment not factor in. \n\nToyota Camry tires with information I found on average will last 60,000 miles let’s be fair and say it cost $1,300 the same as tesla. \n\nTo travel 60,000 miles on a tesla would’ve cost $2,570.4 plus 2 sets of tires $1,300 for a total $5,170.4. Now add the MSRP of the car for a grand total $61,160.4\n\nToyota Camry 60,000 miles $3,654.0 and 1 set of tires, $1300, for a total of $4,954. Add the MSRP, for a grand total $33,034. \n\nNot including the time spent charging the vehicle, it’s costing you more time and money driving a tesla on average",

"comment": "&gt; So right now a lot of states have net metering. You get credited on a 1-1 basis for what you generate and do not use. Is that fair?\n\nThe article states:\n\n&gt;Under the proposal, a homeowner with a solar installation would buy all of their electricity at retail rate and then sell all of the energy they produce back to the utility at what's essentially a wholesale rate.\n\nThere are some semantics issues here that concern me. I understand that what a customer puts on the grid should not come back 1-1 at a later time. The question I have concerns the energy a customer produces and uses without ever exiting the home onto the grid. This power is not the same as the power fed to the grid with the expected future 1-1 return.\n\nThe way the article makes it sound you must pay them full price for the total energy used by your home, whether produced by you or not. You then get a wholesale return on the power output of your solar system, whether you consumed that solar power locally or not. If that is the case I cannot accept it. If the power you produce and consume on site, without ever entering the grid, is exempt from the 1&gt;1 ratio then I'm fine with it.",

"comment": "A lot of companies go with Enphase (especially leasing companies) because the electrical installation is easier and less technical. There is very little learning curve for an already established electrician to start installing Enphase. They can use romex. It's all AC residential wiring back to the service panel. The roofers just have to add the microinverters and cabling on the roof. Plug and play. No DC wiring. Very little extra 690 code issues. It's sort of like solar for dummies. Many contractors don't want to get into anything more 'advanced' due to a perceived learning curve. And that is how Enphase captured a large part of the market in a short time (also, leasing).  Why make solar more complicated? Make it easy, accessible and ubiquitous, in terms of installation. (Though, there are some esoteric installation points that Enphase recommends that I'm sure most installers ignore, like center tapping a string to reduce voltage drop). Have an easy product doesn't mean they had a superior product, from a technical standpoint. Though panel level production, and no minimum restriction on string sizing are big advantages, especially for odd roof planes and partically shaded areas)\n\nI am not in solar sales, and currently do not even work for a residential installer. While I do own some solar stock (including Enphase and Sunpower, but not SolarEdge, yet), I don't directly profit from my advice or recommendations in any way.",

Slightly outside the 5-6 year range, but that $250 a month and $30,000 system doesn't tell the whole story either, regardless, the payback is WAY better than it used to be and the FTC is still really important to helping the industry mature.  \n\nWhat kind of bill are we looking to offset?  A $250 bill in Texas where power is cheap is a LOT more panels than a $250 bill in California, where power is expensive.  $30,000 system with SunPower panels or using Enphase inverters gets you a lot less power per $ spent.\n\n&lt;Edit&gt; Sorry, you said $30k after rebates.  That seems to be a pretty expensive system, and I'd start looking at costs there.",

All of my experience in solar panels comes from living on a sailboat, but keep in mind that when your wire your panels in series they essentially become one panel. So if there is any shading on a single panel you can lose efficiency on all panels wired in that series. Assuming your charge controller will handle 24v at 450 watts you'll be within its capacity. Each 12v panel should be outputting about 17v in full sun. So you need to figure out your amperage draw/hour vs your potential amperage input/hour. That'll give you a simple answer of if your setup is sufficient.",

I have high watt loads that can be taking advantage of the peak solar panel output but with a full or near full battery it does me no good if I can't access the power.",

It gets worse towards the poles in winter time especially. From the battery link it's implied that energy density by weight is still rather low compared to fossil fuels so it becomes a difficult balancing act with solar cars, you have to have batteries but the more of them you add, the less range you get out of the stored energy. Then there is the issue of the solar panels themselves. While energy efficiency has improved, it's still under 50% even for the best experimental cells. Think about what that implies for the weight of the car, the kilometers per liter equivalent has to be in the hundreds so the weight has to be extremely low. This will limit the usefulness of the car, it won't be able to transport lots of people nor lots of cargo so even though the car could travel say 500 km in the sun, it can't transport lots of things as the range would drop drastically and it can't be fixed with more batteries since that would increase the weight and the surface area of the solar panels can't capture enough energy. \n\nCan such a car still be made and can it be useful? No doubt it can and it will be useful, however it won't be cheap which will mean it won't be mainstream. It's not going to be a family car, it won't be a company car, unless the company's activity is not time critical which is rare, it won't be an all weather car since heating and cooling is quite energy intensive, it would consume more than it can store or capture from the sun year round.",

"comment": "*Full disclosure: I think solar is actually a great retirement investment if you're fully aware of the downsides. Now I'm going to rag on solar as a retirement investment.*\n\n\nI've seen this concept of solar as a retirement strategy pushed by a number of residential installers and it honestly just comes of as a disingenuous method of framing a sale, and from the stuff I've seen, actually taking advantage of older people that don't honestly know what they're being sold. \n\nEven this article frames it as \"steady, increasing return similar to the high returns associated with traditional investments like stocks and bonds, but without the unpredictable fluctuations of those markets.\" While there is truth to that, people need to know that their investment is still completely at risk, and solar is far from safe when it comes to unpredictable fluctuations. \n\nJust look at Hawaii and Arizona, the utilities are fighting tooth and nail to shut down retail net metering ASAP. A homeowner that invested say $50,000 and was supposed to have a 6 year linear payback (6.2% return over 20 years) and is now looking at a 14 year payback because they're now just getting some time-of-use avoided cost savings and a wholesale export rate and their return is ~1.8% over 20 years. They would have been better off in a long term CD and have no operational risk. \n\nEven just energy prices in general, the age old \"electricity prices never go down\" that everyone touts its actually an outright lie. The \"real\" price of electricity has been about the same for the past 20 years, with any increases barely keeping up with inflation. \n\nThis is all assuming that you're buying 100% with cash as well. To even think of offering a PPA as some sort of secure investment strategy or even taking out a loan against it an absolute joke when framed as a retirement investment.",

"comment": "&gt; Solar and hydro are extremely complimentary as you can absorb the excess peak midday generation with pumped storage.\n\nThat sounds great in theory, but in practice is quite hard.\n\nAs I noted above, utility solar, and rooftop solar are all in different camps, and thus the ability to store energy from solar differs.\n\nIf one has a utility scale solar plant, and it's energy is not required right now, then that energy can be usefully stored, in pumped hydro, or super caps or Tesla batteries, all these approaches are used around the world today.  So for this case, then yes, storage works well.\n\nRooftop solar energy never appears as energy independently of other generation, as what it actually does is to reduce the load in the locality of where the rooftop PV is, and thus that generated energy isn't separately available to be stored once it gets past the export meter.  What it does is (ELI5 version) to reduce the demand on some specific parts of the generation system, and in New Zealand, these parts are mostly hydro anyway.  Thus if one attempted to capture this \"saved\" energy one would be using hydro energy to pump water up a hill, which (all things being equal) is not a smart thing to do, because there are round trip losses involved, so one may as well not burn the water in the first place and thus not suffer the round trip losses.\n\nNote that parts of this answer is New Zealand specific, other counties may arrange their distribution of generation tasks differently to how we do it here.",

"comment": "*Edit: I just put some photos in another response in this thread, if that's more interesting.  Get ready - it's messy.*\n\nYes, I'm in the US.  My system is a small, totally DIY, semi-off-grid system - it sells back a tiny bit through a grid-tie inverter, but ROI was not the goal.  However, I use Raspberry Pi's for various things around our small farm and my Wi-Fi infrastructure is very important, so I wanted that to be pretty much off-grid.  Then, we have a couple critical pumps in the house's heating system - the pumps for the hot water solar panels need to be backed up or else the water circulating through those panels could boil in the sun, and we also have a wood-fired boiler, which would have the same problem if there weren't backup for its pump to carry it until the fire died down (maybe 2 hours max).\n\nSo, my setup is just 400w of panel (with plans to expand to 800w in the spring), and 2x 100Ah lead acids, in series in a 24v system.  I have a couple little converters for 5v and 12v, so I'm providing DC to the Pi that runs everything (5v), the router (12v), the network switch (5v), the indoor Wi-Fi AP (12v), the outdoor Wi-Fi AP (24-28vDC direct from batteries), my 8tb NAS hard drive (12v), and a cell booster (5v).  Not to confuse things, but I also have a 13.8v converter for my main ham radio which likes to get consistent, alternator-voltage \"12v\" (&gt;13.5v with no sag on a 20A load), and a variable converter set to 16v to charge some of my handheld radios which mysteriously like 16v... long story.\n\nIn terms of grid interaction, the Pi can control a 110v grid-powered 24vDC battery charger to do regular 3-stage charging (controlled by the charger) at up to 30A, or single-stage \"power supply mode\" that I have set to about 27v.  That way, even if I need to disconnect the panels or if it snows on them and I'm not in town to brush them off, the batteries won't get low as long as there's grid power.  Most of the time, I can get away with keeping the charger off.\n\nThere's a 110v relay on the board to tell the Pi that the grid is up or down, and the Pi switches two 110vAC circuits - one for my office, so it can be a giant UPS for my main computer (if desired), and one for the basement where the pumps are. These two circuits can be individually switched to draw from the grid or from a 3000w pure sine inverter.  When I tell it to, or when the grid goes down, it turns on the inverter and transfers power.\n\nBasically I took a bunch of pretty modular components and built a DIY version of a high-end integrated inverter/solar charge controller/battery charger/grid tie inverter unit, and in the mix there are various DC voltages available for other stuff.  The advantage is that the inverter takes about 30w just to sit there idle, so if I can get all my loads on DC, the conversion efficiency is much better.  Unfortunately, my ISP won't let me use my own modem unless I downgrade to a residential account and give up my static IP, and their modem has no DC input.  So for now, when the power is out and I want the internet, I have to run the inverter. But the LAN is always up and has most of the stuff I absolutely need - all the Pi UI pages and ssh for the different installations, Plex server with shows and movies, etc.\n\nIn any case, the constant draws of all the DC devices (big radio off) is under 30w, so aside from the modem, it's all pretty balanced to not need any interaction with 110v grid power.",

"comment": "You say your utility gets your surplus electricity for free, does this mean they don't do net metering at all? So you don't get credit for any kWh that you export to the grid? And then you pay for what you use at night?\n\nIf this is the case (first off, that sucks), you may want to look into getting a Powerwall 2 battery in the future. This can timeshift your solar so you can use it at night and cloudy days. Yes you can try to time your electric car charging to when you have excess solar (as long as the car is not fully charged), ideally you can adjust the charging amperage to avoid exporting power to the grid, but this will require paying attention to your meter or installing some sensors on your circuit breaker. I use Neur.io to monitor my solar generation and house consumption and it works well.",

"comment": "&gt; whats to say this disaster wouldn't have happened anyways?\n\nThe Butterfly Effect firmly establishes that this specific disaster would not have happened anyways. But surely you're more asking a question like, \"Even in the pre-industrial age conditions, weren't there storms like this?\" Yep. Fewer. No one person can prove that their lung cancer is caused by smoking. No one person can prove that their personality was caused by being beaten as a child (or not so). No one person can prove that their diabetes was because of their lifelong dietary habits. No one storm can be proven to be caused by climate change. But patterns emerge, and we understand that the patterns help us understand not individual cases, but a tendency for cases to occur more frequently.\n\n&gt; Also isn't it easier to adapt to an ever warming climate as compared to a cooling one i.e another ice age as was predicted?\n\nMaybe? I dunno. Whether literal or metaphorical: can't more clothes always be put on when it's cold, and isn't there a limit to how much clothing can be taken off when trying to cool off in the heat?\n\n&gt; final question, would everyone in the world going vegan actually be enough to stop the climate change or would we have to stop everything we are currently doing in terms of transport, energy etc and revert back to the 1700s to actually make a difference?\n\nI dunno. Would everyone in the world going paleo actually be enough to stop diabetes? I think the answer is, \"Probably not, but it would put a hell of a dent in the frequency of incidents\". Also, there is a false equivalency here. It's not \"live like the 20th Century or revert back to the 1700s.\" It's \"Use renewable resources and don't emit as much carbon and carbon byproducts.\" Wind farms, solar power, and nuclear power are all options that weren't suggested in your limited question. Reducing emissions would help reverse the recent climate changes. The more reduction, the more reversal. It's pretty straight-forward.",

"comment": "Some of the replies are deleted, so I may be missing some pieces of data. But here's my input. 6V x 200Ah = 1200Wh x 8 batteries = 9600Wh. If you use 25% of that daily, that gives you 2400Wh a day to use. You don't say where you are, but since you are talking about a heated dog bowl, I'll assume it gets below freezing. That means your battery capacity drops in the cold. So your 2400Wh becomes closer to 2100Wh. Then figure losses for the inverter, and you've got around 1800Wh that you can use. That's running the 100W heater for 18 hours (100W x 18 hours = 1800Wh).  Or if you put it on a timer and run it less, you have some Wh left for the other loads listed. \n\nAs for configuration, I would suggest 24V, two parallel strings of 4 in series. As others have mentioned, 48V would be best, but as long as you use heavy wire and keep the lengths the same, 24V is fine. So that gives you a 24V 400Ah battery bank.\n\nAs Syonyk mentioned, you have to watch the charge rate of the batteries. A C/8 rate would mean 50A (400Ah / C/8 = 50A).  50A x 24V = 1200W of solar, before losses. Putting charge rate aside, if you want to figure out what size solar array you need to provide your 1800Wh a day, again, without knowing where you are, except that it gets cold, I'd guess 2.5 sun hours in the winter,  so 1800Wh / 2.5 sun hours / .6 losses = 1200W of solar! Hey, cool, that's what the batteries want. I love math!",

If you want to do that, you should draw this proposed system into a full set of plans and get a price for your BOM from a \"whole-tailer\".  That will save you money on hardware.  You should find a local electrician to do the work you don't want to do and who will charge you by the hour so he can't lose money and can pursue your goals w/o concern that they are at odds w his own need to make a living.  Likely you will save some money but you'll spend a lot of your own time accomplishing this project so what's that contribution worth.  You may find it personally gratifying.  (You may also find it frustrating.)  If you have more time than cash, then doing a great deal of the design and install work may be the right answer for you. \n \nMy guess is you'll appreciate the value solar contractors offer their clients more after completing this project than you do currently.\n\nFinally, my suggestion to you is to build the system around the existing SolarEdge Storedge system w lower cost 72 cell modules.  Given the system is ground-mount, using 72 cell modules will lower your install labor/watt and also lower your cost per watt of some things like optimizers and other BOS materials.  Expect at some point to have the 2 LG Chem battery system version of Storedge and build accordingly.  I realize this is not what you had in mind so likely you'll reject this input.\n\nLastly please note that solar plus storage writ large is going through a period of rapid development.  New products and technology families will be introduced at a rapid pace over the next 5 years.  If you don't have an imperative (or cash on hand) to over-invest in the storage part of this application you may want to start generating from solar (configure a grid-tied solar PV system sans storage) soon and punt on some of the energy management and energy storage aspects as new products will be introduced in the coming years that will obviate the quality and capacity of today's \"best of shelf\" products.  The new products will not only be better they'll be cheaper as well.",

Pretty sure we are using a net metering system. So the excess power is simply sold to PG&amp;E for 3-4 cents per kWh.\n\nIf our charging can be used as a credit, shouldn't we just take advantage of it as much as possible and will reduce CDPH overall utility cost?",

"comment": "We really need to be plastering the whole of the earth with solar panels and CO2 scrubbers.  This *should* be technologically solvable in 12 years, because the solution involves known technologies alongside metal processing volumes that humanity is theoretically capable of handling.  It's hard to come up with a way to solve the problem in twelve years that doesn't impoverish people.  For that matter, we'd need to reload governments around the world, because the current politicians don't seem to have the answers.\n\nIronically, I think we need a massive global expansion of the metallurgy and material processing industries.  Maybe even new mining operations.  Yet it can't be just any expansion - the production at the point and especially the downstream further processing facilities need to be specialized towards solving the problem.  Environmentalists are possibly the enemy of the answer here.  Plastering the whole of the earth with solar panels and CO2 scrubbers is going to be fugly, it will create its own more local environmental catastrophes, and it will not be good for hiking.\n\nHave scientists investigated the prospect of changing industrial processes in ways that are neutral with respect to climate, but have other externalities?  It'd be better to lose a bit of the Flynn effect with pollution that hurts people more than the planet, than to lose people anyways because the planet roasted.  No guarantee there's such a changeover waiting to be discovered... or for that matter that people would tolerate noxious non-greenhouse industrialization...",

I've gotten quotes from a couple companies, but each salesperson just spins things and I'm not sure which company to go with. I just want to be sure the panels will be installed well and work for a long time, but it's hard to know who is actually capable or best because online reviews are all over the place. \n\nSunRun isn't able to do a large enough system for us even though they quoted an overproduction at first. Trinity has the best pitch and price but doesn't email any numbers or proposals, so it's hard to compare their rates or feel comfortable. And Tesla is just a buy panels online then coordinate with the company over the phone, which isn't great, but it's Tesla, so maybe the big fish will have the most resources?\n\nAny recommendations for companies that do business in MA? \n\nThanks!",

In 2018 it showed we had a 80 per cent reduction in plastic bags use. Leading to 1.5 billion plastic bags reduction in the environment\n\nMy state uses 50 per cent renewable energy and i believe is projected to reach 100 per cent in possibly 10 years or less. 35 per cent of houses in my state have solar panels as of this year and its constantly increasing.\n\nLast week we banned single use plastics.\n\nMy point is its so important to see the minor steps in progress. Its so easy to completely fall into the trap of being lost in anger about idk the rise of the militarised police and just the general uneasy feeling in the air.\n\nI also suggest writing in a journal all your thoughts and frustrations.

They are largely stationary and free of intensive maintenance.\n\nSolar thermal is a single machine with thousands of individual moving components that have to work together harmoniously in order to operate properly. The system needs to be monitored and maintained by engineers and technicians at all times. \n\nSo, as cool as solar thermal arrays are, I dont think we will be seeing too many more be built. PV arrays almost always get built on schedule and within budget, and are modular, so if the company only has funds to build half the array, they can just stop there and the system will still work. This cannot be said about any other type of powerplant, including solar thermal.",

"comment": "It's not an overproduction problem if the goal of the batteries wasn't to be able to power the house for 2 days straight.\n\nIt's still a grid connected system, and any excess gets sent back into the grid. With just 1 battery so they don't lose their fridge/freezer full of food.\n\nIf someone has a 15kW solar setup, they don't HAVE to get 3x PowerWalls so that they can charge at 15kWh and use 100% of the solar generation, that's not the point.\n\nNewer smarter micro inverter systems are fixing this by allowing only the number of panels needed to produce power. If you have 30x panels on the roof, the power is out, and you are only using enough power to need 10x panel to charge your battery, then only 10x panels will produce.\n\nThe problem is that OP has just a string inverter, and no load bank.\n\nEven large solar sites have load banks for exactly this. During the day the huge solar farm is producing too much power, so the excess gets diverted to something like a huge water pump up to a reservoir. Then when power demand goes up, a hydroelectric damn is used.\n\nIf my needs are that I need 15kW of solar on my roof to get net zero, great. But then I want 1 battery so that if I lose power, I can use small stuff until power comes back on. No one should be forced to buy 3 batteries when they only want 1.\n\nNo different than someone installing a backup generator, but having it only power a small sub panel of important loads like the fridge, internet, and some lights, because they don't want a whole home generator.\n\nLots of people don't want a whole home battery, they want a backup battery for important loads. Not everyone is installing batteries to be 100% off grid where they charge the batteries during the day and use them at night, and never draw from the grid. Most people charge the batteries during the day, and still sell excess, and draw 100% of the battery every night.",

(Sunpower is actually the best but it’s expensive af so I wouldn’t even consider lol)\nOnly 2 brand of inverter are actually good good: enphase and solar edge. \n\nJust sign #1, I still can’t believe they can sell it at the price. I just showed my solar guy and he told me that they might be mistaken on that price. He’s a Rec authorized installer 🤔\n\n\n\nPs: Hold on a sec, I just realize that you calculated the 26% credit in before making the per watt price. We normally calculate the per watt price without taking out the 26%. So your Rec system is around $2.91/watt actually, which is actually higher what the quote that I got 29k4 for 10.73 Kw ($2.74). \n\nStill tho, that’s the best one in your area I guess.",

"comment": "The CPUC commissioner who wrote the entire draft proposal is very anti-rooftop solar. She’s also leaving for the EPA this month and being replaced by Newsom’s energy policy advisor. The incoming CPUC president, as far as I can tell, is not a utility/gas company shill. \n\nI don’t get it either. New homes are required to have solar and this will force everyone who buys a home built in 2022 to have expensive solar bills under NEM 3. Renters even have to pay NEM fees on apartment buildings build in 2023 or later. Say goodbye to anything resembling affordable housing. It is so crazy short sighted it is incomprehensible.\n\nAlso solar companies provide a ton of jobs and tax revenue. Seems like a weird time to attempt to destroy jobs and a tax base, given how much California is needing tax money. And those jobs won’t been entirely destroyed, many people in the industry will move to other states and take their jobs and income tax revenue and property taxes elsewhere. \n\nNot to mention with battery technology improving and new chemistries coming to the market, it will just incentivize people to install solar plus storage and not interconnect to the grid, keep all power on site while reducing or eliminating the power they use from the grid. This reduces grid stability and decentralization when utilities should be incentivizing it if they were nimble and forward thinking.",

"comment": "No I own a 9 year old Leaf for the kid to drive the range is down to 40 miles due to degradation, would try a Hummer or Rivian s/t if one came available. EV6 almost bought 2 months ago but the market adjustment here was a huge FU from the dealer who pulled that. I passed. If Aptera produces vehicles I’d consider one as a fun weekend toy.\n\nI just don’t like the idea sub 300 mile range vehicles at a price that is Tesla territory for a competitor to the model Y.\n\nWhen asked what are the top 3 worth the money EVs new 40-60k range… the answer has been and still is:\n\n1. Model Y\n\n2. Model Y\n\n3.  Model 3\n\nNot saying others aren’t good, but it’s currently watching the WNBA vs the NBA… it’s entertaining in its own way but it’s practically a different sport… (I don’t watch basketball really so it’s just a loose analogy). In time the top 3 list will change. (No that wasn’t a misprint and no it’s not there twice for the 2 different trims. It’s the best 2x before any number 2.\n\nDisclosure. I have Tesla Solar 5 Powerwalls massive array. Their price was the best by far. And it’s had lots of issues. I’ve had my issues with Tesla and I know their service for vehicles is pretty poor too…",

Instead, it is partially a power play by the public utilities to grab cash (i.e. reduce the net metering benefit). It is also a move to incentivize installing batteries with solar systems versus solar alone. NEM 3.0 will make selling back to the grid less beneficial for the solar owner, but having a battery will allow the solar owner to store the energy produced during day and use it at high peak rates night.",

"comment": "Portugal has high energy costs for a number of geopolitical and economic reasons that don´t look like they will resolve in the near future.  It is also very sunny most of the year.  It´s the beginning of springtime and the majority of our solar production is going back to the grid with no compensation.  Net metering is only just getting off the ground here and pays very little.  The previous owner built this system with the intention of adding storage, but decided to start over and build a new house before he got that far.\n\nKeep in mind that I´m not designing a new system.  I´m attempting to model the benefit of having X amount of storage (amp-hours) placed on an existing system with a known level of energy production and specific inverter limits.\n\nSo I can´t answer yet whether this system would benefit from having a crate full of LiFePo4 batteries and a charge controller wired together and plugged into its inverter.  \n\nBut if I knew the maximum amount of storage (amp-hours) it was capable of effectively supporting, I could look up the conversion losses and start plotting a curve of how much of the solar energy production it is wasting could be recovered for a given amount of battery storage.  \n\nI could then draw a second curve showing the energy costs recovered per battery storage amount.  And graph #3 would show how long it would take to pay for itself at the current cost per KWh.",

Im a licensed electrician who will hook up solar for diyers who buy the system and install their own panels.  I’ve done my own and several both large and small for folks over the years.  I am pro solar but I keep having this conversation with folks and basically it boils down to “where is your dollar best spent?”  My end realization is always in reduction of consumption, not offsetting consumption.  Local acquaintance my age is building their forever home with his family and I’m going to be wiring it.  He wants to do solar but net metering is dead in Indiana so fuck your money on any reasonable return on investment.  I told him, take the $30k you’d spend on a battery system with panels and put it in to insulation.  Building more complex systems that can break to increase efficiency instead of doing simple things that decrease consumption long term is always a losing proposition for the planet.  I like solar and for some people the money doesn’t matter but this quote is a joke",

I had a similar setup with 6.5kwh batteries, for under 10k (not in the US of course). The solar panels themselves are quite cheap, inverter comes next, batteries are most expensive, and labor depends on the location. So the bare costs of the equipment for your setup, including batteries, will go  under 10k. Tthe rest seem to be your installer profit and probably local taxes.",

There are multiple verification factors to sign up for solar , including needing your banking information for the autopay , a phone call with corporate to confirm you understand the agreement , a site survey prior to the panels ever being installed, and full disclosure about what the payment is . It takes about 1-2. Hours to review that and start the process, and all of those things would be easily verified by Sunrun. It’s bullshit posts like these that prevent people from saving ridiculous amounts of money by going solar .",

"comment": "With Sunnova you would be prepaying the lease, not buying it. So if you are looking at risk associated with Sunnova, paying monthly would be less risky as your interests and Sunnova’s interests are aligned. System works, they get paid. If you pay fully upfront, then you are relying on Sunnova being around long term and fulfilling their end of the agreement, but they already have your money. \n\nI wouldn’t be concerned about buying a house and assuming a Sunnova lease, that in itself is not a bad or good deal. We need to know the contract price per kWh the annual estimated production, what utility this is in and what their rates and net metering look like. \n\nFor example, if this is a lease charging 12 cents increasing 2.9% each year and you have Duke energy charging 17 cents and increasing much faster than 2.9% then you are better with the lease.",

The only option is a used or refurbished unit, which are hard to come by.  I was told by a major supplier that the newer Sunny Boy string inverters could be rewired to work with the system.  But in my searches no local installers are willing to take the responsibility in doing that. \n\nIn the end Sunpower finally opted to send out their crews and installed a used inverter.  And that took FOREVER! With Sunpower going under, I may be screwed if anything happens in the future.  Since now, not only is my original installer gone, but now the system maker is gone too.

"comment": "I too have two cats. They were abandoned and I consider them refugees. I don't think we should be bringing any new animals into existence for our use as pets though. Of course, no matter the origin, once you do adopt a pet you should keep it and take care of it as best as you can.\n\nHave you heard of Peaceful Prairie Sanctuary? They take care of rescued farm animals, including spent egg laying hens. Your comment made me wonder about what they do with the eggs the hens lay. I was happily surprised! Check it out for yourself : [www.peacefulprairie.org/faq.html#eggs](http://www.peacefulprairie.org/faq.html#eggs).\n\nI don't expect anyone to be perfect, but I do expect them to try to better themselves. While I don't think we will see an end of animal use as property in our lifetime, I do think great progress is possible. Think of how the conditions of people of different races or of women have changed in the last two centuries. Immense progress has occurred!\n\nI do think being vegan is the moral baseline. Just like how racism or sexism are not accepted anymore, I hope one day society will view speciesism as unacceptable.\n\nAnd as a distinction, I don't think people who aren't vegan are bad, I think their actions are bad. We all have plenty of things we can improve about ourselves, life would be boring otherwise. I have been turned on to veganism and have decided to adopt it. A lot of things I do are considered unacceptable by others. Some things I probably don't even know about. I certainly think it would be foolish to think one is a morally superior being based on a narrow standard like veganism, but some actions are clearly morally wrong.",

Then I tried it, it was gross, and I wondered why this even had to be made. Just to prove something to non-vegans? As another transition food? I mean, I kinda don't care about new products coming around but I feel like other products are much better than this. There's Gardein (I'm mostly just about the chipotle lime strips) and I guess faux chicken nuggets (don't really know what those taste like) and then Delight soy nuggets/patties and even more whole foods like seitan that can \"feel\" like chicken meat...and then, as you say, alternatives like tempeh or tofu in addition to seitan.",

The deal with a lot of good vegan food is that it's really fiber-filled and so you get full faster without as many calories. I once tracked my normal eating, what felt normal for me, and was pretty horrified when I got to dinner time and was only at 800 calories for the day (and trust me, I was NOT running around hungry). So track your calories for a few days and see where you're at. :)",

I think that a child definitely can be healthy on a vegan diet with the guidance of a smart vegan parent. \n\nHowever, I just think that historically, we have mostly been raised eating meat and we turned out fine - it's a pretty safe bet (especially if you don't include any processed foods in your diet) and would be much harder to fuck up than a vegan diet. \n\nIt would be sad to see a self-righteous parent not doing their research and just assume that their diet is just as healthy for their child as it is to them - which is clearly not true for either the omnivore or vegan. And now that I think of it, it's probably true that a vegan would do their research on the subject more so than an omnivore would simply because of the nature of veganism and the details that go into it. \n\nI'm just not a fan of early assumptions and there are many of them on the web. The more you say things without any information, the more that information will get buried and hidden from people to see. I'd like to be able to google - \"raising your child on a vegan diet\" and get a clear answer but all I get is a clutter of news articles arguing for either or without clear backing from research.. so who do I trust?",

It's more a refutation of the commonly repeated mantra that \"no culture or society has ever been vegan\" - a fallacious argument, as an appeal to tradition, but also untrue!\n\nOtherwise, it's true that in much of the world, meat is a privilege.  Our privilege in the \"first world\" is one of more choices.  Anyone, whether they buy packaged vegan cookies or a triple bacon cheeseburger, is \"taking advantage\" of this privilege.  So it is quite comical for us to be told, repeatedly, to 'check our privilege.'  To which I respond, 'I have.  That's why I don't eat other animals.'",

Aside from the animal kingdom being majority herbivores, this argument just doesn't work. When do you ever compare human behavior to animals? Cats copulate in the street - does that mean that's an acceptable behavior for humans? Dogs greet each other by sniffing one another's ass - does that mean it's ok for humans to do? Male lions will kill and eat cubs that are not theirs...sometimes even their own. It's not reasonable to compare human behavior to animal behavior in just one respect while saying that of course it's unacceptable to compare human behavior to animal behavior in all other respects.",

Furthermore, the fruit and veg we do like tends to be native to hotter climes.\n\nNonetheless I'm with you, I don't want meat-replacements, I want real food. There is a wealth of fantastic meals that one can make without animal products, Vegan food opens up whole new avenues of possibility, and other than allergies you never have to worry about cooking for guests irrespective of their background/religion.",

(Although, I am pretty sure other companies do similar things)\n\nFry up some onions, carrots, mushrooms, boil some sweet potato, broccoli and then throw in the curry paste with some coconut milk (please be very careful when buying coconut milk, most coconut harvested in Thailand are apparently using slave monkeys, so, not vegan) and put all the vegetables in there! And that's it!\n\nI also added cashew nuts, and some chickpeas to the whole thing. And boiled some rice to go with it!",

Typically it's used to make vegan meringues by whisking the aqua faba with sugar (although compared to egg whites it tends to deflate more easily from what I have seen. I haven't tried making it myself).\n\n\n\nThat's about the only use of aqua faba I've seen it used before but it could probably be used for egg white replacements in other scenarios too like making a vegan egg wash (used to create a glisten on top of some breads like brioche).\n\n\nFeeding it to your plants is a good idea as well!",

If I am being honest, though, I am not sure how much of that is determined strictly by genetics like classic male pattern baldness.\n\nWhat you are describing sounds like nutrient and or caloric deficiencies.  I find it helpful to plug a day into cronometer every once in a while to make sure I am not coming up short on anything.  You say you track and are fine nutrient-wise...what method are you using to track?  A lot of folks 'track' but really just eyeball things and guess, but people tend to be pretty inaccurate when using those methods.  \n\nYou also say that get regular blood tests.  What does your doctor think about all this?  If you are concerned about these symptoms you should probably make an appointment.\n\nFWIW, nothing you are describing can really be attributed specifically to a vegan diet.  It could be attributed to poor overall nutrition or illness, but those things can occur with any type of diet.",

Almost no sensation at all, even straight out of the fridge, so absolutely no concerns there. \nThey are very easy to administer. \nThey were *very* effective for me even on the lowest 0.25 dose - I lost 12kg/26.5lbs in two months - I was about 195lbs at 5'8\". \n\nNo side effects at all for the first month, maybe a little headache, but that could have easily been anything else causing it. \nSecond month I had some minor ones, and the third has been rough. Still only on the second dose (0.50).\n\nI've had horrible nausea and diarrhea, with bad stomach cramps when I eat certain foods - and I'm slowly learning what foods do it; in my case it's either things cooked in oil, onions, or anything higher in sugars - even natural. \nI've ruined days by being so ill. \nThis is why I'm stopping it now, as I can't bare the thought of being so ill over a food choice. \n\nMy other half has had a very similar story, both in weight loss and symptoms. She is vegan also. \n\nAre they worth it? Probably. If you really want to get rid of stuff you just can't. \n\nBut make a food diary - log everything - then hopefully you can work out what causes the symptoms if you have any",

As you said, monks don't choose their meals. He was vegetarian for 18 months or something, but became extremely malnourished because he just wasn't eating enough if I remember. That's why he eats meat now,  or rather just eats all that's available to him. \n\nI could be completely full of shit, but I was sure I read this in a interview somewhere.",

"comment": "&gt;what's it like?\n\nNot much has changed personally, although it can be a little frustrating when you're surrounded by people who don't \"get it\", doubly so if they're blase about it. You hear the same arguments a lot, and that can get old. The hypocrisy can be a bit much. Even among non-vegans, most people think factory farming is horrible. Most people also say that while buying meat left and right that almost definitely came from one of those places.\n\n&gt; How long have you been a vegan?\n\nI count 2 ways. \n\nSeptember 2017 is when I started cooking/ordering vegan in a restaurant, buying milk alternatives etc. I wouldn't eat meat but would consume things containing milk/eggs at other people's houses etc.\n\nJanuary 2018 is when I decided to go \"whole hog\".\n\n&gt;What made you become a vegan?\n\nA small weakness in my reasoning. Once I realized it was there a lot of my justifications for why meat eating was \"ok\" basically unravelled. After a little research, and realizing that I could be healthy/er on a vegan diet, I had no reason not to.\n\n&gt; Have you felt any changes in your physical and mental health?\n\nNothing miraculous, but I *do* feel better. For one, I don't have to try very hard to justify my eating habits now. From a physical standpoint, I do feel a bit more energetic. I don't want to give the impression that the change was more than it is. A lot of it is probably just that I can't go through most drive thru places anymore, and I pay *way* more attention to what I eat. I'm eating far more nutritionally complete than I was before.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons?\n\nPros:\n\n* because I have to pay attention to nutrition, I eat better\n\n* my actions better align with my ethics\n\n* much less environmental impact\n\n* lower cholesterol, smaller chance of heart disease etc\n\n* generally cheaper\n\n* learning new and interesting recipes and cooking methods\n\n* exploring new foods\n\nCons:\n\n* Constantly fielding questions. I like being an advocate, but just by it's nature it's a topic that might come up anytime food is discussed, which means I have to be prepared to talk about it to some extent, whether I'm in the mood or not.\n\n* Unsupportive people. My wife is very good about this, and that's been really great. My father thinks it's a \"lifestyle decision\" and likes to \"poke fun\" by suggesting that my vegan food would \"be good with ham in it\". I know my dad, he's trying to be funny. But just for context, I never watched the infamous slaughterhouse footage until I was already vegan. The sound of pigs in a gas chamber will never leave me. So I just can't find those things funny and that can be very hard to explain.\n\n* Many vegans have had that time they had to eat fries for dinner when invited out. Or that other time, when they had water and a plain side salad because the restaurant fries everything in beef-fat.",

I’m also a sophomore who wants to go vegan but can’t because my parents force me to eat meat and other animal products. I usually have to eat meat at least three times a week and if there isn’t any meat on the menu there’s at least something that contains butter/eggs/milk. I recently tried talking to my mom about it, and it didn’t help much. She was understanding but said I needed to eat animal derived products in order to live a healthy life, and also she thinks that God created certain animals for us to eat. If you want to talk you can message me any time but I’ll head to school now so I won’t be able to reply until I get back home. I hope everything goes well for both of us.",
