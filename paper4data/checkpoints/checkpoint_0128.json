With that, it's powerful enough to either power the car 100% ... so if you're driving 80mph down the interstate, you're powered... \n\nbut, if you're around town, in a city, whatever, it still runs at '100%' but, whenever it *isn't* powering the car, it's charging the batteries.\n\nwhenever the batteries are charged to a preset point (25% 50% 100%, whatever) the thing automatically turns off again. \n\nif it runs out of fuel? just pull into a gas station and fill it back up.\n\nand, if you're on a trip or something, have it so that it can be disconnected from the vehicle, and locked in such a way that 1) it can be tracked... like onboard gps or something 2) is as secure as any locked car broken down on the side of the road 3) has a computer system that only works with the key and/or password or something .... that way you can leave it parked somewhere (probably a motel or wherever 'storage arrangements' can be made... maybe that type of car's dealership's parking lot??\n\npoint is, the car is 100% electric, but... with the added convenience of having (available) a petro-fuel range extender.   The engine would be much more efficient than a car engine... stop &amp; go traffic sucks, and the variability of car engines is a major contributor to their inefficiency. .... an engine with a 'single gear' (no real need for a 'gear' but you get the point) connected to a generator.... \n\n...the computer in the car controls the whole thing (think a tesla's screen here).... or... give it a smartphone app control system... control it from a webpage, etc etc.\n\n...and, best of all, add it to the financing of the car upon purchase... or, later if need be. like, buying an extended warranty for something: usually they give you a week, two, a month.. something like that to come back and add it at a discounted price, otherwise you pay more.\n\nobviously driving around with a trailer sucks, esp on a trip... but it wouldn't be a full sized trailer... like a two wheeled thing. I mean... how much space does it really take to cram a small 25hp? engine and a generator with a fuel tank into? .. hell, they could sell them in different, potentially even 'extendable' sizes... with extra storage space... for luggage, groceries, whatever.\n\n\nthe point is... around town, range anxiety isn't really an issue. I mean, hell, at home you can charge up to full capacity every night... possibly at work too, if conditions allow... and, for a Tesla, this is over 200 miles even for the lowest model\n\nit'd be like filling up your car with gas every night....  200 miles is 4-5x the average american's daily commute so...   it's the 'road trips' that become the issue, and, well... that's where your 'anxiety' comes in towards owning one... and... where my idea of a range extender trailer\n\n... come to think of it, why even buy one? why don't the dealerships just set up a 'rental program' for them... i mean, anyone that has a 'driving job' obviously is less likely to buy an ev anyway... (for now)... so, the few times the average person goes on a road trip?\n\njust set up the account, go to the dealership, swipe your card, pick up your unit (color matching of course).... and... go on your way. make the entire thing automated so it can be done 24/7, as well with no human intervention. \n\nthe renter is given a discount for agreeing to sign up to the program 'within the first 30 days of owning the car' ... the additional payment for program sign-up built into the loan on the car, of course...   ...and there's a basic rental fee, like a flat cost for renting it, then charged on a 'per hour' usage kept on an internal clock on the trailer itself\n\nthe point is... freakin' range extender trailers! however they set up a business model around it, the idea is... you can power/charge your car with a standard ICE on the road... and with all the convenience of the next gas station for more fuel","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.004488297179098784,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2307810243341919,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2840031738109481,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.24162028745180122,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.269608314796695,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3050795899942412,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15864708428013857,"ev_1":-0.27723648954966074,"ev_2":-0.04478390453490041,"ev_3":-0.18796978459189026,"ev_4":-0.24548151013247357,"ev_5":-0.15182627737522125,"ev_6":-0.14661977624372624},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

That’s a cold fact.  I won’t cite a bunch of statistics (that may [seem encouraging](https://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/electrictransportation/Documents/FINAL_EV_Sales_Update_April2019.pdf) but actually are not). Just look around you. \n\nAyep.  Don't pay no attention to them lying statistics and charts and so-called \"facts\".  Use your common sense instead!  Look around you!  There's still lots of gas cars on the roads.  I guess that puts all this EV nonsense to rest, doesn't it?\n\nDespite that funny beginning, the article. . .  Most of it is actually not bad.  He throws out a lot of little tidbits and observations that are right on the nose.  He notes that EVs are better cars in lots of ways, and that people who have one aren't going back.  It's just hard to get that message across to the majority of people who really aren't interested in cars (of any kind) beyond what's needed to get from A to B, especially when the car they've already got is doing that.\n\nHe believes that Tesla are doing it right, and it's other car makers that are dragging their feet.  He acknowledges that there will, at some point, be a tipping point when the masses go for electric cars \"when it becomes a FOMO thing\", Fear Of Missing Out, or fear of being left behind.\n\nSo why the negative tone to this article, when the actual message, if you read closely, is more nuanced and more of a mixed bag?  Why does the author see this glass as half-empty?  Part of the reason might be. . .   Forbes.  I mean, their editorial stance does seem to be generally negative on EVs, that's kind of what they want.\n\nPart of it also seems to be a misunderstanding of the car industry, the scale and time frames upon which it operates.  Cue up a metaphor about steering the Titanic.  It's not as simple as flipping a switch and suddenly there are electric cars streaming off the assembly lines.  When you're talking about the mass market, millions of affordable cars, that is something that can't be shifted quickly, and our existing car companies are poorly equipped to handle it.\n\nIn other words, the transition to EVs is going about as fast as it possibly could, and if you imagined it could happen faster then you just didn't understand how all of this really works.  And, for the most part, it's not consumer demand that's the bottleneck for EV adoption.  I mean for example: whenever Tesla bring new production lines up to speed, that's when their sales numbers shoot up.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.15776953652438852,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13026225234700634,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2569802695466302,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.29347468922644476,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.35250132889979413,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.31186796920770243,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.03190415988986691,"ev_1":-0.11312339852663948,"ev_2":-0.05590737816601177,"ev_3":-0.009060372777942879,"ev_4":-0.2601445883968457,"ev_5":-0.04076241718333525,"ev_6":-0.13373998482224891},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

The core of the dispute was the designation of the driver assistance system with which the defendant equips its vehicles as standard equipment as an \"autopilot\" and the advertising of individual components that can be booked separately under the heading \"Full potential for autonomous driving\".\n\nThe contested text integrated into the order process for the \"Model 3\" vehicle on the website of Tesla Germany GmbH was in July 2019:\n\n&gt; **Autopilot|Inclusive**\n&gt; \n&gt; - Enables automatic steering, acceleration and braking, taking into account vehicles and pedestrians in its lane.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Full potential for autonomous driving**\n&gt; \n&gt;   - Navigate with autopilot functionality: automatic driving on motorways from entry to exit, including motorway intersections and overtaking slower vehicles.\n&gt;   - Automatic parking: parallel and right-angled parking.\n&gt;   - \"Summoning\": Your parked car will find you in parking spaces and come to you. Incredible but true!\n&gt; \n&gt; **Until the end of the year:**\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Traffic light/stop sign recognition with automatic stop/start\n&gt;  - Automatic driving in urban areas.\n&gt; \n\"You can also purchase the function package for autonomous driving after delivery. However, the price is likely to increase over time as new features are added.\nThe currently activated functions require active monitoring by the driver - autonomous operation of the vehicle is therefore not possible. The activation and use of autonomous functions, on the other hand, require proof over billions of kilometers driven that their reliability far exceeds the capabilities of human drivers. In addition, autonomous operation requires legal approvals, which may take even longer depending on the jurisdiction. In the course of the further development of these self-driving capabilities, your vehicle will be continuously updated and upgraded via mobile radio.\"\n\nIn the opinion of the Chamber, both the advertising statement as a whole and the elements separately attacked by the plaintiff constitute misleading commercial acts pursuant to Section 5 (1) sentence 2 no. 1 UWG. According to the Board, the use of the relevant terms and wording gives the relevant public - in this case, average consumers - an idea which is not in line with the facts. In fact, both the Tesla autopilot and the package 'Full potential for autonomous driving', which can be added, are components of a driver assistance system in which a journey without human intervention is not possible. By using the term \"autopilot\" and other formulations, however, the defendant suggests that its vehicles are technically capable of driving completely autonomously. Furthermore, the impression was created that autonomous vehicle operation was permitted under road traffic law in the Federal Republic of Germany, which was not the case under the applicable provisions of the StVG (Paragraphs 1a f of the StVG). The reference made by the defendant at the end of the website does not remove the misleading impression due to a lack of clarity and transparency.\nThe judgement is not final.

What is the basis for such apocalyptic predictions? \n\nCertainly most people’s lived experience is that the climate has not changed much. In the U.K. the winters are still dark and cold and the summers lighter and warmer. The data support this impression: Since the Industrial Revolution, the temperature of the Earth has risen by less than a degree. In fact, XR’s predictions of doom and gloom are based on the results from scientific modelling of the Earth’s climate. But can we really expect the people of the world to change their way of life because of the predictions of a small number of scientists and their models?\n\nDuring the pandemic, scientific modelling predicted that deaths from Covid would be astronomical unless we went into lockdown. Our Government, and many others throughout the world, ‘followed the Science’ and the subsequent lockdowns caused, and are still causing, immense suffering. However, some countries did not impose lockdowns and so we now have actual data to judge the accuracy of the modelling. In Europe we can compare excess deaths in Sweden, which did not impose a lockdown, with excess deaths in other European countries, which did impose lockdowns. The excess deaths in Sweden are similar to these other countries. We see the same pattern in the USA where some states locked down and some didn’t. Again, the excess deaths are similar in both groups. In other words the predictions of the scientists and their models that there would be astronomical numbers of deaths if lockdowns were not imposed were wrong. The number of deaths was more or less the same whether lockdowns were imposed or not.\n\n➖ If scientists and their models cannot be trusted to predict the spread of a virus a few weeks ahead, then how can they be trusted with a far more complex problem, to predict the evolution of the Earth’s climate a few decades ahead?\n\nUnfortunately Boris Johnson, having ‘followed the Science’ down the wrong turning of lockdown, was undaunted and proceeded to ‘follow the science’ down the wrong turning of Net Zero zealotry. He committed the U.K. to a rushed and half-baked Net Zero programme. \n\n➖ Electric car sales in the U.K. are already increasing but by 2030 Boris Johnson proposed a total ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. This will cause hardship. \n\nOther major countries are not proposing bans on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars until much later: 2035 in the case of China, Germany, Italy, Japan and the USA; 2040 in the case of France and Spain; and not at all in the case of India.\n\nEven if the U.K. were to achieve these ambitious Net Zero targets there would be little impact on Global Warming because countries with far bigger carbon footprints are moving much more slowly. \n\nThe U.K. only produces 1% of the world’s CO2 emissions, China produces nearly 30% and is not intending to make any reduction in CO2 emissions this decade. More generally, the developing world produces 63% of the world’s CO2 emissions and the leaders of most of the countries in the developing world have been clear that achieving Net Zero is low on their list of priorities. Their primary goal, quite understandably, is to improve the living standards of their people, their housing, healthcare and education.\n\n…..\n\nLet us hope the next Prime Minister will abandon the Net Zero zealotry of his or her predecessor and instead adopt a more balanced policy. Firstly, be mindful of the limits of scientists and their models. The models may accurately predict the direction of travel – the more CO2 emitted the more the Earth will warm – but the magnitude of any temperature rise is highly uncertain. Secondly, remember that there are two words in ‘global warming’ and the first is ‘global’. So the U.K. should not reduce its CO2 emissions at a pace faster than other countries, particularly those that are major emitters.\n\n[Net Zero Watch Has Warned Conservative Candidates Jostling for the Party’s Leadership That Any Pledge to Continue With a Business as Usual Approach to Net Zero Will Lead to the Worst Energy Cost Crisis in British History](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/vx9osb/net_zero_watch_has_warned_conservative_candidates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19754561440398297,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20155780590670397,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2590286777224167,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19504998302242407,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1020846851170063,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1555944395562013,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1845755253762036,"ev_1":-0.1980846864299375,"ev_2":-0.2680432950071413,"ev_3":-0.31524633926023027,"ev_4":-0.26171744900946886,"ev_5":-0.17167635721871158,"ev_6":-0.315174949971376},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro.

If all this works as expected, it could be a useful compromise. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1aqmor4/first\\_ever\\_handson\\_with\\_the\\_2025\\_ram\\_ramcharger/kqmwail/?context=3","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005035164916383413,"1.1.1_stance":-0.15822263538851758,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20456769912010211,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2745918695297419,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18976928882333455,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26074265601301677,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.10350204810189705,"ev_1":-0.12416620945412778,"ev_2":-0.2749214133703693,"ev_3":-0.13168639516236277,"ev_4":-0.06301217204115044,"ev_5":-0.023651474689055856,"ev_6":-0.14327885447393782},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Your neighbor's solar panels might be Centex, [which was recalled](http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2014/Centex-Homes-Recalls-Solar-Panels/) for causing fires.\n\n2. Even without a specialized module, a faulty module could dump the entire string's power into the ground. Often it's a faulty junction box - a 3rd party component of the typical solar module. Such was the case for [BP Solar](http://www.law360.com/articles/507827/home-depot-bp-face-class-action-over-faulty-solar-panels).\n\n3. Even without a faulty module, an uninterrupted ground fault event could occur. This particularly applies to solar arrays with many circuits -&gt; such as a residential thin film array. A ground fault occurs, but not one large enough to trip the fuses or inverter protection system (which has to make increasing allowances as # of circuits increase). If the problem runs unabated, laterm it will inevitably cause additional faults which turn the inverter off. The problem is that depending on where the faults are, you could force an entire system's worth of power down the face of a single source conductor from a single string. It isn't sized for that, burns up, and you're on fire. [Here we go](http://solarprofessional.com/articles/design-installation/the-bakersfield-fire-a-lesson-in-ground-fault-protection/page/0/1).\n\n4. There's bad design. It's common to perform wire sizing calcs with 90C ratings only to land onto 70C terminals. A designer might not realize a -ER weatherproof rating is necessary, and instead go with a standard cable. \n\n5. Then there's normal wear and tear (squirrel/weather damage). \n\n6. Then you get into how the design might impinge a firefighter's ability to fight the fire effectively. If you don't have proper clearances, they just might show up and let your house burn down.\n\nFor all these reasons, higher fire rating standards are being pushed to the industry. Module-level electronics significantly reduce fire risk, and updated to NEC essentially mandate them in most rooftop designs. Additionally, more module manufacturers - particularly solar shingles - are seeking Class A fire rating certification.\n\nSo no, solar fires are not common. However, the topic needs to be given more attention - particularly by installers who think it's no big deal.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00045561578978473943,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05953784641005626,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21669938535874142,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2495473534114073,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1256720200168123,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.15044035017062357,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19752193801105022,"solar_1":-0.03637161817459855,"solar_2":-0.1588812071853075,"solar_3":-0.21906717603390766,"solar_4":-0.2057224908439821,"solar_5":-0.03075397736756713,"solar_6":-0.239615171392831,"solar_7":-0.011751912320808819,"solar_8":-0.038737909967797655,"solar_9":-0.061646864444256266,"solar_10":-0.2843388090049392},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

It always includes the difference in taxation between what climate advocates think it should be, and what it actually is.\n\nFor example, if apples cost $1 with tax, but climate advocates believe apples should have an additional $9 in taxation, apples would have a $9 subsidy when calculating \"post tax subsidies\".\n\nOther versions of \"post tax subsidy\" will include the *entire US military budget*, under the theory that it only exists to protect fossil fuel revenue.\n\nNow if you remove these \"post tax subsidies\" and only consider \"pre tax subsidies\" which is the difference between the cost to produce the goods, and their market cost, its less than zero, because coal is taxed, not subsidized like solar power or wind power, where the government pays part of the cost to make it cheaper for the consumer.\n\nIf you go by \"pre tax subsidies\" only, then 99% of those subsidies in fossil fuels are petro-dictatorships like Venezuela and Iran selling gasoline for pennies at the pump, instead of selling it at the market rate.

Energy storage, which is equally applicable to anything from cars to houses to factories. They are leading the way in transforming the grid from a centralized behemont to a massively distributed energy storage and generation with products like powerwall, powerpack and solar roof. The cars are just the gravy. \n\nThe reason they give so much hope is that's if they can pull a growth rate equivalent to the adoption of the iphone in the telephone industry then the very worst might be avoided. They just have to do it before the Arctic collapses. \n\n2. I'm thinking of this [particular technology](http://www.climeworks.com/co2-removal/) but I've seen others. The problem is that to make the technology I linked work we will need millions of these machines and they must be solar or renewable powered. That will be expensive and take time to build.  Many would say that I'm being naive to think that this technology will ever grow large enough to solve the problem, and they have very good points.

You don't have to be faster than the bear, you only have to be faster than the slowest in the  group. Here is how I think you can gain that advantage:\n\nFirst energy independence. If you can generate your energy you will be at an advantage  to people that depend on the grid. You don't have to get a full off-grid system. You can build energy independence small steps at a time. \n\nSecond water. You must have a secure water supply. If you have access to energy, then you can get water out of thin air.\n\nThird food. Learn how to grow food or at least learn how to make your food last longer. Have a few months worth of food reserve.  \n\nFourth. Friends and neighbors. Make allies of trusted friends and neighbors. Share vulnerabilities and strengths with them. Make plans for whatever vulnerabilities your area might have. You don't have to prepare for a zombie apocalypse. Preparations for common fires, floods, drought or whatever vulnerabilities your community may have will probably be enough and a good idea anyway.\n\nFifth. Awareness.

The problem the OP has is his solar system is undersized for his production, by 30%.  Tesla suggested he get a battery to 'close the gap' on this 30%.  Since I am hoping both Tesla and the OP are aware that batteries don't **make** power, they only store it, we are looking at how they plan to get 30% of their bill through arbitrage.\n\nEXCEPT.  As mentioned in my previous post, we have 3 issues I can revisit again:\nA:  Arbitrage is charging your battery with cheap (or free solar) power, and selling it during expensive times.  'Gaming' the billing structure, as it were.  \n\nThe OP's TOU expensive (peak) times are when the sun is shining.  So there's no monetary benefit to using the battery to move solar power from the peak times to the off peak.  He's better off just selling any excess power when it is being generated.\n\nSo, if you are charging from the grid instead of the solar (the only way it would make sense for a customer with an undersized system), you lose the 30% solar tax credit on the batteries.  It is explicit in the law that the batteries have to be charged exclusively from the solar system in order to qualify for the credit.\n\nI'm all for arbitrage - I've had to design our entire sales strategy around selling batteries due to the local utility switching everyone to TOU.  But our TOU rates have been pushed to when solar slows down - 4PM and later.  \n\nBut here's numbers, if you have to use them:\n* Your $897 number looks fine, let's use that.  \n* Let's assume efficiency at 92.5% for a round trip storage.  That number drops to $829.  \n* Let's be generous and say that the battery only drops to 90% capacity over the first 10 years on average - keeping in mind it is VERY likely to be CONSIDERABLY more.  That takes us to $746 savings per year.  \n* A $10,000 install, financed at 6% over 20 years, is a total cost of $17,194.  That gives a payback of 23 years.  On a 10 year loan, the payback drops down to just under 18 years.\n\nThere's a LOT of variables we don't know but my point is to be very cautious of running the first iteration of the numbers and drawing a conclusion.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00022318478780410564,"1.1.1_stance":-0.027641376750807467,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2045012388800682,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11092609725892544,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1641065325766249,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21556211262584193,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22098449571058154,"solar_1":-0.010030274221207947,"solar_2":-0.0018458974906631436,"solar_3":-0.0015078503359594226,"solar_4":-0.018009845842849852,"solar_5":-0.0003199333453570337,"solar_6":-0.0002069276506517781,"solar_7":-0.0005262308513920289,"solar_8":-0.0006227385965758003,"solar_9":-0.07184268799998487,"solar_10":-0.001480413736620297},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

Since you're running your load 24/7 and the sun doesn't shine 24/7 obviously the batteries come in as a buffer. The solar needs to charge, at a minimum, all of the capacity that was drained during times with no sun. \n\nYou're drawing 625W 24/7, so \\~15000Wh (15kWh) daily. Without even taking any efficiencies or losses into consideration, assuming that you have 5 \"good\" solar hours a day ([look up here](https://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-information/sun-hours-us-map)), your array will have to produce those 15000Wh within that timeframe at a minimum. So, your 1710 W solar array should probably at least be double in size. If this is operating in the winter where the sun is low and weak, that \"good\" sun window might be closer to 2 or 3 hours. So your array might even need to be closer to 7kW.\n\nThis is the bare minimum to not destroy the batteries over time. \n\n&gt;If 2 arrays output an average of 100-115V, that doesnt mean they are outputting \\~8A at all times, correct?\n\nShort answer, no. Long answer, no. From an idealized scenario, the array will basically operate at a fixed voltage based on temperature, with the amperage varying basically linearly with the intensity of the sun. [Here](http://suniva.com/documents/Suniva%20Optimus%2060%20Black%202015%2006%2025.pdf) is the specsheet for your module. If you look on the bottom left of the second page there is a IV curve which basically just shows the current going up as radiance increases. The circled dot is the Max Power Point.  Now, once you add the charge controller into the mix, the voltage from the solar will constantly be modified by the controller in order to try to maximize the power output based on that curve with the amount of irradiance you have. The only way to know how much current is outputting at any given time is basically knowing how much the sun is shining. \n\n&gt;With 2 arrays, each on one controller, can I expect the amperage going into the battery bank to be additive of the controllers? (48V 12amp from each controller = 48V 24amp from both controller received by the battery bank)\n\nYes. The current from the individual controllers will be additive. \n\n&gt;What should the High Voltage Disconnect setting of the batteries be? I can't find a spec from the battery manufacturer in regards to this.\n\nI'm actually not too familiar with this, but you shouldn't be going over the rated absorption voltage of the battery bank which should be &gt;60V for your array","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.003367137862369418,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22573261580207685,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18560519199180447,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1413863409931461,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.0955599879807256,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2657383535717868,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11141992638771778,"solar_1":-0.10951649633994077,"solar_2":-0.06466053315293319,"solar_3":-0.0598184925357417,"solar_4":-0.0196309409918272,"solar_5":-0.0509008682073662,"solar_6":-0.07216863145974155,"solar_7":-0.040934558688372626,"solar_8":-0.14948612715428075,"solar_9":-0.019715750143205923,"solar_10":-0.24120298578159058},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

The goal is not to keep the car at 68. The goal is to keep the plastics from cracking, right? Keeping it under 100F and keeping the humidity down would do that just fine.\n\n&gt; Much of the power goes to the fans required to move air through the radiators, as the car is not moving down the road.\n\nNo, most of the electricity goes to the pump. Moving air is only about 20% of the electrical load on an automotive heat pump. Put up some sun-blocking shades, and that is NOT a challenge. First of all, there are no conversion losses from AC to DC - even my 8000btu window unit draws no more than 240-340W max while converting. Yes, moving air is expensive, unless of course the airspace is 88 cubic feet like a model S. A typical 300W-ish power source will cool 350 sq.ft. with 8 foot ceilings, which is uh... about 2800 cubic feet if well insulated. A car is not so well insulated, but given that the volume of a car is 3% of the volume an 8000btu air conditioner can cool, we can clearly get by with a less powerful heat pump.\n\nAdd in the fact that a large amount of the sun's energy that would otherwise be converted to heat is now being converted to electricity, so the car is actually not going to get as hot in the first place. If they are designed properly, there will be a minor air gap between panels and the roof of the car allowing them to cool when parked.\n\n2) Correct, regulatory hurdles suck. Wrong though about \"1500W is not enough\". It's not enough for you to run your entire house.  Duh. The home charging would be supplemental. Is it difficult to understand why someone would want to reduce PART of their electric bill? 1500W is more than enough to reduce bills, especially if the homeowner has net metering. It would also keep a refrigerator running in a blackout. You should really price the car as if it is a portable generator, because it can fully serve that purpose in addition to transportation.\n\n3) You made some good ... ish points about dings from driving, but those concerns are easily answered with deflecting material and/or shapes that resist that sort of damage. And of course it sure is cheap to make windshields. If it were mass produced, replaceable layers of tempered glass could cover the entire vehicle for less than a few hundred bucks.  A windshield for a Dodge Neon is around $100 these days, and they don't even make them anymore.\n\nAnd yes, if there is anything we agree on, solar roads are hilariously stupid.

I think no matter what centralized generation has major advantages from the efficiency of scale perspective and also advantages in the utilization of whatever resource gets invested. For example if you truly wanted to live off grid them you would need to greatly overbuild your solar and battery system. The resources used in distributed to power 10000 homes will probably power 20000 homes or more because the utility will better spread generation around and need to oversize much less to deliver the same amount of reliability. Reliability in most places will be much better as well because you have a diverse mix of generators.\n\nThink about it this way, for your home use you will probably have a 100kwh hour battery and a 20kw inverter and the inverter you will be operating at 2kw or less most of the time and the battery you won't be fully cycling because you dont need to. So you have overpaid for generation because you might need all that capacity. Utilities on the other hand will fully use every MW and MWh they invest or else they go out of business. And they get their resources cheaper than you can\n\n So it will always be that outside of major subsidies users that go distributed will pay significantly more per kwh than users buying through the utility. Any cost scaling that benefits distributed will also benefit utilities much more as well.\n\nDo the math and see how many kWh you will need from both your house and your car to get the 99.9% uptime the grid gives you. You take for granted the ability to just plug in whatever load you want. If you truly lived off grid you'd stress all the time if your state of charge is sufficient to run your hvac or charge your car. If you were committed to go off grid then you need a generator in the mix and this starts to be a giant pain \n\nYou might cover 90% of your needs with a $50K system but that's laughable by grid reliability standards so people that aren't true believers will always need grid backup.\n\nIf you get a 5KW $50K system that gives you 25kwh a day and the system lasts 15 years you will have paid 36c/kwh, which is a big loser.\n\nFor the ev cases how the heck are you gonna be off grid? If you drive 40 miles a day you need 15kwh of generation right there + charging inefficiency. V2H is useless without a charging connection which would require an infeasibly large home system. I'd argue if you have an ev you are completely tied to the grid.\n\nThe reason why home solar is even thought of as a reasonable investment is because of generous net metering policies which are really subsidies for pretty inefficient generation. If export was valued appropriately it would be at wholesale rates which really hurt the roi prospects for any homeowner. The second net metering goes away so will a lot of home investment in solar.\n\nIf you only have panels your entire system relies on the grid being present to operate so you have zero independence.\n\nThe only reasonable case for home solar and batteries are in places where the distribution system is unreliable which is really largely the fire areas in California. And even here the system needs to be sized for backup not whole house serving purposes.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00021043464221293107,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3735975424448649,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1856594957974016,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2989043430467504,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15921895527372953,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.037817674688994884,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.18846205361974658,"solar_1":-0.2032089546076962,"solar_2":-0.1776937531417653,"solar_3":-0.03717370818264322,"solar_4":-0.027106153796339908,"solar_5":-0.035883234289095914,"solar_6":-0.05518008697011586,"solar_7":-0.021549296218533225,"solar_8":-0.07504249595998165,"solar_9":-0.012363605354721585,"solar_10":-0.08558276684626019,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.17566590011119843},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

[This article plus helpful graph](https://phys.org/news/2017-07-effective-individual-tackle-climate-discussed.html) explains what the more impactful things are. I was super pissed off after spending years worrying about rain barrels, taking shorter showers, and being careful to turn off the faucet while brushing only to find that these steps 100% ignore [the \"elephant in the room\" that corporations are hoping we don't notice](https://www.truthordrought.com/water). I have still kept my old water-saving habits, but pressuring the government to support and companies to supply more water-friendly products is far more impactful than our little habits in the kitchen, bathroom, or garden.\n\nI've been working with the other mods of r/PlaneteerHandbook, to put together some helpful guidelines about Levels of Activism, and Types of Activism (not posted yet, sorry!) to help my fellow environmentalists pick and choose the more impactful actions that will fit their life situations/skills/passions. I firmly believe that one size doesn't fil all because we all live in different places with access to different things, which I'm going to use as an example to touch on Levels of Activism and why that's important to your question here.\n\nHistorically we've been told to focus on Levels 1 and 4. If we look at Level 1 Activism as personal action, and Level 4 Activism as what governments and multinational corporations are doing, or at least our attempts to get them to engage in better behavior then we start to run into problems when nothing get's done at level 2 or 3. For example, in the chart I shared, you can see that using public transportation is a high-impact activity. At level one, if you find there is no local transit system in your area, or going where you need to go, then you just have to pick something else. At level 4, the government can shell out money to create transit systems, but they may not know the best places to put them. Which is why it's important to jump in at Level 3 where you start contacting your local parish/county/city/town/village council to tell them where you and others in your community need to have public transit lines or stops added. Then when they show up, you are finally able to engage in Level 1 AND Level 2 which is where you invite/convince/dare people you know or are related to to join you in using the system. Help them learn where they can buy a ticket or access card, let them know if certain ages or days have cheaper fare, let them know if the transit goes reasonably close to their homes, places or work, hospitals, or fun places like museums.\n\nThe system as it is, as we're told to play the game is kinda broken, and \"the powers that be\" kinda want it that way. They get to keep making money, polluting, and don't have to change their behavior as long as we keep hyper-focusing on tiny personal actions, or the occasional protest to politicians who often don't know what to do themselves. By joining existing environmental organizations, by increasing pressure on local, high-impact changes, we create a patchwork quilt of the cleaner, safer, better world we want to live in. Focusing on improving our own communities makes us stronger, helps educate us, connects us to others who also want to make a difference, and provides a safety new during times of disaster. Companies profit from people feeling alone, nervous, and vulnerable, which I suspect is why they want us to focus on personal action instead of coming together to create a healthier, stronger movement.\n\nI created this collection of [Action Maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/ubw7et/action_maps/) so people can more easily see where actions are being taken around them (maybe even choose to join in!), a directory of [Helpful Subs for Planeteers](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/fn634x/helpful_subreddits_for_planeteers/) (organized by topic so you can find what speaks to you), and a [Directory of Organizations to Volunteer with](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/felww8/directory_of_organizations_to_volunteer_with/) (or support). One of our other mods posted [this great resource about how to successfully communicate with government leaders](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/tyqh9k/how_to_contact_your_representatives_master_thread/) (the comments section has a growing list of addresses/politician finders to make contacting them easier). My suggestion is to focus on finding the Level 1 Actions you can and want to participate in, then if any turn out to be \"too hard\" or \"impossible\" in your geographic region, then take those as signals that they may need some level 2-4 intervention. Try to work out what's missing so that you and other environmentalists you know can focus your efforts on \"removing barriers to action\" for yourselves and others in your community. \n\nFor example, pressuring for better transit, reviewing restaurants or groceries or talking to their customer service about adding more planet-friendly alternatives (eco-friendly/returnable packaging, or plant-based alternatives for things they already serve), maybe fund raise to get solar power for the local schools, hospitals, and retirement homes, so the people in them are less likely to die from temperature extremes in times of disaster. Maybe you have bad heatwaves, traffic congestion, air pollution, public health, and lack of connectivity, so it would be worth getting together with community planners to create a safer network of walking/cycling paths, parks and tree-cover to help connect residents with one another, local businesses, health services, etc. while giving them a healthy alternative to driving. Try to focus on one problem and solution at a time, see if an organization is already working on the problem, or talk with people you know to see if you can create a little team. It's honestly amazing how much impact a small group of concerned people can have when it comes to this kind of activism.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.044078731282752415,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1978595311978779,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18689749881451231,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.277277315268293,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.260697435585674,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2783318771970172,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.026930254282585036,"solar_1":-0.13678080630294667,"solar_2":-0.14911462944305262,"solar_3":-0.1987886623913558,"solar_4":-0.1194378335858346,"solar_5":-0.040942138347115055,"solar_6":-0.017715044209277647,"solar_7":-0.06086369296341824,"solar_8":-0.03786522642682636,"solar_9":-0.06315728556761258,"solar_10":-0.1502142638987607},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

You should think about it in money though (e.g. if you send $20 of energy to the grid during the day, you can use $20 of energy at night) since peak rates do affect it. This is called \"1:1\" since the price you get paid for sending energy to the grid is the same as the price for using that same amount of power.\n\n> Or are they doing the cost offset? I put in 4000 kWh at $.05 so that’s $20 but if I use more then $20 at night, I pay for that overage?\n\nThe overage is calculated at true-up time rather than every day, but that's basically right.\n\ntl;dr\n\n* Before: You send 10kWh (for example) to the grid. At $0.35/kWh, that's $3.50 of credit. If you use 10kWh overnight, that'll cost $3.50 and it'll come from your credit.\n* After: You send 10kWh to the grid. It gets exported at a lower rate, say $0.05/kWh, meaning that's only $0.50 of credit. If you use the same 10kWh at night, that'll still cost you $3.50, but since you only got $0.50 credit, you'll owe $3.\n\n(these examples don't deal with peak/offpeak to make things simpler)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00038747262927548337,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1802470777996632,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.31110871611154517,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28596746587707855,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3979358129959473,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22703843342233654,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2727210379591518,"solar_1":-0.3535180372806887,"solar_2":-0.10871518917720903,"solar_3":-0.11534203559173192,"solar_4":-0.08446251570416011,"solar_5":-0.036492734974065875,"solar_6":-0.005878543323584988,"solar_7":-0.05572421313020944,"solar_8":-0.06754202635481003,"solar_9":-0.22941412843903725,"solar_10":-0.3132301009758841},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

PV installation prices would remain the same because panels are getting cheaper but labor costs keep going up.  So unless you are doing it yourself the price would be about the same now and in 10 years.\n\nLike many here you'd have to check your net metering laws and stay up to date on your state/city's laws. They change so fast.  In 10 years it's the hope of everybody with PV that solid state batteries will become a reality for battery storage and backup so it wouldn't matter what net metering program you are on.  Battery adds about $10k but only lasts 10 years (per their warranty). Unless you have frequent power outages $1k/year is costly but new net metering rules only make sense to get one.\n\nThe urgency for us was California's phasing out of Net metering and the expiring tax credits.  Biden restored the tax credits but we wouldn't have qualified due to income limits of the new rebate.  For that matter check your local rebates as well to see if they are expiring or expanding.  Some states ran out of money on their PV rebate programs.\n\nI don't know if home insurance is an issue for you but in Florida some insurance companies dropped coverage if there was Solar Panels on their homes and it wasn't declared because of the fire risk (although very very small risk).  \n\n\nWe haven't had a problem with Sunpower so I don't know what the person paying $50k is talking about but we negotiated with them removing and reinstalling the panels if we replace our roof in 15 years instead of 10 years. They are a lot more expensive than tesla but a lot more efficient.  There were a lot of horror stories with Tesla installers in our area.   For that matter see if there is a community facebook group in our city/town.  Its best to ask your neighbors about their experiences with solar and installers.  \n\n\nInstallation is more costly if you have a \"complex\" roof.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2340321431993376,"1.1.1_stance":-0.13626069037563865,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23592361664396372,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3026275256160066,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1901351884007454,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18152458469208838,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.29851921430478495,"solar_1":-0.2095812175278457,"solar_2":-0.0048261588453897275,"solar_3":-0.0512650160768923,"solar_4":-0.2624038958456367,"solar_5":-0.0009947494363586884,"solar_6":-0.006793207959465993,"solar_7":-0.012996929154420892,"solar_8":-0.019016543918648193,"solar_9":-0.01225538520278254,"solar_10":-0.41864137776682625},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Fat people are gross, fat people use up precious food resources and precious medical resources with their diabetes, heart problems, bad backs, bad knees, etc. As a vegetarian but not a full vegan I don't feel morally superior to others however I stand by my statement that fat people are gross and they make me feel uncomfortable to be around.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.04349606235822042,"1.1.1_stance":-0.26831164086858433,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22054863042462114,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.35297270771785083,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1313460585754737,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.003278368075067798,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.003064905477610106,"diet_1":-0.011681157406807566,"diet_2":-0.0037189961973732957,"diet_3":-0.0030882496139383875,"diet_4":-0.001934623714381208,"diet_5":-0.002299414530474072,"diet_6":-0.004285231416967387,"diet_8":-0.0012780579563695937,"diet_9":-0.0014641257488013555,"diet_10":-0.010818107286468148,"diet_11":-0.0026097287554875948,"diet_13":-0.0027203800079102316,"diet_14":-0.029067706650216546,"diet_17":-0.04504438803026763,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.03886651465048393},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against.","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Especially if you grew up part of a different culture. Part of the reason you join the vegan community is to get inspiration and talk about food. That's hard when very few other people know what you're talking about. \n\nFor instance, I'm ethnically Mexican, a first generation American. I can find lots of recipes on this sub from some good Americanized Mexican food (like the type of stuff you could find at taco bell and chipotle). Which, don't get me wrong, is super delicious.\n\nBut I've typed so many different authentic mexican dishes into the search and come up consistently with either 0 results or maybe I get lucky and 1-3 results show up.....over the course of like 4 years. \n\nAlso coming from a culture where pets are not even a thing. Dogs are meant for working and living outside with squirrels and raccoons. All animals are things. The notion of having a pet living inside the house with you was literally met with roars of laughter from my Mexican family. Having compassion for animals in any respect whatsoever is a completely ridiculous notion according to them. I've been an on-and-off vegetarian since I was a teen before I finally decided to just make the hard jump to veganism. You wouldn't believe the amount of times I was accused of \"abandoning my culture\" and traditions. That I was doing a stupid \"White people\" thing, an \"American\" thing.\n\nAll this among other issues of course.\n\nNot something I really expect to relate to a lot of people on here but maybe a few.

In this day and age, when we know that a plant-based diet is better for health, better for the planet, and most definitely better for the animals, why would any person choose to slaughter animals, when it's so easy to fuel your body with plants?","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"yes","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.23187670381333914,"1.1.1_stance":-0.08899181460340817,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21577093925701163,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.056677758150423564,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1884438338864129,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.021619583344242226,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.001652224508385795,"diet_1":-0.1103613573759839,"diet_2":-0.030596441015390496,"diet_3":-0.07664990356476338,"diet_4":-0.20099116988606455,"diet_5":-0.13144413923758136,"diet_6":-0.17497016618103345,"diet_8":-0.040516942094351784,"diet_9":-0.008864175217847029,"diet_10":-0.29769199434667826,"diet_11":-0.01466244031325914,"diet_13":-0.19765052320602194,"diet_14":-0.10864270346749233,"diet_17":-0.010380859012608804},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

That's why lots of people claim they were vegan for x amount of time, but it was too hard, when all they did was eat a vegan compatible diet for that time. Acting as someone you're not is hard.\n\nInterestingly, when one stops eating animal products, the mind gets more open to the idea of empathizing with animals because our crtitical thinking power doesn't need to justify eating them by backwards rationalizing. Thus, eating a plant based diet does increase the chances of becoming vegan.\n\nAs many people said, if you strive for health, eat as much unprocessed foods as possible, but make sure to eat enough calories (please don't do just fruit, or only raw food). Whole plant foods are much less calorie dense, so you'll need to eat greater volumes.

On sale, 60 cents off at Whole Foods, haha. I just had to try it.\n\nReview: **Gross.**\n\nI don't like the texture (it's like layers of veg...layers) or the taste. I would think it tastes ok plain. Nope. I sure do get mad at people who say that tofu is bland--I then say, well, isn't raw chicken bland? You've got to do something to it! (I do know some people eat plain-ish tofu.). But these strips were grilled. I forget, is grilled chicken bland? Anyways, it just tasted gross.\n\nI appreciate the need for transition foods. I have even taken some of those \"transition foods\" way beyond my big transition period.\n\nBut there are better products out there. If you want juiciness and, if you so desire, the mouth-feel of chicken (from what I remember!), there are two yummmm options:\n\n* seitan (I think I had a chicken-style seitan?)\n* Delight soy nuggets (http://www.delightsoy.com/)\n\nSeitan being the more whole food, as I see it.\n\nOh, and chicken-fried tofu.
