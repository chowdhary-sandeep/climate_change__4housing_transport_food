However, it [requires](http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/07/20140728-bmw.html)480V AC input, which is somewhat unusual.\n\nEMotorWerks has been building DIY charger kits for some time now. They now offer high-power chargers with DCQC charge controllers suitable for fixed installation. Presently they offer only a CHAdeMO option, and it's expensive: $2600 for the 25 kW charger, $600 for the CHAdeMO charge controller, and $900 for the CHAdeMO cable set ($4100 total). I assume they will offer a CCS cable set and controller at some point in the future.\n\nNotably, their charger is compatible with 240V AC, but it will need 110+ amps of service. Possibly two 60 amp circuits would be barely adequate, if it supports two inputs; otherwise it will max out around 20 kW with 240V 80 amp service.",

Where is Nissan's 60kWh car? What about 80 kWh? Do they not make more expensive ICE cars, so what's stopping them from making EVs that would win over not only EV supporters but actually convert petrol heads? I'm sorry, actions speak louder than marketing. I understand that there will be people willing to defend them but anyone who looks at the market from the outside can clearly identify this lack of desire from the manufacturer to wow the public. They show no such reservation with their other products.",

The fact is that we have EVs on the road at various price points that are practical for something like 95% of all driving instances. \n\nThe only time these longer ranges come in handy is intercity travel. From Dallas to Houston I would still need to stop at least once to recharge in a 200mile range EV. I don't want to turn a 4 hour trip into a 6 hour trip. It is still more convenient to rent a fuel efficient ICE vehicle.\n\nI love that more car makers appear to be getting serious about EVs. But I think there is a clear distinction between companies making mass market EVs that are suitable for driving today and those making pie in the sky promises while only delivering compliance EVs.",

"comment": "But you do get what you pay for, that's kinda the point. You pay for 60 kWh of usable battery capacity (and they're very clear that it's actually 75 and upgradable, they don't hide this in the slightest) and that's what you get. You pay for a car without AP and that's what you get.\n\nThe other important detail to remember is that Tesla is keeping costs lower by keeping all their cars as close to the same as possible. If they tried to produce lots of different variants to accommodate different selections then it'd be more costly than just producing lots of the same and locking off sections via software (and give the consumer the option to use them later if they want, but at no obligation to do so) - if they tried to produce 2 variants of the sensor hardware, one that could only do basic safety features and another that was full AP, that'd be a significant increase in manufacturing cost having multiple variants. That's before the development, certification and QA costs. It's a false economy to put lesser hardware in the car and it wouldn't make it cheaper. You'd just end up losing the ability to upgrade without getting anything in return.\n\nSo it makes more sense to put the full AP hardware in the car and lock it off depending on what was paid for.\n\nYou get things like this all the time. If you buy a computer component such as a CPU or a GPU, there's actually good chance it was originally a higher spec model that's being run at a lower speed and sold cheaper because it's less likely to fail. Why manufacture lots of different components with different specifications designed to run in different ways when you can just manufacture and sell the same thing and make them cheaper?",

Would you consider buying an electric car the laziest way to fight for less emissions in traffic? Or buying solar panels? You vote with your money to support the industries that have a lower impact. If electric cars dominate, and it's obviously something that will happen, no emissions from traffic.\n\nIf I continue buying stuff from Hampton Creek, if I start buying stuff from Impossible Foods, more money to them, less money to the animal agriculture idiots.\n\n&gt; Civil rights also did not happen gradually, it was resolved in 2 huge steps.\n\nYeah, two steps...\n\n&gt; Please actually argue instead of bringing up fallacies. \n\nUnfortunately, your arguments are irrational. I just can't argue when you use logical fallacies, that's why I point them out.\n\n&gt; \"you don't have any basis or grounds to base your opinions on.\"\n\nWhat the?\n\nIt seems you're deliberately just ignoring the vast number of sentences people have thrown at you.\n\nThat's a desperate man argumentation and as I said, I can't argue with you without always sounding more coherent than you if you keep on using them - and that's something I really don't want to do. Although, I'll give you a hint how to win this argument, here's the catch, say:\n\n* I'm selfish and I care only about myself and people around me;\n* I do not care about the global issues because I will die before they escalate, so who gives a fuck;\n* I will personally do anything to better MY existance, and I do not care at all if it makes a negative impact on someone else.\n\nIf you say the things above, I have nothing to counterargument. Fine, you're a selfish prick who doesn't care about the global issues. There's plenty of people like you. Continue doing what you do, good luck.",

"comment": "&gt; America had the same amount of wild buffalo before colonization as it does cows today, and none of these environmental problems occurred.\n\nTrue (roughly). However, wild bison roamed over the entire area of the continent, rather than spending a great portion of their lives in concentration camps. So the crap per area is far greater now.    \n\nHuman activity has tossed the balance of nature way off. You can't say \"it used to be fine without us, so it's still fine with us\" because a variable has changed. We threw things off, and we need to try and fix it. To do my part, I'd rather eat beans than buy an electric car (hint: I can't afford an electric car).\n\n&gt; Their manure replenishes the soil...\n\nThis is assuming that they are circulated across vast areas of land. Overgrazing is extremely damaging, so you have to be careful. Cows spend a great portion of their lives in feedlots... tiny area, lots of manure, methane, and ammonia, so not good for the soil or their lungs.\n\n&gt; ... so the carbon they release is sequestered when the grass grows back.\n\nMethane is not taken in by plants. The majority of CO2 produced in animal agriculture is due to clear cutting and burning forests to make room for grazing animals. About 25% of this is reabsorbed by plants, 25% absorbed by the ocean, and the other 50% equilibrates in the atmosphere.\n\n&gt; They drink the rainwater that naturally falls where ever they are grazing...\n\nWe all drink rain water, if you look at the global water cycle. Water isn't just used and gone forever. There are complex geological processes, including evaporation/rain, or filtration via rocks and sand, to clean up water. It doesn't matter WHERE fresh water comes from, it's the total amount at any given time that's important.\n\n&gt; as well as the water contained in the grass.\n\nIf this was enough, people would eat vegetables and never have to drink water. Cows can drink up to 100 litres a day, aside from the grass they eat. Besides, the water in that grass could be water in vegetables for humans, so it's not like that water is \"free\".\n\n&gt; Just buy free-range grassfed beef and you won't cause any environmental problems.\n\nThis person is clearly very, very uneducated. They should watch a film like Cowspiracy to get an idea of what cattle farming is really like.",

"comment": "&gt; When 80% of the driving is in EV mode, who cares about MPG?\n\nWell, with only 20 miles of EV range, I can't get 80% of our Energi driving in EV mode. It's more like 50%.  Ford, in their infinite wisdom, still builds their 2017 Fusion Energi with less EV range than a 2011 Volt...\n\n&gt; My car has 2 \"mountain modes.\"  There is a hill decent mode...\n\nSorry, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about recharging the battery using the gas engine. In a Volt, this is called \"Mountain Mode\" -- the engine will run, detached from the drivetrain entirely, solely to charge up the battery. Energi does not allow this.\n\nFor example,  you can run the battery down to 0 charge in the city, hop on a highway and drive to a new city (burning gas for propulsion and recharging the battery simultaneously) and then arrive at your destination city with 50% charge (from the gas alone, even while driving uphill).  Energi does not support doing this.\n\nYes, it's not the most efficient way to drive. But it allows you to offset your emissions to areas where people aren't breathing them (freeways, country roads) and eliminate them where people are breathing (city centers).\n\n&gt; There is a hill decent mode and \"L\" Gear. Maybe you missed that feature in the Energi you drove?\n\nMy 2013 C-Max Energi has an \"L\" gear too, but it's fake -- it's an engine breaking low gear (just like any conventional ICE). Energi can't properly handle single pedal driving (in the way that a Chevy Volt, BMW i3, or the new \"e-Pedal\" on the Nissan Leaf does).\n\n&gt; If you live on top of a hill and want to use regen, yes, it'll start the engine for engine breaking. I believe the volt does the same thing.\n\nThe problem is that an Energi will engine break *even if you live at the bottom of a hill*. It starts engine breaking the second you shift into L gear, just like an ICE car. A Volt does *not* do this -- you can shift into L mode, even on a 'full' battery, and drive around with no engine breaking, just aggressive regen.\n\nPerhaps Energi can't manage the battery as well, and this engine breaking is a side effect of that? I don't know the specifics, but anyone can see the results of it.\n\n&gt; ~65 Electric HP which is good up to about 40mph or in town driving. If you are going out of town (highway driving), you'll need to burn fuel anyway.\n\nRight, exactly. ~60kw electric engine is fine for an ICE-hybrid, because the assumption is the ICE is the \"real\" part of the car, and electrics are just there for assistance. Which isn't terrible or anything -- the original Prius PHEV does the same thing, it works, the car moves.\n\nBut I personally believe the that is the fundamentally wrong approach to take. It's backwards thinking that assumes the battery + electric can't and won't handle the main driving uses cases. And sure, the Energi drivetrain is dated and 6 years old now, but the Voltec drivetrain is also 6 years old now too, and they seem to have gotten this philosophy right the first time.\n\nI maintain that the Energi drivetrain is a liability for Ford, not an asset. It represents flawed, dated thinking. Holding on to this will inevitably hold back their future EV efforts. If Ford is going to start taking electric vehicles seriously, they need to sunset Energi as it exists today, and build a proper EV + Range Extender platform for their vehicles. A platform that puts EV drivetrain and EV battery front and center, not the ICE",

"comment": "I'm in a similar spot as I'm waiting for my old car to die so I can switch to an EV except I haven't reached the death part yet on my car. I think your choice depends on whether you really, really want an EV and will pay an early-adopter surcharge or can compromise for a couple more years until the market gets more friendly.\n\nI don't think it's accurate to call any of the current crop of new EVs affordable. The Bolt MSRP is $37k+ and you're not seeing the $7.5k tax credit come back until next year, also I think the Southeast is one of the last regions GM is rolling it out to. A new Leaf or Ioniq will only be about $30k but again you're far away from receiving the tax benefit to offset the cost. You *can* get a used Leaf for between $5-8k but its usefulness will depend on whether the 80-100m range is enough for you.\n\nIf environmental factors are why you want an EV there's no shame in buying something like a used Prius or Volt and using that for a couple years until the EV market gets more established, or being really thrifty and picking up an old Camry/Civic-type car that's only purpose is to get you to the point where the Model 3 and its competitors are more widely available and cheaper if battery price trends continue. If my car died today that'd be by choice - find the most affordable and efficient ICE car that fits my needs and deal with a less-than-optimal situation for a couple more years, knowing full well I'll have funds saved up for whatever EV is best for me in 2019/2020.",

Consider upgrading your heating and cooling to a heat pump, those ductless kind are very efficient compared to most other solutions.

I don't think they'd do a little 2 cyl that would trickle charge - they'd go the 918 route for maximum performance without the compromises.  It's basically what my Karma did too - the generator wasn't even connected to the wheels and while it wasn't a V8 it was a fairly beefy Turbo-4 with one job:  Generate as many kW as possible.  A 911 that suddenly drops to 30 horsepower after a brief drive (because hybrids mean less battery than full BEV) won't be acceptable.  It will need a generator that supplies at least enough power to keep the battery in a performance state - maybe not the 600 horse unit of the 918 but enough to keep the 911 moving at full speed so lower SOC doesn't become a limp mode.",

We went PHEV for a number of reasons and #1 was not needing a second car for the rare extreme case we decide we want to drive across country or a great distance without needing to charge.\n\nWe have enough range (30 mi) to get to and from most places we need to get to entirely on EV. End up being 95-96% EV for our driving stats in a month period and always have a tinge of disappointment when that engine first kicks on.\n\nThere's a lot of peace of mind that comes with the Fusion we have. I've seen some serious vitriol for PHEVs around here and it's caused me to be pretty quiet because I think they have some serious benefits for a certain kind of consumer and can really bridge the gap to the EV era.",

But to claim they can't bring an EV to market when they're second only to Tesla in EV sales is ludicrous. The Bolt is undoubtedly the best EV you can get for under $30k out the door, and you can get it in non-CARB states as well.",

If you feel like it's worth $800 if it had a working battery, low ball by subtracting the value of a used battery. Probably $500-600.\n\nI got a used ebike. It all tested fine. Battery seemed great, bike was only 3 months old. Dude just wanted a motorcycle instead. Got home, rode for a week, and the battery failed. Customer support determined the battery was doomed to fail from a factory defect that couldn't have been detected without dissembling the battery. I had to pay $600 out of warranty for a new battery. I wish I had low balled the seller by an extra $450 (Or that the seller would've rode it for another week and dealt with it himself, he could've just filed a warranty claim)",

"comment": "Whilst we can't point to tech and say \"it would have been viable earlier if we just threw money at it\", A lot of the tech behind automotive NiMH batteries ended up with GM, and then Texaco, then Chevron, who in turn placed bans on Toyota using Panasonic's NiMH batteries in certain vehicles (ie. their Rav4 EVs and anything else with a plug) for a decade into the 2010's, and continued to hold patents on the tech until 2018.\n\nPeople like to shit on Toyota and others for not continuing with EVs in the early 2000's, but in reality Li-ion was substantially less viable than NiMH in the 90's/early 2000's, and not really a viable alternative for mainstream vehicles. Once they became viable they made their way into the first Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept in 2009 (allowing Toyota to get around the NiMH ban) then the next Rav4 EV (supplied by a small company, Tesla) in 2012. But the 1st gen Rav4 EV wasn't killed by Toyota - it was killed by Chevron.\n\nIronically, if not for GM/Chevron's fuckery with the patents, we could have had plug-in hybrid Prius' or even BEV ones substantially earlier. It's probably fair to say that Toyota were probably the biggest victim in all of that, effectively having their electrification strategy stopped short at hybrids for a decade until li-ion came down in price. They made it work for a decade and took hybrids mainstream, but it's depressing that the US market forces stopped EVs from becoming more prevalent, then when hybrids were starting to gain traction, quickly decided emissions weren't a big enough issue to include them in incentives.\n\nSo now we're stuck with not enough batteries to satiate supply to get EVs across the market, giving ICE a lifeline, and no incentives to support hybrids which could have killed ICE by mid-decade through a pincer movement with BEVs at the top/middle of the market and hybrid at the mid-low end.\n\nThe simple fact is that without NiMH, there wasn't a chemistry suitable for an EV in the 2000's, and NiMH was effectively held hostage by GM selling the tech to Texaco/Chevron.",

Gas stations are probably already spending hundreds of thousands per year on equipment and maintenance, and have service contracts for pumps that could be expanded to chargers, insuring that chargers have high availability.  Gas stations already located optimally, have lighting, security, 24 hour staffing, etc.  It just seems like gas stations would be a common sense way to get charger availability to expand rapidly and reliably.",

Gas cars are limited in similar ways; your car is technically capable of far greater power performance than it is allowed.  Conversely it could be neutered for power but more efficient. ECUs govern many variables in order to achieve the manufacturer's ratings. Maybe They™ tell the fuel pump to stop if you exceed 50mi from your home. Or tell the electronic throttle not to respond. All with firmware, \"at will.\" It's not an EV-specific issue. \n\nMany industries practice this. Economies of scale allow for production of a single component, which is then artificially limited for lower-cost items. The software lock stuff is ultimately voted on with the customer's wallet, but Tesla doesn't even make models like that at the moment.",

You said that PHEVs fall apart in the real world because they aren’t plugged in enough.  I think we are very far from having a convincing case that is true. I’m not sure what you mean by “ fall apart” but I took it to mean, not a practical solution.  That’s the part  reacting to.  They are a very practical solution.  Having traded in an ICE that used 40 gallons/month (25 mpg x 1000 miles) to a PHEV that uses 11 gals month (90 mpg, 50% electric), I can’t see how that isn’t a big environmental win. \n\nPlus I have a vehicle that 90% of the time I am driving, is fully electric, has a 600 mile range, never needs to be charged out of my home, and when at home plugs into a standard 120 volt outlet. That is an extremely practical solution.",

"comment": "Translation:\n\nVolkswagen Works Council Chairwoman Daniela Cavallo spoke to Der Spiegel about the capacity utilisation problems in the Group's electric car production. She also commented on her view of the challenges facing German industry as a result of e-mobility.\nThe lack of capacity utilisation is not just a Volkswagen problem, she said. \"E-mobility as a whole is not being accepted in Germany and Europe as planned,\" said the employee representative. \"We will most likely miss the German government's target of putting 15 million e-cars on the road by 2030.\" Many believe that e-mobility is inconvenient. The fear of breaking down on the road with an empty battery is still widespread. In addition, e-vehicles are more expensive than comparable combustion engines.\n\nThe most affordable electric car from the Volkswagen core brand currently costs just under 40,000 euros. Cavallo conceded that there is currently no offering in the entry-level segment. From 2026, there should \"finally be a vehicle under 25,000 euros\" with the series version of the ID.2. However, an electric car with a starting price of 20,000 euros is also needed to really reach all groups of buyers. Unfortunately, there is still no clarity here, as the vehicle is still in the concept phase.\n\nThe head of the works council does not believe that VW has opted for the wrong e-models. The switch to e-mobility requires \"huge investments\". The company earns more money from larger vehicles, which is why it had to focus on this initially. Innovations always come from the upper classes in the volume segment, which is customary in the industry. \"But of course VW should have planned smaller models much earlier. The fact that this didn't happen is now a burden for us.\"\n\nWith regard to the abrupt cancellation of the electric car purchase premium at the end of 2023, Cavallo said that politicians do not have to do the job of car manufacturers. \"But anyone who promises bonuses should stand by them in the long term. In addition to predictability and reliability, I expect the German government to clearly position itself in favour of e-mobility. Instead, it is presenting synthetic fuels, e-fuels, as a supposed alternative.\" This unsettles people.\n\nE-fuels make sense for existing vehicles, but are not an alternative to electrification, Cavallo noted. Although there is \"a certain disillusionment\" on the boardroom floor with regard to electrification, there is still \"no alternative\" to e-mobility. It would be \"dangerous to deviate from this path again now\". Countries such as the electric car Mecca of Norway have proven that a consistent switch is possible.\n\nThe head of the works council explained that jobs would be lost as a result of the switch to e-mobility. However, it is \"a misconception\" that car manufacturing will change completely as a result of the transition. At the same time, new jobs would be created, for example in battery cell production. \"However, we have to be careful that we develop such future technologies in Germany - where the old jobs are disappearing.\" It is also important to attract expertise and new industries to the country. \"If we don't succeed in doing that too, our prosperity will be at risk.\"\n\nMoving away from the de facto phase-out of combustion engines set by the EU for 2035, as some in industry and politics are calling for, would be \"fatal and a danger to the economy\", said Cavallo. \"We at Volkswagen have aligned our strategy with this and are investing 180 billion euros, largely in e-mobility.\"",

"comment": "Powerwall also isn't going to work for you, it's designed to interface with a grid-tie system. There may be off-grid inverters that can support the high voltage (~350vdc I think) of a powerwall, but I don't know of any. And even if you found the right inverter, the powerwall software probably isn't going to be setup for an off-grid system. It has it own DC-DC converter designed to soak up extra power during the peak and feed it back off-peak. \n\nMy \"solar system in a box\" is pretty simple fundamentally. You have a variety of components needed to make your own power off-grid; one or more MPPT controllers that actually connect to the panels, a bank of batteries and BMS to manage them, and a off-grid inverter to produce AC power. But the part you don't generally think about is all the wiring to tie them together, the high-amp DC breakers needed for each component to protect the rest of the system in the event of a component failure or fault, the conduit and equipment panels to protect and contain the wiring and mount the breakers, and a control panel to monitor the status of the whole system and keep track of production and usage. \n\nMy goal was to package everything together in as small and efficient a manner as is possible, and in doing so create something more like an appliance than a custom designed and installed system. The whole thing is the size of a refrigerator. And in that package I've packed 3 MPPT controllers capable of up to 15,000 watts of panels, an inverter that can output up to 8,000 watts of AC power, and 16,000 watt-hours of long-life lithium batteries, as well as an internal network that connects it all together and gives you all the pertinent information either on the front display or via a webpage. \n\nEverything is quick-connect so no permanent wiring is needed. The solar power comes in on one side, pretty much any standard array voltages will work. And the AC connection is just a standard generator twist-lock. Though I'm considering adding a breaker box and a bunch of standard 120/240v outlets to make wiring even easier. \n\nI've been using mine to run my house and metal shop. Oven/well pump/stove/AC are no problem, and it also runs my welder/plasma cutter/battery chargers, and it's even the sole source of power to charge my Tesla. \n\nI was actually looking into building a shipping container home previously, but I needed to bring down some HUGE diseased trees to make access. Half way through I realized I had tons and tons of wood fiber that could be processed into composite blocks using standard cement and an electric chipper/shredder I built, so now I'm in the process of pouring a well insulated foundation and constructing wood fiber/cement walls.",

"comment": "You can definitely run a fridge with solar. You have plenty of sun in your northern summer, but probably not enough in winter. Can't help you regarding specific brands, prices, etc since you're in Finland and I know nothing about the local market there. In Germany, Czech Republic, and Poland you can find lots of cheap solar panels (less than 1 Euro/watt) and LFP batteries (0.50 euro/watt-hour capacity -- 500 euro/kWh capacity).\n\nYou're looking at $5000-$10000 USD for a decent small system. You could probably get it down to $3000 if you do a lot of it yourself and learn a lot about solar and electronics.\n\nhttp://www.solarworld.de/en/products/produkte/solarworld-kit-easy/overview/\n\nhttp://www.solarshop-europe.net/product_info.php?cPath=139_257&amp;products_id=2327&amp;xanarioID=ho4lg45b55v1buh2gs6skabic3\n\nIf somehow there's no one doing solar packages for off-grid summer homes in your area, that would be a good business opportunity for you or a friend!",

"comment": "There is a lot of misinformation here. The system shown may work as described, but it may or may not be legal (depending on your AHJ), and it may or may not be safe (depending on how and where it is connected).\n\nIn my very brief research on this product, I haven't been able to find any documentation on the individual components, nor installation guides. They claim that the microinverters are UL 1741 compliant, so they won't unintentionally backfeed the utility grid during an outage, as some other commenters indicated. The inverter shown in the picture isn't clear enough for me to read the manufacturer/model, but the only inverters I know of that look like that are definitely not rated for 120V, so you couldn't just plug them in like the picture shows, unless they are also including a transformer. \n\nIf the receptacle you are plugging into is not on a dedicated circuit (no other loads or receptacles on the same breaker or fuse), there is a distinct danger of burning up the wire (and your house). The breaker/fuse panel has to be rated appropriately, and the solar array needs to be at the end of the bus bars from the incoming feed, also. There are exceptions to these basic rules (See Articles 690 and 705 of the NEC, or your local equivalent), but I would be very hesitant to recommend anything like this without a lot more information.\n\nThe system is also pretty expensive at about $3.14/Watt. Fully installed systems, by licensed professionals, shouldn't cost much more than that, and you would have the assurance that it won't burn your house down. DIY kits from various online retailers tend to be less expensive, too.",

"comment": "&gt;It doesn't: https://collapseofindustrialcivilization.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ferroni-y-hopkirk-2016-energy-return-on-energy-invested-eroei-for-photo.pdf\nIt take more energy to produce the parts of the solar systems in Germany than they will return in their lifetimes, because Germany has poor insolation. Solar is net positive in sunny areas, not cloudy ones. And residential power in Germany is about thrice as much as residential power in the US, but go ahead and tell everyone how expensive nuclear power is.\n\nThat was a recent and interesting paper that hasn't been cited yet to my knowledge in other peer reviewed papers. Thank you. \n\nIt is certainly an outlier of Solar PV EROI.\n\nThis review looked at 232 papers between 2000-2013 and found something quite different for solar PV EROI.\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211500146X\n\nHowever, it was for a mean global insolation of 1700 kwh / m^2 per year, whereas the Ferroni paper used a value as low as 106 kwh/m^2 per year.\n\nThis is by far the biggest difference in the values and methodologies in the paper, and it even goes as far as to say Germany's should be even lower by 5%.\n\nEarly edit: I just found a rebuttal of that outlying paper.\n\nhttp://cassandralegacy.blogspot.fi/2016/06/photovoltaic-is-energy-source-not-sink.html\n\n&gt;This is a comment by Luis De Souza on a recent paper by Ferroni and Hopkirk who reported a negative energy yield for photovoltaic plants in Switzerland (in other words, an energy return, EROEI, smaller than one). It is an anomalous result, considering that a comprehensive meta-analysis of the field reported values of 11-12 for the EROEI of the most common PV technology. So, what's wrong with the paper by Ferroni and Hopkirk? A lot of things, it seems. Here, De Souza shows that photovoltaics is a source of energy, even in a not so sunny country as Switzerland. He concludes that something went badly wrong with the review procedure with the journal that published the paper by F&amp;H, \"Energy Policy\". That seems to be correct and you may be interested to know that an extensive rebuttal of that paper has been prepared and submitted to the journal by a group of researchers expert in the field of energy calculations. That rebuttal finds a lot more wrong things in F&amp;H's paper than those identified by De Souza. In short, Energy Policy managed to publish a flawed study that should never have been published in a scientific journal. Unfortunately, it was done and now a lot of people are using it to support the war against renewable energy.\n\n&gt;The Take Away\nThe EROEI figure concluded by Ferroni &amp; Kopkirk for PV is the lowest ever and far below any previous studies.\nThese authors use awkward units that largely obfuscate their assumptions on yearly energy yield.\nA sample of various panel models points to an energy yield under 700 Wh/Wp/a used in this study.\nOfficial statistics point to an average yield well above 900 Wh/Wp/a for the Swiss PV park; this is in line with values from assessment tools like PVGIS.\nThe peer review process is not functioning properly at Energy Policy.",

I used to deal on the finance side of things, doing due diligence with projects - however, now a days I spend a lot more time dealing with customers and moving projects through the pipeline...so I've missed out a lot on the money movements.\n\nAre bond offerings/securitizations by the SolarCity's of the world filtering down into real life for solar power? Do the boutiques still have to find all the cash? Are you able to sell into the bond market (if you're a boutique that is, if you're a big player - would you buy a package from a boutique?)?\n\nI'd like to do more backend work one day - I enjoy the spreadsheets at the idea of bringing together 100 rooftops across a region.",

Since you are going to be on the grid, start with this size and see how much of your loads it takes care of. You can then stack additional ones later if you need to.\n\nIf you have a far distance to run the solar panels, you can use a 600V MPPT charge controller for the long run. Schneider makes one. \n\nBoth of these inverter options output split phase 120/240V.",

"comment": "Obviously the area under the curve matters, but what matters more is Tesla investors’ continued belief and support in Tesla. It is difficult to stand if the ground is removed beneath your feet. \n\nI think most people would agree that it’s in the best interest of Tesla and its investors that model 3 production is ramped at a sustainable rate in terms of standards for fit and finish as well as quality. Recalls and repairs are expensive, and so is potential bad publicity. \n\nHonestly I think that the biggest issue they’ve had so far is their expectations control. Shooting out over optimistic numbers and then revising them time and time over again. It would be much better to have positive surprises than negative surprises. \n\nSure, all that burning cash is not negligible, but let’s not forget that they’re not only building the factories, but also developing semi trailer tractors, new cars, new battery chemistries, self-driving research, developing solar roof panels, building service and sales centers across the world, charging infrastructure, hiring people, and more. There’s a reason that cash is going out so fast. They’re investing in being part of the future. \n\nSure, other manufacturers have decided to up the EV game, but Tesla is still dictating how it’s played. Over the air updates, sat-nav by default, immense configurability, rolling updates to production instead of waiting for the next model year. On top of that, the amount of data Tesla gathers from its fleet is enormous compared to other manufacturers. With the importance of data today, Tesla is increasing their potential value by every mile driven. \n\nOther manufacturers might have a lot of things in place already, but I fear that with the “low” maintenance required on electric cars could make today’s business model suffer. My local Audi dealership is so expensive it’s more economical for me to take time off work and spend three times as much time doing it myself. Cost of labor is expensive in Norway, but when visiting a dealership is “almost” as expensive as hiring a lawyer it’s a bit ridiculous. How much of this revenue will disappear when electric vehicles become the norm? There will obviously always be out of warranty repairs, damage repairs and so forth, but the market is definitely open for someone not trying to make as much money as possible after the car has been sold. \n\nI certainly wouldn’t count Tesla out, but if they’re going to fail I certainly hope it’s due to the customers not coming rather than the investors running away before they’ve had time to deliver. Let’s not forget that they’re still ahead of the original target before it was accelerated due to the huge amount of pre-orders.",

I don't hear anyone decrying the government setting up solar panels and wind turbines when there is a massive problem with inner cities in America, but for some reason they get upset when people care about animal lives too...\nPlus, as a nation, we kind of pushed Trump to sign an executive order about these child camps, so I suppose that is a step in the right direction. But honestly, I see no issue with fighting for what you are able to (as in, not all of us are able to fight against child camps except for sending letters to congress and/or posting on the useless Facebook and Twitter sites).",

But the data isn't their own, instead it's from Lazard. Version 8 of their LCOE study from 2014 (almost 5 years ago).\n\nLazard is now up to Version 12 of their LCOE study. They also do a specific report on LCOE of energy storage.\n\nYou can find both here:\n\nhttps://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2018/\n\nLazard now also finds that wind and solar have the lowest LCOE. Their battery storage estimates are higher, but assumptions for them are different.\n\nCSIRO/AEMO found only considered SMR Nuclear reactors, leading to their high nuclear estimates.\n\nObscuring your true source is either being intentionally or unintentionally dishonest.\n\nFacts don't care about your feelings.",

"comment": "&gt; Diving deeper: proposal includes sunpower X 360W panels which are 96 cell modules. Enphase spec sheets says that only IQ7Xs are compatible with 96 cell modules. (IQ7+s only go up to 72). Is it a big deal to connect a 96 cell module to a IQ7+?\n\nOnly if you like your warranty and functionality of the equipment.\nYou see the problem is that the 96 cell modules have a different MPPT range where they produce power and accordingly the IQ7X has a different range for MPPT (53-64V ) vs the IQ7+ (27-45V).  \n\n&gt; I'm getting a bit concerned that my installer may be missing basic 'spec matching' points...\n\nyes there are a lot of untrained crews out there but sunpower generally only deals with installers that they have trained.   So I would suspect that this is a sales guy giving a line of BS.  Either way not an installer I would deal with.\n\n&gt; Re the networking: I was thinking more along the lines of wireless protocols (802.11ac has a theoretical advertised bandwidth of 300Mbps, but real world is closer to 90).\n\nOk with wifi a little different but it CAN do that.  The throughput drops with distance and interference and since it is a shared media, also with number of connections.   So in a faraday cage, with just a router and one device set close together you should get that speed.  Add interference, distance and other equipment and the speed will drop.",

I get credits for it which I can use to offset usage at times when solar power is not available.\n\n  In my area grid tied solar reduced the fuel consumption for our power coop by 10% for the year while meeting a larger demand. That takes a lot of local installs. \n\nRegardless of your reasons for doing so solar is a worthwhile investment. Keep in mind that even after the \"break even\" point the system produces power. There is an end date to your subscription after which you gain no further benefit.",

"comment": "I installed (and bought an electric car) in California last year.\n\nWith PG&amp;E anyway, there is definitely such thing as too many or too few panels.  Your electricity production can be used to fully offset your electricity consumption.  But if you annually produce more than you consume, you get either nothing or a trivial payment for the surplus.  Therefore your provider should do an in-depth review of your electricity consumption habits and try to nail exactly how many panels you’ll need.\n\nI’m a numbers person so I did my own analysis, and concluded I could get by with significantly fewer panels than recommended.  Providers face incentives to sell you more than you need.  Obviously they make more money by selling more, but keep in mind if they underestimate your needs, they also face irate customers coming back one year later angrily complaining “I spent all this money.  Why do I still owe PG&amp;E money too?”  Anyway, the bottom line is do your homework and get a really good estimate of how many panels you need.\n\nRegarding the Powerwall.  Read up on load-shifting.  You can fill up the battery during morning hours, then dump all that energy out into the grid during peak hours when you earn maximum credits.  When I did the number crunch, I found it to be cost-competitive... I could buy a Powerwall and then forego 9 solar panels.  \n\nOne of the drawbacks to this approach for me is that I don’t know how to predict how rates will change over the next couple decades.  If the discrepancy between peak and off-peak rates closes, the value will evaporate.  And, doing a full power cycle every single day will presumably decrease the lifespan of the Powerwall.  On the benefits side, if power goes out during the day or you have reason to anticipate that you may lose power overnight, you can temporarily stop load-shifting and use the battery as a normal backup.  the other benefit: Note that without a battery backup system, you will have no power during a grid outage, *even during the daytime.*  Has something to do with the way the panels are integrated into the grid... I think they have to shut down when the grid goes down since there’s nowhere for the excess energy to go.  I don’t know if this is universal but that’s how it works with my panels (I don’t have a Powerwall).\n\nThat said, here’s an option to consider: You said you may get an EV later.  I don’t know how much later you’re talking, but you could get enough panels to cover your current needs now.  When &amp; if you get an EV, you could add a Powerwall to do load-shifting to cover the EV needs.  My provider said that this is a doable way to expand as needs arise.  It’s worth noting because expanding seems later seems like an option many people might like to have, but adding additional panels requires a long and possibly costly process of resubmitting permits.  And it knocks you out of your rate plan (which you are grandfathered into for 20 years, at least with PG&amp;E).",

"comment": "&gt; For example I'm hearing from people with zero experience like myself that you can't have a big sound system because it eats into the range. Is this true? If it is, is actually that big an issue or is it negligible?\n\nIt's completely negligible. \n\nLucid Air has a 21 speaker audio system and yet its range estimate is the best of all EVs.\n\nClimate Control however can cause noticeable range decrease. Bit more noticeable than it is on ICE cars.\n\nRange is reduced in cold weather too. Look up winter reviews for the EV you're interested in in particular. Some EVs have heat pumps (which improves range in cold weather), some do not. But since you're in Australia, I don't think this is an issue at all for you.\n\n&gt; How about if the wife and kids have all their gadgets plugged in? \n\nSame as above. A plugged in phone or tablet are negligible.\n\nYour average smartphone has a ~3500 mAh battery (~13.3 Wh). The car battery is thousands of times bigger than that. The smallest battery option for the current Nissan Leaf is 40kWh. That's +3000 complete 0 to 100% phone charges. The Hyundai Kona comes with a 64kWh battery, VW ID.4 with up to 77 kWh and so on.\n\n&gt; Are batteries likely to combust?\n\nNot on its own.\n\nIf you're in an accident and something punctures the battery the car might catch on fire. But so can your ICE car in an accident when fuel leaks. Both is statistically quite unlikely to happen but it does happen nevertheless to someone unfortunate.\n\n&gt;  Is it really cost effective long term if I have to replace the battery every X years?\n\nIt's much more likely that the battery lasts longer than the rest of the car. \n\nUpcoming batteries are all \"million mile\" batteries. Current batteries are good for several 100k miles too. There are many \"second life\" projects for batteries from old electric cars because the batteries are still good for energy storage but the rest of the car is scrap. The batteries can still be used for huge grid storage projects all the way down to small home energy storage for solar panels.",

Boiled down you both say your customers are a bother.  If I want panel level tracking WHO are you to say I shouldn't have it?!  WHO paid good money based on what the salesman said, only to find out later that the local sun power installer doesn't \"really pay that much attention to the monitoring system.\"  Your warrantee is worthless if nobody is watching the system.  \n\nSo do you want to be helpful or a just another jerky sunpower  installer?",

"comment": "Please slow down.\n\nI don't want to sound mean, but you don't appear to have any idea what you are doing.\n\nSolar panels generate DC electricity, like a battery. You can use this power for a few things, but usually it is used to charge batteries.\n\nWall outlets are AC - alternating current. To get AC from DC, you need a special device called an inverter.  Just like batteries there are different size inverters. A single AA battery does the same thing as the battery under the hood of your car. But they are hugely different in the amount of voltage and current that they can store and provide. Likewise, you need to size the battery and inverter to your needs when designing a solar system.\n\nStart with what you want to do. The complexity and expense for a system that will keep your cell phone battery topped off is much less than what you need to use a coffee maker, or a microwave, or a window air conditioner (each of which being more complex than the previous). \n\nI suggest spending some time watching YouTube videos on solar systems. I like Will Prowse, he has a teachers attitude and tries to make his videos educational without lecturing.",

"comment": "I don't know if \"go bigger\" is always the best advice and many factors should be taken into consideration.  Ideally you acquire a system that is just large enough to support your needs.  The reason for that is SCE isn't paying you retail rate for any excess energy you produce at the end of your 12 month billing cycle.  I think the current wholesale rate they will pay you at is between 3-4 cents/kWh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as an example if you purchase an extra 1kwH of panels for your house knowing you don't need them you will pay \\~2500$ extra for the up front cost.  For an average year in SoCal those extra panels might bank you an extra 1,800kWh with SCE in a 12 month period.  At the end of that period they will then cash you out for those excess kWh to the tune of \\~ $72.00 (1800kwH \\* .04c).  At that rate you are looking to see a return on your investment in approximately 34.7 years.  OUCH!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdding an electric vehicle definitely changes your needs, but you should also attempt to determine when you will be purchasing the new vehicle(3 months, or 5 years?) and how much energy you will require for it per year.  With that information you can try to make a better informed decision on how many panels you require and how the purchase will affect your return on investment.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany solar installers probably wont talk you out of installing more panels and may even try to upsell you.  Their profit margin obviously goes up the more panels they sell to you and it doesn't matter to them whether your ROI is 7 years, 15 years, or never.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFood for thought!",

If you plan on electric use going up or a need to increase in the future micros are going to slightly edge out. If you are happy with size and don’t suspect you would ever need to expand the slight edge goes to string. Optimizer tech has all but eliminated the weak panel discussion. And the new lg battery is a beast. Either way I’m super excited to see the value increase. A couple years ago that ppw for top teir without storage would have been a great deal!  What state?

EVs can make use of decentralized sources of power like solar panels and gas generators, in addition to the usual grid, while ICEs rely on a fairly centralized distribution network of gas stations with no backup. So EVs would be a more robust option in the disaster scenario you bring up.\n\nI totally agree, EVs FTW.",

"comment": "That may just be the float voltage while the charge controller keeps the charge on the battery  properly maintained. A standard 12V led acid battery has a float voltage of 13.5 VDC.  \n\n\" The **Float** mode follows the constant current mode. **Float** mode is where the **battery voltage** is maintained at approximately 2.25 volts per cell, or 13.5 volts for a 12V **battery**. This **charger** will maintain the **battery** indefinitely without boiling out electrolyte or overcharging the **battery**. \" \n\nFor Lithium batteries\n\n\" Charging Cobalt-blended Li-ion\n\nLi-ion with the traditional cathode materials of cobalt, nickel, manganese and aluminum typically charge to 4.20V/cell. The tolerance is +/–50mV/cell. Some nickel-based varieties charge to 4.10V/cell; high capacity Li-ion may go to 4.30V/cell and higher. Boosting the voltage increases capacity, but going beyond specification stresses the battery and compromises safety. [Protection circuits](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/safety_circuits_for_modern_batteries) built into the pack do not allow exceeding the set voltage.\"\n\nThen 4.2 V DC per cell times 6 cells = 25.2 V DC. \n\nSo your controller display can't be showing that voltage. I agree with another poster that that voltage may be your PV panel. Just press the up/down arrow on your controller and take another picture. Then just disconnect one of the wires from your panel and see what the voltage reads.",

It's already the most inxpensive form of electricity. If it could be installed by the homeowner and prices for solar and batteries are cheap, I'd imagine it'll be everywhere.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the price of a residential solar panel system has dropped by an annual average of more than 60% over the past decade — from upwards of $50,000 for a 6-kilowatt-hour (KWh) system in 2011 to between $16,000 and $21,000 in 2021.",

Solar panels are not such a terrible risk that insurance should no longer be offered or made exorbitantly expensive. In fact, properly installed solar can extend a roof’s lifetime. Add to that that Florida seems to be a special case, while other hurricane-prone states apparently don’t do this, and you should be smelling a rat.",

Silicon and hydrogen form toxic silane, which over the years has been responsible for a significant number of fatal industrial accidents.\n\nWhy do Australians fall for such absurd green narratives?\n\nThe reason appears to be that many Australians yearn for the days when Australia was a booming manufacturing hub, before Australian manufacturing went into decline 60 years ago. \n\nThe green industry narrative plays into this yearning.\n\nThe reality is Australia’s manufacturing decline will not be solved by a few solar panels.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the decline in Australian manufacturing was caused by a combination of greedy government tax rises, and later, in the 90s, rising energy costs, after the Australian government became obsessed with renewables.\n\nExpensive, government subsidised green energy will not fix these problems.",

Corporations can do a lot like encouraging eligible staff to work from home, giving transit subsidies to staff, removing parking subsidies, reducing corporate travel as much as possible and investing in energy efficient buildings and in EVs.\n\nGovernments can do more by increasing tax rate on fossil fuel businesses but give generous r&amp;,d credits for renewable energy research and offering no or low tax rates for renewable energy businesses, reducing the administrative burden when consumers want to install solar panels on their property, encouraging scientists from around the world to work together on ideas, etc. International scientific cooperation led to record breaking timeline in development of COVID vaccines. We need the best scientific minds from around the world to work together.",

"comment": "Umm.  New to solar here, but I don’t understand the desire to size ones system substantially over your expected needs.  I have a small 4.9kW system (12 Panasonic/REC panels with IQ8M microinverters) and it is easily currently meeting our daily power needs, except for charging up our two EVs in the middle of the night.  So, when I see those gray bars under the line indicating power being exported to the grid I view that as a negative.  It’s estimated to meet about 60% of our annual needs, which was our compromise on space available, but is currently giving us 100% of our regular needs for this time of year.  We installed a 13.4kWh Enphase battery storage system that’s recharges to 100% by early afternoon, even as we’re running the Self-Consumption Profile to minimize exports to the grid and fully covers our evening power needs when solar is off-line.  That means we have a window from around 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM when we’re basically sending everything we produce to the grid, which seems a waste.  That’s averaging around 6kWh a day, and makes me think about adding another 5kWh battery to capture that, as well, but I’ll give it a year to see if that makes sense to me.  Of course, this is prime time for annual solar production, so after the summer solstice it’ll be all downhill the rest of the year.\n\nI understand the economics don’t really work very well for battery backup, but my desire is to only go to the grid when I have power spikes, which routinely only occurs twice a night with two EV charging cycles.  Our battery provides any temporary power shortfall to solar during the day.  All of my regular 120v circuits are fully covered by my system.  It’s only late in the night after midnight when the EV charging starts up that my battery finally discharges to its 20% minimum.  Interestingly, my battery contributes 5.1kW to my EV’s 11.5kW charging draw until it reaches its minimum, then our system pulls everything from the grid for the rest of the night until solar production becomes meaningful the next morning around 9 AM.\n\nI am a bit envious of those who have the space for a larger system, but don’t really see the need.  Maybe it’s just because my system seems pretty well optimized for my needs at the moment, and that will diminish as the year moves on.  Perhaps those with larger systems are doing so just to grab more solar throughout the year with less production from each panel as the sun lowers in the sky?  I guess that makes sense, but unless you have a 1:1 Net Metering arrangement with your utility, you’re likely selling power back to the grid for less than you could buy it, essentially subsidizing your power company.",

"comment": "This is why the solar salesperson should be required to check out the roof, electric panel plus the location of gas meter and main water pipe before presenting a quote.  Evaluate current and future use of electricity and if all the gas appliances will be replaced with electric appliances. The customer should demand these evaluations before the quote and before signing the agreement.  No more bait and switches. Our quote was changed 5 times. In the end, the system proposed was nowhere near the initial system that we asked for. The final system design was a severely undersized system made up of hacked up job of putting anything anywhere and proposal to hide equipment from the city inspection so the system passes. The proposal was the solar installer will hide equipment inside the house connected to the system as the city inspects outside. After the inspection passes, the solar installer will put them back outside.  That was because there were clearance requirements outside.\n\nSolar Quote Checklist\n\nEvaluate:\n\nElectricity Use for the entire year and each month: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nRoof: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nElectric Panel: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLocation of gas meter: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLocation of main water pipe: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPotential location of inverter/combiner: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPotential location of AC Disconnect: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPotential location of Solar Battery: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nCentral Air Conditioner: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nCentral Heating: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEV:  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nGas Appliances: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nCurrent electric items: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFuture electric items: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

"comment": "We are starting the install of a SolarEdge system, with panels and battery backup.  \n There is a company hired for that, but I'm the kind of person who wants to understand things in detail, and also we need to evaluate the locations of devices, the routes of wires, where to make holes in the wall, etc. So I'd like to have a good understanding of the scope.  \n   \n I made the attached diagram from the info I found. Would appreciate if anyone more knowledgeable would tell me:  \n  \\- is anything incorrect?  \n  \\- is any wire or connection missing in my drawing?  \n    \n This is what I have so far:  \n  \\- The grid feeds the Main Panel (service side) through a bidirectional meter  \n  \\- Large loads don't get backup, and are fed directly from the main panel  \n  \\- The inverter receives power from the solar panels, through the optimizers.   \nIt charges the battery, and feeds the Backup Interface from either direct solar or battery power.  \nIt connects to the internet for monitoring and control.  \n  \\- Backed up loads are fed from the sub-panel  \n  \\- The backup interface feeds the subpanel from either the main panel or the inverter  \nIt also feeds excess solar power TO the main panel (red arrows).  \nIn this case, energy flows up to the grid, through the main panels and bidirectional meter  \n  \n  \nThanks!",

"comment": "Well it looks like you are only using a single 7.6kW inverter from your Powerwall+ setup. That could bring your ratio to 1.789.\n\nI compared your home to some Phoenix AZ systems ranging from 13.42kW (1.118 DC/AC) to 14.74kW (1.292 DC/AC) and in the summer they pull 70-90kWh/day (full sun) and in the winter it's 50-60kWh. If you are making 39kWh/day in the winter and 46kWh/day in the summer, then something is not quite right.\n\nAlso, your father's system is  93+kWh/day in the winter! If everything is wired correctly at your home, your father must have a 33kW solar system since his winter production is 2.4x yours.\n\nYou could also check the main panel to see how what sized breakers are dedicated to solar PV.",

That does make a difference and would drop costs by about $45/month from my calculation.  So, it could potentially save $9/month to go with Sunrun.",

I generally think of 1200-1300 kWh as a reasonable production estimate, with some sites lower and some higher. If you're in the southern US, higher might be justified but I wanted to flag that estimated production feels rosy here. \n* You're citing an expectation of 1454 kWh/month, but it's October. Most systems will see much higher output in summer and much lower in winter, so I'd certainly expect you'd see lower than the monthly average right now. \n\nThat doesn't mean the sale rep didn't deceive you or set the wrong expectations, I just wanted to clarify that the overall estimate seems high to me, and even if it was accurate, I'd expect you'd see lower production than average this time of year.\n\nAnd, the sales reps for most of the big national companies pushing leases and PPAs are generally hired with very little training or oversight, and compensated primarily through commissions, so it's always good to take anything they present with several grains of salt and try to dig into the details of any expectations they set.",

Also is it possible to use the same facility and be able switch things between a breeder and a burner or are these separate facilities? \n\nMolten salt vs sodium. I've read more about the salt ones it seems. I'm guessing it has to do with the corrosive issues you mentioned with sodium. I wonder how often the issues come up with salt reactors with \"uncontrolled oxidation\"? I know that's one issue I've read about with the lithium battery systems so I see some similarity there. On the battery subject i was just reading a article about zinc based batteries that are showing incredible longevity  which hopefully be the improvement we are looking for in the renewable storage department.\n\nI definitely see all the issues with looking to depend on nuclear and I'm in complete agreement renewables should be the work horse of our near future of conquering our current climate alternating issues. \n\nOne thing I'm thinking about with nuclear is what comes after. At some point we will have to extend off this lonely planet we have here and if we want a future that in any way resembles something from science fiction nuclear power will likely be a big part of that. It's not like we will be able to find wind or solar power we can harness very well on any of the possible targets in the solar system maybe besides the moon with solar. \n\nI simply see too many reasons to not be done with the technology.",

Did the rep tell you that or is that you doing the math?\n\n2) why only 55% offset? Do you have the standard 100 year old Tacoma home and that’s the maximum number of panels your roof can fit?\n\n3) are you certain you can claim the full tax credit in the first year? \n\nYou should understand that net metering is time sensitive but TPU’s net metering isn’t going anywhere for at least a year. In no way am I saying you should wait a year, but depending on what freedom dealer you’re working with they may tell you it’s going away any day…that is not the case.\n\nAny other questions you have just ask, you’ll hear other solar guys trash freedom but you don’t have that many options in western Washington, so you could do worse….like Lumio.",

"comment": "You should see what's going on in the utility-scale commercial side. I just recently toured Proxima Solar in Calfornia - 466,000 panels stretched out over 4 miles in multiple fields with battery storage. It's a Nextera project with energy being sold to Sonoma Clean Energy, the community choice agregator. There are dozens of fields like it going up across the country, many with half a million panels each. Its going to be brutal for the natural gas producers as the demand for their electricity will plummet mid-day but still be high after hours. It will be hard to keep them in business and many are shutting down in California, which will add to grid instability. Dynegy has shut down some at Moss Landing in CA, previousy the biggest one in the state, and is threatening to shut down more. I love solar, but am not sure we've fully thought through the implications. Check out the duck curve and how it's changed over time and look at where it's going. Already there's going to be a glut of solar soon on certain days in the spring and fall. Always seems odd to me we encourage EVs to charge at night when theres no solar on the grid. I guess until we hit the glut it doesn't matter much, but it could help flatten out the curve a little.",

In total since 2019, at least 1325 MW in capacity has been built, at least 700MW in capacity is under construction, at least 2015MW in capacity has PSC approval awaiting construction, and at least 1725MW in capacity for proposed projects are awaiting likely approval at the PSC. In a very few years, the state could quite possibly hit 1/4-1/3 or so total electricity generation from solar farms instead of a few percentage points in 2019.

I wouldn't mind going out with an atheist/agnostic if i could convert them to veganism fairly easily, but sometimes I just can't handle so much work just for a date, know what I mean?",

"comment": "I commend you on wanting to make a commitment to your health. \n\nThis is going to be downvoted, but may I suggest that you look into a couple different dietary lifestyles, including veganism? A paleo diet has remarkably good success rate. I can't even begin to tell you how much it's changed my life. \n\n* If you're overweight, you will lose until your ideal weight\n* Cravings become a thing of the past\n* The limit on carbs makes you age slower (fact - just research \"glycation\"), less prone to diabetes, cancer, alzheimers and a ton of other chronic conditions\n* You have far more energy, and you don't have to eat every few hours (trust me - I was someone who was constantly hungry, and now I can skip meals)\n\nI was a vegan in the past, and I tried to force it, but I just didn't feel right. I finally came upon paleo eating in my 30s, and I've never looked or felt better. My gut is gone (I wasn't fat, but I had a small belly), and my six-pack is coming through for the first time in my life.\n\nMore importantly, my health and energy levels are excellent. Once you learn that saturated fat has been unfairly scape-goated, and that the agricultural industry is responsible for the inappropriate emphasis on grains in a healthy diet, your life may turn around (mine sure as hell did).\n\nYou can choose to be vegetarian on a paleo diet (although it's tough), but not vegan. Vegans just rely on too many carbs, especially grain products, which are incredibly harmful to the body and promote disease. Some vegans are grain-free, and for them it's difficult to acquire adequate sustenance.\n\nThe benefits to eliminating grains and relying on healthy sources of fat and protein are amazing. You HAVE to at least read about it so you can make an informed decision. \n\nHere are some links:\n\n[MarksDailyApple.com](http://marksdailyapple.com) ([here is the author's subjective take](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/vegan-island/) on veganism)\n\n[http://robbwolf.com/](http://robbwolf.com/) - an excellent resource by a guy who really knows his nutrition\n\n[Everydaypaleo.com](http://everydaypaleo.com/) - recipes\n\n**edit:** I actually recommend you try both veganism and a paleo diet (unless you're becoming a vegan for ethical reasons). Just give yourself a few weeks on both diets to acclimate, and see how you feel. It may take a couple weeks of a paleo-style diet before your body becomes \"fat-adapted\", meaning that your body becomes more efficient at burning fat as fuel. I felt better on a paleo diet within 2 days, but sometimes it takes people a little while for their body to stop craving sugar (whether it's in the form of milk chocolate or whole wheat bread).\n\n**edit:** I'm pleasantly surprised to see that my comment hasn't been downvoted (and I actually got one upvote!). Sorry for underestimating you guys!",

Surely your wife can agree that pureeing meat to feed your kid before he is ready, or even has the teeth necessary, to digest it, is pretty strange and unnecessary. My little brother was raised vegetarian and I can't begin to describe the difference it made. While most kids refuse to eat anything but mac &amp; cheese or chicken nuggets, my brother has little interest in meat and **begs** for his favorite fruits, vegetables, and beans. Even though he eats meat now (he's five), it is a very small part of his diet because he's just not that into it. He eats a more well-balanced and healthy diet than any other child I've ever seen, and he is an extremely active little boy.",

We shouldn't put all our vegan eggs in one basket.\n\n&gt;It's not a justification for the vivisection. \n\nWhat vivisection?\n\n&gt;The whole idea that some humans will decide that some nonhumans will be experimented on and then say \"but it's for the sake of all those nonhumans\" is absurd\n\n Is it? We're talking about, at the very least, significantly denting the meat industry. That involves millions of animal's welfare and lives. Not some trifle thing.\n\n &gt;why don't you just grow in vitro human meat and conduct your tests on consenting volunteers?\n\nSure. I don't know which tests you're referring to though. Also, I don't know how willing people will be to purchase human flesh. Defeats the point.\n\n &gt;That's socialization - and people will say the same with synthetic meat.\n\n Sure, but I think it will be much easier to deal with, since it doesn't involve telling people they can't eat meat, just that it's another kind of meat. Also I think the idea of 'vegetarian meat', so to speak, will appeal to a lot of people.\n\n&gt;These things will come as they become profitable - that is the sad reality of capitalism.\n\n I don't see why we can't use the capitalist system against itself, that is to say, use the profit motive and consumerism to destroy the meat industry.\n\n &gt;I don't think we should spend our time creating markets\n\n  What about all those vegan and vegetarian substitutes that already exist? Are they a waste of time?\n\n \n&gt;For animal liberation to become a reality we need people to do more than change their diets\n\n Yes, but people changing their diets is a part of animal liberation. This is what I meant about vegan purism. We should make whatever gains we can (as long as they don't make the movement regress in the long run, but I don't see any good reason why synthetic meat should do this).\n\n \n &gt;we have to attack power structures.\n\n That's a bit abstract. I mean, I agree with you, but I don't see this and synthetic meat as mutually exclusive.\n\n &gt;See you at the barricades comrade.\n\n I'll see *you* at the barricades, comrade ;).",

Following some of the recipes will give you a flavour for vegan cooking and eating. If you're having a hard time easing off the meat, they have an entire section based on meat substitutes.\n\nSome things you may want to try to cook: burritos/tacos, stir fries with either tofu or mock meats, grain bowls (basic recipe: just cook some rice or quinoa in broth and add some black beans or tofu, veggies [try kale and broccoli if you aren't a heavy veggie eater] and a store-bought or home made sauce), pasta, sandwiches (go to a natural food store or whole foods or something and find some pre-marinated TEMPEH.

"comment": "I agree that the majority of the problem is factory farming. If factory farming is the elephant in the room, then pasture raised meat is merely a fly. But the fly is still a problem. We're still talking about morality, which means you still need to place yourself in the other's shoes.\n\nIf you were a cow, would you want to be killed for food? No, of course not. Just because it's part of nature doesn't mean the cow is cool with being killed. The cow doesn't care if it's a lion or a human eating it, all it cares about is not dieing. The difference between us and a lion however, is that we don't have an excuse, we can reflect on our own actions and have the  resources to easily act differently. We aren't bound by an ecological niche that forces us to kill animals for food.\n\n\n\nIf you wouldn't want to be eaten by another animal, and you don't need to eat another animal, then you ought not eat other animals. Basic ethics, don't do onto others what you wouldn't want done on yourself. Just because we consider it \"ok\" for nature doesn't mean it's ok for us. It's only \"ok\" for nature because nature doesn't have a choice, if nature did, then nature would be an evil psychopath. \n\n\"But the cow wouldn't be born if it wasn't to be eaten.\" Yes, this is true, but you wrong no animal by not breeding it. Most of the animals vegan's \"save\" aren't so much saved, as they are never born into a life of exploitation. Again, place yourself in the other's shoes. What's worse, killing your child, or wearing a condom? Breeding animals is basically like having children but of a different species. It ought to come with some level of moral responsibility which includes not killing them needlessly in their adolescence. \n\nYou'll also realize that we do have to treat animals lesser than us. Our footprint is too large, vegans kill animals as well through other aspects of modern life. The goal is to just do it as little as possible within practicality. It's not about valuing animals the same way we value humans, it's about giving animals the respect they deserve that we can afford.\n\nThat being said! Bravo on facing up to factory farming! I think you're at least 90% of the way there already when it comes to respecting animals! :D",

Soy milk in the shelf stable cartons go on sale pretty frequently and you can load up and they stay good for a long time.  Our local grocery store chain does a \"can\" sale every six month and we walk out with cartons full of beans.  Lentils, nutritional yeast, and dried fruit are all much cheaper from the bulk bins as well.  Big bags of generic brown rice can help stretch out all the other food you make too.\n\nIt's definately still possible to do it on the cheap and still buy fresh produce and healthy foods.  You can freeze things like cherries, bananas, berries when they are in season and on sale too.",

It is so hard to discuss these things with people whose livelihood depends on it, I know how that is, I've done it. I don't have a specific point, but I will just say thank you. I'm sure you will care for those sheep like no other can.",

"comment": "Definitely give DIM supplements a go. They’re vegan and cruelty free. Our body naturally makes indole-3-carbinol when we consume cruciferous vegetables, which is what DIM is in a large concentrated amount. It is hard to implement a high amount of these vegetables in to our diets to achieve the needed amount to combat hormonal issues so DIM supplements offer us that. I take DIM for hormonal acne and it’s by far the best and most effective thing I’ve ever taken for my acne.\n\nAlso I might add incase it’s relevant, I came off my contraception pill at the end of 2019 after being on it for 8 years so I was suffering terribly from post pill acne for about 13 months or so. DIM basically stimulates the production of less potent, more beneficial forms of estrogen. It balances testosterone and estrogen so you will find that your periods are less heavy, with decreased PMS symptoms and reduced pain during your cycle too (if any of those symptoms apply to you). \n\nGood luck!",

And lots of people want to take a lazy way out of things with a pill (and suffer the side effects and take _more_ pills for those).  Not saying medications aren't sometimes very necessary, because they can be, but they shouldn't be our go-to for everything.\n\nMy dad actually followed in my footsteps to an extent when I went vegan.  He quit dairy and red meat, not perfect, but it was a huge improvement.  And you know what?  All those medications he had been taking for over a decade didn't help him like a diet change did!  He even told his doctor that he was \"doing it differently now\" and explained.   His doctor then did the same and lost 50 lbs!\n\nJust do you, listen to your body, do what it needs and ignore people that tell you not to.  A vegan diet isn't perfect, there are nutrients we must pay attention to, but this is fairly easy if you just do your due diligence :)",

"comment": "If veganism is supposed to be a serious moral standing, then it needs to hold to serious moral principles.\n\n\"Animal\" is a classification that comes from biological taxonomy. It's an observation we've made of the cell structure of certain organisms. But that's not a feature to build morality out of.\n\nSentience and the ability to suffer and to feel pain is certainly a valid moral framework to establish. We can talk about how it's important to not inflict those harms upon other living things. And we've found that, conveniently, plants don't suffer while many animals do. And therefore it's tempting to say \"I will slaughter plants and not animals for mouth pleasure because plants don't deserve morals while animals do\". But like, what is it about the plant that you care about? A biologist would say \"Well, a plant cell has a cell wall and chloroplasts\" - but that doesn't make it ethical to eat it. What makes it ethical is that it doesn't have any of the features of a nervous system that allow it to suffer.\n\nIf, one day, we miraculously stumbled across a creature which was a plant biologically (did photosynthesis, etc), but could also speak to us and have moral reasoning, then it would be unethical to eat that plant - because it is sentient. Despite being a plant.\n\nNow, in the same way: Imagine something composed of animal cells, but that did not have the ability to think or interact with the world around it. We actually have this: Fungi are closer, biologically, to animals than to plants. Look at a mushroom, a plant, and a human under a microscope and you'll say the mushroom looks closer to the human cell to the plant cell.\n\nAnd yet, the mushroom is ethical to eat - because it's not sentient. It doesn't matter that it's more animal-like than plant-like. It still gets morally considered as acceptable to eat because it's not sentient.\n\nVeganism, in order to not be ridiculous, needs to be built around not exploiting sentient beings. It is convenient that there is an extreme level of overlap between animals and sentience. But they are not the same trait, and an organism that exhibits one without the other should be evaluated critically.",

"comment": "I'm glad you posted this, because people like Mr. Yourofsky are doing alot to hurt animal rights activism. And from what I've gleaned from many vegan messaging boards, these people are all too common among vegans. If we try to build arguments by spreading falsehoods, people will see through us and may reject our morally pertinent points.\n\nAnyway, as other posters have said, humans absolutely have evolved eating meat. Not only that, but we can be almost absolutely positive that many of our ancestors were cannibals. Source: (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0410_030410_cannibal.html)\n\nDoes this somehow make cannibalism moral? Obviously not. The argument Gary is making is evoking the 'naturalistic fallacy.' He is trying to say that since humans originally were herbivores (which they were not) that it is therefore right for us to be herbivores as well. This is a fallacy. Just because something is 'natural,' has no bearing on its' 'moral-ness,' if you will. \n\nWe do not pick and choose the facts that suit our agenda (or make some up) and then present them to get people to arrive at what we believe to be the 'moral' conclusion. We should be honest with ourselves, look at the facts, and then we can decide what the moral consequences are. The fact is, that although humans can consume meat, it is unnecessary. Therefore if it follows that causing unnecessary suffering is immoral, then (humans) eating meat is immoral. When activists are not committed to the truth, they do the animals we need to protect a huge disservice.",
