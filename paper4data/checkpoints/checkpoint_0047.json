Once there's enough cars on the road, it might be possible to start up a battery swapping business that can compete with those prices.  \n\nI would offer two options.\n\n1. You own your battery, as you do now.  When you swap, you lease a battery.  The leased battery could be of any size.  As you drive across the country, you get a fresh battery at each swap station, but eventually you bring the car back to the original swap station and your battery is returned.  The price you pay could be based on how many swaps you did, size of the leased battery, and/or duration of the lease.  Not too different from what Tesla is doing.\n\n2. For frequent long distance travelers, you can sell me your battery and permanently lease one from me.  The advantages of this are; a.) you don't have to worry about returning to the original swap station to get your battery back after a trip, b.) you don't have to worry about a battery going bad or loosing range over its lifetime, just visit a swap station and get a different one, c.) swap costs could be included in the lease, thus streamlining the swap process, d.) you could lease a smaller battery for a lower monthly charge, when you're around town commuting, e.) you can easily take advantage of new, more power dense battery technology as it becomes available.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0036673619761131704,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3432012500028481,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20576142063360003,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.331413054633934,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19484814678736784,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32072358767794124,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1853413381613791,"ev_1":-0.14317552771761757,"ev_2":-0.17460395240521695,"ev_3":-0.14232172723691291,"ev_4":-0.0787298185642572,"ev_5":-0.07806196045693108,"ev_6":-0.1793730404262081},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

And the important is the average, not the worst case.\n\nWell, let's wait and see, but remember the huge industrial base around ICE and the lack of batteries to make any significant transition to fully electric vehicles by the end of this decade.

You're estimating very poorly, range on a 60 kwh battery pack, which is small but not unlikely on a Jeep, would be measured in days of constant use, not minutes.  But if you calculate based on a small 60 kwh pack, you're pushing ~300 miles of rock crawling range even on that very low estimate.  \n\nUneven terrain, weight... these things have far less impact than you think at very low speed use.  The largest impediment to range is the inverse squared law of aerodynamics which will never come into play on an offroad expedition.  If the jeep is rock crawling while towing 20+ more Jeeps, your belief that range will be poor makes a lot more sense, otherwise there is ijust no way they can make a vehicle that inefficient.

In the US without incentives the base model 3 is $39,500 compared to ~$37,000 for the average car transaction price.  That leaves a lot of room for much cheaper vehicles.  Between myself, sister and parents none of us have ever come close to spending the average transaction price for a car.  When I do buy an EV (something I plan to do soon) it will be by far the most expensive car I've ever owned, likely by a factor of at least 2, perhaps as much as 3.\n\nSince this thread started with MEB price charts it makes sense to compare with MQB cars.  The base Golf starts at $22,000, quite a bit less than model 3 as well as announced ID3 prices.  A more feature-comparable golf to model 3 is $27,500, still more than $10,000 less.  ID3 first edition is $33,000, but that doesn't come with adaptive cruise control.  Pricing hasn't been announced for the launch edition plus that does have ACC, which I would consider mandatory if spending over 30k.  Guesswork tells us MEB will be somewhere between 125-150% of roughly equivalent MQB cars.  Still just outside the window incentives can fully cover, but certainly getting close.

That's not a likely place where it would be able to do its top-secret vehicle development work and build its IP. It's possible, of course, that Alpha is doing that work elsewhere or will use contract manufacturing services.\n\nTo make some essential statements clear: Alpha Motor Corporation declares that it is a sole entity unrelated to any other entity or organization, that it doesn't share a business address with any other EV company, and that it is a private company unrelated to any other entity or sources of finance. And as a private company that hasn't requested any money from potential customers, it's under no obligation to show its cards.\n\nThat said, we'd be remiss to mention that the address is exactly the same one, down to the suite, as what was formerly listed by the U.S. arm of Neuron EV, a here-and-gone company that was reportedly based both in Shanghai and Los Angeles. \n\nThere's also another apparent coincidence: Paperwork for Alpha Motor Corporation and Neuron Corporation includes—albeit in different time frames, not overlapping—what appears to be some of the same names, some in signature.\n\nTo take a step back, Neuron New Energy Vehicle was founded by Gang Zheng, a venture capital investor in China, and Neuron Corporation, known as Neuron EV, was registered as a California company in 2018, signed by Edward Lee, with Lee and Michelle Quan as executives. \n\nOne startup went dark, another sparked\n\nNeuron’s website followed a similar design and layout to Alpha’s, and it originally put out sustainability-rich language that is close to Alpha’s messaging—although Neuron’s model itself, with a full line of modular trucks, including a Class 8 semi, was far more vast and ambitious. Then at some point later in 2019 it went silent. Green Car Reports tried to get in touch with Neuron EV around that time to check the status of its projects and received no reply; sometime soon after, its website was taken offline.\n\nIn June 2020, paperwork was posted for the dissolution of Neuron Corporation. Then two more things happened. Neuron EV was registered separately as a new California company in August 2020, indicating a corporate address in an office building in adjacent Tustin, near John Wayne Airport—with Gang Zheng as a director. Alpha Motor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware that same month, with Michelle Quan and Edward Lee listed as executives, then registered at the same Irvine address in September 2020. \n\nUnder the new incarnation, Michael Adam Smith—a financial advisor—initially plugged in as the executive officer. Then in a Statement of Information to California in January 2021, the company lists a different Lee, Kevin Lee (signed), as its CEO with Michelle Quan the secretary, CFO, and agent.\n\nDespite all the apparent coincidences featuring Lee and Quan, Alpha Motor Corporation asserted to Green Car Reports—now in multiple emailed statements—that it is unrelated to Neuron. It also stated that the Wolf is not based on an existing production vehicle, current or past. And it stated that it is not funded by Gang Zheng.\n\nThere are a few things about the Wolf launch that don’t entirely impress as statements made by those who are EV-savvy. A release accompanying the video used peculiar language for an EV startup, noting that the Wolf is “a versatile pickup truck motorized by an all-battery electric power system.” It said the company “is set to accelerate vehicle development by automating the latest digital efficiencies,” and mentioned a “precision virtual validation” enabled by the AMD Threadripper Pro. \n\nNo, that’s not referring to a manufacturing system or a solution involving robotics; the Threadripper Pro is a high-end processor for gaming and design workstations. Design software like Catia would be needed to design a complete electric vehicle and would likely be even more costly.\n\nWho is the \"we\" behind Alpha?\n\nThe most disjointed part of the video launch of the Alpha Wolf concept is the coffee guys, Boyt and Lijewski. They spoke with a “we” consistently enough to indicate that they’re a part of the automaker. They appear to be forming a corporate voice in lieu of the actual people behind the vehicle.”","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0018829823626826208,"1.1.1_stance":-0.14910682250329424,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14877247720617687,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.026098713278770447,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2010562867997818,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2226936963949304,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006786719971690521,"ev_1":-0.22193690147757714,"ev_2":-0.0259190967772156,"ev_3":-0.016295056271095138,"ev_4":-0.015501415400649421,"ev_5":-0.051526675815694034,"ev_6":-0.09149831087658337},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

And that is fanaticism. It's a low-value tribal behavior that doesn't elevate the discourse, rather just gives everyone some dopamine to reinforce their priors.\n\n(And of course everyone thinks the reasons they shit on things they don't like are legitimate reasons. I have blacklisted VW Group since Dieselgate, and I am firmly convinced that is the right thing to do.)\n\n> Not at all. They are working on it because that's their job, and because that's what their bosses are telling them to do, largely because that's what's going to keep the stock price high. Engineers don't decide what they work on; they work on what they are told to work on.\n\nYou say \"not at all\" (as in, the engineers do not believe the effort is futile). But in your previous comment, and later in this comment, you reinforce that's the opposite of your opinion: specifically, that the Tesla engineers know the FSD effort is futile.\n\n> For reference, I am an engineer, and I've worked on a ton of projects that I and everyone working on them knew were doomed from day 1. That's very common. \n\nFor the record, I don't agree that this comparison fits. The people working on the FSD Beta project seem genuinely optimistic when they talk about it.\n\n> Sometimes you try to come up with a way to explain to the big brain executives why what they're asking for is impossible\n\nI am familiar with highly bureaucratic companies where this is certainly true. But again, the Tesla engineers do not seem (to me) to be so afflicted. Though, I don't think there's a way for us outsiders to know for sure.\n\n> Believing something is possible, and believing it's possible in a reasonable timeframe with the hardware they have access to are two very different things.\n\nTrue, but not really relevant considering earlier you said that the engineers knew it was simply not possible, with no qualifications.\n\n> I don't necessarily think it's impossible to make a car that can drive as well as our better than a human, but I also don't think Tesla or anyone else is even remotely close to pulling it off.\n\nAre you also not impressed with the Waymo and Cruise autonomous vehicles?\n\n> You're not going to convince me of this one, sorry. Allowing non-test drivers to fiddle around with an experimental system which steers, accelerates, and brakes for them on uncontrolled streets is reckless to the point of being unethical. \n\nI am not trying to convince you. I am just informing you that I strongly disagree. In fact, I feel generally safer next to someone using FSD Beta (or a Waymo) than I feel next to many human drivers I pass on a daily basis. It's disturbingly routine to see people driving while looking at their phone or worse.\n\nI think suppressing the progress of autonomous technology by limiting its current reasonably-safe use would be unethical.\n\n> Particularly because they know that people aren't going to use it as intended, because the intended use isn't actually very useful: what is the point of a car that drives itself, but requires constant vigilance from the driver?\n\nThe point of the current FSD Beta technology in its Level 2 form, at least to me as a consumer, is to marvel at the advent of this technology and help with its training. Yes, it is more effort for me to drive with FSD Beta enabled because I increase my vigilance (admitting this betrays the human condition). When using FSD Beta, I am no longer responsible for my own driving behavior; I am responsible for the behavior of another driver, whose style and decisions are not the same as my own. But it's easy for me to intervene whenever I am not satisfied with its behavior.\n\n> It has already killed a number of people, and while most of them weren't using it as intended, the fact that it's still even enabled on random people's cars is insane.\n\nI have not yet seen a credible report of FSD Beta killing anyone. Are you referring to Autopilot? If you blame Autopilot for killing someone, you should just broaden your scope and point out that cars kill people. All sorts of features of cars have killed people. Cruise control. The accelerator pedal. Windows. Fuel. Seat-belts. The sound system.\n\n> absolutely nonsensical design choices for no other reason than Elon Musk thought it would be cool.\n\nI do not think the Cybertruck is using a 48V low-voltage architecture or steer-by-wire because Elon Musk alone thought it would be cool. Again, from hearing the vehicle's engineers talk about it, it seems *the team* thought 48V and steer-by-wire would be cool. And for whatever it's worth, I agree. I don't own a Cybertruck and don't plan to, but I do want those two features in my next car for sure.\n\nAgain, this doesn't really seem to qualify for the use of the word \"clusterfuck,\" unless you use that level of hyperbole casually. Yes, it was delayed. Yes, it's silly. Yes, I'm not interested in owning one. But a clusterfuck? I don't see it.\n\nYou are obviously entitled to your opinion, and it seems you are very passionate about it. You don't have to ever drive a Cybertruck. Just like I don't ever have to drive a VW Group vehicle.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.007323329492161672,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3063123510282407,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15846477588638663,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.053970117665206395,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15967338415794075,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2143555319021171,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06959116793586873,"ev_1":-0.1376573211433594,"ev_2":-0.08931595767110896,"ev_3":-0.17966603939324463,"ev_4":-0.15209107861100885,"ev_5":-0.13734264884745548,"ev_6":-0.07400337090683944},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I guess we can always mine landfills if we ever do run out.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00117875924964513,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3437207506414094,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21136687750889707,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21722642002636283,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21066437032883104,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22583314076953176,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02906507273049404,"solar_1":-0.003321054854798907,"solar_2":-0.08226751205074834,"solar_3":-0.0961648596034678,"solar_4":-0.014275380586695974,"solar_5":-0.004609130114355746,"solar_6":-0.0008002485616695291,"solar_7":-0.001264680545621862,"solar_8":-0.0006589258991880342,"solar_9":-0.0319277368641148,"solar_10":-0.12511708302190527,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.13798016866494436},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against (the author expresses a need for hydrocarbons and mentions solar as a missed opportunity)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

So we're likely going to see a massive hike in electricity rates for non-solar customers in the next decade... \n\nAlso, you can correlate the rise of utility-scale solar with the uncapping of the ITC. If we really wanted a consumer friendly solar policy, which protected consumers and exacted the largest value out of solar technologies and subsidies, we'd eliminate the ITC, pass cap-and-trade, and expand PURPA to allow federal net-metering of &lt;20kW 100% emmissionless micro-generators. But our politicians suck and the power companies have our public utility commissions by the balls.\n\nAlso, lithium ion batteries will increase the price of electricity for the non-participant as much, if not more, than solar.\n\nAll this said, I sincerely believe we're transitioning to a 100% solar economy. Electricity is going to go up over the next 100 years, but 200 years from now, electricity could be free and we could be living in the Star Trek universe.

I might just be a newbe clasping at a dream here, but I would like to set up my little farm to be as automated as possible.     \n\nNothing wrong with that, and *a lot* is possible, including measuring the moisture content of the soil to automatically water the plants, adjust the day/night light intensity for the fish, run the pumps intermittently to save (battery) energy, or whatever, the best advice I can give is to take small steps and study/understand the electronic part so you know what's happening and why, and build up confidence for the next step.    \n\n*I know I make it sound easy, but electronic stuff is what I did for a living.*    \n     \nHad a quick search for aerator pumps, they are either cheap/230Vac, expensive/big, and [battery operated pumps](http://www.ebay.com/bhp/battery-air-pump), no idea how long they last, and you'll need to solder a few wires to replace the 1.5V D-cell batteries and use it with a DC-DC converter (or leave those batteries in place and use the whole unit for 'backup' if the solar power fails.

Even Tesla's CTO said it's not a good idea.\n\nTo give you something to work off (in metric) the sun puts out 1kw of energy per square meter. An optimally oriented PV panel can only capture about 20% of that, so 200watts.\n\nSo every hour your 1sqm of panels produces 200watts.\n\nLet's say you have a garage that's 36sqm as 6mx6m is pretty common. If you were able to cover the entire thing in panels you'd produce 7200 watts or. 7.2kilowatts of energy per hour (7.2kWh)\n\nTotally dependant on your location is your solar hours but for example most good solar regions have 6 hours of good solar.\n\nIf that the case then your garage would produce 43.2kWh of energy per day.\n\nThen you'd need to store it, well the Powerwall 2 has storage of 13.5kWh but it loses 10% when you charge it. So really you end up with 38.88kWh required. That means you need 3 Powerwalls to be able to store what the roof is generating.\n\nNote: everything I've said above is best case. You need good clean panels that are optimally oriented and have good solar access and of course lots of sunny days.\n\nNote2: not one has said if you can charge a Tesla vehicle via the Powerwall at this point it's likely not directly possible other than using it to power a power point and charge off that.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0005180715743335895,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20839607147506253,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.29656944626833187,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19482987755790243,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.34581026056992836,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2748398719043035,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02580875159765128,"solar_1":-0.11958283300764379,"solar_2":-0.1974892110819786,"solar_3":-0.17848584267005663,"solar_4":-0.03319729996839522,"solar_5":-0.22593986301585525,"solar_6":-0.003914973203791305,"solar_7":-0.008068024197806759,"solar_8":-0.00839082266187082,"solar_9":-0.02868129483645987,"solar_10":-0.1617921421178193},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against particular but pro (opposes specific instance of storing solar energy in Powerwalls, but supports the concept of solar energy)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I saw someone else commented on this but I just wanted to respond to you as well..\n\n&gt;\"The heavy upcharge is an additional amount that would replace out 100amp service that is from the 1930's\" but then you also go on to say \"2 More panels will add $3000 to the cost of the system\"\n\n...so to me it sounds like the \"Heavy $3500 upcharge\" is actually really two charges: 1 $500 charge for a Main service panel upgrade (knob fuses?) and a increase system cost of $3000 for 2x (SPR-X22-360-D-AC Modules at a cost of $4.16/W.\n\nNot sure if I am reading that correctly, but no offense, a solar installer upgrading your MSP from a 100A option to something larger is not just them adding a $3500 upcharge. Especially considering that adds an extra 720W to your system size. \n\nHaving said that, they could possibly look into tying in via a line-side interconnection (depending on your jurisdiction/AHJ rules) and  avoid the extra charge for service upgrade. However,  if your service is really from the 1930's, you may at least want to consult with an electrician.\n\nTwo other things you mentioned that are important: Panel degradation &amp; inverter warranty/lifetime.\n\nGenerally speaking, a lot of inverter manufacturers offer full warranties. So something like a solar edge inverter, you can easily get it with a 25 year warranty from the manufacterer for ~400-500bucks or so. Having said that, it is generally considered a best solar practice to inform customers that they *may*have to replace a central inverter over its lifetime. Just so if it DOES happen, it is not a case where the customer had no idea it could. But to say it is likely is not true.\n\nAdditionally, even if your inverted went bad, a ~7000W inverter in 10 years will NOT cost $10k to replace. It seems to me the sales guy was just trying to sell the SPR Microinverter/equinox/AC module package. As mentioned before, this is a really good system, but that doesn't mean that all central string inverters are bad and require 10 year costly replacement. \n\nAnd lastly, degredation warrantys are pretty standard in the industry. The warranty is only as good as the company is. It does you no good if the company goes out of business. Having said that, generally speaking modules degrade at a fairly \"normal rate\" throughout their life (assuming the manufacturer is not shit).\n\nEach module manufacturer will generally have their own production guarantees.

I posted out of pure frustration and sarcasm.\n\nI've known this was coming since James Hansen testified in 1988. It jived then with everything I was taught in ecology class in 1973, the first year my college hired a professor and added it to the curriculum. It was also reminiscent of a chapter in my high school science textbook in 1967, although in that book they estimated 200 years before it would become a problem. (computing was barely a thing then, and modelling more distant years away.)\nBut I knew that it was going to take an ENORMOUS amount of political will, and a leader who could  INSPIRE Americans to ~~sacrifice~~ some of the 'good life' to save the planet. And I was hopeful, voting then working for the election of leaders who might do that. Instead,  we got 12 years of oil industry Bushes (and Cheney). We also got the Citizens United decision, and the end of politics that wasn't purchased by industry.\n\nI did take my eyes off the ball while raising kids, driving a minivan instead of a 36mpg car, buying a too-big house and a 40 mile commute to have land and life outside of the city.\n\nWatching the scientific evidence roll in, I think I concluded in about 2007 that we had already reached the permafrost tipping point, and action would be too little too late. Climate mitigation and adaptation would be the next imperative.\n\nEVERY interaction I've had about climate with another person in my current life always entailed skepticism if not a slap-down rude &amp; crude reply on their part (did I mention I live in an rabid conservative area?)  But even my husband won't acknowlege the science. \n\nSo, I decided to just fix me, to live with the smallest footprint I can. I first added insulation to my house. We have a geothermal electric heat. Then I spent retirement money on a solar array, and bought an 100% electric car. I recycle, compost and am trying to minimize everywhere. \n\nI've attended two clinate marches in DC, but now feel it's not worth the carbon to get there. Marches do nothing.\n\nI wallowed in my anger, but finally found some people who actually care about climate, and watched this younger generation not give up the fight, and frankly have been surprised that articles like this one posted even give us time left yet.\n\nBut you go on, and fight the good fight for me. Maybe we can win office, get  back into the Paris accord next year. If we can quell the right wing into submission without a civil war it will be a miracle.\n\nBut have you seen our nation? Do you think we can do anything this year? NO.

It may not be an issue now, but imagine if 40% of households had solar and were trying to sell at a profit?\n\nThis is why almost all net metering agreements cap to current usage.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0008166902892601987,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11651053769855366,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21114264020327678,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.16545799498756728,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07261640667314039,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24533732390525895,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.029512415732218262,"solar_1":-0.17933923531866944,"solar_2":-0.0021328994965491197,"solar_3":-0.16927859195834571,"solar_4":-0.1410641160057974,"solar_5":-0.005311122845644907,"solar_6":-0.002724826837948058,"solar_7":-0.0014760485404015828,"solar_8":-0.004172444434516365,"solar_9":-0.27123434587944456,"solar_10":-0.17769720451906323},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

A generator may also be sized large enough to run your AC (not sure about that, but worth asking). They run a few thousand dollars...much, much cheaper than a battery. They also have a longer expected lifespan. That also eliminates any concern about solar array size matching with a battery *and* the need to even bother with IQ8s for the \"solar backup\" function since you could just use your natural gas generator.\n\nYour most cost-effective option for covering outages is #5, for sure. Otherwise, #7 without a generator and maybe getting your \"solar backup\" thing going might be interesting, but definitely an added cost and wait vs. #2 (or #5) for likely not a huge benefit.

But I would like to add a few things. First, safety. Are your solar panels connected to one big inverter or does each panel have a micro-inverter? If there is only one inverter, the panels are most likely in series and that means very high voltages (like 400vdc) So precautions must be taken when disconnecting a panel. If each panel has its own micro inverter it’s much easier and the voltage is less than 40vdc. You will need to plan ahead and purchase a few things. I recommend:\n- MC4 disconnect tool. This is to unplug your positive and negative panel wires \n- 20ft MC4 solar extension cable, in case you want to leave panel mounted on the roof. \n- Solar charge converter. I recommend Victron, but you can get a cheap Chinese one for less than $25 that will work fine for emergencies, but I suggest testing it. \n- 12v battery. You can use a car battery in a pinch, but I would recommend a deep cycle marine or truck battery. \n- 120v 1000watt inverter.

The media also told them ALL solar panels contain \"cadmium, arsenic, gallium, tellurium and lead\", and all of it will just leech out of that solar panel into your drinking water /s. Oh and don't forget rare earth metals! There is also that one where to power your house you'd need enough solar panels to cover a football field. Most people also don't realize that solar costs have dropped, most people I asked still thought solar costs way over $5 per watt. Though a part of that may be due to national installers being overpriced plus the high total cost when financing over 20-25 years. \n\nSo I can imagine it being quite a hurdle to explain to people that most of what they heard are lies or half truth at best without sounding like a used car salesman.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2650675963221787,"1.1.1_stance":-0.18801253232411871,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1814262726010464,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14757634678458834,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.39330287946395404,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19206936962138244,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.15259771530206004,"solar_1":-0.2114740863372636,"solar_2":-0.16354874226406155,"solar_3":-0.20352242935436088,"solar_4":-0.060363574716296185,"solar_5":-0.07297082173288129,"solar_6":-0.1693087763803002,"solar_7":-0.029019255944149336,"solar_8":-0.04690677908850679,"solar_9":-0.03037016316251595,"solar_10":-0.19764988970517466},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Some of the recent units will also allow generators, added solar, wind/hydro, etc. Your Enphase only allows solar and grid, shutting down EVERYTHING when the grid goes down.\n\nI've done solar PV for over 30 years, lately I have been doing a LOT of solar upgrading, to units like Sol-Ark 15k or EG 18k units. These accept your existing Enphase, grid, battery, generator, added solar or whatever. \n\nThe INVERTER is just part of a power managment system. By power managment I mean it can change voltage, it can transform frequency, as in a generator frequency to home/system frequency, accept battery power (DC), etc. It's not either solar OR generator, it's solar AND generator if you need the extra power.\n\nPeople complain about the cost, but this unit will 'Spoof' a grid supply letting you use a grid tie only inverter with batteries, and it will accept batteries at the same time. \n\nIt's been DECADES in coming, some of us have cobbled together several components to do this, but cost and restrictions have kept it small... Until now since the Sol-Ark units can gang up to 9 together to do the entire job. Just add another unit and have another 15k available.\n\nThe power frequency output (home power) is so stable, and responds to frequency shift, you can add grid tied inverters on the lines to expand.\nFor example, I have cabins fairly far from the home, shop and units. \n\nI simply slapped solar on the cabin roofs, installed a much cheaper grid tied inverter on the building and the cabins \"Think\" they are connected to the power grid. If rhe cabins produce excess power, and they often do since they aren't occupied a bunch, the power gets transfered and stored in batteries or used elsewhere. The big power managemt inverter allows it so it's not stand alone wasted power. \n\nUnless it's a very expensive transformer generator, the generator you use is one or the other. It's either solar or its generator. No blending...\n\nShould you not have one or the other disconnected and the power comes on, you will smoke both and a very good chance of starting a fire.

I don't feel like doing a whole AMA since I don't think I could answer every question, but I'll totally give you some ideas since you're interested. \n\nAnything you can find online that's DIY/stuff from your kitchen/whatever, as long as it's vegan give it a shot. You never know that one thing that might be the solution for your skin specifically that no one else knew about trying. For me, as I mentioned, coconut oil is perfect for my skin.\n\nSince labelled vegan cosmetics are really expensive, it's important to know which chemicals are plant derived. Typically, beeswax and carmine are what you have to look out for, as well as testing on animals. Carmine is in almost all things that have red or pink coloring, however you can find red lipstick (one of my favorite things) and blush, etc, that doesn't have it. The prices for these products are through the roof, though, and an easy thing to do for red coloring is to mix a dark juice, like a beet or cranberry juice, with petroleum jelly from a brand that doesn't test on animals. This makes a great lip gloss and a blush if you use it very sparingly on your cheeks.\n\n\n I use Dr. Bronner's as shampoo as well as soap but if your hair is longer, that isn't really an option as it leaves the hair tangled and strange feeling in general. A lot of people have success with baking soda and apple cider vinegar (I haven't personally tried it, but it's a popular no-poo thing). As always, though, you can find vegan brands.\n\nMost importantly, you need to do your best to sleep well, drink plenty of water and keep your skin cleansed and the rest becomes a lot easier. You'll save A LOT of time doing makeup and worrying about your hair, and you'll probably look better for it if you slowly wean yourself off of wearing a lot and focus on the health of your body to reflect your beauty :)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0059793417652448016,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28229063659427567,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1528895541957522,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19983217582202564,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.41891464181406646,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21845782091759558,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.30974312656083686,"diet_1":-0.13405573776496263,"diet_2":-0.011788951363996603,"diet_3":-0.06799756901455112,"diet_4":-0.011640231642862394,"diet_5":-0.01176407663175875,"diet_6":-0.0599137584407193,"diet_8":-0.0008767322457667129,"diet_9":-0.004147154972694504,"diet_10":-0.1326195566992586,"diet_11":-0.03540613519726321,"diet_13":-0.004639278068983306,"diet_14":-0.2395545937870196,"diet_17":-0.009638629515393404},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Celebrating 24 years this year! And you're spot on about how much has changed. I first went vegetarian after a school trip to a children's farm during which I got to meet some beautiful baby lambs. I went home and my mom had happened to cook lamb for dinner. The connection clicked for me and that was that – I never ate meat again. \n\nTo research stuff like nutrition and recipes, I had to take two buses to the closest library and wait in line to use the one computer with internet :-) I got half an hour to one hour each time, depending on how many people wanted to use it! As I was researching, I came across some really basic websites explaining veganism. It didn't take much to understand that torturing animals across their life course for dairy, eggs, etc. was almost worse than outright killing them, so I went vegan pretty quickly. \n\nBack then, _no-one_ knew what the word vegan meant. Most people didn't even pronounce it properly! You'd have to repeat it a few times every time, and define it too. That was often followed by a long explanation and usually some dismissive counterarguments. The latter hasn't changed lol\n\nAt the time, there was one meat substitute available at the supermarket – a nice grilled 'beef' burger. It was a lovely treat! There was no cheese, chocolate, ice cream, chips, or cookies, so I was easily a lot healthier hahaha. But I'm _so_ grateful for all the pioneers and thinkers and experimenters who've given us this rich world of blue cheese and camambert and chocolate and creamy ice cream. And I'm so happy to now have amazing fish and sausages and the like! \n\nI'm still so delighted when I go to cafes or restaurants locally and around the world and vegan options are just a given on the menu. Happy Cow has also made my life so much better. And I'm eternally excited by how huge veganism has become. I love that it's such a significant movement and how much impact that has each year.

Most are spiked with all kinds of unhealthy stuff. About 16-20 ounces of cold purified water in a powerful blender with 15 cashews, let it rip, there's your *very inexpensive* dairy-free milk. You can sub this for cooked plain oatmeal (very healthy, good for diabetics) or a few raw almonds.\n\n2. stick to plant protein powder without dangerous artificial sweeteners: erythritol, Splenda/sucralose and Aspartame.\n\n3. you will need to take a B12 supplement (either nutritional yeast, or a natural methylcobalamin pill).\n\n4. many vegans will initially feel weaker; it's mostly due to lack of iron that comes form meat. Make sure lentils & spinach are a staple your diet and talk to your doctor about possible getting a *prescription* iron pill (supplements aren't regulated & no one knows for sure how/if they're properly absorbed).\n\n5. Avoid vegan foods with palm oil (just as bad as bacon grease for your arteries), coconut oil (at least keep it to a minimum; it's in a lot of vegan butter spreads). [This one is the best of the lot](https://www.target.com/p/miyoko-39-s-organic-salted-oat-milk-cultured-vegan-plant-based-butter-12oz/-/A-79687754?ref=tgt_adv_xsp&AFID=google&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000108139145&CPNG=PLA_Produce%2BFloral%2BShopping_Local%7CProduce%2BFloral_Ecomm_Food_Bev&adgroup=SC_Produce%2BFloral&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=c&location=9032252&targetid=pla-659148908296&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMImvWawKWDgwMV9YVaBR1m6gU5EAQYAyABEgIChfD_BwE) if you're in the US.

Keep the garbanzo beans humming there and all kinds of beans all the time. A medium size bowl is very filling and will tie you up for hours.\n\n8. weight-wise: I lost over 90 lbs after I went vegan (no joke). I combined it with *daily* exercise but it started out *very* light so I wouldn't get discouraged the first month. If you can start on a recumbent bike and do 20 minutes a day. It may not seem like a lot but do it everyday; the effects will add up and you'll see a difference in your mental health (and physical health of course) in about a month.
