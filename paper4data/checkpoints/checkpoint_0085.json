"comment": "Exactly. That's what makes EVs so great.\n\nWell, you're down to only a few choices then, assuming you're not in a CARB compliance state (e.g., California):\n\nThe Nissan LEAF, which during cold weather might not make the journey without charging at work. \n\nFord Focus EV, may have range issues too. Small cargo area.\n\nThe i-MiEV, which won't make it without charging at work (mostly because of the 70 MPH highway speeds). \n\nTesla Model S. \n\nBMW i3, though it could also have range issues like the LEAF.\n\nAnd... um... well... That's about it right now. There are a few new EVs coming to market in 2015, but in limited numbers.",

"comment": "The quote from Issac Singer is a good start. \"In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.\"\n\nOur willingness to oppress animals is what gives way to the mentality that it's alright to treat a different group of humans that we look down on as \"animals\".  The need to change humanity's mindset to all sentient creatures deserve freedom not \"the creatures we feel like deserve freedom\" - I truly believe that if all mankind had a mentality that it was not okay to treat animals like this, that it would be a significant step in uniting all of humanity finally. \n\nI've always known in the back of my mind that I was never okay with the the constant use of antibiotics and growth hormone.  As my biologist wife says, \"It will only lead to an epidemic of antibiotic resistant strains of disease that we will be powerless to stop\"  \n\nWhile being vegan/vegetarian isn't a pass to a healthier life style (Plenty of junk food that is vegan!) it is certain a start for a shift in mentality. \n\nThe line \"animal agriculture is more devastating to our natural environment then all other human activities combined\" - Considering how completely optional this is, it just isn't acceptable.  In my mind it would be comparable to if electric cars where just as good as gas cars, but cheaper and safer, and everyone just decided to keep using gas cars.\n\nLastly, I read someone state that it wasn't as hard as you'd think, that it is just kind of a \"switch\" that happens, and I can very much agree with this mentality.  If the right information hits you in the right way, it will be easy to say good bye to animal based products.  Even last night, my wife surprised me with bringing home dinner, just a fast food stop, a corn dog, chicken strips and ice cream.  I made it about 1/4 through the ice cream before I just couldn't do it anymore and I tried to work myself UP to eating the chicken/corn dog, but in the end, I just couldn't, and that's when I told her my decision to stop eating animal based products as much as possible going forward.  When you hear that animal based product alternatives have increased in sales by 20-40% yearly, it does hold power over the mentality \"I am just one person, who cares if I eat meat\" at least, for me.  It did strengthen my resolve that this is the right direction to go, and that, even if it's just me (and maybe my wife!) it is significant enough to make that stance. \n\nMy thoughts aren't all complete yet. It was a mind shattering couple of days, but, I am actually looking forward to this change.",

You'll need to download the document and open it with Excel to edit it.\n\nLooking at your ROI, this varies by state as well (that is why I did not include that). Here in Louisiana, you can get a 50% tax credit (refundable) of the first $25,000 of the cost of the system, and then the 30% Federal Tax credit (non-refundable, but rolls-over excess to next years). So I could effectively come out of pocket only $5,000 for a $25,000 system (which is about 7 KWH system).\n\nWith the $5,000 in mind, I can look at my chart, and see that after 4-5 years, my savings with the solar system, the $5,000 OOP will be nulled, and every year after that, i'd consider it \"savings\".\n\nEven if the systems degrade to %85 at 20 years, if I could get 4-5 years out of it and break even, i'd be happy, though I'd imagine the system would last longer than that (30 year warranty).\n\nAbout tiered rates, that's out of my league. In Louisiana we are $X/kwh, no tiers, much simpler.",

"comment": "It's fascinating that people talk about this 90 second battery swap as if it's being done all the time when it has only been done twice in a Tesla demonstration, and then many of the same people say that Hydrogen cars are just \"bullshit\" future tech that will never be widespread because of all these imaginary obstacles.  \n\nHere's a pretty good argument that the Tesla Battery Swap is a hoax so that Tesla can get carbon credits. I don't know enough about these credits yet to determine if this guy is credible or not but he makes a good argument.  \nhttp://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/12/21/the-tesla-battery-swap-is-the-hoax-of-the-year/  \n\nFrom the comment section (many good points raised, here's one):  \n\n&gt;Greg says: \n\n&gt;What does not make sense in the whole process is that you are not going to drive away a leave your $18k battery pack for someone else. \nThis would immediately loose you your guarantee on your $18k investment. You now have a second hand battery pack of unknown origin. \nAs the general stock of batteries ages, you risk picking up a weak unit for your brand new Tesla at the first “refill”. \nThe demo, however irrelevant to real life filling station scenarios, seems technically feasible so I doubt it’s a fraud in that sense. \nHowever, since this does not currently exist, even at one single location in the world for customer use, it DOES NOT EXIST. It does not merit a single ZEV point , ever. \nIt is a scam which has been approved and regulated by CARB. \nThe ordinary man in the street is subsidising rich men’s toys. \nAlberto does well to point out this is recognised by CARB but they just kicked it down the road. So it’s not oversight.\n\n[Battery Swapping has been tried before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Place)  \n\nIf this subreddit is going to be against Hydrogen Electrics maybe that should be clear on the sidebar. Right now it says \"News and product pages for anything that runs on electrons and gets people from point A to point B.\"  \n\nHydrogen Electrics are EV's with their own power plant. They have existed at least since 1999 and everyone is going to hear a lot more about them sooner rather than later. It's a fact.",

The *whole reason* I became a vegan *was* because of environmental impacts, so it is extremely important to me. *But* nobody is perfect. Not everyone has an electric car. For those who use public transportation, almost always fossil fuel is still being used. Same with transportation of goods like I said.\n\n\n\nNot to mention there's energy from the energy sector, which also contributes to GHG emissions *and* other pollutions, such as noise and light pollution that disturb nocturnal species and are messing with them.\n\n\n\nIf anyone is coming off as pretentious, it's you. You're getting upset over him/her getting an ahimsa tattoo and *reprimanding them* for *not doing enough*.\n\n\n\nSorry, had to say it.",

Replacing the anode material in the batteries they're producing means a retooling within the factory, not scrapping it. You will read many such articles about improvements to the battery chemistry over the next 10 years.

"comment": "Heya EV folks - (disclosures: I work for Plugless and we are an aftermarket accessory). Totally understand, if you are a hypermiler or your primary concern is efficiency than Plugless may not be for you and thanks for saving the planet.\nFor the same reason, people might chose a particular EV (an i3 over a Tesla or one Tesla over another) and the differences in efficiency are within the same sorts of ranges as our system - or taking mass-transit or riding a bike for that matter. For PHEVs, we certainly increase electric miles driven (with Plugless you never forget to charge). Big picture, wireless EV charging makes EV ownership more appealing to the average car owner = more and more people switching to EV. (In our conversations with the EV manucacturers they tell us that perceptions - right or wrong - of corded charging suppresses new EV purchases for the masses. Note - our efficiency rating is in our FAQs - the 3rd FAQ. As for mechanical systems (arms, lifting the pad etc) in our early stages of development we certainly considered this but the design philosophy was to minimize as many moving parts, friction points and maintenance issues (this mirrors the many benefits of EVs). Charge on!",

The base Model 3 has DCFC standard with the best DCFC network and charges over 30% faster. It can also use the extensive Tesla Destination Charging network with HPWC’s at many hotels, resorts, and BnB’s. The Model 3 has better shoulder room and rear headroom. The Model 3 has a longer base warranty with 4/50k, rather than 3/36k.  Plus, the Model 3 has much better acceleration and driving dynamics, making it  actually competitive against its segment... BMW 3/4, Audi A4, etc at the same price point ($35-60k). The Bolt, not so much. Comparables are $16-28k vehicles. Plus, the Bolt has some really crappy seats to go with a terrible interior.",

I imagine there are quite a few people who would be willing to spend $27,500 on a Tesla (base model-full fed credit), but the reality they face now is that the model 3 will cost them at least $45,250 (after the reduced $3,750 fed credit). I guess state incentives will drop those amounts a bit, but the cost is still much higher than a lot of people expected.",

"comment": "&gt;I'm pointing out at lower utilization it can actually be cheaper by getting cheaper electricity. You for some reason can't comprehend that.\n\nExcept that if electricity were the majority of cost, hydrogen would be sub 10 dollars per kg retail. Do you think you discovered some new idea that no one else had thought of? Yes, energy is sometimes cheaper, no, that doesn't mean it makes sense.\n\nThink about this for a moment. If what you were saying is true, don't you think more than 7% of hydrogen would be produced by electrolysis?\n\nI'm guessing most of this stems from your inability to understand how fixed capital costs factor into average cost of production. When in doubt, examine what virtually everyone is doing, and that's SMR (because it's vastly cheaper).\n\nThose systems consume 16,800/33,600 kwh to generate 330/660kg hydrogen a day, or \\~50.9 kwh per kg. Wow. Very impressive. Hey, I'm no mathematician, but isn't 50.9 between 50 and 55? And how will your costs change when you run these things 10 hours a day?\n\n**Another pro tip: people have already done the math, hence 93% of production being natural gas.**\n\n&gt;Go look at Texas wind production and see how many hours a year nearly free wind power is there. The state of WA just put a plan for their utility to start producing hydrogen with excess renewables. It's happening. It's been happening in the EU for almost a decade.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/HDEyTjM.png](https://i.imgur.com/HDEyTjM.png)\n\nLooks like a bit less than 50. Wow. That's 50/8760 = or **a whopping 0.57%!** And it's down from 2017 too! Wow. So much opportunity.\n\nIf by selling fewer than 1,000 vehicles in a decade is what constitutes \"happening\" in europe then I guess we both agree! Hydrogen will continue \"happening\" forever then.\n\n&gt;You don't turn it back into electricity. You use it to fuel FCVs\n\nahahahahahaha. Do you even know what a fuel cell does to hydrogen? This is just awkward now.\n\n&gt;V2G is not great. Almost all analysis gets that. it's not 90% round trip efficiency, it's around 60-80% depending on how it was connected and discharged and charged.\n\nSo, just to be clear, even in your imaginary world of 60-80% efficiency that's still \\~2x as efficient as hydrogen is, and I have no idea where you got the idea lithium ion is 60-80% efficient, but it isn't.\n\n[https://www.tesla.com/powerwall](https://www.tesla.com/powerwall)  Hey look, unlike all the garbage you keep posting, this actually exists. And look, 90% efficiency. Wow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;FCVs are improving rapidly.\n\nYeah lets see how that is working out for the hyundai nexo...ooo...should sell about 340 combined between EU and US for 2019. So much for the gen 2 hydrogen vehicles saving the day. PS: that's less than the original roadster (which was a garbage car), thankfully the gen 2 didn't suck as much as the hyundai does.\n\n[http://carsalesbase.com/european-car-sales-data/hyundai/hyundai-nexo/](http://carsalesbase.com/european-car-sales-data/hyundai/hyundai-nexo/)\n\n[http://carsalesbase.com/us-car-sales-data/hyundai/hyundai-nexo/](http://carsalesbase.com/us-car-sales-data/hyundai/hyundai-nexo/)\n\nAnyway as fun as it has been to tutor you on basic science concepts, you still aren't actually providing me any new sources or information. As a result I'll be blocking you now. Hydrogen is the fuel of the future, and always will be!",

He gave no evidence, He has more reason to justify his purchase in the face of bad press than he does accept he doesn’t need even 200 miles of range. he is quite literally a random rich man on twitter who said something that Electrek took a face value as you are doing too. I have a *counter* to his claim, not a claim in and of itself. I’m not being condescending so much as you simply don’t understand. \n\nI’m now having a meta argument with someone who’s driven probably around 400k miles less than I have in assorted electric vehicles. Now why should you believe this, my claim? Simple answer: You shouldn’t. The reason is because I offered no evidence. I simply made a claim. That is exactly what this gentleman has done.

"comment": "Alien Rides does some of the most beautiful b roll during races and events, they feature some great units on their channel and have more information about the Rion and what it’s like in the wild with all the other units around it. Diversity is the biggest thing about the Alien Rides channel for me, the feature for the Goblin was inspirational. Also they tend to ride with the correct gear, they’re a great example for Scooter protection, safe riding and skill.\n\nI love Wrong way, GoW, Pirate and a few others too, Vorteks is actually one of my favourite for his “fuck off, I’m workin” attitude towards his videos and modifications, he does some great work.\n\nWrong way has an awesome attitude, however he’s more focused on his love for the EUC and high power ebikes than anything else if you ask me, Sorry Adam, you’re still awesome though. You do a shitload of testing on scooters and most of it is pretty fair ;)\n\nGinger on Wheels has been pushing out far more quality content since his departure from the NanRobot range, he’s been deep diving into the intricacies of the PEV world and does a LOT of Commuter content, Wolf rides and great ride vlog style videos too.\n\nPirate does a bit of 3D modelling (made some dope coolers for a few motors so far) and fixes a lot of basic issues with the chinese models, there is something about his willingness to just yeet life in the face. He also does. A bit of ride vlog style content too.\n\nVorteks does his own shit, he diys a lot of stuff, programs, solders, modifies and runs at the limits, my favourite kind of person. He’s someone else chasing the Power Dragon and he tends to make some decent waves. He’s been running a M365 with a sabvoton and works on his ridiculously hotrodded Ebike (I mean that in a good way)\n\nI follow so many channels, but the information spread amungst them for the stuff I want to learn and build (power builds) is all over at www.endless-sphere.com In text format. There’s no where that has more comprehensive information.\n\nPersonally, I actually avoid ESG, sorry to say, but I’m just not that kind of consumer, the videos tick me off and it makes me feel like I may as well just read the spec sheet unless the big boy comes out to give his piece. The videos feel too much like an infomercial thats been entirety fed to them by corporate, as an Australian, I hate that, good content still though. The only time I’ll usually watch one of their videos is if no one else has one or I’ve already seen the rest of the ones worth watching about a unit.\n\nI was watching electric scooter academy for a long time there to see how people used Electric Scooters on a daily basis, he’s learning more and more about these crazy contraptions as he goes along doing Deliveries on his Scooters.\n\nI watch BruuunoPoweeeeeeer for his seriously contagious attitude towards the EV scene, he does videos on Ebikes, but hey, he also builds batteries and screws with everything he can to get a little more chooch out of anything, he does a lot of interviews with people all over the world, he also shows a lot of keen interest in the innovation of the EV industry.\n\n\nI’ve been keeping up with this industry for about 3 months now atleast, it’s hard, there’s not as much information as there could be and I feel like it’s down to the retailers at that point, these reviewers are practically their only real advertisement strategy for the most part.",

I ended up getting CarNet and my free EA charging set up on my own (showed them how I did it faster than they could get me the promo code from EA) and was off to the races.\n\nTheir service side was much better equipped at handling EV related questions though. The dealer I purchased from had 2 technicians who were trained on the ID.4 so they had a better understanding of the car and were able to replicate the issues I was having, which was nice since they gave me an idea of what to expect, looped in VW Corporate (which they all have to do for any ID.4 issues), and I got a call from VW about the issue and that they would follow up with me regularly on any updates for the fix (the issue was a software issue related to scheduled charging).",

So we’re stopping every couple hours for 20-30min anyway.\n\nThat's what happened on our last road trip. Stopped every 1.5-2 hours because we had to. Plug in for 10-15 minutes for a bathroom break, or 30-45 minutes for lunch/dinner. From Seattle to San Diego and back, not once did we stop to charge with charging being the main reason for the stop. Not. Once.\n\nThat was on a Model 3 LR AWD. But the same concept is beginning to apply to more EVs.",

As the focus will likely be on making the short-haul/local distribution zero-emission first and then medium-haul/regional distribution, and then the last focus will be long-haul/international transport. The long-haul 1000kWh trucks being very common needing MW charging is still quite a long way out probably, and we first need the capacity on the energy grid for that as well.",

Ended up taking delivery the same week they announced they were discontinuing them. \n\nHonestly, if I hadn't ended up with the Bolt I would have gone with a basic Tesla.  Canada doesn't have a lot of affordable EV options at the moment.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest would be looking at hybrids.  Our other car is a hybrid 2020 Escape, and it's been pretty good. We bought the non-plug-in hybrid, but the plug-in version would've gotten most of the environmental benefits of an EV without being nearly as expensive.  A hybrid also gets you some of the reduced maintenance costs (there's less break wear, the electric motor means the gas engine is running less frequently and cooler, etc.).  A hybrid also doesn't require you to install a Level 2 charger ($6k in my case, although the install involved quite a bit of trenching).",

While at a battery swap each person takes 5 minutes. Not 5 minutes or 5 hours. 5 minutes.\n\n> but the likelihood of a line forming is inherently less than at a swap station - because there are more separate units available.\n\nIt doesn't matter if there is a line. What matters is how fast the line moves. You can get through a line faster with 8 people in it if everyone takes a small amount of time than a line with 1 person in it if everyone takes a long amount of time. It's the same rationale at a supermarket. What's faster? The express line limiting people to 4 items or the normal checkout lanes where everyone has a carting full of items. Which line do you hop in when you just have 4 items. I hop in the express lane. The line might be longer but each person takes much less time.\n\n> A swapping station might be more efficient than a small number of chargers (say four or less), but not a larger charging setup.\n\nWhy are you assuming that there can only be one swap station?",

"comment": "Broke it down into a few of the key elements you should know about: \n\n**System Type** The first thing to note is which type of system you want. Ground mounted systems are much much more expensive due to the materials needed to set them up, not to mention the further you place the panels away from your main breaker, the larger gauge wire you will need to prevent losses. So, on that front unless you are looking to produce a very large amount of energy, you will be getting a much better ROI by going with a rooftop mounted system instead of one in a field. \n\n**Sun Path** Since you mentioned you might be building the house around this and had questions about peak sunlight - South is absolutely the best if you're in the northern hemisphere. Where I am in Connecticut, a roof tilted at roughly 32 degrees (8 pitch) facing 180 degrees south is the optimal position for panels. The further south you go, the lower and lower the ideal pitch is. \n\n**Net Metering** This is a bit involved, but can be quite worth it depending on where you live. I'd check to see if if your utility provider allows for net metering. What this does is makes it so that your meter will actually be capable of running backwards when you are producing more than you use. So if you produce say, 15kWh during the day and end up using 10kWh later that night... you'll actually end up \"banking\" 5kWh. (generally they won't buy back but it is still nice to have a large \"bank\" of kWh for winter months) Otherwise, you will only be utilizing the system during the day - and this is where batteries become a more viable option. Again this is based on the fact that most people use a bulk of their power at night when the system isn't producing. If you primarily use power during the day this isn't as much of an issue. \n\n**Permitting** Don't forget that there will be added costs in the forms of permitting and the actual physical net meter I mentioned above (if you have the option/decide to take advantage of it). As with any addition to a house/property you'll want to make sure to go through the proper permitting processes both with the town and with the utility company. \n\n**System Size** As far as the size of the system goes - this actually depends on the amount of shading around and your location on Earth. In a state such as California, a 250 watt panel with no shade will actually produce MORE than 250kWh per year on average - especially in the summer when you'd be using your AC. So just because you use 2,500kWh per year, doesn't mean you need a 2.5kW system. Not sure the best method to go about finding this information for your particular location yourself, but most major solar companies offer free solar surveys. \n\n**Inverter Type** One other thing to consider is using microinverters (parallel) vs a centralized inverter (series). Centralized inverters are cheaper but if you have shading issues, it'll limit your production due to panels running in series instead of parallel. Panels in parallel will only derate the specific panels that are receiving shade while stringed panels derate everything further down in that string. There are also things called DC Optimizers that can be used with centralized inverters that do the same thing, but now you're entering if not exceeding the cost of micro-inverters alone. \n\n**Cost/Savings** Unfortunately there's not much I can give you here, but hopefully with the above information you can figure some stuff out. Also not sure if you plan to do it yourself or are looking to have some solar company come do it. Doing it yourself will be a good bit cheaper but I think the average solar installation companies run around $3 per watt fully installed, give or take $.50. \n\nAlso, don't forget there are a LOT of rebates out there. The federal ITC is the biggest to the tune of 30%. This runs out in a year or so though, so now is the time if ever!!\n\nHopefully this can get you going in the right direction! If you have any more questions feel free to shoot me a message and I'll see if I can help.",

"comment": "This letter was forwarded to me and it is supposedly the actual letter that was sent. Judge it's merits yourself.  \n\nNovember 19, 2015\n \nDear Chairman Hatch, Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Wyden, and Ranking Member Levin:\n\n \nI am writing to share Sunnova’s perspective on the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a 30% tax credit for solar installations that will be stepping down to 10% in some circumstances and will be eliminated entirely in others in 2017. We do not believe an extension of this credit is necessary for the continued health of the solar industry. In fact, quite the opposite is true. If the credit is allowed to step down as planned, the industry will remain more robust in both the long- and short-term.\n\n \nSunnova is a residential solar energy company that is active in 23 states and territories including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Saipan. We founded Sunnova in 2012 and have since grown the business to tens of thousands of solar customers across the country. We work with local installation partners in the markets in which we operate to install and maintain rooftop systems on homes.\n\n \nThe solar industry has been aware since 2008 that the ITC would be stepping down to 10% starting in 2017. This six-year window has given the industry ample time to prepare for the decrease in the incentive. In fact, all of the largest solar power service companies, including Sunnova, have stated publicly and to investors that they are prepared for the decrease in the ITC and that their pricing and installation projections will be unaffected after 2016.\n\n \nYet, there has been an organized effort by many in the solar industry to convince legislators that the need for a five-year, or even permanent, extension of the ITC is necessary to the continued functioning of the industry. Extreme claims are being made about the number of jobs that will be lost and the number of companies that will go out of business once the ITC steps down or sunsets as planned.\n\n \nAt Sunnova, we respectfully disagree with these claims. We firmly believe the ITC has served its purpose and that it is now time to allow it to step down as planned. The industry made a deal with Congress in 2008 that it needed the ITC’s support until 2016 and then it would be able to operate and, indeed, flourish without it. We, collectively as an industry, should honor that deal.\n\n \nWe also advise against allowing “commence construction” language to be included in any ITC-related legislation. This provision is unnecessary for residential solar projects because residential construction timelines are short enough that such language would have no bearing on a company’s ability to raise tax equity to finance them. Also, under this provision, companies will be able to claim that the project has technically “commenced” although no customers have actually been identified. In reality, such a provision would just provide an additional subsidy to solar firms that have resources to—as they did with the Treasury Grant Program—buy large numbers of panels and store them for future use. This would then allow systems built with those panels in the future to qualify for the ITC because 5% of the project had “commenced” with the purchase of the panels. This loophole would unnecessarily extend the impact of the ITC for years beyond its sunset date.\n\n \nThe solar industry is increasingly an established industry that no longer needs government subsidies to survive. Rather, the solar power industry is now ready to use capital market structures that other, more mature energy sources have access to, such as Master Limited Partnerships. The MLP Parity Act, sponsored by Senators Moran and Coons in the Senate and Representatives Poe and Thompson in the House, has strong bi-partisan support. The bill would level the playing field among various energy sources, not just solar, by allowing them to access the MLP capital structure, thereby giving all energy sources access to lower cost capital. In contrast to the ITC, the MLP Parity Act is supported equally by both parties and applies to multiple technologies. If legislators are interested in supporting the continued growth of the industry, we encourage them to support the MLP parity act rather than an extension of the ITC.\n\n \nAdditionally, if legislators are interested in enabling the continued growth of the solar industry, I encourage them to join the discussion about what the next generation of the electric grid will look like. As more distributed energy resources are employed by individuals, businesses and utilities, we will need to level the playing field and allow all types of energy and technologies access to our shared electrical system. We must push for grid neutrality in order to ensure that no technology is valued or favored over any other. The result will be a more efficient overall system that will provide the most competitive and cost-effective choices for consumers.\n\n \nIn the meantime, I want to make it clear that Sunnova and the rest of the solar industry are well-positioned to respond to a decrease in the ITC starting in 2017. We have had ample time to prepare and are now a mature enough industry to no longer need the government to support 30% of the cost of our projects. While we understand that some fear it could be difficult and even disruptive to transition away from such a significant subsidy, we do not believe this is a crisis for the industry. Rather, it is an opportunity to explore broader, more conventional sources of financing that will allow the industry to continue expanding. \n\n \nAs the solar industry, technology, and the grid evolve, so must policies that encourage and support their growth. A policy such as the ITC that was implemented for a market that existed almost a decade ago is no longer the best option for meeting renewable energy goals in today’s world. Therefore, we encourage you to ensure that no new legislation is passed to create a new or extended ITC subsidy.\n\n \n \nYours Sincerely,\n\n\n\nWilliam J. (John) Berger, CEO\n\nSunnova Energy Corporation",

SunPower X-21 (21.5%) is only *just* now becoming affordable ($3.75/W installed here in MD vs $3.1/W for Canadian Solar).\n\nIn the end, the best solar install is the one that delivers the best ratio of total installed power to price, and the only time to buy a \"high end\" system is if it's the only way to get the wattage you want.  My needs are 8.28kW and my roof could only hold 6.5kW of Canadian Solar.  While that would've been $9000 less, in 6 years the larger number of panels would catch up and surpass the cheaper, smaller install.",

"comment": "Bad advice.  Outback and  directly recommends including the bale cling transformer with off grid situations were the grid is not available to do the balkencing.   With say the flexpower2 with two inverters of say 3kw each, if there is a load of 3kw, on inverter will be shutdown , running the one at high efficiency instead of running two at low.   You also have much faster load ballencing with the transformer than just the two inverters.   Considering the price of the transformer it is a small percentage of the system cost.\nSearch mode is unrelated as that just lets the inverter shut down when no demand.\nAs for needing it with the powerwall with the StorEdge, you only have 240v with no center leg, so no transformer, no 120v.",

Now that grid parity is achieved and there is economic rationale for demand, further subsidies are not necessary to keep the industry alive and the production-improvement cycle going forward. \n\nSubsidies need to be small in the beginning, but once the production volume becomes large enough through the exponential growth, the size of subsidies necessary to keep it growing is unsustainable. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that if you want to get to 100% of energy demand to be supplied from solar PV, it has to be already self-sustaining, feasible.

"comment": "I'm a HUGE Elon Musk fanboy.  I think he's going to go down as one of the most transformative individuals of our time.  Between starting SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, the impact he will have on our society as a whole 20, 50 years down the line will be really awesome to see.\n\nThat being said, I don't get this solar roof thing.  It's not even a new tech, or an existing tech with a new spin - it's the same freaking thing that people have been doing for years.  The only new part of this is looking at in from a 'reroofing' standpoint instead of a 'buying solar' standpoint - there's some market to be had there, I'm sure, but it doesn't tackle the myriad logistical problems of solar roofs.\n\nGlass - okay there's a bunch of things packed into this.  First off, glass is fragile.  There's a reason why they don't use it as a roofing material already.  There's a reason why you shouldn't walk on solar panels right now - you fracture the hell out of the cells, even if the glass doesn't break.  What if you need to replace a cell in the middle of the array?  Which leads us to:\n\nWiring - A single cell typically outputs somewhere around 1V.  How are these being strung?  How much wire are we using?  OH MY SWEET JESUS HOW MANY POINTS OF FAILURE ARE THERE?!?!  The #1 point of failure we have for installs at my company is something in the wiring.  And what kind of inverters are we going to use?  What are the startup voltages?  I have to have 120+ of these on a string?  yikes...\n\nHeat - Roofs get hot.  One of the reasons we don't drop the panels right on the roof is to keep them cool.  The typical 6\" standoff and rail gets you a HUGE drop in temperature, which is a huge increase in panel efficiency.  It might be 2% less during manufacture, but in real world, just from temperature derate those are gonna be 10%, 20%, or more behind standard solar.\n\nSetbacks - I know ButchDeal keeps bringing up setbacks, and again, there are *reasons* for that.  No one is Southern California is going to have a roof that looks like the ones in the video.  Fire departments are not going to want slick glass panels on their fire clearances, so you are going to have standard roofing on those areas regardless.\n\nThis is what I can come up with in a few minutes, just from my limited experience and having discussed solar tiles with other industry experts throughout my time in solar.  This is by no means a comprehensive list of the issues, but these are all real issues that they have given no hint towards answering.\n\nIn software development, this is called 'vaporware'.  I'm not sure what we should call it in solar, but whatever we come up with, this is exactly the sort of situation that needs that name.",

My replies have 100% to do with how the load breakers are arranged in a panel. The idea being there is an optimal way to arrange load breakers in a panel, based on load size and operating time.  Solar feed in breakers will still be at bottom of the panel.  Optimum load breaker placement will bleed the current flow off the bus bars as soon as possible.  Small load rarely used load breakers near the top of the panel.  Large continuous loads breakers near the bottom.  As soon as solar power is fed into the bottom of the bus bar, it will be immediately bleed off by large continuous loads. The large currents won't need to travel up to the top of the bus bar if the large continuous load breakers were placed up there.",

"comment": "I wouldn't look at it that way. Absent net-metering protections, a 3kW emmissionless solar array is treated in the exact same manner as an 80MW gas generator. I think consumers which are 1/10,000th the size of manufacturers and significantly more clean deserve a value of solar tariff rate higher than avoided cost.\n\nUSA-style Net-metering also makes economic sense as an environmental policy, beyond a simple consumer protection policy.  But the utilities have alot of power over the consumer, so some checks and balances are fine by me. The utility can always reallocate it's cost structure towards demand charges, which would force better solar design to market. Likewise, we may be facing a race to the bottom in terms of meter fees.\n\nBut this ignores history! Before net-metering in the USA, there was only PURPA (see first paragraph). But why was PURPA put into place? It was because utilities were refusing to purchase cleaner, gas generation at avoided cost rates while purchasing emmission-heavy power supply for equivalent cost, simply because it better fit their business model to do so. The utility has a proven track record of dicking iver the consumer and the environment to do things as they best see fit, and that's the wrong attitude for a quasi-governmental business to have. That's why we have protections like PURPA and net-metering in the USA.\n\nI don't think net-metering is a viable long term policy, but until the USA starts to value carbon pollution, environmentally-minded consumers deserve the right to produce as much clean energy as they consume, on-site at retail rates, within the limits of existing grid infrastructure to handle it.",

I'm glad I am in a Solar fair net metering district with restrictions/fees, albeit minor ones.  It's highly unlikely my rules will change going forward.  I wish others lived in similar districts because installers charge more in the more \"friendly\" areas so changing the rules after the fact really hurts people.",

"comment": "This is too big a question to do service to. I'll point out a few quick hits and context. Apologies if I overgeneralize or end up flat-out wrong in some cases.\n\nAt utility scale, wind is generally cheaper than solar per kWh produced. There is a LOT of wind being put up in the US (and Europe) and there is a LOT of solar installations happening too. They have significant and growing marketshare, but not dominant. Honestly, I think solar has better marketing and is more exciting because it's futuristic tech instead of windmills that have been around for ages. Also, solar can be done at an individual level, which is huge and engaging. Also, solar works anywhere, where wind is more site-specific. And, like, $5m+ per large turbine. It's not accessible to homeowners.\n\nSolar costs are a little tricky to understand. Solar is cheap per unit of power produced, but it doesn't produce the power whenever you might want. That's solved with batteries, or a mix of generation. But if you wanted to be 100% solar, you'd need batteries and then solar isn't as cheap as it looks.\n\nIn poor markets, it is less upfront money to start with a diesel generator. The fuel costs are greater over time, but people are bad at paying more now to save money later. Also, there's the battery issue. Wind doesn't work well because of service costs and technician availability. Solar panels and equipment can be thrown in the back of a pickup truck. These poor countries don't have interconnected grids, so you're setting up a mini grid for a few hundred or a few thousand people. They don't consume a ton of power so it's hard to make money. Like, super hard. There are tons and tons of people, organizations, nonprofits all working on it. Things are improving and people are learning. In the past ~3 years the economics have dramatically improved.\n\nIn the US, the adoption rate of utilities has some interesting conflicts set up. My understanding is that utilities are regulated as monopolies to prevent price gouging. They get to charge rates agreed by the regulators, and those rates are calculated to provide an agreed, reasonable amount of profit. So, like \"costs plus 10%\". Well, in that case, you make more profit dollars (and bonuses) by having higher costs that you can pass on to the ratepayers. So there's a dis-incentive to deploy long-term cheaper solutions. That's one type of utility. Tons of other utilities do power purchase agreements. Someone generates power and sells it to the grid. That's a case where money savings can be huge and incentives better aligned. Power grids break costs into generation, transmission, and delivery. Delivery is the \"last mile\" to end users. I want to say costs are something like 40%, 40%, 20%, but it doesn't matter a ton. If you put solar panels on your roof, you skip ALL of that. But the small scale roof installations cost 2x-4x a utility scale installation, so the savings sort of cancel out. But you need either batteries, a backup generator or the grid for when the sun doesn't shine.\n\nThere was a REALLY COOL writeup someone did (I think in this sub, if not it was a similar one) regarding the Australia Tesla battery installation and the concept of inertia in power generation. Basically, utilities didn't know until very recently how batteries would interact with other grid models. Utilities still don't really know the trade-offs with distributed power generation. There's a lot of press out there that home solar can destabilize the grid. Green Mountain Power in Vermont found that it saved them having to upgrade transmission lines.\n\nThere's been a 35% federal tax rebate on solar and wind installations in the USA. That's huge and really makes it cheaper. It's been in place for a number of years, but solar now today without that rebate would be as cheap as solar 5 years ago with the rebate. So, initially, solar only made sense in certain situations. As it got cheaper, it makes sense in more situations. Using it more makes it cheaper from economies of scale. We are definitely in that virtuous cycle!\n\nThis stuff is all still so new, and so core to how we live our lives, that change is slower than we'd all like. Costs have plummeted. The big thing now in rooftop solar is reducing soft costs (labor, design, installation) and batteries (which are also declining dramatically). That's one of the big deals with the California requirement for all houses to be solar-ready. It will force innovation and standardization on stuff that's currently very custom.\n\nSolar is amazing, it's progress is super exciting and going super well. I wish we could push harder at converting to renewables, but the trends are grinding forward and picking up momentum!",

"comment": "Well, just talking out my ass here but some thoughts.\n\nSeems like you're paying $15/month for a backup power source and at the end of 10 years you've bought a powerwall $1800 (or $1500 up front; probably the about the same if you convert from 2018 dollars to 2028 dollars).  I don't think there is a way they could control your usage during a blackout. Probably totally wrong here...\n\nI'd say this is pretty forward thinking by them by thinking small. The issue everyone has with solar is the demand curve. This would be a way for the utility to remotely store power everywhere. I'd assume the peak problem day in VT is a cloudy hot muggy day which everyone has the AC cranked and solar is producing zero energy to the grid. GM power would then pull from everyone's powerwall to make it through the demand. On the flipside when it is a perfect (from energy usage) VT day and it is sun and cool enough for no AC but hot enough no heating is needed. Well the grid is over producing from solar. Now GM Power would have some place to put that power. \n\nThe other option would be GM Power builds a large grid sized storage facility; so clear cut some land and build a bunch of new transmission lines and build a powerwall facility. Kind of like this:\nhttp://www.ladwpnews.com/ladwp-fast-tracks-first-utility-scale-solar-battery/",

What are the loads?\n\n&gt; Also, the charge controller says it's \"operating voltage\" is 150V. Does this mean that I will have to run enough panels in series to produce 150V just to run the charge controller?\n\nNo you need to be in the operating range and not over it.  That is temperature compensated as well so you need to look for your cold weather stats and the PV modules temperature coefficient.  You can use the sizing tool, likely will need two Charge Controllers : http://www.midnitesolar.com/sizingTool/index.php\n\n&gt; South-West at 235* from due north.\n\nIs that True North or Magnetic North?\n\n&gt; anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 shaded at different times of day, \n\nThats a lot of shade for an off grid system.\n\n&gt; Our panels will be mounted on a flat roof. I've read that the best angle to place them at would be equal to your latitude, in this case 34.4 degrees. Is this true?\n\nOK so this is going to be on your house.... You will need a permit, as well as shut down equipment and arc fault equipment.   And you will need to use proper racking like from Iron Ridge or Unirac.   Both of them have a design tool on their site.\n\nWhy are you designing this for off grid?  It would be much more efficient on grid with net metering.",

This compares to US$280 billion renewable energy investment, including over US$100 billion in wind power and US$160 billion in solar photovoltaics (PV). China alone invested US$126 billion, over 40 times as much as in 2004. Mexico and Sweden enter the Top-Ten investors for the first time. A significant boost to renewables investment was also given in Australia (x 1.6) and Mexico (x 9). Global investment decisions on new commercial nuclear power plants of about US$16 billion remain a factor of 8 below the investments in renewables in China alone. \"\n\np22 of https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20180902wnisr2018-lr.pdf\n\nRenewables are just a better solution all around, and its the nuke fetishists that are trying to impede CO2 progress by wasting money on an inefficient means of decarbonization",

In other words, one side is a little more \"south-facing\". \nMany of the big solar firms give me offers to place all panels on the side that is a little more to the south (but mostly west). This will give the maximum production on a yearly basis.\n\nBut I would rather maximize the electricity produced during the time of that that I can use it myself (mornings and evenings). Thus I would split the panels equally on both sides of the roof).\n\nThe price for selling excess power to he grid during midday I think is lower than using more of my produced electricity myself during morning/evening\nAm I'm wrong in this way of thinking?",

"comment": "1. Are you planning on planting trees in northern parts of the globe in the future, provided there will be enough financial support? \n1. Does the location of tree planting also depends on whether there is a local organisation doing that, which Ecosia can cooperate with? Or can Ecosia start new organisations/chapters in some places? I would love to help planting trees, but there is no such organisation doing that in my country.  \n1. Are the sites, where the trees are being planted, Ecosia's or the local organisations' private ones or you need to eg. ask for permission from local goverments and it's up to locals what happens to these trees later, provided they will grow?\n1. Are you considering other options than just trees, eg. seaweed?\n1. Are you planning on expanding your marketing campaign in the future, as in promoting Ecosia in newspaper ads, billboards? I think it would be very profitable, seeing as how the environmental awareness is on rise today.  \n1. What is the advantage of Ecosia's app in Play Store, in comparison to other browsers with Ecosia as their main search engine? Does it earn money from ad renevue on all the pages, not only search pages? Is Ecosia's PC browser planned in the future?  \n1. Maybe it's a stupid question, but would the trees' planted counter go up faster than 1 tree/sec if more people started using Ecosia, or is it a fixed estimation?\n  \n  \nAnd thank you for coming up with this idea, and doing all this job :) you're amazing, guys, and we need more people like you. I really appreciate you switching to solar panels, too.",

"comment": "&gt; Solar panels were also \"suboptimal\" for energy generation when they  first came out. Good thing we didn't scrap that idea. They were made  cheap and efficient as a result of lots of deployment.\n\nI know, i studied it while that was still the case. But they were really made cheap and efficient bz scientific research, not so much by lots of deployment.\n\n&gt; Reforestation has its own issues and limitations. The point of developing tech for carbon capture is to tackle the areas of the problem space that can't be solved by traditional methods. Comparing reforestation to tech solutions is, in a sense, apples and oranges. They have overlap but also differences in what they can achieve. They should be looked at as complementary approaches, not mutually exclusive.\n\nThe atmosphere is global. It does not matter where the CO^2 is removed. And it is absolutely not apples and oranges, both remove CO^2 from the air. The difference is that in one case you have to pump the resulting concentrated Carbon deep into some rocks and hope it never escapes, not unlike the yet unsolved problems with nuclear waste. The other difference is that trees eventually decompose, so it's not the individual tree but the forest that makes a net difference. But all things considered it is a lot more promising approach to sequester carbon into the soils of grasslands and forests as it is to keep an underground vault of concentrated carbon secure forever.\n\n&gt;Another purpose of developing tech is to find ways to permanently store or convert the excess carbon from the burning of fossil fuels into a form that removes it from the planet's active global carbon cycle on a timeline that doesn't take millions of years.\n\nSee above, that's a pipe dream.It only serves to uphold the illusion that we could continue to burn fossil fuels. Forests and Grasslands do not take millions of years to sequester Carbon, and they store it much more reliably than some underground gas-tight storage could ever promise. plate tectonics are a thing, something that gets conveniently ignored by nuclear proponents as well. \n\n&gt; Yes, it's a model, of course there are assumptions and simplifications. But claiming that they are \"shaky\" while providing no specifics is meaningless.\n\nDo you expect me to go into a detailed analysis of their shakyness? *here*?\n\n&gt; There is documentation on the assumptions and the research the assumptions are based on. And the simulator tool also allows you to adjust many assumptions (within a plausible range supported by research). Look under the Simulation -&gt; Assumptions menu at the top. There are some specific parameters for afforestation that are adjustable.\n\nYes. And if i put in some reasonable parameters it will turn out that industrial carbon capture is a huge waste of resources, huge surprise. I am not debating the overall validity of the models used, i am debating the feasability and efficiency of industrial carbon storage, with specific reference to energy/resource ROI and the actual storage part.\n\nWe should use the dollar and the KWH where they make the most impact, not where they enable the delusion that we could keep on burning fossil fuels. Industrial carbon capture and long term storge simply compares extremely unfavorable to simply reforesting the rainforests and managing our huge grasslands in a carbon-farming way.",

"comment": "This will oversimplify things a little, but hopefully without getting too inaccurate....\n\nBasically, 36 kW (kilowatts) is how much **power** you're (theoretically) capable of generating at any given moment in time.  If you generate that for a full hour, that's 36 kWh (kilowatt-hours) which is a measurement of **energy**.\n\nYou will never generate the full amount of what your panels are rated for, because you lose a bit for various reasons -- if the angle isn't exactly perpendicular to the sun (which it almost never is), if it's too hot outside, if there's a tree or tall object casting shade, etc etc.\n\nAs an example, I have a 7.2 kW system.  When it's bright and sunny and cloudless outside, I can generate about 6 kW of power.  On a good day, that ends up being about 40 kWh of energy for the day.  (I'm in Southern California with a south-facing roof and only a little shade)\n\nAs far as covering a percent of your consumption, you can only estimate, because how much energy you use varies from day to day / month to month / year to year, and how much energy your solar panels will generate varies also according to how sunny it is, etc.  Ideally, though, if you want to cover 100% of your consumption, then you want to way overproduce in spring, and that will carry you through summer (when you're running A/C the most) and through winter (when the sun isn't as generous).",

"comment": "Here's an explain like I'm 5 version of what is happening.\n\nEvery house is connected to the power station by wires.  Collectively those wires are called the grid.  Electricity is often compared to water in how it flows and that is a good analogy for this explanation too. Think of every house like a kids swimming pool and the water is the electricity.  Every time a light is turned on a hole is opened in the bottom of the pool and the electricity drains out.  Different things make different size holes.  The air conditioner makes a big hole while a night light only makes a tiny little one.   With all those holes in the pool its easy to see something has to keep pumping water back in or it will be empty very quickly.\n\nThis is where the power station comes in, it is like a giant pump, pumping water (electricity) onto the grid. You can think of the grid as a really big pool.  Remember that I said the grid is made of wires?  Well think of those wires like pipes.  So, your house pool is connected to the grid pool with a pipe.  When everything is working as it should, the water is calmly and smoothly flowing from pool to pool.  The grid pool is at the same height as your pool and once the water levels are equal it stops flowing.\n\nWhat happens when someone adds solar to their house?  Well solar panels are pumps just like the power station.  They pump water (electricity) into your pool.  Lets say you want to microwave your lunch and it makes a medium size hole in your pool. Your solar panels keep your pool full without any help from the grid.  Now lets say the air conditioner, the electric dryer, electric stove, and electric water heater are running.  Those appliances make really big holes in your pool and most solar systems aren't big enough to pump that much water.  The grid's water will begin to flow into your pool to keep the level constant.  Your solar is still powering your house, but the grid is helping too.\n\nSo what happens when your solar can pump more water than is leaking out of your pool?  The water just flows onto the grid.   It most likely is going to flow to your next door neighbors pool so they can cook lunch and do the laundry at the same time.\n\nAnd the last question, why does solar have to shut off when the main grid is down?  If it didn't shut down your solar system would try to refill the grid's pool.  Water is lazy and wants to flow through the easiest hole it can find.  When the linemen are working to fix the grid they could  be that hole.  It takes just a tiny bit of water (electricity) to hurt or kill someone.\n\nThere is a WHOLE lot more to this than I've explained. But this is the picture in my head when I think of solar panels and the grid, just a bunch of leaky pools connected together.",

"comment": "Do you want the solar to function in the event of a power outage? Most solar systems are run by panel mounted micro inverters these days and only function while the grid is operating. It seems a lot of people assume solar will replace a generator. (It can but most systems don’t). \n\nA ground mount is easier to install and service should there be an issue or panels upgrades in the future but they take up additional sq feet. The panel tilt can be changed seasonally as well to maximize panel output. \n\nIt sounds like you should consider having an home efficiency audit done. Id wager the spray foam insulation has had a much larger return on investment than the solar will over its lifetime. Also if you size a solar system based on current utilities such as oversized ac, incandescent lighting, resistive heating elements for a water heater or home heat, you may end up buying a much larger system than you need. I believe Eversource offers a low cost or free energy audit. \n\nKeep in mind some solar sales are there to sell you a system. They will sell you a system and mount it to a shaded roof, or double the panels if you have east/west exposure.",

"comment": "Using reflectors can overheat the panels causing damage.\n\nPanels produce more power when they are kept cooler so you might see a small boost at first and then actually reduce output as the reflector heats the panel.\n\nMy system is ground mounted and in winter the snow in front of the panels reflects sunlight and because it is winter they stay cool and that way I get some reflective boost in sunlight.\n\nA similar reflector surface could be used in winter where panels are cooler but no snow. Not recommended for summer use where it could damage the panels.\n\n\"Solar panels produce maximum efficiency between 59°F and 95°F. As the temperature rises, the efficiency will drop and the solar panel will produce less energy.\" \"A typical temperature coefficient is 0.5%/°C. So, if on a hot day your solar panel heats up to 35°C, you can expect your solar panel’s efficiency to drop by around 5%.\"\n\n[https://www.sullivansolarpower.com/about/blog/do-solar-panels-get-hot](https://www.sullivansolarpower.com/about/blog/do-solar-panels-get-hot)\n\nI have experimented with reflectors and found any boost you get in hot weather is lost from temp rise and not worth damaging your panels IMO.",

"comment": "It also dramatically complicates the warranty. The current 8 year warranty covers 300-500 cycles on the battery, depending on car configuration. Someone who was peak shaving could add a half a cycle a day very easily, meaning another 150-200 cycles a year. So now the warranty has to cover 1500-2000 cycles instead. That demands a different battery design with lower density and power capacity. The cells in the Powerwall use a different formulation than the cells in vehicles for that reason.",

They also quoted her about $48,000 for this system (without a battery) and got it about **right** where her monthly electric bill would be after incentives and such. \n\nMy dad’s neighbor also went sunrun about 4 years ago. They described it as the biggest mistake they made going solar. I’ve heard the same from people in general when it comes to larger companies. \n\nMy advice- go local.

Even with the limitations, the EV driving was so much nicer. I always had it charged and got really good at using the 10 miles in the most beneficial conditions, and was always disappointed when the engine started. Quickly decided that my next car would be a full EV and figured in another 5 years I'd find a nice used Bolt. For various reasons, I ended up with a new Ioniq5, shortly after installing solar panels. The only problem is I spend too much time thinking about how much I like driving.",

"comment": "NO. Here's the explanation:\n\n&gt;Inverters and charge controllers definitely have maximum current inputs. \n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;It’s not about what an attached device pulls, it’s an electrical rating based on what the conductors and equipment can handle. \n\nThis is where your confusion comes from - yes the ratings are based on conductors, connectors, and so on.  These can all handle a max rated current.  HOWEVER, this current flow is determined by the equipment PULLING it.  So a well designed solar inverter with a max 25A current rating will be designed to pull, wait for it, 25A max, in order to not exceed the rating of said conductors and connectors and so on.\n\n&gt;Most inverters will only allow 25 amps max input. Put too much on and you risk a fire. Don’t exceed it!\n\nYou can't, the inverter will only PULL 25A.  \n\nThink back to u/rproffit 's example - your wall outlet can supply say 15A. How is it that you can plug a phone charger pulling say 100mA in to that 15A source, and it doesn't burn up, even though you have exceeded it's rated input current by 150 times?\n\nVoltage ratings are to be absolutely respected - current ratings as far as equipment inputs are informative only.",

I have a 0.06% voltage drop on the DC run, and a 0.51% drop on the AC run. High voltage DC kicks ass!\n\nString voltages are 409 volts in maximum sunlight, with no load, and 331 volts at max power point. Max power amps are 8.3 amps per string.\n\nNo battery yet, and when I do, it will be an AC coupled battery system, like a Tesla powerwall or similar.",

The solar provider initially told us they would submit the interconnection application after we close on the home. Do you know if for new builds, there's any way for solar providers to submit an application before closing? Or no since we wouldn't have an active SDGE account at that address yet? If not we'll probably look to add more panels and battery if possible since it's only a 3.6 kw system they're installing (at least faces southward but no opportunity to add panels before closing, unfortunately).",

That's from maybe 2 square meters, and works out to something like 500kWh and charging at an average of 100W for 12 hours per day.\n\nSolar cars just aren't practical. The absolute best you can do with a 100% efficient panel is 1.3kW per square meter, but reality is more like 20% efficient.",

"comment": "If you're looking for a backup power system your cheapest option, as far as up front costs is concerned, is a backup generator. You can get a decent generator in the 7KW - 9KW range for under $1,000. Just for comparison my off-grid home solar system, 13KW load capacity, 30 kWh battery bank and about 5 KW of solar panels, cost me about $13,000 after the federal tax credit. It was that cheap because I was able to do almost all of the installation work myself. But then I'm not exactly a DIY'er. I've been in the building trades since the 1980s. I also have a 7.5KW generator but it only gets used to charge the battery bank in an emergency if there's not enough solar coming in to top it off.\n\nIt's all a matter of what your needs and goals are and what your budget is.",

Currently, the ROI for petroleum-based is about 1/3 of the ROI for electric vehicle, plus billions in subsidies and grants.  Think of the billions spent in solar panels that the grid couldn't handle so that prices went up 85%.  And they will have to replace them with billions more from the taxpayer. The utility should be able to stand on its own.\n\nWhy not set fuel efficiency target like before?  We don't have to give musk billions.",

I used to have *hyperhydrosis* and used excessive amounts of crazy anti-perspirants, and I manage to go without anti-perspirant and no longer sweat much at all.  If *I* can do it, you have no excuses.  Seriously.\n\nDon't forget your cleaning supplies, too.  Seventh Generation and Method (available at Target, I think) are pretty nice.  \n\nAs far as other things go, buy **Conair** (no animal testing) for hair styling tools, Aveda has a great line of vegan makeup (that's what I use) and **Pacifica** makes really nice perfumes, lotions, and body butters that are all 100% vegan and awesome smelling!\n\nFor other companies, check out **caringconsumer.com**; you can search and see if a particular company is cruelty-free.\n\nEDIT: OH -- I forgot to mention **Aubrey Organics**.  Not all of their products are vegan, but try the face lotion made with Blue Algae.  I've been using it for 2 years and won't use anything else anymore!  Plus it has SPF-15.\n\nEDIT2:  Try JASON toothpaste or Trader Joe's new brand of toothpaste that sells for $2/tube.",

I have yet to get anyone pregnant or get an STD, but when 100% of the people I know that use vegan condoms have kids/STDs I get a little cautious. I would consider using vegan condoms if a comprehensive scientific study found them to be just as safe and effective as standard condoms though. Until then I am going to stick with my traditional condoms.",

I believe that the biggest impact my veganism makes is not the amount of food I purchase, because I don't think that my individual consumption will make much difference; following my morals and not eating animals is what matters to em.\n\nI find dogs and cats being in a grey zone. See, if I save their lives by letting them live with me, I think I do make the choice to buy them meat on their behalf, so to speak. And these animals do need to eat meat to survive, unlike me (some dogs are exceptions, apparently). \nJust like I'd milk a modern cow if I kept one, because she produces too much milk, I'd certainly feed this dog or cat meat. \n\nMaybe see if you can buy meat that has passed the expiration date? The emat mustn't necessarily be bad. There can be ways to contibute less to the bad industry, and there's a lot of waste going on so it shouldn't be impossible",

I like both your designs, with reservations.\n\nThe calligraphy shirt I would wear if it just said \"vegan\". I don't really see veganism as something to be proud of or ashamed if you aren't doing it. I wouldn't want the pride part being misconstrued as that \"I'm better than you\" attitude that is sometimes reproached of vegans\n\nOn the 2nd shirt I like the quote, however Jeremy Bentham saw no problem in killing animals, so I would be uncomfortable promoting him.  The first suggestion that comes to mind is \"Respecting animals means going vegan\". I don't know if it's a quote from someone, it's the title of a pamphlet by the Boston Vegan Association. I hope other people chime in for quote suggestions.\n\nIt's generous of you to offer to donate the profits. Choosing a group might be sensible though, ie if it's PETA that might turn off certain buyers.\n\nI wish you good luck in this project. Keep us posted.",

Most meat eaters have the disconnect between pets and food and there is nothing we can do to magically make them see the hypocrisy.\n\nAppeal to their logic instead.  Meat industries frequently lobby for or with misinformation, market unsafe products, mislabel products [ask anyone with a severe antibiotic allergy what they think about meat businesses], produce less healthy products, engage in media blackouts or blockages...\n\nThat was my revelation.  I hate ubiquitous lies.   Humanitarian concerns are an agreeable side-effect, but the clincher in my adoption and promotion of veganism was the realization that people are not far from being farmed in the same manner as their animal foods; the speciest mindset's boundaries are infirm, and it needs abolished before its conjectures are applied to more aspects of societies.",

"comment": "I'm a vegan who occasionally eats honey. Maybe to some that makes me not vegan in the eyes of some, but that's okay with me. I'm not concerned about how others categorized me. If I was really concerned about how others viewed me I would probably have a really hard time choosing to not eat animal products (besides honey) and devoting my life to animal advocacy.\n\nWhether or not a vegan chooses to eat honey, I think putting so much emphasis on it \"ups\" vegans' crazy factor, which makes our ultimate goal to reduce animal suffering sound less credible to the average omnivore. They are more likely to write veganism off completely instead of being open. \n\nI think Michael Greger has a very interesting point to consider: http://www.satyamag.com/sept05/greger.html",

Sacrifice your health?\n\nFirst off, it's pretty hard to find a country where you can't eat a healthy vegetarian diet so long as you have decent access to food. In emergency situations, yes, you may have problems because of a lack of food in general. In that case, try not to put yourself in those situations needlessly, bring food in with you, do what you can when you don't have other options but don't starve. These situations are pretty care, though. Emergency food tends to be vegetarian if not vegan because animal products are expensive and don't keep well.   \n\nSeriously, vegetarian foods are staples around the world -- potatoes, legumes of all sorts, grains. And even in northern climates, at least in those areas where people tend to live, you can find plant foods or have them shipped in reasonably. This isn't the 1100s. Even Alaskans import Doritos and cheese whiz. You can get a bag of beans.",

"comment": "No, fishing is not vegan.  The whole \"fish don't feel pain\" thing is *highly* dubious, and in fact the behavior of fish when subjected to painful stimuli tend to indicate that they absolutely perceive pain in some fashion, if not necessarily through the exact same biological mechanisms that we do.  In one study, for instance, fish were injected with bee toxin in the lip.  Even when the immediate physical stimulus was removed, the fish continued to show signs of pain for some time afterwards.\n\nFor a moment, step away from your fondness for fishing as an activity and try to look at it objectively.  The fish are going about your business, looking for food, when you lodge a hook in their lip, put them through a violent struggle which ultimately pulls them out of the water leaving them unable to breathe, extract the hook from their lip without anesthetic or any manner of surgical procedure, and then throw them back into the water with wounds that may later prove fatal.  From this arrangement you derive pleasure, while the fish yields nothing but negative consequences, even if you choose to deny their ability to feel pain.  This is using an animal for your own benefit against their interests, plain and simple.",

"comment": "&gt; Omnivores, like vegans, consider that some lifeforms are fair to be killed and some are not. The only difference is that vegans take a lower limit: omnivores take intelligence as the limit, while vegans choose sentience.\n\nThat's not the only difference, and certainly not the whole story. I have two points. Let me explain:\n\nFirst, let's briefly talk about morality or ethics in general. At its core, this is a process of trying to assign a value of \"good\" or \"bad\" to some action or effect *mainly* based on how that action or effect is perceived by another actor. If there's an alien from the planet Fhthragl and something I do to it makes it feel very *glubrdhshal*, unless I can put that in terms of my own experience of good or bad things I really cannot make a moral evaluation, right? Likewise, I cannot relate to something that doesn't have a point of view like a rock. So I would say this: Meaningful conversation about morality or ethics can only occur when we're talking about entities or objects it is possible to relate with. After all, we only have our own experience to go by: we don't even have access to the experience of other humans.\n\nSo then: is it meaningful to talk about ethics as pertains to other humans? Well, based on physiological and behavioral similarities we could reasonable make the evaluation that other humans are similar enough to us that it is very likely they perceive things in a relateable way. Even if they don't perceive things exactly the same - for example, a masochist - we could synthesize a relateable perspective from what we know of them and generate an idea of whether they would perceive something as good or bad.\n\nI would say that this also goes for all mammals and many animals (at least those with a central nervous system): there is enough behavioral and physiological similarity that it does make sense to talk about morality and/or to consider them appropriate recipients of moral concern.\n\nPlants on the other hand are quite dissimilar. They also don't have a central nervous system. It is quite improbable (although not impossible) that they have any relateable experience that we could attach a meaningful value of \"good\" or \"bad\" to.\n\nSo here is my assertion: it's not just that vegans and omnivores arbitrarily draw the line in different places and there's no real difference between the two except *where* that line was drawn. I'm not going to say that all vegans have a firm basis for their belief - such a statement would require only one counterexample to refute - but speaking for myself I will say that I draw the line such that it includes *all* entities where moral concern is meaningful and scale the energy I devote to avoiding harm or increasing happiness on a continuum based on how likely I think the entity is able to experience it in a meaningful way.\n\nBit of a long first point. I'm just going to quote part of your previous statement again to make the topic change more obvious:\n\n&gt; omnivores take intelligence as the limit, while vegans choose sentience.\n\nOkay, so now my second point: Omnivores very frequently say that, but I don't think that's true. I don't think it really can stand. Keeping in mind my earlier definition of the general goal of morality and its constraints (which I hope you agreed with for the most part!), I do not think intelligence confers *any* moral worth except as a means to an end. \n\nImagine a computer: It has no subjective experience, it cannot feel good things or bad things no matter what you do to it. While lacking sentience, it does contain all the attributes that humans consider to set themselves apart from beast: extraordinary problem solving skills, abstract computation, linguistics, creativity and so on.\n\nWhy would anyone have motivation to grant it moral relevance? You could not hurt it or deprive it of anything no matter what you did. It would have all the moral worth of a rock. Its only use would be as a means to make sentient creatures (like humans) happy. If it was used to make sentient creatures unhappy then you would consider its value to be negative. Right?\n\nIn conclusion: Intelligence is just a type of computation. It has no inherent moral worth.\n\n&gt; What if the limit chosen was life itself, as in using only products that cause no harm nor death to any sort of lifeform, sentient or not?\n\nBy and large, the best way to accomplish that would be to eat low on the food chain. Due to energy loss going up trophic levels, you'd always lose food energy if you didn't eat as low as possible. If you ate a pound of beef, that steer would likely have needed to eat 10 pounds of grass. A very rough sketch, but that's the general idea.\n\nSo then I think it would come down to the exact semantics of your hypothetical world where life was the important factor. \n\nWhat about eating fruit - would that be considered killing a plant? If not, then living off fruit could be viable.\n\nWould we consider one celled organisms like bacteria and algae to be individual lives that were as valuable as a human/dog/bee/onion/banana? If not, then it could probably be least harmful to eat those.\n\nAnyway, I could think of more examples but it's probably not that helpful. If you gave me considerable detail on the restrictions of this hypothetical scenario I *could* attempt to calculate what the optimal course of action would be.",

If you eat something now that you **know** is junk, replace that first.\n\n*This could be many processed freezer foods, many canned foods, candy, \"snack foods\" like chips/crackers, or others.  Many vegetable oils (Canola, corn, etc.) aren't great for you, in general reduce intake of fried foods.*  (And Vegan cheese is less healthy than animal based, but if cheese is the last part your diet you change then you are probably already doing great.)\n\nReplace it with **something sustainable** every time - if it's a bit of snacky candies.. replace it with a fruit.  If it's canned veggies, replace it with fresh veggies... etc etc.\n\n\nIn general, get the **best variety** you can possibly get.  Good proteins and fats will come from nuts and seeds.  You can buy bulk Hemp and Chia seed online (vitacost or other sites) and mix it into almost everything you eat. You can buy Almonds, walnuts, pecans, etc in bulk at the store.  It is best to buy unsalted/unflavored for health purposes.  If you crave some flavor, throw some raisins in and call it trail mix.\n\nVeggies are great, but raw leaf veggies often leave us hungry or without adequate intake levels - **try leaves that can be boiled and you'll be able to eat 2 or 3 times as much in a sitting more comfortably.**\n\nIn general, *boiling and steaming results in most nutrient availability*.. although having some raw veggies once in a while is nice too.  Easy dish is boil a good couple handfuls of green leaves (typically until they wilt, depending on what veggie for how long) and simply add a bit of salt and a touch of olive oil and you have a simple, clean veggie dish with a little flavor.\n\n\n**A general recommendation in Nutrition classes for beginners who haven't learned about nutrient intake is \"Get the best variety of colors you can in your diet, some of every color.\"**\n\nSince you are concerned about it - you can sure your child is eating good nuts/seeds (home made trail mix if you want) - that will ensure they get good protein and fats.  Otherwise, lentils are good too.  \n\nYou can mix Quinoa in when you cook rice (I mix 2 cups rice + 1 cup quinoa when I do a batch of rice) which spikes the protein up a bit too.\n\nIn general, don't be too worried about everything all at once.  You learn as you go and as long as you are getting the freshest you can + the best variety you can... and you FEEL good, then you're doing good.\n\nCome back with any questions you have a long the way.\n\nOh, by the way http://nutritiondata.self.com is a nice free resource for seeing composition/breakdown/nutrition facts of anything you might eat for when you get to that point.",

How do you feel that your kid's school teach that them that eating meat is healthy and animals are raised on farms in an ethical manner? How do you deal with other children's birthday parties?

And I get that the people who are already super-knowledgeable about veganism might get oh so bored with the omg-the-banana-diet crowd. I would have hoped that the nuisance wouldn't be so bad there would need to be another sub just for more on-point discussions about veganism.\n\nMaybe just having science-related threads in /r/vegan labeled veganscience would have been enough? Hell, that would be enough for me to click on them.\n\nJust my two cents.",

First of all, being a vegetarian should never be associated with being morally adept or being open-minded. That's a dietary choice. If someone wants to proliferate that type of ignorance, you're just fucking yourself. I don't go around promoting beef and poultry shoving it in people's faces, I don't castigate people for not eating steak sandwiches, and I would never diss someone for being a fucking broccoli head, or living off radishes or eating grass or tofu. I like a lot of vegan cuisine but the illogicality of expecting everyone to adopt your particular idea of what being healthy is, is just preposterous. I'll  be damned if I let somebody else push their agenda on me. You know I don't eat pork, not cause I'ma Muslim, I just don't really like it. But I really will fuck a bird up, and fish is good when that stuff is fresh. You know I don't criticize people for eating moss. Then don't open your fuckin' mouth about my food man.

They don't have to milk the cow, or cut out the ribs.

I understand some people feel you should never say bad things about anyone. I don't share that view. That asshole earned my response.\n\nIf you think being mean to an asshole is just as bad as being an asshole, so be it. I think that's just as ridiculous as the idea that being intolerant of racism is just as bad as being racist. Intolerance of shitty things is perfectly reasonable.

The professor is amazing, honestly) and we were discussing monism and reincarnation across species. I personally believe in both, but having that discussion just further solidified my rock solid stance. It's a selfish way to look at it, but it's yet another perspective for some to consider.\n\nIf we are all the same thing or we can be born into any living thing, why would you ever want to torture and abuse yourself so horrifically *or* risk supporting such an abusive industry thst you might find yourself the victim of in your next life. \n\nGo vegan so you aren't brutally slaughtering yourself because imagine what that actually physically feels like.\n\n Go vegan so you don't risk being boiled alive like the pigs at the Belgian slaughterhouse in your next life.\n\n(Of course this only applies if you hold those beliefs, haha)",

"comment": "Still a fairly new vegan (4 months or so) but I used to love eating meat and cheese. I love Italian food so it was easy to eat pancetta and beef! Bit by bit I started learning why eating meat was bad for the environment, for the animals and for my body. It took me months/years before I thought about it all together. \n\nI started replacing all of my products with cruelty free products and I thought that was a good start.\n\nI went vegetarian for a few days and realised that also wasn't enough and then went vegan, something switched in my head when I pieced everything together. I started watching vegan videos on YouTube (earthling ed especially) and I hope I never go back! \n\nI still don't feel sick when looking at non vegan foods and I still find the smell of bacon delicious. But everytime I think \"that looks/smells amazing!\" I try to think about the animals that lost their freedom, their dignity and their right to life.",

My favourite vegan ice cream by far is booja booja but I think they're only available in the UK. \n\nIn regards to cheese, there are a lot of vegan cheeses that can do Mexican style, generally if you find some that are pre sliced they'd be pretty good, but try a few brands to see what you like.\n\nNow egg is a bit trickier, but a good tofu scramble is great and may be a good substitute. Depends what you're \"using\" the egg for though... If you're after more of a moist yolky kind of thing then maybe [this recipe](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/vegan-toast-dipping-sauce/) is more suited to what you're after. I personally prefer a cashew sauce with some tapioca starch for that though!\n\nGood luck with everything.",

It is kind of funny to me how people see keto and vegans as opposites, when I see them as two sides of the same coin, with fast foodies being the opposite. \n\nSure, there are dumb keto people, just like there are people eating fries every meal and calling themselves vegan.\n\nI do the vegan thing for a year a while back, but I never got good at it. I was eating a bunch of freezer food and PBJ and oatmeal.  It wasn’t healthy.\n\nThis didn’t really have anything to do with the topic, but I’m glad you guys are around.  People who think about what they put in their bodies consciously are important, and I hope we can make that point to others, even if they end up with different diet choices than we do. Good luck to y’all, and maybe some day I can be vegan again, but in a healthy way.",

"comment": "Well there are a few. I’m no expert, but I’ll break it down with my basic understanding. Anyone with a background or greater knowledge on this, please chime in!!\n\nSo the basic idea is cloned meat. A lab starts with stem cells and coaxes the cells to grow into a steak or a chicken wing, etc. Now, in order to bring that lab grown meat to market, the stem cells have to be harvested from an actual animal. A lot of vegans will tell you that they are against all exploitations of animals. \n\nIt’s also important to note that this is new technology surrounding food. Lab grown meat, I believe, has to be first tested on animals to be considered GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) before being approved for human consumption. Lab rats and other lab mammals are typically purchased for the specific tests that scientists want to study and then destroyed after 😢\n\nI will never eat meat again, not even lab grown meat, because I know the health benefits of a plant based diet. I won’t be going back. But when lab grown meat comes to market, you better believe I’ll be pushing every meat eater I know to buy that instead. \n\nIdeally, once the stem cells are harvested once and cloned, the companies wouldn’t need to continue to factory farm animals in the conditions that we do now. Maybe there’s a world where happy cows and other animals on farm sanctuaries are able to have a non-invasive harvesting of stem cells and they think it’s just a massage or something 😂\n\nLike I said, I’m not an expert on this. Just a hopeful vegan ... wishing for a world where billions of animals don’t need to die every year for our insatiable appetites 💗",

Veganism is best understood as a rejection of the property / object status of non-human animals. \n\nShrimp are turned into property when caught or farmed. Insects killed in plant agriculture or while driving aren't. \n\nPlenty of humans are killed in industry and transportation. We recognize those deaths as bad, but not a reason to avoid driving or manufacturing. We can act to prevent those deaths because we recognize that humans aren't property. Similarly, we can only begin to prevent the deaths of insects when we recognize them as individuals. But just as we don't expect all accidental human deaths to stop, we shouldn't expect all accidental insect deaths to stop",

But no one thinks and there is no evidence of sentience in either an oyster of a Venus fly trap.\n\n Also I have an interest in the Buddha I've been reading the original texts and Buddha ate meat. He dealt with a king rather than defy him so was a pragmatist, wasn't a prince, didn't proclaim to be god or even say gods exist and certainly wasn't a believer in an afterlife.\n\n He even mocks some of his followers and says guessing if gods exist is like bring shot with an enemies arrow and not pulling it out until you know who it was who fired it.\n\n The talk of karma and rebirth and all that were how the regional religions such as bonn took Buddha's teachings and mixed existing Buddhist teachings to it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on secular Buddhism?  It seems to me the only one that is true to the original accounts of the Buddha and his teachings.\n\n He was just a dude, kinda a freegan and agnostic when that wasn't even a thing and simply taught medatating and mindfulness practises to find inner peace in this life in a sea of misery . Cool to see other vegans who are Buddhists.",

Also non-violence to [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy) ^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammon_Hennacy). It's up to you to define compassion. And [this](http://i.imgur.com/s8dPTqE.jpg) [isnt](http://i.imgur.com/cnGlXi4.jpg) [compassion](http://i.imgur.com/f9GFzur.jpg). Eating meat is no necessity anymore.\n\nBecause of this, modern days eating habits can be link to [gluttony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluttony) ('*I'm eating meat because I like the taste*'), which is a sin. I believe the more *radical* and austere the Christian the more prone he/she is to go vegan/vegetarian.",
