I just note that technological innovation doesn't create more energy.  The improvements in solar PV and windmills have been marginal.  The improvements in nuclear power, on the other hand, have been remarkable.\n\n&gt;That's why the other half of the solution will be moving toward hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nWhy not ~~Zoidberg~~ SkyTran?  And why not nuclear?\n\n&gt;You don't need to predict weather a year ahead of time, just long enough to adjust power levels with the load following generators.\n\nAdjust it how?  If you know a storm system is headed your way, what provides power when solar can't?\n\n&gt;Plus, with improvements in energy storage...\n\nThere's what I was waiting for.  Intermittent power is only useful on a large scale if you have some sort secondary system for storage.  I'm sorry to tell you that advances in storage have been very slow indeed.  The ways to store power on a large scale are generally pumped hydro, which is old technology and very expensive, compressed air storage, which is old and far less efficient than pumped hydro, and static batteries.  The cheapest batteries used for static applications are *still* lead-acid batteries, a technology over 100 years old.  You mentioned flywheel storage also.  It isn't even as cheap as those three options.  I'm not saying there won't be improvements, but the evidence I've seen suggests storage development is very slow.\n\n&gt;Do you mean fossil fuel plants that already exist? \n\nNo.  Large scale plants can't adjust their output in a timely fashion, and natural gas is used most efficiently when used in a combined cycle system.  When you use natural gas to back up intermittent power, you can't run it as combined cycle, so your net natural gas use is not very different than if you had no solar or wind in the first place.\n\n&gt;What we're talking about is adding generating capacity with renewable energy.\n\nAnd that additional capacity, unfortunately, needs a secondary backup system because it is intermittent.\n\n&gt;The only problem is that it has such long lead times for planning, approval and construction that it can't really keep up with the rate of change in our modern economy. \n\nA sound argument against excessive regulation.\n\n&gt;These plants require an immense amount of investment and support from a broad range of stakeholders.\n\nThey do, but there have been advancements in the technology that can reduce those costs.  I think the U.S. would be more favorable toward nuclear than would, for example, major European countries.\n\n&gt;In the long term, the goals of our energy policy should be to have a robust system with minimal possibility of price volatility, accidents, environmental consequences, and other unforeseen events.\n\nI agree.\n\n&gt;The only way to achieve this is to move away from fossil fuels.\n\n...toward nuclear ;-)","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.006407539593055844,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3760854255295039,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.287393089789059,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.12198965437710285,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.300949885885183,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.32213580428966226,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2587486324967661,"ev_1":-0.10333192740413288,"ev_2":-0.11651665926910937,"ev_3":-0.02741956877677391,"ev_4":-0.11398011323763058,"ev_5":-0.008981383483236035,"ev_6":-0.15675709872173693},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (for renewable energy and storage, the author is advocating for nuclear power)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I really don't see charger outputs beyond 7.2kW (240v @ 30A--the current sweet spot) being common for many years in home installations.\n\nEven a 7.2kW EVSE (currently ~$500 plus install) can comfortably charge a 200+ mile range EV while you sleep. For example, it will take about 8 hours to completely charge the Bolt or Tesla Model S's 60kWh packs. \n\nMy only advice is not get a 15A(~3.3kW) EVSE. While sufficient for the Volt, it would not be future proof and won't save much money over a 30A system.\n\nHigher output fast chargers require robust power infrastructure and will probably be limited to commercial installations for many years.

The majority of this car's structure has been removed to show the EV system. It has no cooling system, no vacuum system, no on-board chargers, no 12V wiring harness, no safety systems, lighting, or climate control. Half the structural components of the body are not present. You could do the same thing to a VW Golf or a Toyota Camry and it would look just as clean. You could do the same to a Ford F150 and it would too, but with the added benefit of actually having structural integrity.\n\nI'm no Tesla hater. Tesla is a remarkably innovative company and makes, in my opinion, the best EVs on the market. No other manufacturer can come close to the seamless experience of driving a Tesla. I'd love to have one, but my employer would not be happy with me driving to work in a competitor vehicle. That said, there is nothing innovative about the Model S body.

For a moving vehicle you need at least 20 frames per second, for a fast moving vehicle even more.  Its true that you can make a system smarter with layers, but its useless if it takes 1 second to make that decision.\n\nThe gist of what you do to deal with this type of problem is you jeep track of potential obstacles, every frame you match potential obstacles to previous potential obstacles, when you see the same potential obstacle getting closer and as a stronger signal its probability goes up, at some level you start slowing down, at a higher level you hit the brakes.  This is exactly adaptive cruise control does in my car.  This isnt the first time a tesla has plowed into the side of a truck at full speed, last time it decapitated the driver.  Testing their system at the side of a truck should have been part of their test plan at this point.\n\nThere are a lot of very hard problems to solve for self driving cars, I personally don’t think it will ever pass 80% ready to fully replace humans in my lifetime.  The moment you throw in fog, a cloud of dust from another vehicle, frost/ice, hard rain, the sensors start seeing garbage.

My, \"napkin calculations,\" are based on real world phenomena.  The idea that there's some CO2 or heat tipping point exists only in the minds of the people pushing the idea.  The big problem with this, and why Climate Gate was such a big deal is because they have not provided the evidence to prove these ideas.  They simply want us to believe them.  Michael Mann has been fighting tooth and nail to keep people from seeing his data with which he created the hockey stick.  How in the world are we supposed to take these people at their word when they fight so vigorously to prevent us from seeing their work?\n\n\n\n&gt;As far as what do do about our energy issues, you seem to have a fatalist view. You don't have an idea for how we would solve it... So we just shouldn't try? You didn't say that exactly, but it sounded like you didn't think it was worth trying.\n\nYou couldn't be more wrong.  I absolutely support the elimination of fossil fuels in energy generation.  But based on the mountains of information that I've read on solar and wind production, there's simply no way that they will serve our needs on their own.\n\nThe biggest problem is energy storage.  We could build enough solar arrays and wind farms to power our country during the day, but we don't have the energy storage capacity (or technology) to power the country at night.  \n\nYou made the claim that night time power usage is significantly less than during the day, but what about the people in the north who are currently burning fuels to heat their homes during the winter?  If those people switch to electricity, then energy usage is going to go up significantly during the winter.\n\n\nPeople toss around the claims that a solar array on every roof would provide enough energy, but those people have not done their research.  Most home solar arrays, under ideal conditions, don't provide enough power to meet the demands of that home, much less providing power to industry, or to keep the traffic lights running.\n\n\nWind power is highly volatile.  In some places, it's quite practical.  In others, it's quite impractical.  You can't just put a wind farm in Oregon and transmit the power to New York.  The loss of energy from transmission inefficiency is too high.  The cost of maintaining wind farms is also very high, and the cost increases significantly with age.  Don't get me started on the insanity of offshore wind farms.  You also don't want to have wind turbines where people are, as the turbines are prone to catastrophic failure.  \n\nThat brings me to this article, which is one of the many reasons that I absolutely support the idea of getting rid of fossil fuels for energy generation.\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/\n\n\nOur current Nuclear reactors are horribly outdated.  But due to heavy opposition and red tape, we have not been able to build new, upgraded nuclear plants.  The newer plant designs are significantly safer, and significantly more efficient.  There's also new research being done on molten salt reactors and thorium reactors.  These technologies could safely power our country for a millennium, and could serve as a supplement to any renewable energy generation methods that we have in place.  But as long as people are vehemently opposed to nuclear, these technologies aren't going to be put into production.\n\n\nI'm also quite interested in geothermal and tidal power generation, but Geothermal doesn't generate enough energy, and tidal is possibly the most difficult to implement.\n\n\n\n&gt;We can easily nudge the market away from carbon emission in a technology agnostic way with a carbon tax, which would provide incentives to move towards carbon neutral energy sources.\n\nThis doesn't work.  The businesses hit with these taxes just pass the costs on to the consumer.  All that this does is takes money from consumers and puts it in the hands of the government.  The government then pisses away the funds on wars, special projects, etc.  The consumer, who now has less money, cannot afford to invest in renewable technologies.  Carbon taxes are worse than useless.\n\n\n\n&gt;Once we have a solid install base of solar, energy will be cheap and abundant. Then we use electric cars with a tesla-style rapid charging system (which they have shared the patents for) and we're all golden.\n\nHave you done the math for how much this would increase the demands on our power grid?  Based on what I've read, switching from gasoline to electric in our cars would increase the demands on our energy grid by 25%, and most of the charging associated with electric vehicles would likely be done at night.\n\n\nYou claimed that I have a, \"fatalist view.\"  I believe that my views are informed, and realistic.  I have done a lot of my own research to see how viable these ideas are, and the conclusion that I have come to is that we can eliminate fossil fuel use, provided we supplement renewable generation with nuclear generation.

There's a crazy advanced idea to take the solar power from a satellite and beam it back to earth via laser.\n\nMicrowave, actually.  It's a brilliant idea whose only problem is that it would never pay for itself unless we managed to built a space elevator or Neal Stephenson's concept of a [20 km launch tower.](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/09/making-science-fiction-a-reality.html)\n\n&gt;I'm open to all possibilities available.\n\nYet your comments quite clearly suggest opposition to nuclear power.\n\n&gt;Does this still produce waste?\n\nThey consume the existing waste.  What little waste (a couple of percentage points of existing waste) remains needs containment for ~300 years versus the ~10,000 needed for transuranic waste.\n\n&gt;Is the radiation even used and disposed of 100% efficiently?\n\nI don't follow your question here.  Maybe this will help.  If we managed to get a fleet of Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors going, the waste produced from powering the entire U.S. for a year could be ossified (made into glass) into a block just a little larger than one cubic meter.  Once ossified, it doesn't go anywhere.\n\n&gt;Right, cos we never make huge mistakes in matters like this.\n\nActually, we never have.\n\n&gt;You know the truck drivers never run off roads, the forklift drivers never drop loads, the welders never miss spots.\n\nLook, you are demonstrating a lot of ignorance about this.  The dry casks sit in the parking lots of current nuclear reactors.  When those sites eventually get converted to breeder reactors, that will become fuel.  If we are stupid enough to not build breeder reactors in the future, we can transport the waste to Yucca Mountain, where storage is prepared and waiting.  The dry casks have been subjected to crash testing of all sorts (including train crashes) and are certified safe.\n\n&gt;I'm not a fan of nuclear power but if it's the most efficient and can be handled safely I could accept it.\n\nI encourage you to do some objective research then.

According to the diagram, peak load starts at 10am in the morning and ends at 7pm in the evening - these are times when solar panels are working - although granted, by 7pm in the summer they aren't working great.... but most panels are active to some extent right up until the sun sets.  If the panels were correctly installed, then generation and demand should be roughly matched.  Any time during the day, solar on that house will drive that house's energy demand, and if there's surplus then a couple of the neighbor houses as well.  This effectively takes that house's energy consumption off the grid - supply matches demand.\n\nIn our local public utility we have two coal fired power turbines that run 24/7 365 days a year and then 4 demand-driven gas-fired turbines that fire up based on demand.  Peak demand locally occurs - statistically - at (from memory) 2:30pm in mid-July.  At that time all 6 turbines are all running at full tilt - and several days in the month our local publicly owned utility needs to buy extra generation off the spot-market... which is very expensive.  Solar takes the total demand down - even if it's not exactly lined up - and thus reduces the total effective consumption of the local grid thus saving our local operator from having to buy electricity at - for example 0.19/kWh at 2:30pm in mid-July to sell to consumers at 0.13/kWh.  It also saves them from having to figure out how to fit a new 7th gas turbine into the local power station to avoid losing money in the summer - the 7th turbine isn't needed because solar is effectively offsetting demand.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0032837494121243558,"1.1.1_stance":-0.27370075783096987,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.31655381164875296,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25823842057149543,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10541076337115858,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.288337048789022,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.031734645289058484,"solar_1":-0.2774516852176792,"solar_2":-0.20556038207429556,"solar_3":-0.0032954035777947865,"solar_4":-0.02438462275586062,"solar_5":-0.1518069892966499,"solar_6":-0.015880101497411186,"solar_7":-0.00577298529969994,"solar_8":-0.022370273845808697,"solar_9":-0.059447469654294594,"solar_10":-0.044781967884167294},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

If you have clear sky, high sun (less atmosphere) and cool panel temperatures you can get those 1440W.  1440W at 30V is 48A and fine for your batteries or a little larger.  1152W at 30V is 38.4A and is just C/12.  Still charging faster than C/13, but getting close.  \n\nThe other part \"bit longer to charge up\" might mean an extra day.  Lead acid batteries last best if discharged some then charged right back up.  Leaving them discharged is necessary some times, but it's best to do that for short periods.  \n\nedit: part of the problem is charging at the end of the day.  Solar doesn't charge at capacity all day.  A tracking mount can improve it, but it still ramps up in the morning and ramps down in the afternoon.  Part of it is sun lower in the sky and shining through more (light scattering) atmosphere.  Part of it is the \"glass\" on the solar panel acting more like a mirror when the light hits it at a shallow angle. The batteries are a third part.  As the batteries charge up, they won't accept the same amount of current.  Mid-day, your 450Ah battery will accept 40 or 45 amps at 30V. Later at the same 30V, the batteries will only accept 30 then 25 then 20 then 15 amps.  Charge controllers and amp-hour meters typically consider batteries charged when the voltage is high and the current is C/50.  That means your MPPT controller is holding the voltage at 30V and the batteries are accepting only 8 amps.  THE BIG POINT OF THIS EDIT:  this gradual tapering off means that you need to charge faster in the mid-day because the charge will taper off before it's done.  Too much battery for the solar array means the batteries are still accepting lots of current in the afternoon but they're far from fully charged.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"yes","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.000877675978699699,"1.1.1_stance":-0.20128131985089795,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23883001308452828,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.18109193625824682,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22250647825034242,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2322255930372693,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1765593777721127,"solar_1":-0.13408681751958407,"solar_2":-0.11506579593637578,"solar_3":-0.163505331285256,"solar_4":-0.18114489198317915,"solar_5":-0.18686812696512067,"solar_6":-0.058953096760281674,"solar_7":-0.08307251691414781,"solar_8":-0.03653966581744802,"solar_9":-0.20304464461454821,"solar_10":-0.173372375536177},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

E-waste includes computers, cell phones, telephone equipment, military equipment including missiles, I could go on and on. Are you proposing we stop all that production? And how much E-waste is involved in producing, maintaining, and operating a FF refinery? \n\nWhat climate deniers can’t seem to comprehend is non-repeating fixed costs (NFC) that is used for costing out equipment at manufacturing plants every day. Where I work that is used to produce prices where tooling is a one time cost that is distributed over every part manufactured. For solar panels there is a one time charge for NFC which is then distributed over every KW produced. That is what people pay for when buying and installing solar panels and after that costs is covered there is never another charge for source electricity since yes it’s free. With FF there is cost for every single KW produced that is never ending. And that’s even after the NFC for the plant is paid for. \n\n\"All that waste doesn't seem like your helping the environment one bit,\"\n\nCompared to what?\n\n\"in fact, it seems to be hurting it. solar and wind seem to produce more waste than they supposedly are \"Saving\".\"\n\nAnd this is your expert scientific opinion based on research?

However, real-world temperatures are not warming to dangerous levels, nor are they going to.\n\nAustralia’s ABC news, for example, tells its readers that the “influence of climate change ensures nearly every season is now warmer than normal.” Yet, in 2022 Australia experienced the coldest spring in 30 years! Major cities like Melbourne, Adelaide, and Canberra recorded their coldest maximum temperatures.\n\nThis mismatch between reality and the MSM narrative has been widening in recent years. Computer models are becoming increasingly erroneous in their predictions of future weather and misleading policymakers into believing that doomsday is imminent.\n\nThe danger of cold weather is seldom acknowledged by an MSM that has sold its soul to the apocalyptic narrative. For the common people in the Northern Hemisphere, cold events pose more of a risk because the entire policy framework emphasizes addressing a supposedly warming world than being prepared for frigid spells.\n\nAs a result of the replacement of fossil fuels with ineffective wind turbines and solar panels, Northern Europeans approach winter with increased energy costs and the prospect of regional blackouts – all in the name of averting a fabricated climate emergency.\n\n…..\n\nThe challenges of winter weather would have been much more manageable if European leaders had not shifted their economies away from coal, oil and natural gas in favor of expensive and unreliable green technologies. Of course, the damage of this folly has been compounded by the disruption of energy markets by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n\nHuman progress in the last two centuries has been phenomenal, and one of the greatest achievements has been the development of electricity and fossil fuels to fend off the cold of harsh winters. We are now undoing this feat and putting millions at risk of freezing in the name of a faux climate emergency.

This is all likely in response to the new PUCT Performance Credit Mechanism (PCM) that was adopted in January of this year.\n\nThe PCM is designed to incentivize generators to build and maintain dispatchable power plants, which are power plants that can be turned on and off quickly to meet fluctuating demand. The PCM works by requiring electricity providers to pay generators performance credits if they are available to generate electricity when the grid is under stress. These credits can then be sold to other electricity providers who need more power. \n\nLarge battery farms or in this case access to large numbers of homes with battery storage is perfect as a virtual power plant thatcan be turned on or off quickly to meet demand. I feel that as things get closer to PCM being fully implemented more and more REPs in Texas are going to be looking to somehow utilize their solar customers that have storage.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20397457694852608,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25033651609017016,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1411618790807362,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23619496150660088,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20609109474971396,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17145919152729525,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05909226035388807,"solar_1":-0.2329622632864604,"solar_2":-0.2305917184814632,"solar_3":-0.2905280769934164,"solar_4":-0.12535190892926715,"solar_5":-0.07902073614816443,"solar_6":-0.029922304859307285,"solar_7":-0.15401068056126013,"solar_8":-0.1820438422034447,"solar_9":-0.11038876323408525,"solar_10":-0.18173678107804075},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

And while some people have problems taking iron supplements, it's possible to combine smaller doses of supplements with a better diet that not only contains more iron but also thing that help to soothe the stomach problems associated with iron and also increase absorption.  \n\nAnyhow... yes, you are right that an individual's health problems does not mean that \"veganism is misogynistic and misguided\".","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.05056605658804377,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12167813239769387,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20478373030630248,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1367748636039252,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2212526043476828,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.12486621006731013,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.11659151988957699,"diet_1":-0.23340006549532855,"diet_2":-0.00036425609384120133,"diet_3":-0.001577124009296919,"diet_4":-0.005631319227783631,"diet_5":-0.0008702681273765241,"diet_6":-0.0024190145607766076,"diet_8":-0.00041881467404891737,"diet_9":-0.0008673217380419374,"diet_10":-0.0020038831765608243,"diet_11":-0.0010870394204782012,"diet_13":-0.001983167567232158,"diet_14":-0.014707340854026066,"diet_17":-0.00013464562410566336},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

I'm actually going to grad school next year for my Masters in Nutrition/Dietetics/Public Health and am currently interning with Mercy For Animals on their nutritional campaigns.  Contrary to popular belief, eating meat is nott really that healthy for us.  Although people argue we have 4 canine teeth, we do not really share many more characteristics with carnivores.  In fact, we share manyy more qualities with herbivores in the world.  You should check out this website..\n\nhttp://www.celestialhealing.net/physicalveg3.htm \n\nit covers alot of nutritional reasons why meat isnt that great for you and why eating vegetarian/vegan is muchh healthier.  In fact, meat and animal products are veryy acidic in nature, while humans bodies are more alkaline on the pH scale than acidic.  And since your body thrives off balance.  It needs to be at a certain pH balance to run efficiently.    Therefore, in order to combat the acidity you are digesting in meat, your body takes calcium away from your bones to balance out the pH...making your bones weaker in the process.  That is why you see in major first world countries where alot of meat and dairy is consumed, there are higher rates of osteoporosis...heres another article depicting the Protein myth and why eating high levels of meat/dairy lead to osteoporosis \n\nhttps://www.msu.edu/~corcora5/food/vegan/osteo.html\n\nAlso for really good reads on the nutritional benefits of a vegan diet check out:\n\n1) Veganist by Kathy Freston\n2) Thrive: The Vegan Nutrition Guide to Optimal Performance in Sports and Life by Brendan Brazier (Professional Ironman Triathlete)\n3)The China Study by Dr. T. Colin Campbell (one of the major Drs on Forks Over Knives)\n4) This Crazy Vegan Life: A Prescription for an Endangered Species by Christina Pirello\n5) The Kind Diet by Alicia Silverstone\n\nalso check out some websites \n\n1) mercyforanimals.org\n2) chooseveg.org\n3) thekindlife.com\n\nany of these websites/books will highlight the benefits of a vegan diet and explain why meat is nott as healthy as many pple think.. actually getting too much protein is harder on your body than not getting enough.. and since the American diet is heavy in excess protein, our livers are working overtime to detoxify and neutralize the excess acid in our bodies, thus making us feel sluggish, tired, and it actually takes our muscles longer to recover from exercise while eating meat. I have found through experience and literature that eating a plant-based diet makes me feel more energized and run more efficiently. \n\nsorry for rambling but I know what its like to be a new vegan! hope all this helps!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.010408186664183935,"1.1.1_stance":-0.06777487726261218,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.0660305945187929,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13657161463440085,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2594230458388256,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.012593962009608125,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.028452261874917895,"diet_1":-0.20380092950770343,"diet_2":-0.10943761233425467,"diet_3":-0.13156776878151005,"diet_4":-0.233899976519069,"diet_5":-0.16751932112781234,"diet_6":-0.16254591261730694,"diet_8":-0.14860331013066266,"diet_9":-0.20209766667091147,"diet_10":-0.062346181752423034,"diet_11":-0.1503621033830882,"diet_13":-0.25721797941640545,"diet_14":-0.17580970044362992,"diet_17":-0.1409329163768874},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.","1.3.1_reference_group":"friends (the author mentions sharing nutritional resources with them and interning with Mercy For Animals together)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.","1.3.3_second_order":"strong.","diet_1":"YES.

As our brains got bigger, our guts got smaller. As a result, we had to become dependent on more high-quality, nutrient-dense, easily-digested food than other primates to maintain the high cost of our brains, since our reduced guts could no longer handle the sorts of food on which our ancestors had subsisted for millions of years. They proposed that the most likely reliable source of such calories was meat and other animal products. A dramatic increase in animal matter in the hominin diet eased the energy constraints imposed by nature on big brains, and allowed our brains to grow to massive proportions without violating Kleiber's law.\n\nInteresting.\n\n&gt; For the ETH, meat itself wasn't really the point. Though Aiello &amp; Wheeler proposed it as the probable source of the necessary calories, they hinted that other high-quality foods, like sugary fruits, tubers, or oil-rich nuts and seeds, could also have done the job. A close reading shows that the ETH was fundamentally about total calories, not specific calorie sources. Even so, the prominence of meat-eating in the paper supplied de facto legitimacy to several paleofantasies about the necessity of meat to the human diet, one of which would become the modern paleo-diet movement.\n\nVery interesting.\n\n&gt; But more fundamental to the ETH than meat-eating -- indeed, the whole point of the paper -- was the claim that Kleiber's law is maintained through a necessary trade-off between expensive tissues within a given organism, in this case Homo sapiens. Increased meat-eating was merely a consequence of this claim, not the foundation of it.\n\nCool.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-9.797878131697264e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.050908712911359545,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.03086710845430692,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.06298448157031089,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2528752308965065,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21652807046378086,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.17520519574948898,"diet_1":-0.01835822520054838,"diet_2":-0.0005124177193162419,"diet_3":-0.0030769648947170936,"diet_4":-0.00082895667522583,"diet_5":-0.002318041218435004,"diet_6":-0.0009503892476156276,"diet_8":-0.0003386262815183727,"diet_9":-0.00134497767915794,"diet_10":-0.002441790499384903,"diet_11":-0.003818185504011732,"diet_13":-0.00284567376850949,"diet_14":-0.011547803294282252,"diet_17":-0.000648828622615838},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

It led me to trains of thought that made me realise that if I were hit by a car, my life would be snuffed out too, and I would be no-less squished than a squirrel. The only difference is that people wouldn't walk over me. So, I figured that the only difference between me and a squirrel wasn't that I was a special being destined to some afterlife, but rather that either no one cares enough about squirrels to realise they matter too or people are so egotistical that they truly believe themselves to be so special that only our lives carry on.

That's discussed in the article above, but it does not mention of severity and ongoing process of having to monitor your cat's urine ph levels because you're not feeding them \"correctly.\" I.e meat. \n\n\nThere are vet recommended vegan dog kibbles that probably won't give dogs issues and require monitoring, but no veterinary association or widely reccomemded vegan cat food exists. They are obligate carnivores (synethic taurine is a thing tho, just gotta tackle other issues) and no vegan should have cats if they don't plan on feeding them meat - rescue rabbits and other rodents are alternatives.\n\nJumping through risky hoops just to have a vegan cat is awful imo. I'd love to see more research on stuff like this though, because it's a hard pill for many to swallow that animals whose lives have worth are being killed to be kibble. And there are health issues with non-vegan kibble too.\n\n\n Then again, this is just my opinion on the morality of it and after looking into it further, there are more things to consider. There are vegans who have healthy vegan cats, and there are things you can do to combat the ph issues. The choice comes down to feeding your cat meat food and participating in an industry that kills animals or being a sorta pioneer in the field of vegan cat and dog diets with the support of the best and most up to date research in the field and regular vet visits. I don't think it's a black and white issue, and the \"imposing your morals\" argument that I often see is silly - parents and ppl impose their morals on their kids and pets. As vegans, we get fortified b12. Vegan cats need fortification just like us too - but is there a chance at hurting the poor meows that are forever kids? There's stuff to counteract that. \n\n\nI'm just a scrub, u/juiceguy is a vegan of 20+ years who has had/has healthy vegan cats with vet checkups. So it is possible.

Has meat but a good number of dishes are marked vegan or can be ordered vegan. Definitely get the jerk tofu with mushroom rice and a side of fried plantains)  \nGreen Leaf (vegetarian but only like two options aren’t default vegan.
