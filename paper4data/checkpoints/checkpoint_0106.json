"comment": "I made a few assumptions\n\nFirst, I assumed you cared about the emission efficiency of the car, since that's the whole point of electrics and the question the guy you responded to was asking about (the source of the fuel - electrolysis or fracking). \n\nSecond, you said efficiency based on power train (fuel to horsepower), and listed an oversimplified process (ignorance or lying - you make the call). [Here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/_yY5pRxdRnfevkLmXSVExqk8L3epUg9Kk6z7c8lMvXsxRULEwOyZ3PG1CGgknTd8vqrrnxcqVBvUbDTJE9RPO7vpTmvL8MjxeCFAqb2HnsyGSh8sAkCERlA8E8WXeU3EhBjvrjphssnmOuHHu6Ap6Kjvf9kA32hsg2Iw_HrsttataZ-ILPuGLF5b4m3dO92VZ4Dm1-Zn3TNw5Q934vm18wrjvQ=w470-h557-nc) is a nice flow chart to help you.\n\nThird, I did research on electrolysis a while ago because I found a home electrolysis system that cost about $500. Cheaper than most home L2s. I found that using that kind of system was *at best* 40% less efficient. 20% drop from making the hydrogen. 10% drop compressing it into the car's tank. 10% converting it back into electricity for the battery.\n\nTo answer your unrelated question about burning fuel efficiency (but really who cares? The point of all this is to stop using emission producing fuels for personal transportation. Trying to justify which fossil fuel we burn burns better is silly):\n\nYou can't. There are more sources of energy than just fossil fuels, and we are using a variety of them. To try to answer that question would have to be done on a per area basis or try to use some national average. You can pick and choose data points to nitpick which is more energy efficient or look at the actual problem: emissions. \n\nFuel cell vehicles aren't as environmentally friendly as battery electrics. One method keeps us on the path we're on, using fossil fuels and speeding up climate change. The other uses water that we're running out of globally. Battery electrics are simple. Hydrogen fuel cells would be great for, say, space exploration. \n\nBut not for personal use.",

FYI, \"charging cords\" and \"charging stations\" are the same thing - they're basically just plug adapters to get mains power to your car's onboard charger, and they have a built-in switch to cut the power when the car's not charging. And the proper term is EVSE (electric vehicle supply equipment.)\n\n&gt;3 tesla chargers (which might not be for anything but teslas).\n\nYou're correct that Tesla chargers will only work with Teslas.",

I'm extremely excited to be purchasing an all electric vehicle within the next month or two. While I can plug it into any regular outlet, I will regularly be looking everywhere I go for the parking spots where I can easily plug in to a level II charger. Sure I won't find them everywhere, but when I see one, rest assured they'll have my business.",

A few people here looked at the situation, but in the end I'm afraid that the legal situation is  just too nuanced for us to determine, with certainty, over the Internet. I found this document: https://www.azdor.gov/portals/0/brochure/543.pdf\n\nThat says at the state level, self-installs ARE qualified for tax credits. However, there may be additional county- and city- level regulations that you'd have to follow, and we don't have the legal background to give you a confident determination (we're not lawyers) -- sorry!\n\nA coworker suggested that you go to your county courthouse and town hall to ask about zoning, permitting (building/electrical/etc.) for your specific property.\n\nIf you still don't feel comfortable after doing that, yes, perhaps a local installer would be a safer choice? Definitely ask around -- look for neighbors with panels, or maybe read some local reviews.\n\nSorry I couldn't be more helpful here, and I hope you can find more information. Good luck with the project!",

It was republicans in congress that passed this ridiculous law that forced the post office to fund 75 years of benefits into the future-- this made them have to drop their plans and of course they have been barely surviving due to this.

And the more energy stored, the potentially more dangerous a battery becomes, said Croy.\"  \n  \nI am confident that if you compare li-ion batteries to gasoline, li-ion are at a lower risk of explosion than gasoline when you factor in energy density.  \nAfter all, gasoline tanks go up in flames much more easily (and frequently) than li-ion batteries. But as a society we've gotten desensitized to that and so no one writes about that even though people die all the time due to gasoline tanks exploding.  \nAlso why does Tesla always get mentioned when it comes to articles like this? Sure the Boeings and hoverboards were recalled but Teslas haven't. Yes they have li-ion batteries but they are well built and some have caught fire only because of getting pierced etc - causes that aren't typical and you would expect to result in a fire.  \nAfaik not a single person has gotten hurt from an issue with Tesla batteries. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.",

An extremely risky thing to do, but it might well pay off handsomely.\n\nThe only way to really 'beat' that is to actually think hard about what *original* goals you want to achieve, identify where others have left the voids and then jump.

The difference now is you won't be able to turn it off. Ours has a switch but it resets itself to on each time the car is started. Also, the noise isn't loud and you can barely hear it from inside the car, the AC makes more noise. Outside it is obvious when I turn off the sound, but the car still makes various fan noises and it is only if I turn off the AC that it becomes completely silent, unless I move in which case there's the sound of tyres.",

"comment": "Polestar’s First EV Is a Track-Happy Challenge to Tesla’s Model 3\n\nWith its first fully electric car, Polestar delivers a fully evolved sedan engineered for economy and more than enough performance.\n\nA car driving down a curved road with trees\nDrivers uninterested in stomach-churning track expeditions will be glad to know that Polestar’s first fully electric car is a useful, family-friendly sedan with a promised 275 miles of range.Courtesy of Polestar\nI wish I’d seen Joakim Rydholm take the new Polestar 2 electric sedan around the test track in Sweden before my drive, rather than after.\n\nThe engineer, who designed the chassis and happens to be the program’s chief test driver, hammered the handsome, unassuming sedan through every turn, seeming to squeeze every pound-foot of torque from the 78-kWh battery pack and dual permanent-magnet motors. (That’s a very healthy 487 pound-feet, to be precise, complementing 408 horsepower.) Despite damp conditions, the car stayed planted and poised, but still squeaked out a few satisfying hints of back-end looseness in several turns.\n\nBy comparison, my laps around Volvo’s Hällered Proving Grounds—Polestar is Volvo’s electric-focused performance division—was a leisurely leaf-peeping tour through western Sweden. And I was going as fast as I dared on a wet, unfamiliar track while adapting to a new EV that I wrongly assumed wasn’t a track beast. Plus, Rydholm, riding shotgun, had mumbled something about a course speed limit, giving me further pause—though he seemed to thoroughly disregard it once behind the wheel himself.\n\nInterior of a car\n“Your primary tools are the anti-roll bars, springs, and dampers,” says Polestar engineer and test driver Joakim Rydholm. \"If you have head-toss on a bumpy road, you work with the anti-roll bars. Hard impacts, you work with the tires and shock absorbers.”\nCourtesy of Polestar\nI longed for another crack at the track in the surprising little machine. But excuses aside, I learned enough from my still reasonably spirited time there and on public roads around Volvo’s HQ in Gothenburg to posit that when the Polestar 2 arrives next year, it will be a worthy competitor to the performance-oriented version of Tesla’s Model 3. Granted, the prototype I drove included the optional, $6,600 “Performance Pack,” which provides Brembo brakes, 20-inch alloy wheels, and a set of Öhlins suspension dampers that are tuned manually at each wheel, to better balance the car in the corners. “It makes the car smoother without the driver losing confidence,” Rydholm says.\n\nDrivers uninterested in stomach-churning track expeditions will be glad to know that Polestar’s first fully electric car is a useful, family-friendly sedan. And to go with that performance, it promises a practical 275 miles of range—to be eventually validated by the EPA, of course. Rydholm and his team spent years at the proving grounds, tuning the car’s performance on the handling track I drove and the more varied “comfort track,” which simulates a host of roadway surfaces and anomalies. “Your primary tools are the anti-roll bars, springs, and dampers,” Rydholm says. \"If you have head-toss on a bumpy road, you work with the anti-roll bars. Hard impacts, you work with the tires and shock absorbers.”\n\nMy own laps validated the effort put into the dynamics engineering, with the car sticking hard in the turns on the hallowed grounds of Hällered. The all-wheel-drive setup, using the front and rear motors, delivered power immediately to accelerate out of the turn and onto the next straight. On public roads, the car was smooth and quiet, with negligible wind or tire noise—especially impressive in a vehicle without an engine masking those sounds.\n\nThose who opt for the $45,000 base version, which will come about a year after the Launch Edition debuts at $63,000, will still be able to go from 0 to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds. (Polestar hasn’t yet released the car’s top speed.) All customers will also get a water-cooled lithium-ion battery pack, developed with LG and capable of charging in just 35 minutes through a 150-kW charging station.\n\nA clean and attractive design both inside and out caps off the package, with a bonus industry premier lurking inside: This is the first car to include Google’s Android-based infotainment system. All the vehicle systems and connectivity features—navigation, search, contacts—are accessed through Google, with wireless access included in the purchase price. Though the prototype I drove didn’t have this system fully operational yet, a stand-alone test rig I tinkered with showed a simple and elegant interface, with a single dominant screen and quick and easy access to features and controls. (GM vehicles will also offer Android-based infotainment systems in the near future.)\n\nAs the name suggests, this is the second vehicle from Polestar. The first, the Polestar 1, is just now entering production. That one is a 600-hp plug-in hybrid luxury touring car. Polestar will make just 150, selling each for more than $150,000. The Polestar 2 is the brand’s first mass-market production EV, and Volvo’s as well—though the car’s power train is also headed for the parent company’s newly announced XC40 Recharge SUV.\n\nOther EVs tout a variety of capabilities tied to their all-electric power train architecture. Tesla offers Ludicrous acceleration. Audi’s E-Tron SUV drifts with glee, thanks to a precise all-wheel-drive setup. Porsche’s new Taycan accelerates more aggressively, thanks in part to tech like a a two-speed transmission. But even at half the Taycan’s base price, the Polestar 2 offers ride quality near to the Porsche’s standard. And it has one popular feature the Porsche doesn’t: single-pedal operation. The motors will slow the vehicle both while coasting and in lighter pedal use; the mechanical brakes kick in once the force exceeds 0.3 g. On the track, where almost all braking is beyond that, the Brembos performed smoothly and powerfully. On the road, the re-gen braking was pronounced but unobtrusive, a satisfying feeling for EV enthusiasts who like to pump power back into the battery every chance they get.\n\nIn lieu of a key parlor trick, the Polestar 2 delivers a fully evolved EV, engineered for reliability, economy, and more than enough performance, whether you drive like Rydholm or like me.",

"comment": "Don't forget M3, early model Bolts, and such hitting the used markets. \n\nBut, I suspect a few things hold sticker prices up. One is, car makers perceive they can get the higher prices for EVs. \n\nSecond, and somewhat controversial are the tax credits. When GM went over the threshold, they started discounting Bolt heavily, basically you can now get Bolts for about the same price as with the full tax credit, without having to wait for the tax filing season. Part of that was competition (Hyundai, Kia, VW) arriving or at the doorstep. But, GM claims they are making money on Bolt sales. So, one can't help but wonder if they kept MSRP artificially high knowing tax credits would make the cars financially appealing enough to sell.\n\nTax credits may not be as helpful anymore. For one, there are options now that didn't exist a few years ago, the VW and Rivian \"platform\" offers, existing components from third party (Panasonic, LG Chem, Delta, etc) becoming available, and just a primed market. So, the barrier to entry is not as high as it was for Nissan, Tesla and GM. \n\nCertainly, there are tech features in EV that I didn't have 7 years ago when I made my last new car purchase, but most of it is available in ICE now too.\n\nReally, the biggest factor that will sway those on the sidelines will be proof positive that the TCO clearly favors EVs.\n\nFor me, I bought a Hybrid Fusion in 2013 for about $32K. It was great, but 43MPG was a gateway drug. When I bought my Bolt, I paid $43K, less $12,500 in Fed and CO tax credits, for a net price of about $31K! The kicker was, the Bolt would be far more efficient to operate (it has handily met this hurdle), will cost me next to nothing in maintenance, and will theoretically be useable for more years than ICE\\\\Hybrids before maintenance costs become more than a new car payment. \n\nI believe the masses in ICE now will be swayed by compelling proof of TCO benefits. Most not already in EVs are not highly motivated by emissions concerns. But, sticker shock remains a big obstacle that many never get past. \n\nPerhaps if all tax incentives were eliminated and EV had to be sold in a competitive market, it might reduce the resistance?",

You can get into a new EV for about half the price. (mostly the leaf and bolt)  Keep in mind that the leaf still gets the 7.5K tax credit.\n\n2) No guaranteed charger (**this is a big one**) You said that you have one \"around the corner\", but does that mean you own it and no one can block it or that there is a plug that is usually available? What if you move? \n\n3) Charging every \"few weeks\" - how many miles are you driving a month?  The more the better from a cost recovery standpoint. If you are a low mileage driver, I'd just stick with what you have and drive it into the ground.\n\nSince you asked for feedback, I got a Ioniq EV LT about a year ago and love it. Like you, I looked at the Tesla but just couldn't justify the price difference (about $15K). The main reason I went with it over the leaf or bolt was that it looked like a normal sedan. \n\nThe other option is to buy a used EV, there are quite a few out there under $15K that would suit your needs and save you $25K over a new Tesla.\n\nYou mention \"bells and whistles\"....  Which ones specifically do you like?",

Tesla's inflated prices are indicative of just how insane demand is for their cars, and I think the most likely outcome is Tesla lowering the Model Y price slightly while still selling out with months-long waiting lists. \n\nUntil another automaker makes EV ownership as seamless as Tesla does with their charging network, trip planner, app, and software updates (and solves issues like [overheating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi_sChlWTRc) and laggy software), Tesla will keep enjoying massive sales and the best owner satisfaction numbers.",

We can use NYC as an example - Bloomberg spent a lot of money creating bike lanes, but they've become double parking lanes and pedestrian lanes. Dedicated bike lanes lined by bumps to keep cars out are a huge undertaking. Cycling is great, but it's not gonna be easy to convert our car infrastructure to something really bike friendly.

I'm looking at a E-ST 900, 27.5\" MTB with a mid-drive worth €2200, and its battery is a 36V, 14Ah (504Wh) unit. Which is quite respectable in the world of ebikes, but barely above entry-level in the world of e-scooters: even my old Speedway Mini4Pro used to have a 48V 13Ah battery (624Wh), and that was the shitty cheap version with no-name cells that I paid a grand total of €460 for.\n\nAnd that's a moderately expensive e-bikes. Pay one as much as you're paying your average Ninebot scooter and you get horrible crap like 24V 7.8Ah batteries that are *really* only meant to assist you pedaling.",

It's highly unlikely but if you operate before they give you permission you can be liable if it ends up damaging their equipment. That's not a risk I would take. Also, PGE won't give you credit for surplus solar fed to the grid until the date they grant permission to operate, so the best is you'll offset your usage during the day, but you'll still be paying full price at night.\n\nI know it's hard but I would just wait it out. Also it doesn't hurt to follow up with PGE and Tesla after a couple weeks to make sure things move along.",

If you are already maxing out your 20% extra space with your solar array, then later, when you retrofit a battery-bank on its own inverter, or perhaps a back-up generator, or perhaps both.... well, you're out of amperage.  \n  \nThat's why NEC 2014 accounts for sum of all inverters x 125%, plus sum of OCPD, which should not exceed bussbar ratings. Again, any overloads are because the panel was loaded above its rating without addressing the main service panel.  \n  \n&gt; Under no circumstance can a line-side connection be performed hot  \n  \nThis happens all the time. Most electricians are cowboys too, and homeowners don't have tolerance for an all-day outage to coordinate with the utility.",

"comment": "&gt; I mean if every window was a solar panel then wouldn't electricity not be a problem\n\nGenerally, if you try and make a solar panel a \"solar panel and\" type device, it ends up being crappy at being both a solar panel and a \"whatever you want it to be as well.\"\n\nExample: Solar Roadways.  Shitty solar collection, shitty roadways.\n\nExample: Solar windows.  I can't speak for you, but I like the fact that my windows are clear so I can see through them.  Making them try and collect sun interferes directly with their use as a window.  Further, my windows are vertical, and that's a bad orientation for solar panels.  It's OK in the dead of winter, but it's not good any other time of year.  My office solar panels, right now, are about 20 degrees off horizontal for summer sun, and they'll be closer to vertical in the winter, but still not vertical.\n\nSolar panels are like cold blooded lizards.  They wish to be left alone to sit in as much sun as they can find.\n\n&gt; I also don't get why the U.S. can't invest more in making solar power our lives.\n\nFeel free to invest in solar.  It sounds like you want someone else to pay for your solar windows, though.",

"comment": "Adding to this - definitely an AGM or gel cell battery; others will dry out really fast in those temperatures. Keep an eye on the max charge rate specification as well. Sealed batteries work by recombining the hydrogen and oxygen back into water; if you charge too fast they vent, which means you lose some hydrogen and oxygen and run the risk of the vents not re-sealing. I'm not 100% but I think I read that they work by having an excess of one component which makes the recombination work faster, and after they vent you lose that excess and they don't recombine as well.\n\nOn note #4, keep in mind that even on an overcast day, you still get power from solar panels. Even if it doesn't charge the battery at all, if it powers the load and keeps it from discharging for 6-8 hours on those days, that still changes your equation quite a bit.\n\nIf you can, burying the batteries in a box might make a huge difference in temperature and life span. No idea what the soil temperature gradient is like in your environment, but you might only have to go 6 inches or so to make a big difference.",

"comment": "The existing hot water system probably is not pv? Pv means photovoltaic. That means turning light into electric power. That power can them either go to an inverter (to create ac electric power like you get from the power company) or it can be stored in batteries. Pv means a bunch of solar panels on your roof, connected with wires.\n\n Solar hot water on the other hand is usually a hose in a greenhouse and maybe a small pump to cycle water from a tank up to the roof. The water is heated with the sun and them put back in the tank.\n\nHeating water is generally more efficient with the second method, largely because there are fewer energy conversions. If you need to turn light into DC power and then into ac power (or use a DC heater) that is more conversions. Each conversion loses some of the energy. Thermal storage is pretty good if you want to save up heat from the sun and them use the heat later. A big water tank is cheaper and can hold more energy than batteries. It's just only useful for heat, and not electricity.",

I don’t remember from reading the article but even if it doesn’t, I’ve seen people spend more than 10 grand on the aesthetics of their home.. doesn’t seem too outlandish. Even better if you take your high prices or if his price included a powerwall.\nPlus any state or federal rebates would be in the total price of Tesla’s roof right?

"comment": "Those numbers help.  This is how I calculated it based upon your numbers:\n\n* Cost is $10,000\n* First year saving is $830.22, which is the $897.5354 x 92.5%.\n* Second year savings is $813.3668, which is a 3% decrease times a 1% increase from the previous year.   The 3% number is because the powerwall 2 has a [warranty to have 70% of its capacity after 10 years.](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/powerwall_2_ac_warranty_us_1-4.pdf)  Put in simple terms, it will lose 3% capacity (more or less) every year.  The 1% is to account for rising electricity prices.  To be simple, I could have called it a 2% decrease since the difference between 1% and 1- (0.97 x 1.01) isn't significant here.\n* Third year savings is $796.8554, also using the same -3% and +1% from the previous year.\n* Fourth year savings is $780.6793, also using the same -3% and +1% from the previous year.\n* Tenth year saving is $690.28954, also using the same -3% and +1% from the previous year.\n\nAccounting for the first ten years, the savings doesn't even pay for the system.  The internal rate of return is -4.87%.\n\nWhat if we lie and get the 30% tax credit? Answer: 1.53%.  Still bad.  Getting a 6% loan to make 1.53% is a bad financial decision. \n\nWhat if the battery lasts 15 years? Answer: 6.38%. Maybe if OP can deduct the interest on the loan, maybe this will work, maybe.  To me, the difference in interest rate is not enough to take a risk buying the battery. \n\nWhat if the battery lasts 20 years?  Answer 8.205%.  Better, but to me, assuming the inputted numbers are correct, 8% is not enough return to warrant the risk here.  Add in the possibility that the numbers are generous toward gains means the 8% could very well be less. \n\nHere's more information about the ITC and batteries: http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/02/when-is-energy-storage-eligible-for-the-30-percent-itc.html It doesn't look good for OP to get a battery.",

That's why there aren't any solar installers out there.  \n\nI have family in OK and would love to run a small company there, but for now it just doesn't make sense.  I think you should try and do a few jobs, first on your house, later on friends/family where you can take some time and learn the craft.  It isn't that hard but nuances make the difference between losing money and making money.  \n\nYou do not need a GC license in OK. \n\nI would not quit your day job till you've got this worked out a little bit, but best of luck to you, honestly.   There are a lot of beautiful roofs in OK with open spaces and no obstructions, I've always thought it would be a great state for solar.  \nMessage me If you want to know more about racking hardware, I work for a racking company and have years of install experience,  and could give you some training links and a couple of tips. (Idc if you use our products it's just useful solar stuff).",

If you are not cost sensitive and think a canopy is better than a rooftop system + a standard carport for your money, there are options people have mentioned here.\n\nYou can DIY but you will need to deal with things like water drainage in the design. I've driven by a few that I would have guessed were \"home made\" structures where perhaps a contractor was hired to finish by installing solar panels and wiring it to the house. \n\nAre you sure all your utility and state incentives, if they exist, are unaffected by not installing solar on the structure?",

The can and will do things like make the peak rate hours longer, increase cost of electricity at night so they can charge your more when panels are not producing, decrease cost of electricity during peak solar hours so they can pay you less when you are selling electricity to the grid, etc.\n\nAdd it all up and I think you'll be glad to have the extra capacity in a few years and I would not convert from gas to electricity if your goal is to save money.",

And this is just a different way to install solar panels onto your house-- it's a conventional PV system with a special way of installing the panels.\n\nThis guy's system has a SolarEdge 3000 which is not compatible with DC-coupled batteries (basically good/real batteries) so he would need to use an AC-coupled option like an Eguana or Tesla powerwall.  Neither of which are great options to integrate with solar.",

Then run the wires from the Y connectors to the Charge controller. \n\nI'd base the battery voltage on the loads you want to power. 12v electrical components are pretty common. Do you have anything already that runs on 24v?\n\nYes, if you are going to parallel two batteries (or series connect them for that matter) they need to be exactly the same make and model. And brand new or used from the exact same system. New is obviously safer though.",

As a sales rep are you not allowed to lower your commission to get the sale? Standard solar commission is anywhere from 3-5% (pretty hefty) Just because the price came down doesn’t mean the company was trying to rip you off the first time. It’s more likely the company is still making the same profit but the salesperson is wiling to make less to get the sale then the company ripping you off. \n\nSunpower will never be the cheapest proposal and the dealers know that. Successful sunpower dealers sell value not price and that is why they tend to not negotiate on pricing because they are trained not to focus on it.",

"comment": "Chris Mitchell The Australian September 12, 2021\n\nNever mind the UN’s “code red for the planet”. It’s D-Day for the media when The New York Times, The Guardian, Vanity Fair and the Nine newspapers go into overdrive over what they claim is a plan by News Corp’s Australian tabloids to run a marketing campaign for net zero emissions by 2050. \n\nMarketing has more to do with emotion than fact. At much of the climate alarmist media, emotional journalistic responses to climate politics always trump factual analysis of climate science. It’s why the former Fairfax newspapers were so keen on the utterly useless “Earth Hour” climate pose in the noughties.\n\nOutlets excited about the climate campaign story on page one of The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday don’t often report climate science facts. \n\nAs this column said on August 15 and Holman Jenkins wrote in The Wall Street Journal on September 4, last month’s sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pared back warming claims and gave low probability to the outlier “RCP 8.5” scenario which Extinction Rebellion followers claim will cause havoc within a decade.\n\n➖ The words “code red for humanity” do not appear in IPCC 6, even though they were all over Australian media reports last month. Those words were the political spin from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Lazy environment writers reported that spin, but ignored the fact IPCC 6 had toned down temperature forecasts, found little evidence of increasingly severe storms and admitted much of the warming built into the system might take more than a century to eventuate.\n\nGuterres’ agenda was not about the science but about the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November.\n\nThe UN is desperate to avoid a repeat of the failures of previous COP meetings. Glasgow will probably fail too because the world’s No.1 and 3 emitters, China and India, refuse to lift their Paris 2030 CO2 emissions reduction targets. Emissions will still be rising in 2030.\n\nIt’s not climate science denial but accurate reporting of climate politics that drives activist journalists, the Greens and former prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull nuts. Journalists at the News Corp papers have for decades accepted CO2 is linked to atmospheric warming. \n\nCritics need to explain why they support policies that will hurt Australian living standards and jobs when China, India, Russia, Brazil, much of South-East Asia and much of eastern Europe will keep lifting emissions.\n\nWhile News does employ a couple of outright deniers they do not write about climate for its newspapers. This newspaper began editorialising in favour of a least-cost emissions trading scheme almost 20 years ago — five years before Rudd and then Prime Minister John Howard each took a similar policy to the 2007 election.\n\nThe Australian opposed Howard’s mandated Renewable Energy Target, believing it inconsistent with a trading system designed to send price signals to investors. We argued for limiting any emissions reduction targets to the same levels as reductions by our major trading partners.\n\nWhy? Because getting ahead of the big emitters would do nothing for the planet but would drive domestic manufacturing to countries with cheaper power and lower environmental standards.\n\nThe Australian also opposed showpiece policies that would do little to reduce emissions but cost a bomb. Think Julia Gillard’s 2010 “cash for clunkers” policy that had a price of between $400 and $600 for each tonne of CO2 abated, when the EU carbon price was $8 a tonne. At the time both George Monbiot in The Guardian and Michael Green at Fairfax made similar points.\n\nToday the application of any such rational analysis to climate proposals is branded climate denial. It’s rubbish journalism and many of the outlets that publish it carry advertising from companies that benefit from renewables subsidies.\n\nA paper last month by former National Party senator Ron Boswell — no scientist but a man of common sense — looks at what has happened to emissions in different countries. The paper, presented to the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth, uses UN data to show China’s share of global manufacturing from 2004 to 2018 rose from 8.7 per cent to 28.4 per cent.\n\nEurope’s emissions from industrial processes from 1990 to 2018 fell 40 per cent, but global emissions in that sector rose 67 per cent, most of it in China. Pointing this out is not climate denialism. As even The Guardian warned in 2019: “Britain has contributed to the global climate emergency by outsourcing its carbon emissions to the developing world.”\n\nNor was it denialism when this column pointed out British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is getting credit for committing to net zero by 2050 while actually doing very little to achieve that. Ditto US coal and gas export increases this year under President Joe Biden.\n\nThe left media’s biggest targets at News Corp, Graham Lloyd and Andrew Bolt, accept man-made climate change but anger the activists because they report inconvenient truths. Think the 2019 peer-reviewed Auckland University study that proves most Pacific atolls are rising rather than sinking. The real deniers are journalists who won’t report such science.\n\nAnd then there are the problems in energy reliability as the penetration of wind and solar rises. Many journalists on Twitter last month bagged a story in this newspaper which revealed the Energy Security Board would consider paying coal-fired power generators to remain open. This is not denialism. Pretending a nation can have firm grid-scale power without fossil fuels, nuclear power or enormous hydro battery storage is engineering denial. California is confronting that fact with plans for five new gas peaking power plants that will firm the grid when the sun isn’t shining or wind blowing.\n\nNor is supporting coal exports climate denial. China and its Belt and Road Initiative clients are building hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Demands from UN Climate Action Team assistant chief Selwin Hart last week that Australia phases out coal-use are silly. Australia’s is among the cleanest coal in the world. If we stop exporting it, coal-committed nations will burn dirtier coal from Indonesia, China, Russia and South Africa — bad for the planet and for Australian jobs.\n\nHow little respect do media and marketers have for their readers and customers? Why not trust them with the facts about costs of climate action? The world’s financial institutions may be convinced, but polling globally shows voters largely support climate action but are not prepared to pay much for it. Australians are not turkeys voting for Christmas. Why risk their own living standards with only 1.3 per cent of global emissions?\n\nAnd when local New York Times correspondent Damien Cave suggests News Corp newspapers target scientists personally, that’s usually not about climate denial.\n\nFormer climate commissioner Tim Flannery in 2007 claimed the nation’s dams would never fill again. Later he claimed oceanfront apartments would be inundated several floors up, but bought tidal land nearby. Outing Flannery’s denial of reality was good journalism.\n\nWhat of News Corp’s new net zero campaign? The SMH got it wrong. News’s Australian boss Michael Miller made clear late Friday there would be no centrally imposed climate position. A plan to focus on the environment in the lead-up to Glasgow came from the editors. In a week that started with hearings by the media diversity inquiry, activist journalists will be shocked News’s reporters remain free to write and say what they think. That’s diversity.",

If you save $600 but spend $10k, you payback is 16 years. I wouldn't invest in that. \n\nMind you, if you DIY you can probably do a 4kW system yourself for under 10k, but your current usage would only be for a 1.5kW system (a lot of net metering agreements won't let you oversize by that much would adding extra load).",

Next year is batteries (powerwall or alternative), and wife's BEV should be likely the year after (maybe stretching a bit for 3rd row BEVs if they continue to be delayed). Getting a Lvl 2 charger installed hopefully by year end to grab that credit.\n\nI plan to drive the PHEV like an EV for almost all of my driving. We unfortunately don't have enough charging infrastructure on the path to the inlaws. East Texas is a black hole outside of one Tesla supercharger stop, and I'm not in position to wait for a Model Y thats 10-15k more expensive pre credit. Plan is to upgrade the PHEV when the charging infrastructure exists and more large family vehicles/3rd row become available. \n\nIf anything, I'm weighing options on a 2nd 240v plug vs a dual plug system. Leaning single outlet and single plug, then waiting to see what dual charging prices look like in 2-4 years. Hoping they continue to drop. My bet is we could get both vehicles on one cable like you're doing, but my wife is terrible at logistics planning and would undoubtedly end up at less than 20% charge and feign desperation - yes I'm exaggerating but also am I?",

I’ve only had mine installed for less than a month but with 2 powerwalls in the spring and summer months I will probably be able to shut off the grid if I wanted. Not sure how they would respond if batteries died completely and had to be recharged and there was no solar so maybe one day I will try that out but asking because you might know already. Thanks. I have 7.86 kw solar with 2 powerwalls and Tesla gateway",

"comment": "Serious answer-  the issue is who pays vs. who benefits.  \n\nThey want to build 288,000 wind turbines and and 16,000 solar farms.  Who pays for that?  Utilities.  Or maybe the government.  \n\nA big part of that return is from health and climate costs, and lives saved from lack of air pollution deaths.  Utilities aren't getting those savings.  They might be getting some savings from low per-unit cost power, but not from the other issues.  \n\nFinally to make this work requires a bunch of new tech.  Specifically, a smart grid that can dynamically route power around from where the sun is shining / wind is blowing to where it's needed.  If one place is cloudy and calm, power needs to flow from another place that might be sunny and windy.  And the next day it might go in reverse.  \nA lot of utilities haven't made that kind of investment.  Look at residential solar in a lot of states- many utilities would rather resi solar just goes away because even though the grid is overloaded, demand will be constant.  If you have a bunch of people with solar panels, demand will be lower, until a cloud comes out and then demand goes up.  So you have to have a system that reacts quickly and can route power to where it's needed.  \n\nWe should absolutely be doing this.  I'd like to see it as a nation priority with a 'move, follow, or get out of the way' mandate to everyone involved from utilities to manufacturers down to every little municipality and their utility permitting fiefdoms that add 3 months delay and 30% cost to a solar install.  But it takes LEADERSHIP.  We're lacking in that department.",

"comment": "Yeah I had this offer too. The idea is there is no loan, they own the solar panels and say they are operating as a utility company. Sales rep said was referred by my neighbor who likes them. So essentially it’s this..  customer pays no cost for equipment or installation, Sunrun owns the equipment on your home, you pay them the standard (lower) rate as the electric company charged. They said they will only go up on price around 3% a year, where as the electrical company(SDGE for me) rep said they may go up 17% next year. I wondered, what’s the catch? I don’t really like the idea of the company owning the equipment I rely on that’s attached to my home, but it is an attractive offer - I don’t have to buy the solar stuff or lease it, just pay them like a utility. What am I missing?",

Known reserves and NOT from O&G companies: \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-largest-oil-reserves-country-164927540.html\n\nHow much is the unknown reserve? \n\nWhen and if oil becomes too expensive to extract and process, we MAY see a shift to renewables but only if that source is cheaper.  You are also omitting that technology is moving at an amazing pace and while fracking was indeed a game changer, none of us know what new technology yet to be introduced can make even more energy recoverable at a cheaper price.  \n\nWe agree force is wrong way to get people to do things and yet we see many advocates pushing for that.  They want to tax you by miles you drive. In Holland they are forcing dairy farmers to shut down.  NYC forcing restaurants that use coal and wood fired pizza oven to install equipment to reduce the emissions by 75% or face fines.  They want to ban gas ovens and in California, they force new housing to install solar panels raising the cost by an estimated $10,000.00.   Some states are forcing their citizens to purchase EVs and todays internal combustion cars are banned.  That’s how they do it. They don’t send the “climate police” to your house, they just increase your costs or fine you into obedience.  You chose s small town, but the majority of people live in big cities and in some of them, walking to the nearest business means you may not return home.   \n\nEV’s you may have the ability to pay up front for what will have a 10 year return on investment, but most people don’t.  I don’t, I can’t spend thousands of $ more today to see savings 10 years down the line.  A business will only make capital investments when the ROI is 2-3 years or less. If not that, it makes no sense.  Also as studies have shown, there is not enough cobalt and lithium to transition the world’s economy.  That does not even take into account the environmental damage and human costs of mining them.  I encourage you to research where and how they are brought to market.  \n\nAs for China - do you know the human toll in lives lost and disrupted to build the 3 gorges dam?  The environmental damage it has caused?  \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-three-gorges-dam-disaster/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/style/article/china-three-gorges-dam-intl-hnk-dst/index.html\n\nDo you understand the human toll China’s transition to renewables is having?  It’s not like the US, when the government wants to build a wind or solar farm, a dam or geothermal facility, they just take the land and do it.  I don’t think you want the US to use China’s practices to make us bring more renewables to market. \n\nLike I said, I support any and all forms of energy.  I believe O&G will eventually run out and we need to find new ways to power our world.   Cold fusion, hydrogen, wind, solar, geothermal and everything else theoretical or practical.  It’s the constant drumbeat of doom and gloom, all the fake predictions that have failed to materialize and most of all, how the loudest and most irritating voices fail to live like they want us to live.  When they show us by their actions rather than words we have a crisis, them maybe folks will take notice.",

"comment": "Air conditioning and any other prolonged 240v use will drain a Powerwall in a hurry.  You will have 27kWh of stored power if both of the Powerwalls are full.  If you use 3kWh each hour which a central air conditioner can easily exceed when added to your household electric use, you will last less than 9 hours after sunset before you run out of power.  If the sun is shining brightly from around 10am to around 2pm, your panels will produce plenty of power for you to run most everything in your house and charge your batteries up to full.\n\nYou will likely have to adjust your thermostat temperature up, turn off your air conditioning, avoid using an electric water heater or clothes dryer, etc. if you are in an overnight outage.  That is what I do.  During an extended outage, you always want enough battery power to last you until the next sunny morning at sunrise with at least 5kWh to spare as it takes an hour or more after sunrise to start generating sufficient solar power to make you comfortable enough to start turning things back on.  Check the weather forecast multiple times each day and then decide if you need the air conditioning off or set to a higher temp or to normal temp and if you need to conserve anything else.  I try to make sure I can sleep at a somewhat comfortable temperature at the expense of comfort when I am awake if I need to conserve power.\n\nOn a very cloudy stormy day you will get maybe 10% of your normal sunny day solar power so if the next day is going to be a bad solar day, you really have to conserve your limited battery power.",

Yes, you're paying way less if you're in a country that allows these imports, and I'm not denying the quality either. But China's goal here is not for the benefit of mankind. The moment they can monopolize/control the market on panels (US included), they're not going to keep those low prices.\n\nI live in the US, want cheap quality solar panels, and we're getting there via the free market. I'm also for free-(er) trade with friendly democratic nations like our bordering friends and friends in the EU and abroad. \n\nInstallers in the US can pick up panels for $0.20 a watt these days in the US. Production is ramping up, competition in production is ramping up, and the price is getting lower naturally as a result.\n\nChina, and any of its companies, are not anyone's friend no matter how cheap their solar panels are. Engaging with China in any capacity is a major risk to your country's security, and supports some pretty terrible evil leaders. I'm glad we're staying away from their solar products, and hope policies like this continue.",

"comment": "Solar air heaters are cheaper and simpler and more efficient than electric solar panels. Converts more of the sunshine to heat. And they can work fine off grid.\n\nBut you only get hot/warm air from them. You need something like a thermostat regulated air-air heat pump as well. Then the air-air heat pump can take over at night. And when the solar air heater starts generating heat the heat pump automatically turn off.\n\nIf you build a new house you could build a house with good insulation and a lot of thermal mass. Stone/sand/water. And use the thermal mass to even out the temperature over the day or even the week. \n\nYou could also have solar water heaters. Then you could have a big insulated water tank to accumulate the solar heat from sunny days and use it to heat the house during the night or cloudy and colder days. But that is more complicated. Great in combination with floor heating and a wood furnace that can also heat the water. \n\nWater is amazing for heat storage and transport. You can store huge amounts of heat in water and when you need heat somewhere you can pump it there.\n\nThere are even concentrating vacuum insulated solar water heaters. They can produce very hot water even when it very cold outside. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH8Z9nBrCBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH8Z9nBrCBg)\n\nIf you live in a seasonal cold area then you worry about cold and want heat and can get it from solar without first making electricity. But you need some other form of heating as well. Solar heating is best on sunny days... \n\nIf you live in a hot/warm area you want to run your AC and need electricity from solar panels. Solar panels and AC is a great combination, because when the sun shine you want electricity to run the AC.",

"comment": "Sugar: Not very useful, but I personally eat more of it than I should, mostly because it's so hard for a lazy cook to avoid.  I don't go out of my way to buy \"vegan\" sugars, but tend to prefer the \"sugar in the raw\" in terms of taste anyways, which I think is probably vegan.   I have found that being vegan seems to reduce the sugar craving, as I don't particularly like sweet foods, or non-sweet foods where sugar may be added.  Maybe that's just me. I do love quality chocolate, though.  \r\n\r\nArtificial sweeteners: As far as I am concerned, their only point is to trick your body into ingesting crap that you otherwise would not eat.  I avoid aspartame like the plague after watching a documentary on it on Netflix.  I'll take sugar over artificial any day.  I'll occasionally sweeten something with, or partly with, Stevia (which is a natural sweetner).\r\n\r\nCaffeine: I partake of this on occasion when I use it as a mild drug.  For example, prior to an important meeting, or to improve alertness when driving for extended periods.  I love coffee mixed with chocolate soy or hemp milk at about 50/50 mixture hot or on ice.\r\n\r\nCarbonation: All the time.  I have a home soda maker (from sodastreamusa.com), and prefer sparkly water to regular water.  Sometimes I will mix it with juice to reduce the thickness and sweetness of the juice to make a soda-like drink.  I do not know of any harm in carbonation itself, but if you do I would be glad to know.  I believe that all of the bad press over \"carbonated drinks\" is mostly because they often contain nasty things like artificial sweeteners, sugar, high fructose corn syrup, etc.  Also, they sometimes come in BPA plastics.",

If you're a minor, the best thing to do is remain rational and explain your viewpoint, citing research that shows eating vegan is actually quite healthy and not detrimental/sign of eating disorder. A good place to start (since you are dealing with medical professionals) is the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (pcrm.org). Backing up your decision with sound research and recommendations by medical doctors, PhDs and other health experts is a great rebuttal.",

We disagree, and that is fine. I just regret that your hostility and childishness have made this a less-than-interesting conversation. You have some interesting points, but it is difficult to take them seriously when they are shouted and interlaced with five-year-old-style responses.\n\nI recommend that you adjust your tone if you want to have productive debates in the future.

There might be exceptions where there is no ethical dilemma in eating meat or animal products but doing so creates excuses for more gray areas to be forgivable. Eating is very impulsive for some so this can be a slippery slope. My ethics aren't even fully realized to be honest but I can't really find a good reason to not be fully vegan and given my penchant for impulsive eating, being an absolutist is the only way to go.",

I do so because products like eggs and milk contain elements in them that aren't good for your health. Watch the documentary forks over knives. It gives you a more detailed explanation on why these foods can be harmful to the body. Plus it's an awesome documentary in general.",

"comment": "I don't have any sort of a formal eating disorder, but I have some disordered eating patterns, and there can definitely be some, er, interference between them. I'd say that's a real concern and something you should be conscious of if you try it out. To top it all off, a lot of the books and websites about veganism you might look at will also be oriented towards low-cal, weight-loss, low-carb sorts of concerns.\n\nI'd recommend easing into it and really, really not sweating small things. Work on easing eggs out of your diet, but don't worry about l-cysteine or where the stearic acid comes from or any of that shit. Don't read the labels if you've been having feelings of stress or body dimorphism or whenever you're likely to trigger; rather, if you want to do more research on ingredients lists, do it when you're feeling good and have already eaten (and preferably on the internet, rather than in person), so it can be more of a detached experience.\n\nWhen you're out for dinner with friends, it can be *really, really* easy to pass off not eating (in my case, usually drinking my dinner) and socially justifying it by saying *there are no vegan options, but I'll eat when I get home\"&amp;mdash;and then just not. Even unintentionally. You may be better off going into social meals with the idea that you'll order something and eat (without asking too many questions, if that might be triggering as well&amp;mdash;feel free to ask your server or the chef for a recommendation and go with it) even if you can't be sure that it's fully vegan.\n\nOn the yay side: it's really hard to calorie count piles of grains and vegetables. Let me tell you, I couldn't calorie count my diet if I had an intern to spreadsheet things for me. Soups, stews, stove top gravies, stuffed vegetables, bulk grains and legumes done pilaf style, big salads with piles of nuts&amp;mdash;mostly things that don't have nutritional information labels on them to begin with.",

Really cool presentation, I thought.\n\nOne of the keystones of this intersection between veganism and anarchism is [Animal Liberation and Social Revolution by Brian Dominick]( http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/brian-a-dominick-animal-liberation-and-social-revolution). \n\nThe group that organised the talk in the vimeo video is Resistance Ecology, which has its own periodical available on its [website]( http://www.resistanceecology.org).\n\nYou could also try /r/veganarchism although it is not tyat active at present. It does have quite a few nice links if you look back through the history, however.\n\nUltimately though, as I think the video illustrates well, the best way to learn is to go out into the world and do. Food Not Bombs is often a good place to meet people and if you are more inclined to direct action then local hunt sabotage groups and other single issue campaign organisations (such as SHAC, talked about in the video) are not only educational but a great place to meet lovely people.",

Some gentle prodding over a long time from some well meaning vegetarian friends made me slowly understand a new point of view that has lead me, years later, to being vegan.\n\nIf you believe in something, you should talk about it. I'm certain you'll have influenced opinions in your life. Don't be so harsh on yourself :)",

Potential for a fetus exists any time a male and female have vaginal sex, so potential for life is not a practical measurement for morality. This leads us to veganism and zygotes. Zygotes cannot feel pain, nor can they suffer.\n\nA fetus can sense and respond to stimuli at 20 weeks. These neurological frameworks do not mature into the capacity to feel pain until 24 weeks. Incidentally, this is also when most medical communities consider a fetus to be viable outside the womb, and most states do not permit abortions after this point unless they're necessary for the safety of the mother.\n\nThe number of abortions after 24 weeks in the US is estimated to be about 0.08% of all abortions.",

This was probably one of the worst ones I've seen, and it's made worse by the fact that I live in the Netherlands and so it's very close to home.\n\nYou're right though, there is so many things that we don't see. So many things we're conditioned to think and do. After going vegan I've definitely also started to look differently at money and society. I thought I had trust issues before going vegan, but this opened up a whole new dimension of trust issues, lmao!",

We know they react to their environment, but they lack all the physical structures that we recognize as necessary for consciousness.\n\nWhat's important is not that they *are* different, it's a matter of the ways the ways they are different, and how that matters from a moral perspective. One of the basic premises of veganism is that animals deserve consideration because they posses traits that we would, in other cases, recognize as being morally important. If plants lack those traits, and it seems that they do, then I don't see any moral requirement to consider their needs.\n\nSuppose I go in for surgery. If a nurse pricks me with a needle, I will be unconscious, and won't experience any pain. However, my body will still go through all the processes to seal the wound. Blood will clot, lymphocytes will be dispatched, flesh will knit. None of those processes have anything to do with why it's wrong to harm me in a waking state of consciousness though.\n\nI think we are allowed to use what we know to make decisions about things like this. Keeping in mind also, we cannot prove a negative. Prove that plants don't feel pain. That's a silly demand, because we can always simply wonder if there isn't some other \"way of experiencing\" we're ignorant of. We are only able to use positive tests to see if they *do* feel pain, or suffer. Currently, it seems like that isn't the case.",

One is the easy, simplified one that says \"no animals or animal products\". We normally use this when talking to non-vegan people because it's easy to remember. However, the more accurate definition would be more like the Vegan Society's definition, which is in the sidebar. This definition generally states that veganism is against the exploitation and harm of animals, most commonly by avoiding animal products.\n\nWith the first definition you run into issues with human breastmilk and gasoline. This is why we use the second definition as a benchmark. Since no dinosaurs are being farmed, harmed, or exploited, using gasoline is vegan.",

Surely you realise how many products contain milk powder for some inexplicable reason.\n\nIt’s outright dangerous to just tell people to cut out meat, dairy and eggs without a replacement in their diet. There’s a lot of people who would have very little left in their diet if they did that. So no, it’s not “going out of your way” to sustain yourself with the food you know to eat. There has to be some education to be able to discard their previous years of education and experience surrounding food. Do not over simplify this.",

Gay rights were won in a riot, women's right to vote happened on the back of the suffragettes literally murdering and threatening politicians, and all throughout history slavery has been cast down after revolts, uprisings and wars. Positive change happens through sweat, blood and effort. Nobody has ever won their rights by asking politely, and animals can't ask at all. Lets look at a directly relevant issue though. In our country we kill 309 animals per person per year on average. My mind was changed by an angry vegan. That means that her anger has saved 309 animals at the least by changing my mind at the minimum. I don't think I could rescue and take care of 309 animals physically in my lifetime, and yet one anger fuelled talk from her alone has saved 309 *every year* since. The only change that hasn't been positive is that I'm ashamed I hadn't listened to them sooner. Instead of just accepting the world is a bad chance and trying to smile about it, lets put in the effort to make it a better place *through our actions*.",

Giving children the healthy diet that humans have always eaten is more important than the lives of animals who  would perish\nfrom other predators anyway.

"comment": "Speak for yourself, mate. While I've never really done all that much street activism or outreach or whatevs (largely because it does two third of fuck all to convince people that animals deserve basic rights or change a single fucking thing whatsoever), I know that if I had to interact with dozens of people, often on a daily basis, telling me that slaughterhouses are good actually, that non-humans deserve the worst treatment imaginable as punishment for not being 'as close to God as humans' or any of the thousands of 'killing animals is good and animals deserve to suffer actually' arguments that non-vegans have, I'd likely want to rip my own genitals out and shove them into my eye sockets after as little as an hour after conversing with animal g0re festishists. \n\nThe more you interact with non-vegans the more you see the absolute worst of them, more and more of them are just flat out saying the quiet parts out loud nowadays and eventually you reach the same conclusion that I did: humans simply aren't capable of any real change, they don't want to side with us to make the world even remotely less horrific and violent and more than likely actually revel in the violence they inflict and perpetuate. It's all just a lost fucking cause at this point, we all may as well give up trying because nothing we do succeeds and things will only ever get worse for animals. The UK government has recently only gone and fucking invested billions of pounds into building new slaughterhouses and funding 'mobile butchers', the latter of which debunks the whole 'poor wittle swaughterhouse rhetoric. If the fact that governments will happily hand over money to industries that thrive on animal bloodbaths but biotech firms, vegan organisations and alt protein start-ups don't get a penny of government funding doesn't say anything about the state of human pathological sadism, I don't know what will. \n\nBeing vegan requires pessimism. How the fuck can I be happy and hopeful when even a seemingly benign video of a happy ex-dairy cow is met with floods of comments talking about how she should be cut up, bled out and eaten, how she's a waste of space if she's even allowed to live at all? Humans are too far gone now, I've accepted that they're nothing like me and I'm nothing like them, and all of them hate animals (and probably secretly want to do 'business' with the freshly life-deleted bodies of baby animals, if you catch my drift.)",

It's \"ladylike\" to watch your figure and eat salads and not be aggressive. It's all BS. \n\nI have people who think I wasnt assertive enough when my wife didn't take my last name. Veganism definitely goes against today's image of a man, but I think that's slowly changing.",

I was in another thread earlier and someone said they blend spinach into smoothies, but for really picky kids who wouldn't even put up with that? Supplements? (vegan) Flinstone gummies?\n\nEDIT: fortified plant milks. There's the ticket. But you could fortify almost anything with calcium (yes?), we're just used to milk = calcium perhaps?\n\nEDIT2: suspicions confirmed, orange juice is usually fortified with calcium. I'll stop making edits now",
