I'd love to watch you argue with elon over the physical possibility of a solar powered car that would make it in the real world.  Crash tests, high speed capability, inconsistency of solar output would all undoubtedly be among his first points.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00029712362205221626,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09624306205660105,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22786265875335526,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2252585779224913,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10527938008317268,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.016785354896758992,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006735438490674521,"ev_1":-0.2703174763164737,"ev_2":-0.020904339997893356,"ev_3":-0.03552725492045283,"ev_4":-0.017067365086404607,"ev_5":-0.034793299423957556,"ev_6":-0.28496182194805186,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.01798940351291094},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

There are *some* people who need to go 300 miles without stopping, but not a lot. There are probably more people who *think* they do, perhaps, but that's essentially 4-5 hours of straight driving. That's not very common to do regularly, but yes, some people do. Fine. They *shouldn't* get an EV now if time is more important to them than money. I don't care. It's a \"low hanging fruit\" issue. The last 5-10% are always the hardest to convert to a new and better technology, and frankly EVs will *never* win the range or speed to refuel contests with ICE vehicles, and that's ok. \n\nAs a dumb analogy, smartphones will *never* win the battery life contest with dumb phones. That didn't stop them from grabbing 98% of the phone market, because they're so much better in every other way that we all just stopped caring about the battery life issue and adapted to a phone that needed to be charged daily (or more often!) rather than weekly. The same thing will happen with EVs. Once more people try them and enjoy the performance, the lower cost to fuel, the lower maintenance, and the realization they'll *never* have to sit around a Jiffy Lube for an hour 3-4 times a year *ever again*, they'll put up with the extra two hours that the 500 mile road trip they take one or twice a year will require in return for how much better an EV is in *all* other respects. \n\nAnd from an environmental standpoint, that last 5% who refuse to switch aren't going to make a significant difference.

Just like you, the car is being driven a lot (at least 300 miles a week for work commute) but the previous car was averaging about 28 mpg.\n\nSo, per day, the car is driven about 20% of the battery for those 50 miles (the Bolt EV has a 65 kWh battery), so that's about 13 kWh per day, times six days times 52 weeks for a total of 4,056 kWh at 18¢ (yes, I've looked, nothing better) that's about $730 per year. \n\nThe ICE vehicle had an efficiency of 28 mpg, so, 50 miles per day, times six days times 52, is a total of 15,600 miles, divided by 28 miles per gallon is a total of about 557 gallons, multiplied by $3 is about $1,671 per year. \n\nSo, only in fuel, I'm saving about +$900 per year. Like you, there will be an extra $200 added to registration (due in two years) but the insurance did go up about $100/month, so we're $500 down.\n\nWhy did we choose the Bolt EV though? Affordability. Besides the tax credit, we were able to 'haggle' for a bit lower price, so the total amount was lower than most of the other affordable Chevy vehicles. \n\nAlso, something that people completely ignore, is the cost of the charger and installation of that charger. Thankfully GM includes a Level 1/2 charger and a $1k install, but others don't. A reliable EVSE (or...charger for simpler although incorrect term) is about $400 and depending on the type of installation, it could be another $400 at the very least. \n\nAlso, sure, no more $60 oil changes and other annoying maintenance stuff, but, tires will needed to be changed sooner than ICE vehicles. \n\nBy the way, just because I bring both the positives AND negative sides doesn't make me a hater, I just don't want people to be misled and then they become the haters.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"yes","ev_3":"yes","ev_4":"yes","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007693639781791717,"1.1.1_stance":-0.12342763359836226,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2548544828961981,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23344124844188627,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2220206746946502,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20169309744000868,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06292743100008617,"ev_1":-0.1415538360143772,"ev_2":-0.14408034540335973,"ev_3":-0.03678179273947535,"ev_4":-0.2152062322502522,"ev_5":-0.02264519956467363,"ev_6":-0.2572270041457548},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

A store can't possibly make 10 sales a day, they couldn't possibly afford to have fuel pumps. If they didn't have fuel pumps they wouldn't have tanker truck deliveries. Sure gas is still a thing, but it's sold in 5 gallon jerry cans on the shelf, next to the motor oil, because they now have similar sales volume.\n\nAnd all the nations refineries wouldn't all continue to operate at 10% capacity, they'd shutdown 90% of them. Now you have one refinery serving the entire country. All those pipelines to other refineries shutdown because there isn't someone at the other end.\n\nAlso, most pipelines have minimum flow rates, petroleum gels when it gets too cold, and it it stops and cools in the pipe it clogs.  Yea many are shipping refined fuel, but the big long distance ones, like the Alaska pipeline don't.  As you said, the Alaskan pipeline is only doing 25% of the capacity, a quick google says they have a hard floor of about 10% of the design capacity.\n\nBasically, I think a lot of people look at this and say if we only had 40% of the current oil consumption, then just maybe half of the gas stations go out of buisness, and you're probably right, along with a refinery or two shutting down. But when you get to say 90-95% of vehicles on the road being EVs, I think the distribution network starts having trouble maintaining any pumps at all (especially the distribution terminals).

I work in the next section of the process which is called cell. We take the wafers and convert them to solar cells which are then sent to the final stage of the process where the individual cells are made into a module. \n\nFor the most part everyone works at what we call \"a tool\" which is essentially a robot designed to do a specific task in the process. \n\nFirst there is a robot that takes the wafers out of the boxes they are shipped in and inserts them into carriers (think of a magazine for a gun) and then also loads them into the TRA which is an overhead series of tracks that run all over the fabrication floor to all the different tools (kind of like an overhead river of carriers) \n\nNext the carriers loaded with wafers go to a a processes designed to remove and saw damage the wafers may have on them from when they were cut from the ingot. This is a chemical process designed to remove and odd edges and make the texture of the wafers uniform. Essentially this is a cleaning process\n\nNext the carriers go to a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process which adds what looks like a golden sheen on the backside of the wafer which is designed to enhance the efficiency of energy conversion.\n\nNext they go to laser tools which etch lines onto the front and back of the wafers which is another step to increase the efficiency.\n\nNext they go through a process which removes any phosphorus glass on the wafers. Another chemical process designed to remove any uneven edges. This is another cleaning process.\n\nNext the go get silicon nitride put on them which also increases efficiency.\n\nNow the wafers have all the chemical processes done to them and they are sent across the hall to the Printline. If you have ever screen printed a T-shirt you already understand this process its essentially the same. The wafer carriers are loaded into the front end of the tool and they are moved under a screen with a thin membrane to allow a silver paste to be printed directly unto the lines the laser tool etched. Then the wafer goes through a dryer and its flipped so silver bus bars are placed on the back side, then through another dryer and then an aluminum paste is added around the bus bars. This process is what allows the electrons to flow through the wafers.\n\nAt this point we have completed solar cells.\n\nNext the cells go through a testing/quality control process which tests the efficiency of the cells and then they are sorted by efficiency to be sent to moduling. \n\nI don't really know the moduling process so I can't really speak to that, I apologize. I've tried many times to get over there and learn it but it seems that my company doesn't want people to know other areas. \n\nThe daily tasks for 98% of employees consist of loading and unloading carriers into the specific tool they work on. Occasionally an alarm will sound signaling an error then the operator will go fix that, usually by just pushing a button.\n\n\n&gt;What major manufacturer recalls are you aware of? What for?\n\nFor the company I work for I know of none. I'm not very happy about how the employees are treated but I am still very proud that we make the highest quality product in the industry. Our motto is \"our customers come back, not our products.\" They have a 30 year guarantee and if for any reason they fail we will fix them or replace them at no cost.\n\n&gt;Have you ever considered going to China and sharing your expertise? You would probably be paid a lot more than what you currently make.\n\nThought about it but the non disclosure agreements I've signed would prevent me from saying much more then what I've told you. \n\n&gt;Why aren't we seeing more integrated modules with micro-inverters?\n\nGood question. I have no idea. I know lots of companies are selling \"kits\" which are kind of like all in one boxes which include modules and inverters in the kit. But that's not interested they're still individual components. \n\n&gt;What is done to seal the aluminum frame to the module glass?\n\nAgain I can't really speak to any level of detail of moduling, I know its essentially like a caulking. \n\n&gt;What is your long term maintenance concern with solar modules?\n\nIf you buy ours, very little. But average maintenance stuff such as, clearing off leaves and needles during fall, cleaning the glass of pollen and oxidation. Just super easy basic stuff. Another company I wanted to work with is a solar array leasing company, they lease you the array, install it, and maintain it for 20 years. \n\nSorry for the vagueness of my answers I'm still technically a temp employee I've only worked there for 9 months. Essentially 1\\2 way through my 18 month temp contract. Thanks for the questions though, I love talking about this stuff!!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0038266495491067567,"1.1.1_stance":-0.22100688268027902,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19426383523166532,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.035153078536192574,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.007244311238810042,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23503318419902408,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0026059488191094715,"solar_1":-0.2958473648953562,"solar_2":-0.15112376525814278,"solar_3":-0.04822255332449762,"solar_4":-0.01686837395876258,"solar_5":-0.002927842613037986,"solar_6":-0.012567548459628597,"solar_7":-0.011908152519026771,"solar_8":-0.017238971049664542,"solar_9":-0.043789756052622884,"solar_10":-0.20285733044147491},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

I'm not sure how much to throw at you at once, so I'll just state a thesis: renewable resources alone cannot power the economy we have today, nor will they be able to.  If energy becomes more costly, it will make everything else more costly as well.  If that happens, the level of complexity of our economy must be reduced.  That means, among other things, reduced aid programs, reduced research and development programs, reduced capacity of production (including silly things like pharmaceuticals), and even reduced energy research.  \n\nYou might be inclined at this point to challenge my assumption that renewables make energy more expensive.  Hydro is the only renewable energy resource cheaper than fossil fuels, and it has already been built out.  Every other renewable energy resource is more expensive than fossil fuels.  If that were not so, they wouldn't need subsidies.\n\nYou might next wish to suggest that perhaps those other resources are more expensive today, but that they will become less expensive in the future.  You might choose to cite the decrease in the cost of silicon PV panels as evidence.  I would then counter with the fact that solar is intermittent.  It produces about six hours per day on average, and then only on sunny days.  \n\n(That's to say nothing of the massive fossil fuel inputs used to create the solar panels, especially in the production of the silver they require.  See [this SciAm article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewable-energys-hidden-costs/) for a shocking illustration of CO2 emissions per kWh from various energy sources, which is a rough a proxy of energy inputs.)\n\nSo in order for solar to become anything more than a bit player in the energy world, it will require backup or storage.  Currently, that backup is in the form of natural gas, the same fossil fuel that backs up wind.  Cost estimates for \"firming\" intermittent power sources like solar have been performed, and [they don't bode well for a renewable energy future](https://theconversation.com/counting-the-hidden-costs-of-energy-12710).\n\nSo what about your point about the finite nature of fossil fuels?  I happen to agree, very strongly in fact.  Of those who comment here, I would bet that I would set peak production for oil, gas, and coal earlier in time than anyone else.\n\nDoes that mean that I espouse Richard Heinberg's view that we must necessarily downsize the economy?  No.  (In fact, I think that stance is immoral, given state of energy poverty a few billion people still experience.)  There's another piece of the puzzle that those who believe in peak fossil fuels yet recognize how insufficient renewables are to the task don't often talk about.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0007137186912586913,"1.1.1_stance":-0.34248359873890877,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2169767998385268,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.273395285500945,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.15747125813062565,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.3104004895586487,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.23060327395796776,"solar_1":-0.00397358797393584,"solar_2":-0.008809125390447056,"solar_3":-0.0024413237309393785,"solar_4":-0.0015828331900896349,"solar_5":-0.0009404299732220048,"solar_6":-0.0002788498071216357,"solar_7":-0.0003871213945482547,"solar_8":-0.0005399245746957604,"solar_9":-0.001131586410338059,"solar_10":-0.005375289705019289,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.4329500355136891},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Think about it this way, if you are about five seconds from a brick wall in a car traveling 100 MPH, you'd still hit the breaks to try to slow it a little bit instead of keeping your foot on the gas.  Climate change is happening and we can at least take our foot off of the gas by reducing the amount of carbon we are producing as much as possible.  We can also metaphorically hit the break by coming up with ways to remove the existing green house gases from the atmosphere. Also, if the worst comes to worst, there are plenty of geo-engineering plans we could try to reverse climate change.  We are a global civilization that caused climate change without even trying, if we dedicate even a fraction of ourselves to fighting it, we can definitely do it. \n\nYour comparisons with other natural events are sort of pointless, but yes, we know how to stop an ice age; no, I don't think we can stop a volcanic eruption; I believe there is actually a growing amount of theory on how to stop hurricanes (but its never been tested); and no, but we can influence El Ninos.  The thing is, climate change is different from all of those this. We know what's causing it and how to combat it.  Even if we can't stop it completely, we can at least reduce the speed and severity with which it hits so humanity has more time to adapt to whatever changes may happen.\n\nEnergy, we do have nuclear fission as a back up, with the slight possibility of fusion at some point.  Also we do have solar power that works while its cloudy and we do know the places that almost constant wind happens.  Also, we are developing better and better batteries as the days go on so we can store energy for the times of less production. I believe one of the most promising battery technologies was a liquid metal battery that is made from very common elements and can store massive amounts of energy (its still in development though, last I heard).  There is also tidal energy, and also there are plenty of ways we are figuring out to more efficiently transmit energy so that large scale shortages of energy in one area can be supplemented by other areas power generation or stored energy.\n\nI don't see how it is risky, at least in the US, our energy infrastructure already  needs a massive overhall and many cleaner energy options can be easily hooked into the grid, especially nuclear, and than other options once battery technology is sufficiently advanced (which seems to be rather soon).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.13452881720045948,"1.1.1_stance":-0.19115512714567606,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2715633529621211,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1474367665687578,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4029062097786967,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.06186073964151243,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19877430420029185,"solar_1":-0.07154664405346915,"solar_2":-0.14466598718094864,"solar_3":-0.2569050183786506,"solar_4":-0.042403355098940665,"solar_5":-0.1508001835415295,"solar_6":-0.007033121844870038,"solar_7":-0.14861682885384653,"solar_8":-0.03403631822341898,"solar_9":-0.024419283162629313,"solar_10":-0.17441890413906927},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Your savings will be easily double compared to a lease or PPA.\n\nHere's how it would work.  Lets say you purchase a 4KW system.  Initial purchase price would probably be somewhere around $18,000 depending on what state you're in. You get a loan for $18,000 and ask bank to let you re-amortize for free one time.  You would get 30% ($5,400) of that back in the form of a tax refund.  You apply that $5,400 to the loan and re-amortize it.  So now you have a loan of $12,600, lets say for 15 years at 6%.  That would be about $106/month.\n\nYou might be saying, well that doesn't save me much right now.  However, that $106/month is fixed for 15 years.  Price of energy will increase every year, so even though you might not be saving much now, your savings will increase a bit every year.  Also, at the end of 15 years, the loan is paid off and then you get all the electricity from the panels at no cost for the remaining life of the system.\n\nOn top of that, when you purchase solar outright, the system adds equity to your house.  Figure you'll get at least half of the purchase price of the solar panels back when you sell your house.  So really you didn't pay $12,600, you only paid $6,300 for the system, which means even though you were paying $106/month, your effective net cost was really only $53/month. The other $53 was essentially a long term investment that will be paid back when you sell your home. \n\nLease/PPA does not add equity to your house, and could end up being a liability.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.3178526407041318,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1559300316512949,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1915149579158195,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14560153376800586,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.346612701607515,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18820749949125926,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22463409088894984,"solar_1":-0.20709099579589052,"solar_2":-0.11032817757265734,"solar_3":-0.06461411212815922,"solar_4":-0.18651310592453665,"solar_5":-0.017789070608462982,"solar_6":-0.007395228087261785,"solar_7":-0.03607156479120022,"solar_8":-0.04775434472112533,"solar_9":-0.01763001731781344,"solar_10":-0.12637775364076648},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Since you are connected to the grid already, you only need batteries in your solar system if you need backup when the grid goes down. Most grid-tied solar systems do not have batteries, they have the solar panels, racking, and a grid-tied inverter connected to their main breaker box. The pros of this setup is 1) simple 2) inexpensive and depending on where you are, can be a quick ROI. 3) you can only make some of your power, and buy the rest from the grid, same as usual, or sell back any extra, creating a credit to use later when needed. The con is 1) when the grid goes down, even during a sunny day, so does your solar system, due to safety rules. \n\nIf you do need battery backup, then you would have a hybrid a.k.a.  grid-tied battery backup solar system. With this, your inverter is connected to both the grid and a battery bank. You would determine what your critical loads are, those that have to be powered when the grid goes out, like a fridge, well pump, furnace fan, etc, and move the circuits to a new critical loads breaker box. You then size the battery bank to power them, not your whole house. Pros: you still don't need to make all of your power, when the grid is up, you still buy and sell as needed Con: more complex and expensive than straight grid-tied. \n\nBoth of those options have  pure sine wave inverter, which is likely cleaner power than what you get from the grid, and therefore will not harm your electronics. Cheaper modified inverters may cause problems with delicate equipment.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0016553859847287338,"1.1.1_stance":-0.21131042861779292,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.19616682886723424,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1828201643600827,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3056527653983452,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.24069555782614754,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.05420481464049468,"solar_1":-0.14940034106383948,"solar_2":-0.11887216280204957,"solar_3":-0.01301034036805504,"solar_4":-0.11882641906049685,"solar_5":-0.013391101740126032,"solar_6":-0.01816542171945912,"solar_7":-0.027550230239285156,"solar_8":-0.012211359890595,"solar_9":-0.016359499499543517,"solar_10":-0.16439246655863787},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

We'll see more utilities banning solar or reducing net metering which will be their undoing as people go off-grid. \n\nPeople like to hate on utility companies but it's rarely the occasion when they actually listen to their complaints.\n\nElectricity in many places of the developed world functions as a regulated monopoly. The infrastructure required to power homes in the first place was expensive, and once it was in place, there'd be little incentive to add a competing transmission line or distribution network. For this same reason, once in place, people could be potentially be overcharged for what became a basic necessity. \n\nWhat ended up happening is that the government made deals with utilities where the utility would be granted an exclusive contract on an area, make an investment on infrastructure, and get a specific return on their investment. They wouldn't be allowed to charge whatever they wanted as the market could allow them to (\"pay me 10x as much or lose power\"), but in exchange they would have a predictable and long term return on their investment.\n\nThen solar comes in and breaks this arrangement. Suddenly utility companies are being forced to pay market prices for power bought from their clients. They don't have the predictable revenue. They invested billions in infrastructure that may not be even needed in the future. They spent years limiting their sales prices to the agreed-upon pricing, but now have no upside.\n\nSolar will probably never be backed by utilities for this reason. It's the technology that allows them to be irrelevant. Any accommodation will probably come from government regulation.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0027191270298014083,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3177713192999363,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.3414279140983472,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.27906672390422865,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.19608669807683196,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.009560137211034695,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04356750457858046,"solar_1":-0.05192801345765474,"solar_2":-0.029123591830284568,"solar_3":-0.24734720559947113,"solar_4":-0.3079095083800591,"solar_5":-0.0012448959081060214,"solar_6":-0.0004801159393537091,"solar_7":-0.0008135454603082811,"solar_8":-0.0013913810001516442,"solar_9":-0.09819293006997516,"solar_10":-0.28384601884317817,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.21636156622334965},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

So how do you solve this problem?  Well, unfortunately you need two things you don't have:\n\n * A energy store, to shove excess energy when sunny, and draw power when dark -- i.e. a battery\n * A [bimodal inverter](http://www.news-archives.solarenergy-usa.com/2011/06/what-is-a-bimodal-system-and-how-does-it-work/).  \n\nSo, your first zombie idea is:\n\n * Let me take my car/flashlight battery and connect that to the inverter\n    * this would work if your car/flashlight battery could be charged with your full solar array without exploding, or get the draw of your entire house without a chemical meltdown\n * The inverter itself must be designed to work with the battery, so it doesn't, for instance, cause it to catch on fire by overcharging it\n * So, in practice, you have to buy a big, expensive battery to manage voltage for a significant part of your house.\n * When you do so, you are disappointed to learn that you can't hook the entire house up to one battery, because if you did, the maximum draw would exceed the battery warranty in some case, the speed of the chemical reaction in worst\n * This means you either have power to only certain sockets in power outage, or you buy multiple large, expensive batteries\n\nOK, now let's pretend you have McGyvered a gigantic zombie battery, why won't your present inverter work?\n\n You'll have to ask someone with more knowledge than I've bothered to learn, but from my hazily remembered college physics and some half-scanned solar posts, here's why I believe a \"normal\" (i.e. cheaper to build) inverter can't be connected to battery: a bimodal (expensive) inverter has the ability to direct voltage from two sinks/sources (grid, battery), and when using battery, to limit the allowed power to what your battery can support (not having this 2nd part right can cause battery fires).\n\nWhat I think normal inverters do is much simpler electronically, but more complicated to explain.  If you think of voltage as something like water pressure, a normal inverter basically uses the grid like a pipe connected to the water system:\n\n * when you magically produce water and push it into your pipe (panels-&gt;voltage), you run water away from your house due only to pressure (voltage), not requiring any smart valve or anything\n * When you open up a tap in house (close electrical circuit), you drain water from the system, again not requiring anything other than giving the water somewhere lower pressure to go\n\nThis only works because the grid is so much bigger than you, that you really can't effect its voltage (pressure) with your puny demand, much like you can't normally keep the whole block from getting water just because you blow one pipe.  So, the grid is functionally equivalent to an infinite capacity battery, that can charge or discharge as fast as any normal-sized system can produce or consume, and the normal inverter expects this, and has no way to restrict flow in either direction.\n\nSo, to use your zombie battery with your normal inverter, you need to make a battery than can store all the energy you can produce or consume infinitely fast, which physics does not allow.\n\n*(yes, this pissed me off too)*","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0013170456901813548,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2148808570240367,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.26195463856639534,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1942022442817688,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4176042398842128,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21154884059416332,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07825527461682213,"solar_1":-0.26661746923658713,"solar_2":-0.1836167076927367,"solar_3":-0.22732094160396904,"solar_4":-0.18942092902431734,"solar_5":-0.11176044485822978,"solar_6":-0.05671513437067441,"solar_7":-0.3362170259060804,"solar_8":-0.02565214909412662,"solar_9":-0.18058154115126207,"solar_10":-0.2735333697077809},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed.

The new particle receiver technology which uses sand to store heat instead of oils is going to kick ass on batteries or pumped hydro as stand-by and on-demand load for an otherwise PV and wind based global energy  system. \n\n\nhttps://www.solarpaces.org/particle-receiver-first-commercial-trial-2018/\n\nFor people off the grid though, DIY solar thermal is . . . well I won't go on and on about what I think about steam but I want to share a little more info with you since you say you're Australian and I want to give credit where credit is due. I learned about some of my first farm-scale solar thermal systems from Australia where a lot of great research has been done. \n\nI don't know if you're familiar with ORC technology but the gist of it is to use an alternative to steam in a turbine such as volatile organic solvents like pentane or other liquids with lower boiling points than water. Much progress was made with that in Australia and they tried to sell it in the States but nobody would buy. \n\nThen, a breakthrough happened about ten years ago. An Australian group who had done vacuum tube solar collector arrays with organic rankine cycle and also big steam got funding from Silicon Valley venture capital. They were called Terrajoule and they had some great ideas and their system worked as promised. \n\nThey not only custom manufactured 60HP brand spanking new made in USA steam engines but also dropped the big tip on the solar community that people like me hadn't known until then. They explained about the use of something called a \"steam accumulators\" which they didn't invent but simply borrowed from good ol' steam technology that already existed. I later learned that this was an idea as old as the steam engine itself but I simply hadn't known about it. \n\nThese guys were smooth though and their big advance in this area was to point out that commercial propane tanks could be re-fitted as steam accumulators. With that they had 24/7 60HP in a location like the California Central Valley. They were selling it to farmers with deep water wells running diesel generators at five bucks a gallon. \n\nOkay, great story --so what happened to these guys? Well, the price of oil came back down. The price of oil used to be super high in California especially and although Terrajoule needed almost a million dollars to install one of their systems when all was totaled there were buyers at one time who felt it still made sense because the sun would continue shining indefinitely so the up-front costs weren't so bad but such investors dried up and the company was sold off to become a subsidiary of Air Liquide.\n\nSo the point of that long story is just to say that there is some very low hanging fruit out there and others have shown the way that this can be done practically. They spent too much money but it doesn't have to be that way. \n\nI ask you and I ask the guys I buy those tubes from in China why there are no decently priced 60HP steam engines coming out of China or India? That's what I'm looking out for. I actually started making my own out of a diesel truck cylinder out of frustration. \n\nKeep your eye on \"slewing gear\" at Alibaba. They're the big gears used in excavators and they are also quite useful for controlling large solar arrays. I suspect there will be turn-key kits coming out eventually with motors, controllers, sensors, mirrors etc. I have seen some on Alibaba already but the details weren't clear to me. \n\nAnother tip on big gears for controlling an array of mirrors is to use fabric, some wire and resin and build up layers that you then bake together to make a massive and tough giant gear. \n\nI'd emphasize this point once again though that the lack of cheap steam engines is really quite shocking if energy is indeed such an important topic. I mean clearly we can directly make steam from the sun and we can even store steam too using off-the-shelf steel tanks so now if we had a way to conveniently turn it to mechanical energy or electricity that would be real nice for those people who do have a few acres of land on which to operate a small generation facility and indeed maybe even sell a bit to the neighbors or have enough extra to build a rental and offer free utilities or something of that nature.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0012025642063235864,"1.1.1_stance":-0.24053672088862316,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20558805763721466,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2707766695608002,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3603260574607356,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19996467793342163,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.13807934970797456,"solar_1":-0.06541627180656308,"solar_2":-0.21338517239306318,"solar_3":-0.10763405205154015,"solar_4":-0.06429558973953438,"solar_5":-0.12088286665675696,"solar_6":-0.0059116821151595405,"solar_7":-0.014928145397182865,"solar_8":-0.026095611166965682,"solar_9":-0.031480868216071656,"solar_10":-0.14768897078198887},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

After the credit, my net cost for the system is $27,972.\n\nIt will offset $200 worth of my power bill monthly, or $2,400 per year.  Just on that math alone, in a worst case scenario I am breakeven at 11.6 years.  However power doesn’t tend to stay the same cost, in fact they are currently talking about raising rates 3% per year for the next decade.  So that $200 bill it will offset would be a $269 bill 10 years from now or $3,228 annually while my power rates are locked in and on my roof.  So my breakeven point at that math will be between 8.6 yrs and 11.6 years.  Let’s say they have paid for themselves at year 10 then.  They are fully warrantied for 25 and it’s not like they stop producing power on that 25th year, that’s simply the warranty period.  My power bill on that 25th year with 3% rate increases would have been $419 monthly.  The solar panels would have been generating me free cash flow for 15 years at that point, over 50k on the low end.  \n\nNow, personally I built some energy efficiency upgrades into my overall plan.  If I can take 15% off of my average usage then I built my system’s size to offset about 10,000 miles of range on an Electric Vehicle annually as well.  Not paying for gasoline brings my breakeven point significantly closer and generates more cash flow in savings once they have paid themselves off.\n\nWith SREC’s coming to Virginia soon as well, that could play another role in pulling back that breakeven point.  \n\nHope that helped!","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0016371451226101879,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23859140222926953,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24140269874769352,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.26571493405572083,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2612212986792396,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20859681593598603,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07185519711735348,"solar_1":-0.15733431408109663,"solar_2":-0.18900846909214686,"solar_3":-0.19532229496871878,"solar_4":-0.09418361281657212,"solar_5":-0.13487019056871455,"solar_6":-0.18182583625214951,"solar_7":-0.16080832420266233,"solar_8":-0.0988536027097338,"solar_9":-0.20586246820026552,"solar_10":-0.20292486077634286},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.

Nearly all local bids are nearly 2X the cost of Tesla solar panels.\n 3. I’ve never had issues my Tesla M3. Perhaps that’s different.\n\nBy no means is Tesla perfect. No company is. And I have to believe, as we saw with other Tesla products, things get ironed out as processes are refined etc. There’s always early adopter costs. But for 2X cheaper, that’s a steep difference to justify. I can’t seem to see 2X better equipment or warranty. Convince me otherwise.\n\nIt’s not about talking down anyone.

That is fair to everyone, still results in a positive ROI for rooftop solar, and still provides an incentive to install storage later when battery prices fall.\n\nRooftop solar may not achieve ideal production numbers, but rooftops are otherwise wasted space that can and should be utilized for something productive.  The same goes for parking lots.  Utility scale solar will be needed too, but that should not exclude distributed generation.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0013702553308879335,"1.1.1_stance":-0.1780868075391867,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2128126210970945,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14653443607191244,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.157965455818529,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.22942436989159054,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.34184872717984643,"solar_1":-0.19946840107774022,"solar_2":-0.2000919846551355,"solar_3":-0.006241972792849992,"solar_4":-0.1309527947450988,"solar_5":-0.004322995664551854,"solar_6":-0.0008112741318958191,"solar_7":-0.001713879668386653,"solar_8":-0.01581632429709619,"solar_9":-0.05696196598884029,"solar_10":-0.020619696357850142},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options.

Your insult response to my original comment was... what... projection? Self-hatred?

Not to mention the incredible timelines he's promised time and again for things like FSD, robotaxis, Tesla Semi, Roadster, and Solar Roof.\n\nI always love watching those unveilings when Musk announces the 'incredible', 'class leading', 'competition destroying' price and specs on stage and the entire crowd screams and cheers him on, and EV media goes crazy insisting that no one can touch this company's prices and value!  And then later we find out it was BS...\n\nRivian, as I've said, copies Tesla a lot.  Doing it before IPO is for the same reason Tesla does it.  They announce low prices to spike share price, whether it's the publicly traded stock or the IPO price.  Either way, the company can use inflated share price to sell shares and generate cash.  As Tesla did in 2020 when they raised $20 billion in cash by selling new shares.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00018290296308502244,"1.1.1_stance":-0.36431742345798956,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22675375585689303,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.14176069417347512,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20292261202333406,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.058802589386080704,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1242753379823019,"solar_1":-0.10039310389644622,"solar_2":-0.09058956140749312,"solar_3":-0.07135787896918878,"solar_4":-0.019644055491880863,"solar_5":-0.005678804382720652,"solar_6":-0.007541549288968478,"solar_7":-0.02730232114845421,"solar_8":-0.003724335028891801,"solar_9":-0.10775276825006586,"solar_10":-0.2111053455810179},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed (The author's stance toward solar is not explicitly stated in the text.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

You cannot reduce the Sunrun bill, it's effectively a fixed cost (depends on if it's a fixed lease, fixed ppa, or variable ppa).\n\nThe solar in a likelihood is saving you overall on electricty costs (maybe ~25% but really depends on factors) but if your expectation is \"I have solar shouldn't electricity/utiliy be near zero\", that's only if your solar production nearly matches your use over the year.

The Sunrun Lease or PPA is a set amount you're paying which typically less than if you didn't have solar.  Like if the utility charges $0.20/kWh, the energy from Sunrun is at Like $0.15/kWh.

It isn't all about the economics.  I understand a large percentage of people who install solar have this laser focus on trying to save money and ignore every other part of the decision, but it isn't all of us.\n\n> Rooftop solar panels will pay for themselves in 7-10 years\n\nI think that is wildly optimistic.  I would love to see the statistics on repairs and associated repair costs over that 7 - 10 year time.  Sure, if there are absolutely zero roof repairs (requiring extra work to remove the panels then replace them afterwards), and zero solar panel issues, and zero micro-inverter failures, and no circuit board failures in the internet gateways, **MAYBE** it breaks even in 7 - 10 years.  But a couple of repairs and that 7 - 10 years stretches out.\n\nFinally (and this is the killer), most people don't realize if they took that same identical money and invested in an indexed mutual fund like VTSAX it would return 10% a year in the same 7 - 10 years.  Instead of buying $20,000 worth of solar panels, invest the money and it will be $40,000 in 7 years.  So the solar panels ACTUALLY cost $40,000 ($20,000 up front plus $20,000 in opportunity cost).  I used the interest calculator on this page: https://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/compound-interest-calculator  That makes the payback period more like 14 - 20 years.  And at that point you would want to install an all new system anyway.\n\nSolar panels don't make any economic sense for most individuals (like you mention, they do make sense for the industrial power companies).  Yet, knowing this, I installed solar (and batteries).  I've lived in three different states, and the power grid has failed me all the time in all three states.  The cheaper way to go is a natural gas generator, but it's stinky and uses fossil fuels, and then I have to worry about it possibly not starting up after a year of not being used.  If I use the solar panels and batteries **EVERY DAY** then they will most likely work just fine during a 4 day power outage.\n\nAlong the way, because of the economic savings (however large or small) the whole backup power system doesn't cost as much as the list price of the panels and batteries.  Heck, I'd be THRILLED if they all broke even financially in 10 years, because that means I installed an entire backup power system **FOR FREE**.  But I'm perfectly happy with it only costing me net $5,000 over 10 years also.  That comes to $1.37 per day (net) for a backup power system, which is the main goal of installing solar and batteries for me.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.1885169355714015,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25669305715211416,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.16899106121802782,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3200488439998789,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.31115527001366383,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2070705825559333,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22360472777614301,"solar_1":-0.18724593405390255,"solar_2":-0.1311220699007844,"solar_3":-0.28314778427772386,"solar_4":-0.23169301611152526,"solar_5":-0.04801198596639248,"solar_6":-0.15156520074576033,"solar_7":-0.10807694680988789,"solar_8":-0.032846716099321945,"solar_9":-0.04768997703715172,"solar_10":-0.25333404688637223},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

We use it every day in some way. You haven't killed anyone today, or stolen something, or kicked an animal for no reason, have you? You have the opportunity to any of those things on any given day, yet most of us find all of those actions quite unpalatable and would probably agree doing any of those things is unethical. We made up what is or isn't ethical, but we have good reasons for deciding where that line is. One might say we've used logic to arrive there.\n\nIn this world, we can affect other living animals -- people and other animals. Animals have a lot of the same basic abilities or senses as people -- they have pain receptors, they can feel a number of emotions, and they have a drive to stay alive. What differs from other animals and humans is that in general their cerebral cortexes are not nearly as developed as ours. The cerebral cortex has a number of functions in humans, and is largely what is responsible for all the extra thinking that we can do that animals can't -- why we can have ethics, think logically, think about \"others\" and \"self\", etc. The cerebral cortex also gives us conscious control over ourselves, including our emotions so that say, if we feel angry, we can think about this anger and then decide how to actually feel and act. Animals don't have this ability for the most part, and so arguably feel emotions much more intensely than we do.\n\nThis is one reason why it seems so cruel to use them and mistreat them. Keeping cows locked up in concrete and cramped finishing lots, pigs who are confined to cages only big enough for them to stand or lie down and not turn around have to deal with all the frustration and anxiety they feel from being there every day. Then, many of them have their babies taken away from them, which they do feel a loss for. Animals produce oxytocin the same as humans when giving birth, and they bond with their young. It is heartbreaking for them to be separated from their babies, and vice versa for the babies from the mothers.\n\nAnimals also are fearful before death. When cows or pigs are crammed together and a guy starts shooting them in the head with pneumatic guns, the ones who haven't been shot yet can see what is happening, and they feel that fear. Maybe they don't know they're about to die, but they're freaked out about what's happening. If they're lucky, they get hung on the hooks upside down and have their throats cut when they're knocked out, but we know this doesn't happen for all of them, and so some of them hang there and bleed to death while still alive, and that is a horrible way to die, and they do feel it.\n\nNow, of course, that is all how factory farms work, and perhaps you already agree that all those things are egregious. Perhaps on your farm you make sure every animal is unconscious before it is killed and it lives a very stress-free and good life up to that point. The rest of the vegan argument against raising and killing animals is more philosophical than it is about animal welfare.\n\nWe just believe that, if given the choice between having its life ended prematurely or living to old age, animals would choose the latter, much like humans. Alive things generally don’t wish to die if they’re otherwise in good health. We believe that, like people, animals should be free to live their lives and generally be autonomous so long as it doesn't endanger others (same applies to humans). We find it hypocritical to keep dogs or cats for enjoyment and that it is generally thought of to be unthinkable to kill and eat one while simultaneously being perfectly fine with killing and eating other animals, many of them mammals with just as much neurologic sophistication as dogs and cats.\n\nYou said\n&gt;That humans think they are somehow endowed with some special consciousness that lifts us above bacteria, invertebrates, plants, and animals is poor logic.\n\nBut humans *are* special for the reasons I listed above -- that we have neurology other animals don't, and this gives us the ability to think and reason. Citing how anything happens in nature is what is poor logic. We are animals, yes, so we are not separate from nature in that way. But we haven't done everything \"natural\" for at least 10,000 years (when we started farming) and probably for even longer (I have no idea when we started making tools and talking, but it was much longer than 10,000 years ago).\n\nWhat vegans are saying is that we can think and reason, and animals can't. Animals kill each other, yes, but humans don't have to. We can make a decision about every aspect of our lives, so let's try to make good decisions. Regarding what to eat -- does it seem like a good or right thing to do to kill an animal who undoubtedly would have liked to live, and possibly suffered at least some fear and anxiety right before it died (if it's lucky) just to eat?\n\nThe answer to that depends on your deeper philosophy.\nDo you value non-human life? Under what circumstances? Is all non-human life equivalent? If not, how do you order things? Why do you order it that way? Does non-human life have any right to its own life? If not -- why?\n\nDo we need to eat animals in today's world? The fact that all of us vegans exist would seem to indicate the answer to this one.\n\nAre there bigger reasons beyond your own taste preferences for eating meat or not? Does eating meat versus not eating meat affect the environment, and if so, how? Is eating meat a good use of resources, and does this matter to you? (Generally, eating higher up on a food chain means more energy is wasted. Farm animals who aren’t solely pastured eat grains that humans could have eaten. They eat more calories in grains than they produce. Thus, it is a waste of food energy to make meat in the first place. Same with water.)\n\nI think you know the vegans answer to these questions, but if not, I’d be happy to enlighten you. These questions were somewhat rhetorical, but perhaps it would be a good exercise for you to answer them to see where you stand. Vegans generally think that animals do have a right to their own lives, and therefore it is unethical to kill them. Again, we generally don’t kill and eat dogs, and this seems very arbitrary – logically inconsistent. Most people know pigs are just as smart as dogs. But we don’t believe an animal’s intelligence has anything to do with their right to life. Just as another human’s life, or if you like a dog’s or cat’s life, is not ours to take, neither is it ours to take a cow’s, pig’s, chicken’s, etc’s life.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.15429887538686224,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3622500844752821,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.32101218170697043,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.242582991146147,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.21160567963565718,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2560100396552667,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.02059113733897296,"diet_1":-0.06329202784081644,"diet_2":-0.24498095500601474,"diet_3":-0.12607713351630992,"diet_4":-0.05702759529801256,"diet_5":-0.05386079123886765,"diet_6":-0.04351655415392764,"diet_8":-0.1669497478739478,"diet_9":-0.20035849356228616,"diet_10":-0.041778572725229425,"diet_11":-0.2534906434163953,"diet_13":-0.09937313508164274,"diet_14":-0.2266008281555014,"diet_17":-0.08614386857108002},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"yes.

Any doctor trying to disrupt a patient’s diet is not a good doctor.\n\nI’m in med school in India, where vegetarianism is pretty common, and although vegetarians here  are more likely than meat-eaters to have some deficiencies, the number one thing we are taught is to ask the patient what their normal diet is and if they have any religious or other beliefs that restrict the intake of certain foods. We are taught to recommend diets based only on what the patient is willing to consume- telling a vegetarian patient to eat meat is the best way to make sure they will not adhere to your diet plan, and end up even sicker than before.\n\nDoctors should be trying to recommend diets which cause the least amount of change in your existing food habits, and require the least amount of effort to accommodate into your lifestyle. Only then will a patient actually stick to the diet and end up with good results. That’s literally rule number 1. \n\nOnly if this fails, we are taught to move on to other options or simply prescribe supplements if the patient is unable to or unwilling to make those changes. \n\nIt’s surprising to me that doctors in developed countries with better medical education systems aren’t taught this very basic thing. Poor patient adherence is the number one cause of treatment failure and diet failure, and doctors should be trying to prevent that at all costs.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2715608916254202,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2767647689953473,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18542900952437386,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2858121105406344,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.229034187153741,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.25205229925998024,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21869451529346406,"diet_1":-0.28565124867537994,"diet_2":-0.0020240088379068766,"diet_3":-0.04113162780292138,"diet_4":-0.08570616363431327,"diet_5":-0.040657487743980404,"diet_6":-0.12373402692295106,"diet_8":-0.007886739967943868,"diet_9":-0.004770887030948264,"diet_10":-0.09082320932026278,"diet_11":-0.0060870713678014,"diet_13":-0.025333410822592366,"diet_14":-0.24491681659433956,"diet_17":-0.035530605169090755},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Elevated levels of greenhouse gases lead to conditions such as COPD, asthma, pneumonia. Because it requires such a large amount of land to graze these animals (more than a third of US land is used for animal pastures) it leads to deforestation in rainforests as well as having both a positive and negative effect on the quality of soil in the places where livestock are raised. Around 30% of forests around the world have been completely cleared for agriculture usage, and another 20% near total degradation, and this number increases as the demand for meat and animal agriculture products increases. The water needed to raise these livestock is just not sustainable in the long term, meaning the destruction of fresh water sources, as well as the depletion of fish species, bringing the ecosystems that surround these places closer to extinction. Countries also see the actual quality of their water decrease as they dispose of animal product wastage. There are many other negatives that come from the factory farming of meat that a switch to plant based diets could solve, such as antibiotic resistence, but that's not the point. The point is that there needs to be a government mandated switch to plant based diets. You're never going to convince someone to switch from meat to plants because it is simply a personal pleasure the majority of us are unwilling to give up, and it's not possible for one person going vegan to make much of a difference. \n\nUnfortunately, because meat is too tasty and too much of a sticking point for many people, the only way we can rectify some of the damage meat based agriculture does to the planet is to at least mitigate it somewhat with mandates and education. If you need meat to survive, then fine, but the majority of people don't and can be just as healthy and natural on a plant based diet.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20290492847556152,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11340600395285444,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18416596281691042,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19171687334536722,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17731379989609194,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13204490200574068,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.005078246952810635,"diet_1":-0.14896954951108135,"diet_2":-0.17825016203481137,"diet_3":-0.21991117586527797,"diet_4":-0.15932009364284264,"diet_5":-0.1932234726206684,"diet_6":-0.07091073036979036,"diet_8":-0.01910674315513461,"diet_9":-0.0719302230863832,"diet_10":-0.1701420738706171,"diet_11":-0.13350371283255905,"diet_13":-0.13316022164032404,"diet_14":-0.17622479216735243,"diet_17":-0.00906173310795566,"1.1.1_stance_lack_recheck":-0.01991365457553229},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"against (government mandated switch to plant-based diets)","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

But yeah, some amputees probably feel excluded and marginalized in plenty of other ways too. \n\nSure. But excluding amputees doesn't imply any sort of \"amputee shaming\" or amputee hate. Being an amputee isn't a good thing though: very few people would willingly become an amputee if they had a choice. It's not considered aesthetic by most either. \n\nUnless an advertising campaign was specifically targeted toward amputees, there wouldn't be a benefit to displaying them.\n\nIn this case, it would be kind of like an organization dedicated to preventing workplace injury putting out a pamphlet on how to avoid injury featuring a bunch of smiling quadriplegics (who didn't lose their limbs in a workplace accident, of course): it just would have a counterproductive effect. Likewise featuring obese vegans in vegan propaganda.\n\n&gt; Diversity is awesome. I'd love to see vegan propaganda with people in wheelchairs, people with all sorts of ethnic backgrounds, various genders, body types, the whole deal.\n\nMaybe I'm weird, but I really don't give a damn if I see someone like me in advertising. If I see someone in advertising that accentuates traits that I consider negative, that's also going to make me perceive the advertising more negatively. If I was fat, I wouldn't really be happy about it: it wouldn't somehow make me see fat people in advertising as appealing and \"like me\".\n\n&gt; If we're following a lifestyle that's about compassion, why not take extra steps to be inclusive and welcoming? \n\nBy all means.
