"comment": "so readign this, they're leaving out something important:\n  - how the power gets to the wheels.\n\nIf you look at the figure for \"electricity\" in the LHV study, you'll note it says 33.7KWh of electricity is equivalent to 1 gallon of gasoline.   Thats probably true int he chemical sense.  Ie. ifyou burn gasoline in a calorimiter (where all of the energy is captured) you the equivalent of that amount of electricity.\n\nHowever, my Rav4EV only has a 42KWH effective battery.  Which means i have the equivalent of 1 1/3rd gallons of gasoline in it.   But the car goes 120 miles on that much power.  This is because the energy conversion is very efficient from the battery to propulsion in an electric vehicle.\n\nHow efficient the hydrogen car is is more related to how efficiently you can *burn* hydrogen and produce propulsion.  The hydrogen cars i've seen talked about are essentially electric cars that use they fuel cell to burn hydrogen and produce electricity (rather than a battery).\n\nThe Toyota replacement for my vehicle (the FCHV tested [here]([]\\(http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/toyota_fchv-adv_range_verification.pdf\\)) which looks pretty much the same) got 68 miles/kg of hydrogen in the study (its an electric drive car with 90KW output fuel cell).  Substantially less fun to drive i'd bet (the Rav4EV is 115Kw and its pretty fast for a Rav4).   so \"my vehicle's\" range woudl be about met by about 1.5kg of hydrogen (100-120 miles).   Meaning 1.5kg roughly equal to 40KW in an \"electric\" car (some electric cars are \"better\" due to better aerodynamics, but the Toyota Hydrogen car and my car look roughly to be the same chassis and shape. (this is the FCHV car not the production car).\n\nTo simply the relationship, it depends on how you produce 40ish KWH of electricity vs. how you produce 1.5ish kg of hydrogen.  Answers to that can vary widely (carbon intensity of electricity varies quite a bit all by itself depending on where you are).",

"comment": "&gt; So it's more a long the lines of 38% efficiency if we're comparing the two technologies directly\n\n38% is about the *theoretical limit* of [ICE efficiency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine#Energy_efficiency). Most engines get less than 20% in practice.\n\nIf you want to compare efficiency, look at it this way: 100 kwh of NG or coal in a 40% efficient power plant will yield 40 kwh. Transmitting that to your home at 93% efficiency will leave you with 37.2 kwh. In a Nissan Leaf (3.33 miles/kwh) that'll take you 124 miles.\n\n100 kwh of oil will give you about 80 kwh, or 2.35 gallons, of gasoline. That'll take a 25 mpg car 59 miles. So you can see that an EV like the Nissan leaf is at least twice as efficient as a gasoline-powered car, \"wells-to-wheels\". Nevermind that coming up with 100 kwh of oil is a lot harder than getting 100 kwh of NG or coal, and increasingly so. And also nevermind that only 70% of electricity comes from fossil fuels.\n\n&gt;If it uses Cadmium which a lot of batteries do, it becomes toxic\n\nNo EV battery uses Cadmium.\n\n&gt;Battery professor Poul Norby states that lithium batteries will need to double their energy density and bring down the price from $500 (2010) to $100 per kWh capacity in order to make an impact on petrol cars.[19]\n\nTesla's cost per kwh [is likely already $100 or less](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084682_what-goes-into-a-tesla-model-s-battery--and-what-it-may-cost). Why do you have numeric footnotes (\"[19]\") that don't link to anything?\n\n&gt;An electric car at 8-10 years being sold will face the skeptical view of buyers that they will get stuck with a major 10,000 dollar replacement\n\nBut you just said in your previous paragraph that in 10 years battery price should come down to 1/3 of present...\n\n&gt;I've had my car for 10 years and I have not even come to half that cost in mechanical repairs for my combustion engine (and $1000 for maintenance)\n\nAnd how much have you paid for gas over those 10 years?",

Well, it will pull my boat trailer, the utility trailer that I use for my lawn tractor, my scooter, my motorcycle, etc.  \n\nYou might be surprised at how peppy the Leaf is from a standing start at a red light.  Unless you are actually trying to race me (illegal street racing is illegal) and have a fairly aggressive sports car, you're not jumping in front of me from a red light.  The Leaf won't beat you in a long acceleration, but in the first 500 feet, it's got plenty of torque.\n\n&gt;You sound like the type of people that say we all need bikes.\n\nNo.  We don't all need bikes.  Of course, I've ridden everything from a C70 to a 1300 over the last several decades, and I think that a serious motorcycle is more fun than....  wait, that is what you were talking about, right?  Have you looked at the [Mission RS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1CSdYsJIWQ)?  Or the [Zero Motorcycles Zero SR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCYPdeoBPz8).  These are not tame little mopeds.\n\n&gt;When you mash on a Mercedes it sounds like this ( ohh my ears are cumming )\n\nOh, I get it, you gauge the worth of a car by what it sounds like.  Okay.  In that respect, yes, electric vehicles are not noisy.  You win.\n\nI'll just leave you with [this thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWQ-dnpplaA)",

Driving just a bit faster you will really burn trough that battery very fast. And even then 30min is still more than 5.\n\nAlso batteries with long range are pretty heavy which isn't that great at all and does not seem like it will change that much.\n\nI'd also question if we are anywhere near cars around 20k who will be able to drive longer distances.",

"comment": "sure Tesla CAN make a grid tie inverter.   But there is little cynergy in a motor controller with highly variable frequency optimized on motor effeciency and a grid tie inverter with fixed input voltage, and tons of safety and regulations.   The teams working on the two (motor controller and grid tie inverter) will have vastly different goals, constraints, and regulations.\n\nThe DC/DC converters?  are you talking about the distributed MPPT optimizers with SafeDC and many other trademark/patents from SolarEdge.   \n\nLowering the profile of the PV modules reduces cooling which reduces production.  Irregular shaped panels, has been tried and failed.   Module to module wiring through the side is done by some as well and also a boondoggle.  They might come out with something great, but unlikely to happen any time soon and without lots of patent license, and fees. \n\nNot sure why having another inverter in the powerwall helps with anything other than adding cost.",

If you take away the tax credit and also pay solar owners wholesale rate instead of retail rate for electricity they feed in to the grid, then solar never pays for itself in most areas of the US.  You might get a 20 year payback in some places like CA and HI where grid electricity is extremely expensive.",

I found a free slow charger at a county office and charged for an hour, getting only about 40 miles, but it was enough to get me home (with careful driving).\n\nSo yes there are still problems, but nothing insurmountable.\n\nI recommend registering on EVgo before you drive on a long trip and they will send you one of their cards.",

"comment": "You could certainly increase the Tesla's range beyond 250 miles with a small engine to recharge the batteries. But as you say, it wouldn't be super efficient. Let's say burning 5 gallons in your hypothetical Tesla would gain you another 175 miles of battery range. Whereas something like a Prius would go &gt;250 miles on that same 5 gallons.\n\nDepending how much range you need for local driving there may soon be affordable EVs on the used market that would work. For instance there are expected to be be many more low mileage Chevy Bolts coming off lease starting this year, pushing prices down. A Bolt with DCFC can manage longer trips almost as well as a Tesla, especially as more Electrify America stations come online.",

"comment": "They \"have to\" adjust? Why? I thought Model3 demand was high? At the beginning of the month Elon said they were likely to post a Q1 profit. Now he's saying it'll be a Q1 loss. What happened? Did demand really fall that much? Has Tesla reached saturation for a ~$45K Model3 after moving &lt;150K units? What does that say about wanting to produce 500K units a year?\n\nDo you see any other manufacturer lowering prices on hot ticket cars?\n\nIf they're making a *net* profit on the SR how did they manage to turn a profit into a loss? Which of their vehicles are they selling at a *net* loss that's dragging them down so badly if their highest volume vehicle has such generous *net* margins that they can ship a few less cells, trade in seat material and turn off software features and still make a _net_ profit on effectively the same hardware?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm not all that interested in Tesla vehicles personally. But I'm not all that interested in Fiats, Fords, BMWs, Hondas or Toyotas either so they're in fine company. Doesn't make me a Toyota \"Bear\". I have no interest in seeing Tesla crash. It might actually be nice to see them make a car that _did_ interest me. It wouldn't take a whole lot really. I was excited for the Model3 before the reveal. Stop forcing glass roofs on everything and overhaul the kit-car level interior with Recaro boy-racer seats. Oh, and a move to CCS would be welcome.\n\nBut this isn't about any of that. This is just that none of this makes sense to me. Because, and this could totally be that I'm just unimaginative, but I can't think of a single other business that _lowers_ prices across every product they offer when they're supply constrained. This seems really unique. _Especially_ in the automotive industry.",

They've been saying that will happen in 2025. Which, last I checked, is still more than 4 years away.\n\n&gt; As for trucks ... they are all going to be like $75K or more. \n\nYet more bullshit. Not even the *highest* trim Cybertruck is over $75k (unless you include FSD). And the lowest is only *$40k*.\n\n&gt; Not everyone is entitled to them in the first place \n\nYes they are. At least, when it comes to the Federal Tax Credit in the US, *everyone* is entitled to that credit if they buy a BEV (or most PHEVs) from any manufacturer who hasn't used up their aloitted credits (Tesla and GM are the only ones who have). There are some *rebates* that have income-based eligibility, but if you make enough money to hit that bracket in, for example California, you don't really need that $2500 anyway. And you can give up HOV lane access to ignore that income-based limit if you want to.\n\n&gt; It's not even a rebate check sent to you that you could decide whether or not to pay it towards the car note or your taxes. \n\nUhhhh, yes it is? What the fuck are you talking about? I got my $7500 credit on my 2018 taxes, and I did exactly that: I put it toward the principal on my car loan, reducing the payback period by over a year.\n\n&gt; The only time the tax credits really help the purchaser in my opinion is once they hit the used market. \n\nYou are delusional. The federal tax credit doesn't apply to used sales! Where the hell did you come up with this garbage?\n\n&gt; I doubt you will ever see an EV four wheel drive for that kind of money. \n\nYup, confirmed as uninformed dumbass. You shouldn't spout bullshit when you don't know anything about what you're saying.",

TLDR: it depends very heavily on the car/manufacturer and ambient temperature.\n\nSome manufacturers (Tesla) tend to publish overly optimistic range estimates. Others (Porsche) seem to understate range. They’re all using acceptable standards, but the accuracy of the standards vary. \n\nMy own experience- my Tesla 3P has a stated range of 300 miles. Real world I would get maybe 250 miles in summer and 200 miles in winter, *if I drove starting at 100% and ran it down to 0%*. But you don’t drive like that. The day to day usable range of the car is more like 150-200 miles, which is adequate but people shouldn’t buy one expecting to drive 250 miles at a time on a road trip. That would be stressful on the battery and yourself to constantly charge to 100% and run down near 0%. IRL you will briefly stop at a supercharger every 150 miles or so.",

"comment": "Depends on your state sales tax. Certainly in California you pay sales tax on the 40k vs $32K, so that's another $7-800 depending on where in the state. Plus I'll bet you can find a meaningful amount off MSRP on a Bolt. So far that's not happening on the ID.4.\n\nAt the end of the day I'd not be surprised if the ID.4 isn't a couple of thousand, maybe three more than the VW.\n\nAnd free fuel isn't necessarily that sweet a deal for routine charging. You've got to be prepared to spend a lot of time at the nearest EA stop. I got free fuel on my first i3. Found it wasn't worth the pain unless I was going somewhere specific and there was an EVgo charger. Whole Foods was a regular for that, but at the time the charging stations were often stacked up.",

"comment": "&gt; Tesla's have suspension that is commonly considered subpar, which I suspect is the cause.  \n\nTeslas (no apostrophe s) have a suspension that is more tuned for performance/high end driving dynamics (as opposed to the softer/comfort suspension found in many commuter/family-type vehicles), which means they have a firmer ride. People who enjoy driving generally prefer this type of suspension (similar to BMWs, etc.). The suspension is not \"subpar\", but it's up to a prospective buyer as to what type of suspension they prefer.   \n\n99% of the cause of EV passenger motion sickness is the driver not being good at modulating the instant torque, and moving seamlessly between accelerating and regen braking. In a Tesla, the recommendation would be to turn on chill mode to temper acceleration. In any case, just taking your foot off the accelerator and letting regen kick in will be jarring to most people. You really need to learn to ease into the regen.",

Run it to almost 0 then plug into a level 2 charger that will show you energy use, and see how many kWh it takes to go to full. You likely have the 23 kWh battery if your expected range is 76 miles. I don't know what Ford has for a buffer, but if it takes more than ~17-18 kWh the battery is fine, and you need to look at your driving style. Ford's threshold for warrantying the battery is 70% of original capacity, so if it's 16.1 kWh or less, you have a warranty claim on your hands.",

"comment": "Right. So what solar installers are doing is they are partnering with roofer and then inflating the cost of the solar so benefits the homeowners tax credit. Does that make sense?\n\nEasy math: homeowners is getting solar for 20k but need a new roof 10k. On paper they are making the solar system cost $30k but under the table 10k is going to the roofer.  So now homeowners get 30% back on their 30k cost.\n\nLots of solar reps do this with their commission money as well. (Inflate cost of solar to make it look like they are getting a huge commission but instead that commission money goes towards new system or roof etc to benefit homeowners tax return.",

Higher output equipment and need to be synced to the grid. \n\nV2L/G/H uses the cars onboard charger essentially in reverse (remember the drama a few years ago when someone said if there wasn't a particular component Tesla's would be able to do V2G) and usually has an output similar to its charging rate. So you plug your car into the house, usually with a supported EVSE and it can tell the car to output power. There are also mobile versions that give you a standard 110/240v outlet like the link above. What I want is a double ended type 1/2 cable that will allow one end to activate V2L and the other to plug into the car that needs charging. Essentially the link above but should be able to be faster and a little less clunky. Modern day gas can/jumper cables.",

It's not clear they're able to produce it gross-profitably anywhere near where they originally claimed. \n\nDojo, now in it's third-ish supposed year of production and years late, still underperforms competitors and has failed to be productized. By every indication, Tesla still primarily relies on chips from NVDA internally. \n\nThe 4680 cell, Tesla's long supposed secret weapon, was promised to be producing 100GWh in 2022 at prices below competitors'. Tesla now outsources batteries from BYD instead at Berlin. In China, it has doubled down on CATL. The 'dry' electrode, 'pure' nickel cathode, and 'raw' silicon anode approaches were flops and are now years behind schedule. Prismatic LMFP is now practically guaranteed to be the future dominant format, not cylindrical NMC. \n\nIt simply is not true the man has any sort of sterling record of banger after banger. He fails.

Check whether your town home complex has special restrictions about modifying the exterior.  Condos and Home Owner Associations often do. \n\n2. There are many solar installations in similar and/or more challenging climates:  Most of Germany is more northern than you, likewise much of Wisconsin.  Key is to learn how many \"sun-hours\" there are for your location.  In the US, PV-Watts can furnish this parameter simply by knowing the US postal zip code.  \n\n3. No.  But snow doesn't stay long on PV modules if they are positioned above 40 degrees from the horizontal in most climates.  \n\n4. No.  Rain and snow do a good job of cleaning mine - but they are at 43 degrees.  \n\n5. Your house is big enough, but chances are budget will control how big of an array you get.  Depending on how much juice you use, if you build out to the physical limits of what your house can fit, you may still not furnish all the juice you use.  Therefore, you're seeking a grid-tied system, not a stand alone.  Stand alone systems require way more money and maintenance and knowledge sinece there are batteries and such. \n\n6. If they are legit installer companies, they are using modules that are manufactured for the market to meet internationally agreed standards of quality.  Perhaps key to understand is that higher efficiency modules (more kW per square meter) are usually more expensive than lower power density modules.  Perhaps read up on this.  \n\n7. Yes.  For hiring an installer, follow the basic protocols in selection that you would use for a house remodeller or general contractor.  Check references.  To learn more, just search online using terms like \"ontario solar incentives\" and \"solar PV basics.\"",

You dont have to wait to save money and they cover everything for 20 years.  Make sure you choose a good company such as NRG, SolarCity Sunpower ect (be careful here they have the best panels but use lots of small companies to install and take care of their systems).  There is a huge variety of financing involved with solar.  If you buy the system avoid paying interest on loans by using a solar company that uses EnerBank (sounds like the 0%down 0 interest for 18 months).  If you cannot get 100% coverage seek out a company that uses SunPower panels.  That company has the most efficient panel in the world.",

Hey the sun is shining the lights are on.\n\nAs far as what is happening right now the higher EEROI energy sources are subsidizing the lower ones.  As an example right now look at the solar only energy systems being installed in India.  No energy for massive house and two electric cars in those solar systems.\n\nAs far as spent fuel.  Do a little research on MSR.  Hint you don't have to store long lived actinides if you burn them all up.",

"comment": "I guess you missed this part:\n\n&gt;Tesla and SolarCity continue to report net losses after a decade in business, but the stocks of both companies have soared on their potential; Musk's stake in the firms alone is worth about $10 billion. (SpaceX, a private company, does not publicly report financial performance.)\n\n&gt;Musk and his companies' investors enjoy most of the financial upside of the government support, while taxpayers shoulder the cost.\n\n&gt;The payoff for the public would come in the form of major pollution reductions, but only if solar panels and electric cars break through as viable mass-market products. For now, both remain niche products for mostly well-heeled customers.\n\n&gt;Musk declined repeated requests for an interview through Tesla spokespeople, and officials at all three companies declined to comment.\n\n&gt;The subsidies have generally been disclosed in public records and company filings. But the full scope of the public assistance hasn't been tallied because it has been granted over time from different levels of government.",

"comment": "&gt; Progressives are no more willing to give up their privileged lifestyles than anyone else.\n\nWhile that's true, we're not even at that stage yet. We're still in the denial stage where almost everyone thinks that climate change is easy and cheap to stop if we act right now (which used to be true but isn't anymore). This means that most progressives wouldn't support the kind of measures we actually need because (among other reasons) they think that building a few solar panels will solve global warming by itself.\n\nSo yes, many progressives are still taking planes, which is something we can't afford to do anymore. However, no one's actually told them that we can't take planes from here on out. Don't blame them for not demanding a WW2-style mobilization without actually telling them that we need one.\n\nIt's like we're morbidly obese with severe diabetes and currently eating 35,000 calories a day. Progressives are people who are saying that we should be eating 34,000 calories a day and then we'll be fine, and conservatives are people who are saying that we need infinite growth so we should be eating 40,000 calories a day. Eating 2,000 calories a day isn't even being discussed outside of fringe circles. So, let's tell them.\n\n&gt; How about Naomi Klein jet setting all over the globe to shop her books and give speeches to other privileged high consuming white folks? \n\nYes, she's a hypocrite who should know better. That being said, her book This Changes Everything actually does suggest building a broad progressive coalition and it does talk about \"Big Green\" (green organisations working with corporations) being counterproductive.",

It makes it harder to pay off the investment in solar, especially with financing.  There is a lot of recent media coverage about this in different markets.  CA is probably more hopeful than other states.\n\n$6/w for 15% panels is a terrible deal, unless it comes with a new roof and electrical panel.  People are getting $3/w for 18% panels with optimizer systems.  Run away from this company.",

Yeah, I can just swap between the panel charging a battery pack, and then I use the pack to charge my phone.\n\nBut why not just keep things plugged in without having to swap?   If I walk into trees, then the charging stops.....and if I'm lucky, it'll start again when I walk into the sun.    OR, if I'm facing the sun vs not facing the sun, the phone might stop charging, and not start again.\n\nNot all devices are like this...unfortunately, mine likes a steady flow of juice!

"comment": "Ok some comments. Think of solar power like a bank account, you can only \"spend\" the power that you save.  If you purchase big ticket items via your bank account, you run out of money fast.  That said...\n\n - Interior/Exterior lights - if they are LED they use very little power and are easy to design for.\n - Fridge - is a BIG BIG ticket item.  They use a great deal of energy and run 24 x 7.  Not to say it can't be done but it requires some planning or compromise and can make your solar/battery install very costly.  It's an item you can read about on it's own.  IMHO, strongly consider going with propane appliances (fridge, stove, water heater) and a large 300-500 gallon propane tank.  Otherwise, consider a \"chest freezer style fridge rather than an upright as they use a fraction of the power.\n - Fans to distribute heat - also easily done with solar -- however - take a look at the [Caframo EcoFan](http://www.efireplacestore.com/caframo-ecofans-wood---gas-stove-fans.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwz_TMBRD0ARIsADfk7hSFbbT8QuwfwVfizSTVYg4BpXbXby8Z9LQ5JF_6k08KQvCDuvuOImYaAqi6EALw_wcB&amp;refnum=AUG-594-5315).  They are powered directly from the heat off your wood stove and do a great job at pushing the heat around the room -- we have 3 of these.\n\n - Charging equipment etc... all very simple and generally low power.\n\nIn general (fridge aside) it sounds like your needs are very similar to ours.  My setup includes 3 x 125 watt panels, a 45 Amp Charge Controller (sized so we can add 3 more panels in the future), 4 x 6V Trojan deep cycle batteries (wired to make a 450 Amp Hour system at 12 volts), a 2000 Watt DC to AC Inverter (for powering lights, appliances, chargers -- it has enough power to run most kitchen appliances, hand tools, inflatable toy pumps etc...) and a Trimetric Battery Monitor (to monitor how much energy is in the batteries and the overall health of the system).  My system has been running since 2010 flawlessly and the ONLY maintenance required is topping up the batteries with distilled water a few times per year.\n\nA very good article/blog to read on Solar, Batteries, Charge Controllers, Wiring etc... is called [The RV Battery Charging Puzzle](https://handybobsolar.wordpress.com/the-rv-battery-charging-puzzle-2/).  It's very very long (grab your favourite adult bevvy one night).  He has ton's of opinions on RV/Solar dealers you can wade through, however his advice is golden.  My cabin setup is almost identical to his RV setup.  Highly suggest going through his article in detail as it will give you some great input on every component required in your system.",

"comment": "I sell both on and off grid systems in Qld. We are really lucky.  You don't need to muck around with optimizers or micro inverters or any bullshit like that. Good solid Tier 1 panels are all you need.  Get the proper ones like Talesun, Jinko or Canadian Solar.  270w x 24 panels should do you. The average Qld home uses about 24kwh per day and a 6.4kw system will generate about 32kwh.\n\nIf you're North of Rocky, cyclone rated rack and rail is essential.  Simple string inverter will do the job.  If you're paying more than $6.5k you're getting stitched. \n\nIn Australia solar systems are heaps cheaper than the USA. You should be paying $1 per watt max. That's supplied and installed.\n\nBatteries, can't go past the Tesla Powerwall 2 if you're grid tied. You can get a 6.4k system with one of those for about $19k supplied and installed in NQ.\n\nIf you want to find out more, send me a pm and I can arrange a quote for you.",

"comment": "The best way I can describe it is pretend your solar system is like a water collection system. The PV array is your funnel that catches the water. The inverter is your downpipe and the battery your jug. Your load is a tap on the side of the funnel that drains water before it gets into the jug. \n\nThe jug holds gallons (let's call them kwh). The inverter and array are in gallons per hour (let's call these kw)\n\nYou need to size your system so that it collects enough so the tap can run and the jug still get filled so you can use it to run the tap when there's no rain. Now just apply that analogy to sunlight and electricity. \n\nYou want to have as big a funnel as you can so that your downpipe is full for as long as possible. If you oversize your array by 30% that's a good size. \n\nYou just need to work out how big a tap you have and size the jug, downpipe and funnel accordingly. \n\nIt really is that simple. \n\nI would recommend a 6.4kw of array with 5kw of inverter for every Powerwall 2. That will generate you about 30kwh per day (depending on latitude. Double check pvwatts) which will allow you to use 16.5kwh during the day and 13.5kwh at night. \n\nIf that isn't enough, add a second or third phase, rinse and repeat. \n\nThink of an optimizer as an individual water pipe from each panel feeding the downpipe as opposed to one pipe per string of panels (most line inverters have 2 strings).",

When you apply to the utility, you sign a form that says that the system is sized for your energy usage or you plan to increase your energy consumption within the next 12 months to match your system. Not sure what subsequent monitoring is done to follow this up or what they would do if they felt that you weren’t in compliance. Definitely makes sense for many people to make the system &gt;100% offset given TOU + net metering.",

"comment": "It's fear-based marketing (emotional manipulation) that has parameters vague enough to mislead even the best of scientists (technologically we're not yet capable of calculating the climate change in real-time or predict it in any certain way) \n\nThe largest forces in Green Energy (Germany, Netherlands, Canada, USA and China) have the largest economical interest in upholding the scheme despite getting more and more data that MMCC is simply not true - Climate is changing (and has been changing), but not because of us.\n\nYou can skin an apple in many different ways and with statistics it's the same. With parameter manipulation you can force your result to suit an agenda. And that is why one has to be very careful when analyzing big data and must not blindly trust results.\n\nHoax - (verb) to deceive by hoax, (synonym) **deception, fraud**, fake, imposture, humbug\n\nSo is it a hoax? I would dare to say so. Mind that many outlandish claims have been marked with the word hoax. That is why this word has a very negative halo around it, that makes people take condescending pose against those that used the word.\n\nAnd since people in the 21st century like to virtue signal all over social media and appear more holier than Mother Theresa, the radical-left movements are so widely spread.\n\nIs it politicized? Absolutely. Nothing big was happening until after 2006 when An Inconvenient Truth got into cinemas all over the world. That was the big boom marketing moment for people behind this agenda and the sales of diesel cars soared, solar panels and wind turbines. Also, must not forget the Uni research grants.",

We have 200amp service at our house.\n\nEven if you are 3 phase power there's a little energy monitor box next to the powerwall. Inside of that box should be a switch to turn on/off the grid. You can use that to go \"off grid\" from my understanding even though it's not fully designed that way. \n\nI obviously will have to see when it's installed.",

That's \"owning\" the problem in my view anyway.\n\nI work in this space so it's my job to change the things I can. \n\nReductions at home is not a valid response if increases are the purported problem. The US being nearly flat while Asia skyrockets would indicate the problem is there.  \n\nIf the West goes to Zero while Asia continues increasing will the planet be saved?  I think not given the solar panels China is selling us are produced with coal.  \n\nThe planet is not doomed because of current levels of CO2.  The doom is attributed to what will happen if emissions increase. So the focus needs to be where the trouble is increasing.",

Solar panels let's say generously have a 20 year life span and a  60% continuous operating efficiency.  Nuclear plants have a 60 year designed life span with many current US plants being re-licensed for 80 years and have a nearly 95% continuous operating efficiency.  Neglecting the fact that a 1500MW solar plant would require much more land area than the equivalent nuclear plant, nuclear is by far the better option to combat climate change.",

"comment": "Cross posting from the Tesla forum \n\nSolar Roof v3 - how accurate is the quote?\n\nCurrent: 4.2 kW solar panel installation on the roof (previous owner) \n\nProblem: The roof needs a replacement in the next year or two with $1500 worth of immediate work needed (northern CA = $$)\n\n**Asphalt option:** Take the panels off + replace with 25-30 year shingles + put the panels back (\"nah, we don't need permits\" - not sure if I can palette this) + 5 year weatherization warranty = **$23.5K + cost of repairing anything below the surface** that may have dry-rot (if any).\n\n**Tesla Solar Roof: For a 9 kW = $33K** (see details in the image). This would more than double the solar capacity, which I think is currently rather inadequate for a 2750 sq ft home. Note that we have a model 3 and expect to switch the other car to an EV as well whenever it is due for replacement.\n\nMy questions are\n\n1. Does anyone know **how accurate** this quote is? Should I expect it to go up at all after they visit? \n2. Would they take care of **removing the existing panels**?\n3. **Is there a market for used panels?** Mine are 3 years old with a SolarEdge inverter but I'm guessing Tesla will have their own inverter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smuyo2dsjki51.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d4b849389e7ef25f5407e84790c56a5876062f5\n\n[Images of the roof ](https://imgur.com/gallery/LjV6eOV)",

"comment": "But residential panels don't put out anywhere near the voltage that the battery needs to charge, and the voltage fluctuates with the amount of sunlight they're getting so they wouldn't be reliable. You'd need at least 10 panels in series to get the proper voltage. So you'd need a boost converter (which is also not 100% efficient, and probably costs the same as the solar inverter would) to step up the DC voltage, then you'd need a separate on-board charger that can take a DC input (or maybe find a way to get the DC input from after the rectification within the onboard charger).\n\nBut either way, that DC-DC boost converter is going to cost as much and not be significantly more efficient than a solar inverter would have been in the first place. The benefit of direct low voltage DC charging of an EV seems super tiny to me.",

However batteries would also give you flexibility for more aggressive peak rate structures as well as some (limited) backup power.  If I were installing in your area, I would be incorporating batteries into my designs and targeting the peak rate. I bet the battery would have a payback less than your solar array payback, except at the end of the payback the battery would need replacement whereas your solar array presumably would not.",

Solar roofs are expensive, and predicted to last 40 years.  The payback time on them just isn’t enough for my liking.  I saved $30k doing the route I told you with shingles.  I just wasn’t willing to spend $80k+ on solar roofs the alternative was $53k.  Both ways had Powerwalls, so that’s why it was so expensive for me.",

"comment": "Nuclear engineer here. I got into nuclear to help solve issues holding it back from helping much more with climate change. I started out studying advanced reactors (including thorium among many other advanced techs) and still do. The more I've learned the more I've come to understand that even current-generation nuclear reactors are completely appropriate for helping en masse to solve climate change, and that we should be building them like crazy. \n\nCost problems can be solved by choosing one or two standardized reactor designs of any kind and building lots of them in serial. I was on NPR's Science Friday the other day talking about [one particularly unconventional way of doing this.](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/floating-nuclear-power-plants/)\n\nSafety problems are like airplane crashes. Bad when they happen, but rare. Air pollution from fossil kills 8M/yr when they operate normally so nuclear heath impacts almost do not register. \n\nNuclear lifecycle carbon emissions are super low: 12 gCO2-eq/kWh. Solar PV is like 40. Wind is 11. Gas is 490. Coal is over 800. \n\nSo let's do it!\n\nAs for thorium, most of the things said about it are at least slightly misleading, so I put together a whole [Thorium Myths page](https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html) to unpack them.",

The advantages to this are the low APRs (sometimes 0.99%) and that you get \"more\" for the tax credits because the contract price is higher. \n\nIf you're going to get your own financing (which could well be worth it), make sure you're getting the CASH price from these providers, which sounds like what SunPower is proposing, but that $/W seems quite high. \n\nWe're shopping around ourselves at the moment, and all of the salespeople I've dealt with so far default to the 20-year loan options so they can market the monthly savings and very low APRs.",

"comment": "Yeah, I was thinking about that too, but we're in a crunch with the state here, they're only accepting applications for the state incentive for another 6wks ish and the net metering isn't going to be 1:1 if I don't install before Jan 1, so I can't really wait for newer panels to come out. \n\nI had an extensive conversation with the SunPower guy while he used their designer thing and the reason I'm quoted lower watt panels on most of this is 2 things, 1 is my roof, it has skylights on it. So the 380-400+ watt panels are longer and skinnier, which actually is worse for me because less panels can fit on the best part of the roof. The 335-375 watt panels tend to be shorter, so I can actually fit more panels into the best area of the roof, like an extra row, but the higher watt are just slightly too long and hit my skylights. And it's actually cheaper and generating more power to have that extra row of lower watt panels. \n\nI'm leaning towards the LG just because looking it up, Q Cells only have a 12yr product warranty/25yr production warranty on the panels, LG has 25yr product and production. \n\nI could not get a watt class out of Company A, they're terrible to speak to. Company D I believe were 370/380 bit I cannot remember. He didn't give me the formal quote as he is doing a price match to undercut company C. However Company Ds warranty is so bad, I'd rather buy the SunPowers then go with him I think.",

"comment": "A kW (kilowatt) is the wattage of the system. This can be DC, the total wattage of the panels, or AC, the total wattage of the inverter(s). Usually you’ll have a DC to AC ratio of anywhere from 1:1 to 1.5:1. The higher the ratio, the more likely you are to experience “clipping”, meaning the wattage being instantaneously produced by the panels (DC) exceeds the maximum continuous rating of the inverter (AC). Imagine a south facing roof with no shade on a clear, sunny day. Solar panels are rarely in perfect conditions which is why it makes sense to have more DC than AC. \n\nA kWh (kilowatt hour) is how we measure the actual usable electricity. A 10 kW DC system will produce a different amount of kWh based on a multitude of factors— location, direction of array, soiling, shading, pitch of roof. \n\nIf you had a 1 kW system in perfect conditions for 1 hour, you’d produce 1 kWh. \n\nThere’s plenty of software that can simulate your energy production (kWh) based on the specifics of your system. \n\nAnd IMO, depending on location and installation Solar can be anywhere between $2.50-$4.50. \n\nPremium solar equipment is about $1.40 for all components needed. People on this sub are so focused on price. When you add all the costs of engineering, permitting, support staff, customer acquisition, marketing, site survey, insurance, gas, tolls, trucks, tools, rent, utilities, software, customer service, inspections, and profit it’s very easy to understand how you get to $3-4/watt. Most deals north of $3.30-$3.50 are financed. Most solar loans have fees to buy down the interest rate in the 10-30% range. \n\nBut guess what? Higher fees, and lower rates = lower payments. Most people buy solar on the payment. And guess what else? If you don’t have the cash, or don’t want to outlay the cash— this is a great deal if you’re paying less than your utility bill. It’s like saying when you checkout at the super market if you were offered a 25% discount on the groceries you were already going to buy…of course you’d say yes. And you’re paying less to not pollute. \n\nI’m guessing OP financed. Oh and OP bought SunPower. The most expensive equipment. And if you are in MA, electricians command $55-65 per hour and the states requires 1 licensed electrician per non licensed individual on site. \n\nYes, some states / jurisdictions have lower cost of labor, insurance, rent, permits, etc. and yes you can get some installers to sell you a system for $2.50 per watt. I can pretty much guarantee you a company selling sub $3 per watt is more likely to go out of business than one selling at $3.50 per watt. I’ve talked to many people who went solar, their system needs service, their installer is out of business, and no one wants to touch it. \n\nImagine paying $0.50 per watt more. $5,000 on 10 kW, $3,700 after incentive, 148 per year over 25 years, or $12.33 per month. And either way, you’d save thousands. \n\nI personally believe this sub’s push for lowest price is bad for the industry. Solar makes lots of financial sense, most installers operate on 10-15% net margins. They’re not price gouging. They’re trying to run real businesses.\n\n\n Cheap = corners cut. Rant over!",

"comment": "my gut is yes, if you can afford to and/those appliances need replacement anyway. We've done away with our furnace for a heat pump (Bosch IDS 2.0 with resistive backup used below 0F), swapped our gas stove for induction (Frigidaire, which we love), and I'm hoping do a hybrid Water heater this summer and will switch the gas dryer at that time too. We installed 15 365w panels at this time too (summer/fall 2020).\n\nUsing heat pump in minnesota our gas bill now around $20 year round and electricity (under special electric heat rate at our utility, but with additional cost for their wind energy program) is cheaper except for jan/feb when our panels are snow covered and even then the cost increase is small. Despite the increased energy use, we have reduced our emissions by 50%.\n\nOur average bills dropped from a combined $160-170 average down to $100 average, 10% of which is the gas connection charge. Our solar doesn't cover our use and I want to add more panels on our garage so I can clear them in winter (our house roof has low gradient and 2 stories up so snow just has to sit till it melts). We do get Net metering money back in summer.\n\nPeople may say what we did isn't value, but our furnace &amp; AC were 20yrs old and our furnace broke in the week before the work was done, and some of it was motivated by cutting C02 and honestly, seeing if All electric can reasonably be done here. We are not the first, but not many others have ditched their furnace in MN. In my view this isn't as scary a prospect now as it might have been and new heat pumps and electric water heaters are up to the job of replacing gas.\n\nGood luck either way. Talk to contractors who are open to this stuff - quite a few here were not, while others excited by it. Oh, and consider ground source heat pump - I regret that I didn't talk to a ground source specialist -it might have been to expensive but at least I wouldn't be left wondering -I'd do ground source in a heartbeat if it would have worked for us. And look out for organizations providing energy efficient loans or grants. Here Minnesota center for energy and environment (MNCEE) was very helpful.\n\nGood luck.",

"comment": "Now is a bad time to buy a car ONLY if you WANT a new car and don’t NEED a new car. I bought my Kia EV6 GT line AWd 6 months ago and haven’t looked back since.\n I live in SoCal, don’t have solar, use the car for errands and my daily commute of 62 miles round trip.\n  Couple of things:\n\n1) Charging at home even with a 15a 230v charger is plenty to top my range throughout the week.\n Home eleccy costs me $0.22/kw off peak. So around $9-13 to juice up from a low charge level.\n It’s costing me approximately $28-$42/week depending where I drive to.\n My previous ICE vehicle was killing me at $1132/month.\n In gas.\n\n2)  True cost of owning…\n\nThis is the most expensive car I have ever bought new. $58950 before TTL &amp; $2k mark up. my loan with interest is $66,135. 🥺\n I have not had a car loan for almost 3years and it’s more than I wanted to pay. However my savings the last 6 months go straight into the loan. I’m currently on track to pay off in 2.5 years.\n\n3) Range anxiety.\n\nHad it at first, once you start charging at home and leave the house with 200-270 mile range every day it goes away. Also, even when the SoC hits 0% we still have enough charge to go another 10-12 miles. \n In turtle mode\n\n4) Public charging issues. \n I see a LOT more EV on the road now, EA charging stations are always busy with Ioniq 5 and ID 4’s because of the free 30 min charging for 3 years.\n  It’s a trap that will suck up your free time to save $20-$40 of over priced electricity. \n I plan to buy a tri fuel (propane, nat gas, gasoline) generator with 230v output. Should the grid go down I have a portable HD charging option at that point.\n Solar is cool but the key to victory is 30+kw of battery storage. Tesla powerwall is kinda a sham when you research other options…",

Tests have shown that lots of tiny charges can extend the life of the battery to something like 8,000 cycles (14 years).\n\nSo look at your solar panel capacity, take half of that.  Then adjust your level 2 charger to charge your car at the half-solar capacity.",

"comment": "It is very tough in OK due to the lack of net metering in many utilities and  the very low utility energy wholesale costs they reimburse you for.  \n\nWe have locations in OKC and Tulsa and they run $0.09-$0.12/kWh and it is VERY hard for residential solar to make that pay back very fast in any or our projected costs.  This is without financing anything and paying cash or at least a 0% loan...\n\nEven with 1:1 net metering, if you pay $2.50/W it is about 10 years to break even, at $3 it is around 12 years and $3.50 about 14 years.  This is assuming no other costs so that is $0 in maintenance or repairs or changes in rates and paying 0% interest on any loan for 15+ years.\n\nPlease let us know how it works out as you go and what your spreadsheets tell you.  I have looked at a few bids in the last few months and they are on the high end of $3.50-$4.50 in OK.\n\nAnother Utah based organization called Aveyo was the highest so far at $4.50/W last month for a \\~19-year payoff and the design would never work anyway.  ($80K for 17.8kW array)\n\n[https://aveyo.com/newsfeed/the-merger-2](https://aveyo.com/newsfeed/the-merger-2)\n\nGET LOTS OF BIDS and do your homework.  I cannot stress that enough.  Many of these folks are going to hurt you either by design or lack of skills, or whatever.  Regardless, you will be the one paying for it as they have their money and are gone.  \n\n(Like the gym memberships of years past...)\n\nSome solar folks are very good, but I think they are outnumbered right now.  Most of them will not be there in 5 or so years when you need service/help...  The solar panel prices and installation downturn in places like California will drive some of them out but only after they have hurt some folks on the way out...  This is a decision worth some serious consideration.",

"comment": "I'm actually not sure if I liked either article.  While I agree with the blogger that the \"10 tips\" article was fairly misguided and too apologetic about veganism, I think it's important to note that this was primarily intended as tips for vegan business owners.  While on a personal level maybe emphasizing veganism is fine/great, the article was only recognizing the realities of resistance to veganism and the choices she thought which would help bring in more money.\n\n&gt;I can’t imagine a vegan would ever tell you to “emphasize vegetarian instead of vegan,” it baffles me.\n\nI found this point that the blogger makes interesting because while I understand that one should never be ashamed to announce being a vegan, I understand it.  I've found myself saying \"vegetarian\" when I know the person I'm talking to either won't understand or will be highly belligerent about veganism.  I do understand the importance of getting veganism \"out there\" but veganism is a personal choice for me and I don't necessarily feel the veganism defines me.  It may be a lifestyle that I follow, but it's only one part and I think \"vegetarianism\" denotes a way of eating whereas veganism delves into all types of issues, opinions, and other areas besides diet.  This is not to say that I won't debate someone about veganism or offer my reasoning and beliefs, I just don't always want to and I find \"vegetarian\" to sometimes be sufficient.  Some may disagree but I do consider myself \"vegetarian\" just a strict version of one, as well as being a vegan.",

They are very popular and are opening up everywhere it seems, so check them out! \n\nFor grocery stores, I would recommend [Trader Joe's](http://www.traderjoes.com/stores/index.asp), [Whole Foods](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/), and [Sprouts](http://www.sprouts.com/stores). \n\nI love Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. They clearly label all their vegan products and at least in Trader Joe's, you can ask for a list of all their vegan products and they will print it out for you. (I even had a vegan employee walk me through the entire store showing me everything they have and what he liked most.)\n\nI have never been to Sprouts, but my SoCal friends rave about it, so if I went to Cali for a visit, I'd stop by to see what the fuss is about. \n\nAs far as cosmetics and toiletries, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods should have you covered.",

Dogs don't care about the abstract concept of freedom, they only care if they want to do something and are prevented. I think being a pet is a pretty decent tradeoff: sacrifice some freedom for a guaranteed source of food, entertainment, medical care and a painless death once medicine is ineffective.\n\nBy the way, dogs can be vegan. There are a number of commercial foods out there that are formulated to supply complete nutrition without the use of any animal products. Most of them are made with human-quality ingredients. I've had my dogs on a combination of Evolution/Ami Dog for about 8 years now. The only downside is that they are pretty expensive. Feel free to ask if you have any questions or want to know more.\n\nIt would seem inconsistent to me to have a pet and feed it other animals whose lives are just as valuable.",

Just be aware of lysine, the limitimg amino acid and eat your legumes. If you don't mind soy, it's the best plant protein there is and it even has amino acid palette close to the meat",

If you are in a big city there is probably at least restaurant that is under rabbinical supervision. The only major chain that I am aware of with many kosher locations is Krispy Kreme.",

Also, wisk the hell out of it when combining.\n\nThat is the base recipe, and you can add whatever you like from there. These pancakes come out so light and fluffy, I've easily fooled my omni family and friends many times.",

I didn't so much mind the health focused peeps, but there was one guy who I remember was trying to organize a weekly carpool to go collect mountain spring water or something because fluoridated tap water. That was a bit much for me.\n\nAh, and the one guy who seemed to be my age there (who was pretty cute so I took note) I saw like a week later at a yoga class. He didn't clean his COMMUNAL yoga mat while everyone else was. Just rolled it up and put it back. That's gross. Why would you do that. They provided spray and wipes. Inconsiderate af.",

It's normal for humans to be glad when bad people who have done terrible things die. Am I supposed to be sad when child rapists and murders die as well? I think not. \n\nHowever, there is a line. It disturbs me when I see graphically violent comments detailing how that person would kill the \"bad person\"(in whatever scenario). I can understand thinking \"the world would be better off without them\" but that's a far cry from the demented sh*t I've seen people post.\n\nI do agree however that vegans in particular should be careful about publicly celebrating the death of humans, no matter how awful they were. It's reinforcing the stereotype that vegans ONLY care about animals and that we're all misanthropes.",

Using any coffee bean you want.  I would just ask you to taste it to see how good coffee, just plain black well brewed coffee can be.  \n\nThen if you want to turn it into coffee with almond milk, or coffee with sugar, go for it.

So I should leave someone I love because they eat eggs and fish sometimes? Incredibly fucking stupid. Every relationship is different and that’s great for you that your partner is vegan but that doesn’t apply to everyone so you definitely shouldn’t be shaming people who do. You may say you don’t hate nonvegans but it sure as hell seems like you do “I go around murdering people, wanna be friends?” Why would you say that if you are friends with nonvegans? That doesn’t make sense at all, maybe you were just trying to be an asshole.",

"comment": "Imo: the reason science is against veganism is because it tends to segregate life into life that “matters” and life that doesn’t. What I mean by that, is that in concept, it ignores that all life is sacred implicitly by saying “killing animals is bad, even for sustenance”, but no one cares to add up the lives they consume at a microbial level. Either life is life and that’s all that matters, or you draw lines about which “life is life”. \n\nNon-Vegans tend towards drawing some common lines, usually around perceived intelligence of the being, while veganism tends towards the claim that “all life is life”, all while killing millions of individuals just by existing. This strange hypocrisy of definition doesn’t go well with scientific method. \n\nThe death of other life forms is provably impossible to avoid in the course of human existence. Not a single human living past a day of age has lived a life free from killing something. The inability to acknowledge that, while simultaneously claiming that other humans are “murder mouths” and such, makes it pretty easy for a scientist to acknowledge that the other half of the argument is failing to acknowledge all vectors of reality, thereby worth ignoring or otherwise shunning.",

Took me a few months to figure out what I like, but meals are as intuitive as before (took me about 4-6 months to get comfortable with the change).\n\nAlso, I found [this vegan nacho cheese recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/5-minute-vegan-cashew-queso/) that my non-vegan friends have said tastes better than dairy versions.  If you have the time, you could try making your own cheese (see r/vegancheesemaking )\n\nThe social aspect is the tough part for me.  None of my coworkers are vegan (so going out for lunch is a hassle), and my mom keeps pushing her carnivore diet when I see her (not all the time, but more often than not).

Ethically I have to be vegan, but actually doing it has been miserable. Spending time and effort hunting down and fixing nutritional deficiencies, cutting out so many delicious culinary traditions, making travel awkward, the social isolation, dealing with other vegans, and getting pulled into never-ending ethical debates about ethical consumption.\n\nIt makes complete sense that the vast majority of people prefer to live in blissful ignorance.",

"comment": "At a certain point we are talking in abstractions. In a perfect world, yeah, we would put livestock down painlessly if we can all switch to a plant based diet. In reality it would take some time for some groups to do so in a way that's reasonable for their health, but a huge amount of people could make the switch. Also in reality, we can't make people switch to plant based diet (yet).\n\nIn addition, pets being fed other non-human animals is a different ethical dilemma than humans eating non-human animals. Pigs and dogs are as smart and loving as each other, and have the same ways of feeling pain, so it's very easy to make the argument that putting down a dog painlessly, when they are vastly overpopulated, makes more sense than killing dozens of pigs in painful ways to sustain the dog--not just for the pain experienced, but the impact on the environment.",

"comment": "&gt;Or you could just take a step back.....look at things.....and realize everything you have ever eaten in your whole life (vegan or not) is something that was once alive and was killed prematurely for human consumption purposes. I am just at peace with this fact. There is no diet I can adopt to change this. I am a strong proponent of lab grown meat, but until then, we eat things which we killed prematurely so that we could eat them.\n\nAnimal and plant biology are completely different my dude. There's a major difference in how we get these foods. Think about getting a tomato or some kale from a garden. You just pluck the tomato or clip off same kale, rinse it off and eat it. To get the meat from a pig even in the most humane way, it has to be sent through a gas chamber before having its blood drained from its neck. Then you have to disect the body to get what parts you want to eat.  You don't have to kill a plant the same way you have to kill an animal to get food from it. It's just not the same. Not to mention the amount of plants you have to feed to the animal before you can even kill it. It just doesn't really make sense.",

You can read more about the environmental impact of them [here](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-06-01-new-estimates-environmental-cost-food)\n\n>Whenever I tried to maintain a vegan diet in university (I tried multiple times), I spent around the same amount of money on food as when I put very few restricitons on what I ate, only to lose an unhealthy amount of weight and to go to bed hungry multiple nights in a row every single time.\n\nWhat you're saying might be true but it doesn't necessarily indicate a flaw in plant based diets it could very well be your lack of knowledge about healthy plant based eating. It can be hard and inconvenient for many people initially but what the animals have to go through as a consequence of that choice is far worse. I personally think that if you do care enough, you'll try to make it work. I am also currently studying in university and my grocery costs are not much, I simply figured out a way to make it work. I currently use [huel](https://huel.com/) for many meals and it's quite affordable and very convenient.\n\n>Anyone who pretends that going vegan is an easy and cheap decision to make for everyone, is seriously out of touch. Privileged people have choices. I don't see how that's a controversial statement.\n\nYour statement is not controversial, the fact that you portray your personal opinion and anecdote as a fact comes off as quite arrogant. Many people here have anecdotes that going vegan reduced their grocery costs considerably.",

"comment": "And not everyone is going to be non-racist or try to be environmentally sustainable. So should BLM or Extinction Rebellion just write polite letters and post cool hashtags? Protest does not function without causing disruption. Disruption of the status quo is the whole point when the status quo is no longer tenable. How many agencies that have sworn to change their institutionally racist behaviour would have done so if BLM had not taken to the streets and stayed on the streets? Yes you need nice vegan cooking and pretty pictures on Instagram as well, but all successful protest movements ever have also functioned by claiming the public space to make themselves heard. And in case you don't think that veganism is worth making a fuss about I think that the completely unnecessary and inhumane deaths of [around 53 billion sentient land animals every year](https://www.adaptt.org/about/the-kill-counter.html) is a significant problem. I think that the animal industry being one of the single biggest contributors to human induced climate change is a significant issue. If you are genuinely against climate change you are also against the animal industry. \n\nAs for the minor inconvenience to traffic, well traffic is more than a minor inconvenience to the rest of us. One the highest areas of breathing diseases in the UK is near where I live, next to a major motorway junction. A lot of the people living next to that motorway can't afford cars but it doesn't stop them dying young. When we went into lock down traffic levels plummeted and reported breathing related problems in the most polluted parts of town dropped with them. People's lives got better not worse. I still don't think that you see the invisible \"inconveniences\" that we inflict on each other and the more vulnerable among us all the time. It is only when an inconvenience challenges our complacency and behaviour that we object.\n\nAnd yes, the MiG-21 F (NATO reporting name Fishbed C) is the most beautiful, minimalist variant of a genius bit of Soviet design :)",

And you are perfectly able to eat vegan dishes, why act like you are not? \"Oh no I dont eat vegan\" when its just NOT adding dead animal for ONE meal? I just substract one of your foods from a meal? Its like someone would insist that EVERY meal he eats has eg some sort of pumpkin/squash in it. People would be saying he is crazy. But refusing to eat one without one out of 4-6 chosen dead animals is perfectly fine? As if it would taste horrible without? Ofc only when its stated. Eating vegan unknowingly is fine for them. Unless you point it out afterwards, then it suddenly was gross and missing something. Even if you tell them that the fruit they snacked was vegan.",
