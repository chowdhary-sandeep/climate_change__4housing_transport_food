These advances have all happened in world with no cap and trade, no carbon tax, no emmisions trading scheme, designed by people who drove to work in traditional cars under lights powered by coal power stations.\n\nThe technologies that will 'save' us are the fruit that has grown from the tree fossil fuels. \n\nAnd the wanton politicization of a threat of an apocalypse, whilst possibly built on a husk of truth is repugnant.",

In the morning, you come back to a full charge.\n\nAround town - Different chargers give different amounts of power, but the average \"J1772\" public charger is between 10-15 miles of charge per hour. If you drove 10 miles to the store in a Leaf, you have plenty of battery to not worry about charging until you get back home.\n\nYou can find fast chargers on http://www.plugshare.com/ (they show up as orange). Not every electric car is compatiable with every fast charging standard, however, but they can charge at up to 60 miles of range per half hour of charging (or much, much faster for Tesla Superchargers).\n\nChademo - iMiev, Nissan Leaf, Tesla S (Adapter coming in the next month or two).\n\nSAE Combo - Chevy Spark, VW Golf\n\nTesla Supercharger - Tesla Model S only",

Technician work is only as hard as the car designer makes it! A lot of us can fix our own cars - and only defer work that has to do with stuff inside the engine, the transmission, or the computer and complex wiring harness. If a car designer designs thungs intelligently and WELL DOCUMENTS repair procedure and component information, this coupled with improved implementation of swappable parts, and simplicity of design for electric cars means third party mechanics could have an easier life - and dealership price gouging can go the way of the dodo",

"comment": "A typical electric oven is 240 volt, 30 amps. That's 6 kW by itself. Throw in a microwave, and some lights, the TV, and so forth... there's easily 10kW of electricity capacity that is conpletely unused at super off peak hours. Higher end homes have even more available... upwards to 35 kW, but obviously some of that capacity is used by appliances and HVAC that can cycle on even at super off peak.\n\nRead up on the duck curve... CAISO for instance amongst others have charts that show the daily use patterns. Peak versus off peak is usually at least double.\n\nMost EVs have the ability to schedule the charge. Time of use rates are sometimes offered and I pay 6 cents per kWh at super off peak... part of the reason for that is the ultra low demand at that point.",

"comment": "Off course you are going to pay a lot of interest with MyPower if you pay as agreed for 30 years. But where else can you get a 30 year solar loan fixed at 4.99% APR that does not encumber your property (no lien against your home or property)? You can prepay anytime without penalty and thus shorten the term any way you like. Most other Solar loans over 5 years have an APR much higher which means that for 5-12 years you will have a much higher \"power bill\" than normal and some people just cannot afford that. \n\nMyPower is the most flexible solar loan in the industry, no matter how you argue it. I allows even people with a limited income to go solar and save money on their electric bill every year from day one while having ownership of the system. All you need is a 650 credit score and be a home owner.\n\nYou also say: \"In addition to an interest rate, you're also looking at a 2.9% escalator that is separate from the interest.\" That is not correct. The payment escalator is just that, an increase in the payment, not the interest. Every penny still goes to paying off your loan, you just pay it off faster each year. If you don't want to escalator, just pay a little extra on the principle one month each year (minimum $500 extra) and you can avoid the escalator or even have a negative escalator, meaning your payment goes down.\n\n12 years for an inverter is optimistic. Realistically 8-10 years is a better estimate, especially in hotter climates like AZ and CA. Some people have 2-3 inverters. \n\nWith the MyPower loan, consumers have the flexible choice of paying less for their power from day one or paying extra to reduce interest and thus overall cost. The interest and loan payments for MyPower do not start until your system is producing for you, while other loans often start when you sign the contract. In some areas of the country you can wait many months for the utility to give you permission to turn on the system while you will be paying principle and interest on a system that is not operational yet.\n\nIf you still want to get your own loan or pay cash, no problem. SolarCity will STILL get you a 30 year warranty that includes all part and all labor so your argument about a 30 year warranty not being that important is moot.\n\nHow many local contractors got into the solar business because it is \"good money\" while the Federal tax credit is at 30% of the retail cost of the system? Most of them will go back to their regular contracting, HVAC etc. business when the Federal tax credit goes down to 10% in 2017. Now who will back your solar system? The manufacturers?? Maybe, but most are have no good system to work directly with consumer (they are manufacturers) and you will get a new part but in many cases will be on the hook for the labor. Besides the replacement contractor will be assigned by the manufacturer, who will that be?\n\nMyPower is the Solar Industries best and most flexile solar loan hands down. You just have to do a little research. Unless you can pay cash (and don't earn interest, capital gains or other returns on that cash) or can afford significantly higher payments for as much as 12 years for your electric,  MyPower is a great choice for most people.",

"comment": "&gt; I think the we are probably the best in the world on advanced inverter technologies – Elon Musk\n\nsure they can, and he is trying to bolster stock and the bail out.   \nSo far SolarEdge has the most efficient and next generation inverter in limited release that is even more efficient.   Tesla has yet to get one built and approved and released.   All takes time.   Also their partnership agreement with SolarEdge ran out recently, so SolarEdge has been touting that the StorEdge works with any battery system including the new LG LiOn battery.   \n\nFronius has a solution for the Powerwall but it has not passed US safety tests yet, same for Xantrex and Outback.   All were shown in early release videos/photos with Powerwall but none have been able to pass safety with the powerwall so far.   SolarEdge patented SafeDC system is what allowed it to pass.    Thus if they don't work with SolarEdge they will have to come up with an independent solution (time) or license from SolarEdge.     Electronics in the home require much more stringent safety requirements than integrated into a car.",

(And is there an escalator?)\n\nBut own the system using a loan like Sungage or Mosaic, factor in all your costs including interest and all your savings (Tax credits, electricity), income (SRECs or rebates) for the same time period as the lease and I'll bet the all in cost per KWh is closer to 7 cents (and no escalator!).\n\nSource: I've been selling solar in MA for 10 years never sold a lease or PPA.\n\nClearly there are exceptions- lousy site (shade), can't use the tax credit (people on low or fixed income)\n\nWhen we propose to our customers we model electricity inflation at the 10 year average, panel output degradation at manufacturers warranty, SRECs at the floor price, production based on conservative shade readings applied to PV watts data.",

"comment": "I've done a bit more research and spoken to Tesla Energy (Solar City) since my original post. First of all, yes, the Powerwall can definitely serve as a 'mini grid' if the power is out. As for your suggestion of more panels versus more batteries, in CA we're not allowed to generate too much more than we use -- I think maybe only like a 110% offset. Seems like BS to me, but whatever. I also learned that you can customize the powerwall to never go lower than a predetermined percentage, so if the grid does go down in the middle of the night, you won't lose power. As for weeks of rainy days, fingers crossed, but that's why I moved to Southern California instead of Oregon. I am also getting a Tesla X and asked if it could serve as a 2nd powerwall, and they said that energy only flows into it for now, but could potentially change with a software update. Thanks again for your help!",

"comment": "Would love a Zero but when I bought my bike they weren't available and I don't use the bike enough these days to justify changing. If I do get another bike it will be electric, no doubt. I still have petrol in my life unfortunately (mower, long distance car and motorcycle) but the Model 3 will trigger the selling of all three. There are battery mowers which will suit us fine, the bike will likely just go and not be replaced and the MINI will be replaced by the Model 3. At that point I'll be using no fossil fuel at all unless I have to fly somewhere (solar on house and carbon zero energy supplier.) I suppose I'll also have to watch what I eat if I really want to be completely free of fossil fuel consumption.",

Smartphones had an average replacement rate of less than 2 years, and even with that it still took about 10 years for them to outsell non-smartphones. Cars are durable goods meant to last 10+ years, and in general people won't replace them on a whim. So the rate will be slower unless we force ZEV programs and the like. The only way I can see it accelerated otherwise is if gas purchases slow down to the point where gas stations start to close down and gas drivers start to get their own range anxiety because of a lack of fueling stations. That's not likely for a while though.",

Individual state fuel taxes are already widely varied (between nearly 15 cents to nearly 60 cents per gallon).  Even if the new gas tax would fund new EV purchases it still won't get us there (you'd be looking at maybe $3 billion the first year at 2 cents/gallon, to maybe $15 billion in year 10 -- much fuzzier calculus as gasoline consumption would be decreasing with an increase in EVs).  \n\nNot that this tax is a bad idea, only that it doesn't get us to 100% EV sales in 10 years.",

"comment": "\"In an ICE car, gas stations are ubiquitous enough and fueling times so short that whether you get even 250 miles or 500 miles on a tank is not going to make a huge difference in usability. But for an EV, that's not true -- for a lot of people, the ability to make a long distance trip will be made or broken by the range of the car.\"\n\nA lot is made of the ubiquity of gas stations but in NYC they're becoming fewer and more far between. That being said, many people with EVs have figured out how to charge their cars, either at home or at work. What we're real talking about are road trips which we do rarely with two EVs, both Model 3s. We recently traveled 250 miles to Cape Cod from NYC and started out with 300 miles range. We needed one 15 min stop to be able to have enough to spend the week there doing local trips to the beach and dinners (we decided to stay for a half hour bc we went shopping for the trip).\nAt the Cape late in the week we charged once more for $10 at an outdoor mall that we spent an hour visiting and having coffee. It was a 14 min drive from where we were staying and it got us another few days and halfway home. Another 15 min stop got us 150 miles range. We stayed 20 to get lunch and a pitstop so it went to 170 (it was a 135 kWh charger.)\n\nSo all the fuss that people make about the stops needed for charging don't understand that you schedule your charges around your actions not your actions around the charging! So many people keep saying they think a gas station is something they do for 5 minutes but a supercharger is something you schedule an active thing like a pitstop, a cup of coffee, a sandwich, a meal, or a shopping trip..evens round of Angry Birds or a YouTube video. If you only want a quick fill, then it does that too, but TBH, my husband can NOT go more that 2 hours in a car without going to the bathroom and that and a coffee's more than enough time to get 2.5 hours of driving miles on a road trip.\nEdit: our usual.method of charging is a 110 plug in a public garage.",

The US is large enough to do its own manufacturing and the citizens are tired of making income by selling burger flipping to each other they want their high paying manufacturing jobs back and if the Dem's don't deliver, they will be voted out, and if the GOP doesn't deliver, they will be voted out.

If it gets 1 mile per kwh then it is 33.7mpge which would be less than the camry hybrid. But this is neglecting the fact that  the chemical to electrical conversion is being offloaded to the power plant so you have to take into account the energy lost there as well at least in the same proportion that the energy is actually fossil in the instantaneous grid mix.\n\nOn an all renewable and nuclear grid though you would probably be right.",

"comment": "Their example is 15 households on a 37.5 kVA transformer.  And then they say,\n\n&gt;Converting a gas appliance to a heat pump, for example, would draw 4 to 6 kW, while an L2 charger for EVs would be 12 to 14 kW. \n\nThose numbers are a little exaggerated.  Yes, there are plenty of ultra wealthy people in Palo Alto who are putting in 80 amp charging circuits, but 7-10 kilowatts is much more common, and even 3.5 kW is plenty for typical home charging needs.\n\nSimilarly, a heat pump in that mild climate would not need for kilowatts unless we're talking a giant house which, to be fair there are some of those in Palo Alto.  But when they talk about 15 households on one transformer they're probably talking about denser neighborhoods of 1,000 sq ft houses.  And there's also the potential for uneducated installers to go old school with low performance heat pumps and resistive heat strips that kick in at 5 kW whenever it gets below 40° F.  Which is actually quite rare in Palo Alto, but can't happen.\n\nBut they are absolutely correct that there can be a problem.  If 10 of the 15 households have one kilowatt heat pumps in 3.5 kW charging, all running simultaneously on a cold night, that alone would exceed the rating of the transformer, never mind the refrigerators, hobbyist gaming servers, etc. that are also running.  \n\nSo some combination of upgrades, such as additional or larger transformers, and load management, will certainly be needed.",

Why did 120V EVSEs get mentioned, I thought you were looking for an EVSE with a 14-50 plug, and those are all 220/240V EVSEs.",

"comment": "“According to data from Cox Automotive, parent of Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for electric cars was $53,469 in July 2023, vs. gas-powered vehicles at $48,334. Tesla contributed to a substantial drop in EV prices since late last year as it cut prices.” \n\nFirst yes new cars are expensive. RJ was only talking about new cars. Rivian vehicles are especially expensive but that’s not his point. Second, in 2023 the gap between the avg ICE car and BEV is only 11%. That was not the case ven last year. Once you add in a tax credit that many but not all EVs are eligible for and all of the sudden the the cost gap isn’t much at all or actually a surplus. (USA incentives.) If you are outside the USA, you probably have many more lower cost EV options from China like MG, Ora and BYD. Finally, if you add in the savings from gas and maintenance I think you’ll find the gap isn’t much at all.",

A ban on all petrol and diesel engined vehicles is then due to come into force in 2030, leaving carmakers able to sell some hybrids until 2035.\n\nManufacturers that miss the target face fines of £15,000 per vehicle — almost half the average selling price of a new car. Last year, EVs made up 15 per cent of all new car sales but those are skewed towards certain manufacturers, such as Tesla and Kia.\n\nIn its latest consultation, the government has created two loopholes allowing carmakers to get around the targets in the early years. First, manufacturers will have a certain number of allowances to sell petrol and diesel cars that they will be able to trade with each other.\n\nFurther, the government will allow carmakers to offset some shortfalls in meeting the EV targets during the first three years with a higher proportion of EV sales later in the decade.",

"comment": "We really need to stop generalizing so much here (and life in general). I read through a lot of this, but definitely not all of it, and I think OP does have valid points. These cars all fit a need. Yes, comparisons can be helpful, but lets all pump the breaks here on thinking this is all apples to apples.\n\nHere's why I chose a 2023 PHEV:\n\n* I was coming from all ICE vehicles and replacing a 2002 Camry. Even if I never plugged this PHEV in, it would still be much more efficient than my old car.\n\n* Most BEV’s I was interested in where $10K-$30K more, and this PHEV was still a financial stretch.\n\n* I know I’ll have to maintain the “ICE” parts of this car. But those expenses might be half of what I spent on my old car. \n\n* I do not have a level 2 charger at home. That will require an added expense. The idea of charging at home is what ultimately sells me on EV’s and I’m not interested in having to drive to, wait for, and sit in an available charge station. \n\n* Using the L1 charger that came with the car works well so far (it’s specked at 33 miles electric). I’m averaging about 27 miles a day, but expect to take longer trips/vacations in the summer and will probably use mostly ICE for that. I think a PHEV with a legit all electric range of ~ 50 miles would be the sweet spot. If I really needed more than that, I’d probably just go BEV. \n\n* Yep, a little range anxiety comes into play here. I think once I educate myself on how charging on longer trips will work, and that its not much of an inconvenience or doesn’t actually cost more than just fueling an ICE, and after I have a level 2 charger at home… I expect to go full BEV for the next car.\n\n* If you have solar at home and don’t have to pay for electric, awesome for you. I wish I did too, but I’m also happy we haven’t yet cut down all of the old growth trees where I live (Northeast US).\n\n* For those arguing that PHEV owners probably don’t even plug in, come on man. That’s silly and you’re wrong. Because I do. Sure, those owners should probably be driving an ICE/HEV. But if they want to spend more for tech they don’t use… it’s their choice. Certainly not a valid argument against anyone buying a PHEV.",

By comparison the polestar is a fantastic option in the premium/luxury segment based on price/performance.  people like me aren't looking at a model y or 3 lol.  i'm not a soccer mom or 20 year old.  lol.",

I compared Sunpreme double sided panels to LG Xeon and Sunpreme had a much higher PTC rating compared to LG Xeon and even most of SunPower's panels without even considering the back side of the panel so it's looking like I'm going to go the Hyper X2/Sunpreme route.",

How the hell is it \"zero emissions\" if it uses a natural gas-powered engine to recharge the battery?\n\nEven if your argument is \"hey, Tesla's or other EVs are not exactly emission-free either because they charge the batteries with energy from coal, and so on\".\n\nFirst off, at least with those EVs, coal and other polluting resources will be rapidly declining as a percentage of the total charging of these batteries. Tesla's new gigafactory for instance will be powered 100% by solar power. So at least that argument against Tesla's EVs will be completely null soon.\n\nSecond, when people say \"zero emissions\" what they really mean is that there's no pollution *inside the cities* from these vehicles. That's true for all EVs. But it's NOT TRUE for these Nikola trucks and those garbage trucks made by the former Tesla co-founder either (both use the same recharging engine). These will lose their battery charge relatively quickly, and then the natural gas engine will have to be powered on, and that's when it WILL create emissions.\n\nSo my point is that I hate how Nikola and that garbage truck company, too, try to get attention by LYING. At least own the technology and its disadvantages, and keep telling us how \"this is the only way to do it well right now\", but don't try to lie to us about it.",

"comment": "From about a year ago, this is what I knew about Delta Solivia products:\n\n__ Taiwanese company with products across a pretty wide range of industries (mostly power electronics products)\n\n__ Typically products positioned as a newer entrant, and as a \"value\" (not top end)\n\n__  Their solar inverters had sold quite a bit at the time across Asia and especially in Australia\n\n__ One of the known distinctions from premium products at that time was they used passive cooling and not fan cooling. There are probably others.\n\n\nUnless they have modified their product and positioning in a year or a year and a half, they are probably still an \"economy\" product. I am not sure how significant shading is and whether your contractor calculates that higher output panels and absence of separate power optimizers will give you equal or better net results. (To be clear, optimizers and inverters are independent.) But if the contractor is reputable they should be willing to explain to you exactly how they see the balance of performance between the two systems. Ask them specifically about reliability and proven durability (e.g. ask about the cooling concern). If the answer is purely about warranty that may be a bad sign. If the answer includes some examples of a year or few years of stable performance that may be a better sign.\n\nIt all comes down to how much you want to spend for peace of mind (durability) and long term performance. As someone mentioned here, if the difference is $0.20 per watt, maybe that's a good value given your budget.",

Or in 15 years when the system still has 5-10 years life left and the Sunpower panels produce a higher output? They market having the most efficient panels over the life of the system... \n\nAm I correct in seeing this as theres a short term benefit to have lower costs initially however the long term benefit of more efficient panels is greater?\n\nAs panda said, it does come down to the data.",

"comment": "&gt; There are procedures for challenging it and cutting the vents off and hiding them and the fact that you did it is not the way to do things.\n\nI did no such thing and I recommend following the procedure for challenging it, in the design phase. I'm a \"solve all this stuff in the design phase\" advocate. I think solar installers can benefit from understanding proper \"design, bid, build\" procedures. \n\nIn this particular UPC issue, I think there is sound basis for a challenge.  I think its bad code. \n\nThat said, I don't have a willingness to break code, so please remove those words you put in my mouth. \n\nI have a willingness to break * this particular plumbing code *, which I would recommend to be pointed out to the permit office during the the design phase, when appropriate. To insinuate otherwise is fake news! Don't be that!\n\n&gt; \"Code is code\"\n\nNo. Code is there for safety reasons and evolves as our understanding of safety evolves. If we blindly follow code without comprehension of it, it encourages shortcuts and human error. If there are no safety reasons for code, then we might as well let HOA's determine everything. Might as well ban ugly ass vent stacks on roofs in the name of good taste. Sometimes code needs to be changed to accommodate the fact that *roofing technology changes* and *now that we have a reason to put coverings over the top of those plumbing vents, we might have to rethink the 6\" minimum height requirement\". \n\nAgain, I implore you to provide the basis for the 6\" height requirement. Snow? Rain-water? All of this is mitigated by solar, which code does not allow for.\n\nStill waiting on your basis for the 6\" height requirement. This is not an accessibility issue. If it were, it would be a lateral offset distance requirement, not a vertical height requirement.\n\nIf you're going to chew anyone out for not following non-NEC code, then how about you focus on rafter penetrations without the sign-off of a registered design professional? That's much more of a safety issue than this not-real-issue.",

"comment": "Oversized arrays are pretty common, both from the sales point of view but also the fact that many installers expect homeowners to start using more electricity since it's now cheap.\n\nDepending on what your gas prices are, you maybe better of converting your heating and dryer to electric appliances. This assumes that your gas prices are higher than the equivalent amount of production from your solar panels. \n\nYou could look into a plug-in hybrid or electric car. An EV driver can easily use 2000 kWh powering the car over the course of a year, and you're offsetting gas payments with lease payments.",

Its a cute word dance, but its bullshit.\n\nIf you are off grid, and need more electricity than your solar panels can produce, you can't get anymore electricity from your internet connection. Maybe, you could slowly save up money and buy a new solar panel. But that's still not the same.\n\nIf you're selling electricity, you can make shit move right here and right now.

"comment": "&gt;Lately I've been reading that the IPCC is too conservative...\n\nNope. The IPCC represents the current consensus among climate scientists. Whenever you read the phrase \"the IPCC is too conservative,\" be sure that the person saying/writing it is an alarmist who can't back their claims with actual scientific research.\n\n&gt; Additionally, they rely on negative emission technology, which doesn't exist in any meaniful form yet?\n\nNo, they don't \"rely\" on it. They include the possibility of it in some of their projections (RCP 2.5, for example). \n\n&gt;If everyone meets the Paris agreement, we're still going over 2C...\n\n2°C from what start date? 1800? Today? \n\nWhether we exceed 2°C will be determined by three factors:\n\n- Climate sensitivity.\n\n- Population.\n\n- Emissions per capita. \n\n**Climate sensitivity:** there is good news on this front, as it appears previous estimates of TCR and ECS were too high.\n\n**Population:** There is disagreement on this front. The UN projections 11 billion people in the year 2100, whereas the [IIASA projects](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140922-natgeo-pop.html) a peak of 9.4 billion in 2070, dropping to 9 billion by 2100. \n\n**Emissions per capita:** This will be difficult to change in the short term, and is a reason the Paris Accord was ill-conceived; however, in the long term, there are lots of ways to drastically reduce emissions per capita. I happen to think that advanced nuclear power, currently under development, will play a key role in this. \n\nPart of the problem with those that are claiming that we're all doomed is that they keep wanting to pretend that today's technology is the only technology we'll ever have. I'm sure there were people in 1918 who thought that same way, but look how things have changed since then. On the other end of the spectrum, there are the people who really believe that solar panels will cost less than paper and batteries will get super-cheap Really Soon Now™. I think both positions are wrong, and that a middle path tells us to not overestimate technology in the short term, but not to underestimate it in the long-term. \n\n(See Amara's Law. \"We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\")\n\n&gt;To prevent going over 2C, we need to not only drastically cut CO2 emissions, but also do massive CCS?\n\nNo. We can remain under 2°C if countries decarbonize over the next several decades. The problem with the Paris Accord is that nations are generally making commitments in the short term, but it's emissions later this century that will matter most.",

As far as I can tell, this is not the case with SolarEdge inverters over 6 kW.  Do you know if this is the case with other inverters?",

If you're in Texas or Nevada, a 5k solar array actually gets much more energy year round than if you're in Canada, lol \n\nEven a 5kW array is highly reliant on where you are.\n\nIn Nevada, a nominal array will collect between 1kWh/day (January) to almost 7kWh/day (July) per sqm panel.\n\nIn Prince George, BC, half that.\n\nSo a 5 sqm array in Nevada generates ~6kWh daily during the winter, up to 34 kWh daily in the summer.  Enough for 30-170 km (18-106 miles).\n\nIn Prince George, that same generation (minus the math) will yield 15-114 km (9-71 miles) a day.\n\nSolar will help, but it's highly dependent.\n\nNGL you are selling me on solar ;)",

"comment": "Sizing a system to get to zero net energy consumption is relatively easy.  \nThe same can't be said about getting to zero *cost* unfortunately, unless you're on true net metering.\n\nTime-of-use, tiered rates and not-really-net metering (e.g. \"NEM\" 2), where the kW⋅h you export is credited at a very different rate than the one you might import later, can make the calculation pretty complex, especially if you don't always charge at the same time each day.\n\nUnless you enjoy very low off-peak rates and can charge then, you'd probably benefit from self-consuming as much as possible, that is, using as much as your PV system produces directly, instead of exporting then re-importing. Easier said than done though.  \nAt least one vendor, SolarEdge, offers an EVSE which automatically adjusts the charging current to maximize self-consumption, but that's only helpful if you charge during the day at least some of the time. Whether this or similar devices would pay for themselves is another question entirely.\n\nI personally took a simpler approach: install the biggest PV system we could get away with...\n\n(In my mind, as long as there's any methane gas or coal-fired power plant out there, there is no such a thing as too much grid-tied solar anyway.  \nI'm glad we went that route: we since ditched our gas-fired water and space heaters for electric / heat pump, and our annual energy bill is still slightly negative).",

"comment": "Heya, we ended up going with Lumina. Their proposal is for a 12.5kW system using 31 REC panels (Alpha Pure series @405 watts) and enphase microinverters (iq8+), projected production of ~14.7 kWh in the first year (which is just under 100% for our target usage). Total price pre-discounts (includes a critter guard and extended warranty) is ~$39k. That works out to $3.10/watt. Unsure if I include things like critter guard and warranty in that price, so without those it would be $2.97/watt. Also, they use an external warranty company SolarInsure as a way to mitigate the risk that Lumina themselves goes bankrupt and I lose my warranty coverage. Tbh, I appreciate that lol.\n\nThey also were one of the two companies (Nova Solar being the other) that seemed confident that they could get a roof design to the permit office before the Virginia setback regulations take effect July 1st. Their design from the proposal already takes into account the new setbacks, so even in the case that they can't get the ideal design approved in time, we'll still be able to get near 100% usage.\n\nOther contenders and my thoughts:\n\n*  Nova Solar: Using 25 Aptos 440W panels, 11 kW system, $3.20/watt. I don't know much about Aptos and seems like a very young panel company. I noticed that their website mentioned they only use REC panels, so I'm guessing they ran out of stock for my proposal. I re-confirmed with Lumina that they actually had the REC panels available before committing. Nova were ~$35k, with that price and uncertainty about the longevity of a relatively new panel company, I decided against Nova.\n\n* Ipsun: Using 34 Hanwha Q-cells 400W panels 13.6 kW system and 14.8 kWh in 1st year. $3.42/watt. Too expensive for us. They poo-pood the Solarize NOVA campaigns as being how companies offload their old stock. Potentially valid (or says a lot about how Ipsun themselves use those co-ops), bad look though. Also had a longer timeline than the others with a worst-case of 5 months for installation date.\n\n* SunPower: Using their own SunPower Maxeon M420 (420Watt) panels. Also ~$47k, 12.6 kW and $3.72/watt. Too expensive for us to reach 100%. Liked their presentation though. and they had multiple proposals available at different % coverage. One of the companies that owned all the warranties themselves and said it would simplify any claims process which I don't doubt.\n\n* Solar Energy World: Met through Solarize Nova. However, they were using 370 watt Silfab panels which meant it would be challenging to reach 100% of our electricity usage without having to waste a _lot_ of panels on the north roof. Their proposal only went to 50% by avoiding that roof, in fact. Reaching 100% was one of our primary goals, so we didn't go with them. Their pricing was unclear. PDF claimed cash OR financing price was ~$24k for 7.0kW, putting them at $3.47/watt. But the sales person claimed that going _cash_ would reduce that price by 20%, for something more like $19k and $2.72/watt. PDF said $24k so I wasn't going to base my decision off of just sales words.\n\n* Green Brilliance: Most affordable offer by far at $2.60/watt. Their panels were SilFab 370 watt ones. Their proposal was only for 70%. I asked them on Thursday to please send me a proposal for what they thought they could get at 100% but I didn't hear back from them by my own decision deadline. Still had the same thoughts about 370 panels considering my roofs.\n\n* Cavu Solar - I started the conversation a little too late. Had supply issues like other companies that impacted what panels they had available. Hadn't had prior work with city of Manassas. If I didn't have my own self-imposed deadline and the supply issues, I likely would have worked with them as one of the more affordable price points. of around $2.90/watt\n\n* Sustainable Energy Systems: Didn't hear back from them from their 'request quote' button in time. Not their fault, I just had my own quick deadline.\n\nOne frustrating thing is that I was hearing different comments from each company on when they felt that the setback regulation's grandfathering worked. Some said a design was grandfathered into the old regulations so long as the permit was _submitted_ prior to July 1st. Others said that the permit had to be _approved_ before July 1st. Ipsun as a matter of policy had already moved over to the new regulations at the start of May. That really was why I narrowed my choice between Nova Solar and Lumina, because they both thought they could get the permit grandfathered in with the 'on submission' idea. For other future shoppers this will be an obselete point.\n\nEach of these companies was an hour or more phone call or screen share. I'm a very accommodating person so I didn't try rushing them for the sake of filling out my comparison spreadsheet (though I did try to fast forward on the solar panel knowledge parts). But just goes to show that there is a lot of time consumed when collecting offers.\n\nOne last thing is that it really does seem like the price per watt is going up for the area, with a minimum of $2.60 from Green Brilliance. Either that or I really suck at shopping solar. I've never been a very good haggler for things like that.",

Don't forget to consider what others have mentioned: net metering, sell/buy rates. \nAvoid microinverters, go straight for string inverters(SMA, sofar, deye, sungrow, growatt, schneider, siemens), they are much cheaper and more suitable for your application. and use big size panels (500+ watts). Also saving the money and putting it on 50% to 70% more panels for the same price will produce more power than enphase.",

Found an amazing deal for a house, offer was accepted for $430k with ability to assume 2.75% interest rate for remaining 350k after putting 80k down.  House appraised for $500k which is way higher than market.  \n\nAlso found out about a 31 solar panel set up that is $61k for a 11kW with Tesla powerwall at 2.00% interest rate.  Seller is most unable to pay down the solar panel since principal is $61k.   Owner also never took out the solar tax credit after we asked about it.  Kicking myself a bit in the foot for not checking the solar panel sooner since we're first time home buyer.  \n\nWe may just end up assuming the solar loan (via GoodLeap which allows this) since it's also too late for us to back out, and risk losing escrow and the money we had put in for inspections",

Roof is allegedly new from 2018. The monthly payment is $195.42, which sounds high. I asked follow ups on how long the lease is for and percentages of solar vs traditional electricity consumption to make a determination if it's worth it. I'm assuming they have documentation from the company that installed them on these numbers, is that usually true? If so I will ask specifically for that. Just want to make sure I have all I can get documentation wise as a buyer. Thanks.",

"comment": "What Freewire does will not be lost, the idea will eventually be built on in energy management systems/EV charging systems from companies like Tesla, Ford, GM, and others that will seek to enable cost savings at a commercial level for companies like Walmart and others with a large last leg logistics footprint.  Along with that will be EV charging for individuals, because at that point is is cheap and easy to add on.\n\nThink about it like this: Electric Semi trucks carry cargo over to stores which have solar, batteries, and EV chargers, and serve as virtual power plants. The batteries enable you to charge faster without needing expensive infrastructure upgrades, provide store backup power, store solar power, charge your semis while they unload, do all sorts of things.  On top of all that, providing EV fast charging is not so expensive when you don't need massive grid upgrades to provide fast charging and you already get so much of the equipment you need from your other operations.\n\nGive it .... 7 to 10 years, and I think that is where things will be at.  Sam's club would be perfect ... you stop in, grab a bite to eat while your car charges, shop, and are off and running.\n\nI think charging companies as a standalone enterprise are kind of a dead end money sink.  Charging in itself is not a good business for making money; it works better as an add-on to an overall energy management system that enables other value to be derived from the system.",

Not very efficient. Lots of waste (relatively speaking).\n\nSolar panels have a shorter life expectancy and are far less efficient than nuclear. They also take up a large area. All this being said, if I had money in solar production I would make more on my investments than if I invested in nuclear. However nuclear is better overall for everyone.\n\nTL;DR: it’s easy to shill for something that will make you money.",

It would really suck to have something go wrong, then have the whole world blame you for it because of your food choices even though that had nothing to do with it.  Statistically, that must happen to a few vegans which is tragic.  Life under the vegan microscope can be a pain.  Celebrities must especially feel this.\n\nThe good news is that this will be one more celebrity that can say \"see, I told you so you stupid ignorant reporters who all you know about nutrition came from 5th grade health class.\"",

I am largely vegan but I’m a flexible vegan. I don’t go to the supermarket and buy non-vegan stuff for myself. But when I’m traveling or going to other people’s places I will be quite happy to eat vegetarian rather than vegan.\n\n\n&gt; [T]here’s a little bit of room for indulgence in all of our lives. I know some people who are vegan in their homes but if they’re going out to a fancy restaurant, they allow themselves the luxury of not being vegan that evening. I don’t see anything really wrong with that.\n\n&gt; It’s pretty difficult to be a conscientious omnivore and avoid all the ethical problems, but if you really were thorough-going in eating only animals that had had good lives, that could be a defensible ethical position.\n\nFrom [interview with Singer](http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/media/links/p34/may-2006.pdf).\n\nI draw the line, like most vegans, at not eating animal foods, as far as possible and practical, as defined by the [vegan society](http://www.vegansociety.com/pdf/ArticlesofAssociation.pdf), and not supporting the exploitation of animals. Singer certainly has no problem with exploitation, and doesn't think it is wrong to kill an animal for food if they were treated well, and in fact, they will taste better the better they're treated.",

I pawn most of my stuff that I get off on an omni friend who is more than happy to take whatever I've got. I prefer not to throw items away, but I won't flat out refuse a gift or tell someone that 'I won't eat these' unless it straight up has meat in it.\n\nIt's easy to rationalize that these were a gift, you aren't supporting animal cruelty, etc. You aren't really harming anything by enjoying a solitary non-vegan chocolate. Everybody draws the line in a slightly different place. But you should at least recognize that you are setting yourself to make exceptions in other areas as well, and it's a slippery slope trying to justify what animal products you will or won't eat in certain specific situations. You wouldn't drink a glass of cow's milk, but a bit of chocolate is ok... how much milk is too much milk? Or products with eggs, you probably wouldn't ever eat an omelette, but a slice of cake that had some egg in it?\n\nMaybe make a batch of fudge for your aunt and let her know you sincerely appreciate her thoughtfulness, and if she is in the mood to make you some treats again, you have some recipes that are vegan that you would love to share with her.",

Cutting back my carbs and going for more raw vegetables and leafy greens has helped a lot. That's just my experience- hope it helps!!",

Even though these recipes call for certain veggies, you can really use whatever you want:\n\n* [Veggie frittata](http://freeradical.me/2013/06/20/vegan-frittata-with-tofu-and-black-beans/)\n* [Tofu scramble](http://vegetarian.about.com/od/tofurecipes/r/Easy-Tofu-Scramble.htm)\n* [Chickpea omelette](http://simplevegancooking.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/chickpea-omelette/)\n* [Stuffed red peppers](http://www.yummly.com/recipe/external/Vegetarian-Stuffed-Red-Bell-Peppers-Allrecipes)\n* [Pilaf, this one happens to be Turkish](http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2008/05/turkish-pilaf-with-pistachios-and.html)\n* And [Shepherd's pie](http://www.peacefuldumpling.com/wholesome-vegan-shepherds-pie)\n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: Oh, also, I don't really have a recipe for it, but one thing I do most often is brown whatever vegetables I need to use in a pan. Then combine coconut milk (in the can if I have it, or I happen to drink Blue Diamond almond/coconut milk so I just use that) and Thai red curry paste to my taste preference. Pure the coconut milk over the veg. If you want a thicker sauce, let it reduce on medium/low for a while, or just wait for the sauce to warm and enjoy!\n\nedit again!: [I found a recipe in my bookmarks that's similar to the one I described above.](http://myinspiration.tv/vegetable-thai-red-curry-served-with-coconut-basmati-rice-and-a-thai-cucumber-salad/)",

"comment": "First off: cheers to you for taking the V step!\n\nB12 comes from bacteria. Which is also the original source of the B12 found in animal body parts and fluids from animals. There are no plant foodstuffs that has been scientifically shown to provide reliable B12 intake so every vegan should from the start take a B12 supplement regularly. A weekly supplement that provide 2000 micrograms (2 milligrams) of B12 is inexpensive, small and quick and easy to take. Buy it and set up a weekly calendar reminder to yourself to take it. For more details check out http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vitaminb12 and http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/everyvegan\n\n&gt; It is supposed to be produced by bacteria living in a symbiosis with the sea-buckthorn plant\n\nSince it is also bacteria that produce the B12 found in the conveniently available B12 supplements there is no point in trying to discover it in some natural plants.\n\nLet us all keep the message to new vegans simple: 1. take B12 pill 2. chill.",

I have got stuff that was reaching the end of it's date at 300g less than £1. Health food shops also often have more firm tofu. I haven't tried Cauldron stuff, it seems expensive, so I can't compare directly. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor dark chocolate you can do Bourneville (not very dark at all) or Green and Black's or even cheap supermarket dark stuff (check for dairy, about half of them have milk). For milk choc bigger supermarkets have free from stuff, and health foods shops have more artisan ones. I've got some good white chocolate too, but think you have to order online. Also bourbons and some other choc bix are vegan too :).   \nAlpro yoghurt, I discovered recently, is exactly like dairy yoghurt!\nBest of luck! Feel free to message me if you like.\n\nedit - I just discovered this today! http://www.theveganwomble.blogspot.co.uk/ Also, Betty Crocker cake frosting is all vegan (I think) as well as Morrison's savers brand chocolate hazelnut spread!",

I don't blame them since they really aren't used to vegetarians.\n\nThese particular owners probably thought that as long as there's no physical meat then it's okay.

Talking about instagram, the election, and trending topics bores me, and it's sad to waste great topics on people who haven't become conscious enough to appreciate the value in the discussion. \n\nIf your friends don't make you feel good then gently move away from them and move closer to the things that make you happy. **Don't be afraid to be alone**, and be patient enough to wait for the things that truly align with your spirit. Your wellbeing will thank you for it every time, regardless of the nights spent in solitude. Also, your passions and intellect will benefit as well. \n\nAs another said, be careful not to judge friends for their understandings. I move away from the vibration of a person, not the person in general. If they can't uphold a respectful, loving vibration, I can't be around that and be my true self. It's nothing against them. If they can, and they happen to not have reached veganism or improving their lives with passion, I can accept that to a point. \n\n**Meetup is a great tool, so are Facebook groups local to your city, also going to events that align with your interests. **\n\nI live in SoCal though so that stuff is very common here. But that's why I moved here, I wanted to be around more of what served my highest path.",

"comment": "Definitely bring along some common dairy substitutes and other vegan staples. This shows that you're willing to help out, you don't expect them to bend over backwards for you, and allows for quick substitutions. If you can, make sure to bring some dishes to share. Try to anticipate what dishes may be made and what simple swaps could make them vegan.\n\nFor example, I stayed with meat loving family for a week this past Thanksgiving and it went great. I brought Earth Balance (which my dad put in the mashed potatoes instead of butter- and nobody noticed), almond milk, nutritional yeast, homemade granola, tofu, mushrooms, some attractive produce from the farmers market, and vegetable broth (replaced chicken broth in soup for dinner). I also made a big batch of red lentil + smoked paprika soup that I ate when the main dish was not vegan, though my family ended up liking it as much as their dinner and ate a lot of it. You could also bring some beans, cashews, and an emergency meal item like bagels and almond butter.",

If it freaks you out that restaurant food is potentially “cross-contaminated” with animal products then eat at home or go to a veg-only restaurant. It’s one thing to ask to clarify like, “oh does this have eggs in it?” But other than that I just don’t see how being neurotic about it helps anyone.",

My fiancé also said that to me when I went vegan. Then I started preparing vegan meals and he learned passively that cooking vegan isn't that hard and that in fact after a few months, he didn't feel like he needed meat anymore. Just learning how to cook a few vegan dishes that work for you and cutting out some of the meat would be a good start. Don't make yourself overwhelmed.",

Sorry I’m so confused and trying to do my own research gets even more confusing because a lot of food products are different in the US. I’m not too fussed at the moment myself; I get these cereals for my daughter and I’m a new vegan so not too fussed about a few Micrograms just yet. But I realised I had a non vegan spread and made a swap because it was so easy (vitalite mmmmm!) anyhoo thanks for the post!",

But I definitely don't feel like I'm limiting myself from nutrition my body \"needs\" in the least bit. I can confidently say my body gets everything it needs. I even have the blood work to prove it. I feel worlds better than I did when I was constantly eating processed meat and dairy. No question im healthier now than I was before. That was 4 years ago when I made the transition. It takes effort to make sure you get the right nutrition, but it is 100% possible. Neither vegan nor omni mean \"healthy\" by definition. There are good and bad diets on both sides. I would feel like garbage living off the things you listed aswell. Do what works for you tho, I dont really care. Just dont come into our sub acting like you know what's best for us because you tried it for 2 months and failed.",

I imagine a bunch of people are just trying to figure it out too. As far as mental health, personally I just try to catch myself if I notice I’m doom scrolling instead of learning something useful. And when you’re doing a normal hobby just try to stay engrossed in that, though it’s way easier said than done. \n\nUnfortunately it’s really about channeling the anger into something more useful, whatever that happens to be for you, because just thinking about it is a highway to losing your mind.",

They went away for a bit and came back to finish off his body. \n\nPeople are saying that's what he gets for swimming in the ocean?? It's not like he specifically went out there to fucking mingle with the sharks. He was just swimming, like all of us have the right to, at a beach, and just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nI've been vegan for around 10 years now, and I'd do this too for the safety of other humans. This shark was lurking along the coast, so it's likely going to stick around there for longer and possibly attack more people again.",

As the other commenter said but it slightly different words: I personally will never neglect my cats, who are obligate carnivores, by putting them on a vegan diet, they are completely dependent on me, neglecting them goes against the whole premise of being ethically vegan.",

"comment": "If you dislike seeing people neglecting their health, I think you should be more angry about the standard American diet than vegans eating meat alternatives in moderation.\n\nLet me give just one example of something wrong with it. The potassium: sodium ratio should be 3:1. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day, and on average Americans eat more than 3,400 mg per day. It is recommended that healthy adults consume 4,700 mg of potassium a day, and the Average American consumes only 2,500 mg a day. The excess of sodium is caused by consuming a lot of processed foods, five of the largest culprits being yeast breads, chicken-based meals, pizza, pasta dishes, and cold cuts (processed meats). Most food that is high in potassium is plants, such as tomatoes, green vegetables, yams, potatoes, legumes such as beans, avocadoes, sweet potatoes, and bananas. \n\nThis excessive consumption of sodium and lack of enough potassium can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke (as a result of high blood pressure), osteoporosis, kidney stones, stomach cancer, and bloating and weight gain (as a result of water retention). \n\nMeat alternatives do have a lot of sodium, but as long as they're only eaten in moderation, it's fine.\n\nOther problems with the standard American diet include  nutrient deficiencies in calcium, vitamins A, C, D, E and magnesium, an excess of added sugars, not enough fiber, an excess of dietary fats (especially saturated fats), etc.",
