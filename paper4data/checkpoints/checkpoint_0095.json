If the curve was once well-fit by an exponential curve, it is no longer.  It's probably best modelled by a logistic curve.\n\n&gt;Coming very soon, some are organic, membrainless.\n\nI have watched dozens if not hundreds of promising technologies that were supposed to arrive Real Soon Now™ that never did.   Why is this one different?\n\n&gt;Donald Sadoway's high temperature batteries are also a proven new technology ready to be developed for grid storage.\n\nIIRC, his approach requires antimony, and more of it than exists to be useful.\n\n&gt;Storage capacity is following the law of accelerated returns.\n\nFirst, there's no such law.  It's a phrase Kurzweil coined that to discuss how strong AI will cause innovation to increase superlinearly.  The problem is that it doesn't match observation.  \n\nSecond, storage isn't following any superlinear curve at all.  Saying it's progress is even linear would be generous.  Storage tech has advanced at a glacial pace compared to most other areas.\n\n&gt;When one technology taps out, a new one carries on the accelerated return, just as lithium took off after lead aced reached limits.\n\nExcept lead-acid is *still* the de facto standard for commercial battery storage, despite what one guy built in his garage.\n\n&gt;It's like the Wright Brothers just made the first flight...\n\nYou keep arguing that batteries are a new technology.  They predate the Wright Brothers' airplane.  There were electric cars contemporary with Henry Ford.  Not only that, there are indeed physical limits to battery storage.  Look at it this way.  The most energy dense chemical we regularly deal with is diesel fuel.  That's about the upper limit for chemical storage, but the difference is that the oxygen it is combined with is drawn from the air.  Batteries have all chemical components contained within, so the best energy density we can get will be about half that of diesel.  The critical area will be cost, though, not density, when we talk about static storage.\n\n&gt;Power companies are already in full panic mode...\n\nFunny, I deal with two different utility power companies and one small-scale power company on a regular basis.  What you speak of isn't even on their radar.\n\n&gt;There are many days when even northern latitude Germany makes 70%+ of it's energy from free renewable sources...\n\nYeah, and they have to pay other countries to take it because they can't store it.  How is it a viable business model to have to pay others to take your product?\n\n&gt;Government is in panic mode over losing gas taxes to electric vehicles.\n\nOf the 16 million vehicles sold each month in the U.S., how many are EVs?  6,000?  Even if it were 16,000, you are talking one out of every thousand cars sold.  I think the gas tax revenue is sound for a while yet.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-8.177194104064256e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.022085720968402712,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.24209182833631834,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19130236593385538,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.10637812570622145,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2776974307960754,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.006937747724199046,"ev_1":-0.27962855424993904,"ev_2":-0.02282967615368155,"ev_3":-0.012420611513031568,"ev_4":-0.03989500273867937,"ev_5":-0.011827410093246726,"ev_6":-0.055543883832190964},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other.

But I know there are a few on this sub that believe that, and perhaps certain manufacturers also believe so. But one of the issues I see with PHEVs is that they might use more gasoline than EREVs in the long run especially in rural and city situations. If EREVs are capable of generating energy over time with optimal or minimal gas usage using a smaller engine, it could allow for a larger battery to be in the vehicle, or even allow for overnight power generation away from a charging point.\n\nEDIT: To expand on my theoretical EREVs&gt;PHEV situation, here are two situations. Imagine that you're stuck in the city for several days at a time, and you can't park in a charging spot due to the lack of infrastructure around you. You're stuck with parking in the street overnight. An EREV generating electricity overnight could potentially be more efficient than a PHEV that's stuck with using only gasoline fuel to power itself for what could potentially be months at a time. There are several articles out there that show that fleet PHEVs rarely, if ever, get plugged in to charge. The second situation is somewhat similar. You're taking a long roadtrip, and for some reason need to travel 400 or 500 miles each way, nonstop. A PHEV is gonna be stuck in ICE mode for almost the entire trip. A EREV could potentially have a larger battery, say, a 70kwh battery, for about 150-200 miles of electric energy initially. Once there's only about 50% energy left in the battery pack, the Auxiliary Generator could kick in and start slowly working to slow down the battery depletion. Therefore less gasoline is used since less energy is being wasted compared to ICE mode, and there's also a larger battery pack to be fitted into the car in the first place.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","ev_1":"yes","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.20351188501830192,"1.1.1_stance":-0.10408740591174295,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.15838453601000452,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2379428872488203,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.1542413825247322,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.271609451640253,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.19390442102151173,"ev_1":-0.1318813862810554,"ev_2":-0.19044972584323472,"ev_3":-0.14268764786341762,"ev_4":-0.24096338068025824,"ev_5":-0.1027285363576491,"ev_6":-0.14245986750991732},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

As a MN Tesla driver I can attest that the winter range loss isn't as bad as you may have heard. It works out pretty well where if you're doing a lot of in-town driving, stop-and-go and it's super cold you take a bigger range hit running the heater at slow speeds or 0mph. But, in those scenarios you're either close to your home charger or other public charging.\n\nYou can get the mistaken impression there thinking that 40-50% range loss driving around town means you need to figure 50% range loss for a road trip. But it all averages out nicely if you're going a longer distance and you end up only losing 10-20% of your range even when it's below 0 (F).\n\nSo, when you're on a longer trip and there's more distance between chargers the range loss is less. When you're closer to chargers and doing a lot of short trips the range hit is bigger but it doesn't really matter.\n\nMore food for thought: back in Feb one day it was -28F and the Tesla was able to just drive off without any problems. Can't say the same for our Subaru even though it had a brand new battery. After 5 different tries the engine finally engaged. When you don't have engine oil to gum up in extreme cold an EV can be an excellent winter vehicle.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2386422415059244,"1.1.1_stance":-0.17276999851067862,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1449428006523116,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2008064627569368,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.06657160687485554,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.13718697680518538,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12118906044634059,"ev_1":-0.12594896284568446,"ev_2":-0.0025730740793126947,"ev_3":-0.05385293452612435,"ev_4":-0.14717725353936353,"ev_5":-0.20512609680493674,"ev_6":-0.242261444937661},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Of course, like all warranties, few panels will fail, but if they do, that's worth having.  The performance and other warranties all seem to be written with big margins and protections.  \n\nFor example, most manufacturers warranty their panels to 80-87% output after 25 years.  However, we have no data on how modern panels will do after that long.  Panels made using technology from 20 years ago had an average degradation of 0.43% per year (which works out to roughly 85% output after 25 years).  I expect that modern panels will degrade much more slowly than panels from 20 years ago.  \n\nThere are also some other concerns:\n\n* There's no guarantee any of these solar panel companies will be around to honor the production warranty.\n* None of the production warranties I've seen cover labor for removal and replacement.\n* None of the production warranties I've seen will help you if they no-longer make a compatible panel.  In that case you get your original money back, which is not useful.\n\nIn essence, I just feel that the panels themselves are pretty mature technology, and have no moving parts, or parts that are fragile or prone to breakage.  Sure, if you get a bum panel that reveals itself in the first few years, the warranty will protect you.  But my guess is that every panel made today will produce at least 85% (90% for SunPower) of rated power in 25 years.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0004912433942081407,"1.1.1_stance":-0.3179874600016384,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21432821449163542,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.28796095895888085,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.28240445277906256,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.17411193150647414,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.021788057677137356,"solar_1":-0.09564743480192,"solar_2":-0.018082789949403377,"solar_3":-0.07146611308902114,"solar_4":-0.18901807066807427,"solar_5":-0.005730085575729997,"solar_6":-0.07551908982168243,"solar_7":-0.01640602052793838,"solar_8":-0.019927829438529443,"solar_9":-0.04390323035303112,"solar_10":-0.04402681655725852},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/Mixed.

I mean I get it,\"Not One Person Can Do Everything but Everyone Can Do Something\" \n\nBut realistically, I don't ever see the population adopting a completely vegan diet. Yea more and more people are going vegan but it's had close to zero impact. People are just not willing to change their diet, Americans and the world in general simply like their meat and etc. \n\nAlso, you're not just asking people to change their diet but you're also asking the millions of people who are employed and pretty much live within the industry to give up their jobs, give up their lands, their livestock, in essence their livehoods. \n\nHowever having the Government impose stricter regulations, (look how much better gas efficient engines have been getting) slowly but surely adopting renewable resources, giving people rebates as much as possibly for things like solar panels, protecting habitats, etc is indeed easier.

The meat pass is great because when we really do want to eat meat, it is for a really high quality piece of meat that we either order from a restaurant or I BBQ at home.\n\n[We also have saved a lot of money on the grocery bill,](https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/menus/how-much-can-you-save-by-not-eating-meat.htm) more than $400 a month savings.  We have lost some weight, mostly water weight, and we ended up getting pregnant with a very healthy baby, which we were trying to do for a year.\n\nWe should also stop driving cars powered by fossil fuels, but that will take a while to transition, which is why trying to eat less meat is something we can do literally right now.\n\nWe should also require new homes be built with solar panels, which is something California has started doing.\n\nThese three things: Eating less meat (we can do right now), Stop driving fossil fuel powered cars (later transition), install [solar panels on new homes (needed policies and regulations but still possible), will all reduce the greenhouse effect. ](https://hahasmart.com/blog/1332/solar-energy-and-the-greenhouse-effect)\n\n&amp;#x200B;","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"family","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.05069416140482493,"1.1.1_stance":-0.545722484588623,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.013830919749466375,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2496032307181475,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.22161625791341066,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.008187784042092972,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.21091775114958486,"solar_1":-0.10077521710812201,"solar_2":-0.17694957269006636,"solar_3":-0.059440506321455665,"solar_4":-0.012017579162299322,"solar_5":-0.005872945747493456,"solar_6":-0.0018232257183020313,"solar_7":-0.015394822645854825,"solar_8":-0.006335547014411229,"solar_9":-0.0071207395497670705,"solar_10":-0.17958511695663523},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.

As it is now, the state's Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, shuts off power to cities in a rotating fashion when the temperature goes up because the grid can't handle the load of the additional air conditioners.\n\nFWIW, a typical car charger draws about twice as much electricity as a typical central air conditioner.\n\nWhat about power generation? California currently imports about 1/3 of it's electricity from other states, primarily because it won't permit new fossil fuel or nuclear generators to be built in the state. California has enough sunshine to power the entire state from solar, but it would require a mind boggling investment in solar generating equipment, and it would have to provide far more power than is required during even the highest load periods because it would have to be charging massive battery arrays that kick in when the sun goes down or on cloudy days. By the time it's all done the state would probably require about 500GWh of solar power generation to accommodate daytime power usage, including all of the electric car charging, as well as charging the storage array. I've never seen a solar generating station anywhere near this large, but I've seen a 25MWh station (enough for about 6000 homes) and it's the size of a small farm.

I've done the design side of things in my college courses and while moving to utility scale can get tricky, most commercial and residential is extremely basic and would probably bore you. \n\nMost companies probably won't take you as a designer without experience due the fact that a lot of designers also deal with permitting so without knowledge of code and permits for whatever area you are in it gets rough. The most common type of volunteer work you're going to get is basic installer and even then it's tough unless you're willing to spend a week in Puerto Rico helping put solar on homes. Reach out to a few local solar companies though. Some of the smaller ones would be great resources and you may even find one willing to trade training for side work. If you get your PE you will immediately become a golden ticket to any solar company because most don't have in house EEs to sign off on commercial job diagrams. I know our company has an PE EE who didn't have any design experience of solar and we just use him to review drawings and stamp them.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2727587966600384,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2574696405844145,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22608749919320623,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.20135415813350951,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.01560130597749776,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2796492693941654,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1957788692164548,"solar_1":-0.22351550763899772,"solar_2":-0.18940036400522917,"solar_3":-0.019096709624136565,"solar_4":-0.012663061344937887,"solar_5":-0.009052761986822588,"solar_6":-0.21052581630483427,"solar_7":-0.025873802267597057,"solar_8":-0.00654781417203291,"solar_9":-0.0705012775688374,"solar_10":-0.2526032262830995},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

Since all panels use either copper or aluminium as electrical conductors there's not much difference between different panels when it comes to temperature coefficient.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's good to be an educated consumer.

Our house is 2200 sq ft.  They installed a 14.62 kW system with 43 panels on both our front and rear roof.  Tesla was the only company that suggested installing panels on the front. Other companies only recommend installing on the rear roof only due to the non-ideal orientation of our house.  Our rear roof faces ESE and our front roof faces WNW.  While the front panel doesn't produce much, it does produce some beginning in the early afternoon until late in the day.  We went with Tesla because their price quote was $20k less than the next nearest price (we got 2 additional quotes), with more total panels and one extra powerwall (the other companies had quoted in the 10-11 kW range with 2 Tesla powerwalls). \n\nWe also installed a swim spa last March (we are located in NY), and it has dual 5 kW heaters, so it uses a lot of power.  The month we had it installed, we filled the spa with water from the tap (water was around 40 F) and heating it up to 86 F bumped our electricity usage for that one month to almost 4,000 kWh.  Seeing that huge spike was what prompted us into getting solar installed.  We are definitely one of the highest electricity users in our neighborhood, and right now we are averaging about 1,800 to 2,000 kWh a month.  \n\nTesla's estimate was that we would produce over 12,000 kWh per year, so their estimate was that solar would offset about half of our electricity needs.  We have our powerwalls set to power our house at night down to a 30 percent reserve, using excess solar during the day to recharge the powerwalls.  So we are sending very little power to the grid, but we are also using less power from the grid than estimated.  We actually turned the system on after it passed inspection, but before PTO, since PTO took so long to get.  Tesla was well aware of this, as the app indicated that because we did not receive PTO yet, the system was not going to send any power to the grid.  If solar had fully recharged the powerwalls, the inverters would cut the solar production to be equal to what electricity our house was using.  In the year we have had the system in operation, the amount of power we pulled from the grid varied from a low of 190 kWh to a high of 700 kWh per month, so we are averaging well more than 50 percent offset.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"local community","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.19533217574159303,"1.1.1_stance":-0.23631917479669937,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.04267880925883105,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19415769601861635,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18819625122310024,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.11477932597820957,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2473359607780973,"solar_1":-0.06842185420583904,"solar_2":-0.16986897685871338,"solar_3":-0.04916495574555787,"solar_4":-0.16031745099254113,"solar_5":-0.16723715000008693,"solar_6":-0.10540314797155945,"solar_7":-0.08731101398977141,"solar_8":-0.07434897432086521,"solar_9":-0.2352823305554245,"solar_10":-0.11739716241042172},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro but lack of options (for suggesting installation on the front roof when other companies did not)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"neighbors (the author mentions being one of the highest electricity users in their neighborhood)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the author also mentions \"everyone in my neighborhood\" and \"people in my city,\" which could potentially be coded as \"local community.\" However, since the author specifically","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.","1.3.3_second_order":"weak.","solar_1":"YES.

If only one, that's easily fixable.  Let them know you are making them compete. My prices varied quite a bit, and I'm in smaller Tucson.  One company quote was the highest by about 3x, I think they were just fishing for customer's who weren't smart enough to shop around.  But looking at that cost for a system that generates less than mine; it seems too high unless the ground mount is throwing off the cost.  \n\nIt says right on the sheet:\n\n* Your current utility bill is $141/month, your solar monthly bill will be $247.\n* Yyour average solar cost is 29.1 cents/kWh, while  your utility bill is 18.8/kWh.  \n* You'll be losing 10.3 cents for every kWh generated. \n* Electrical rates need to go up 55% for you to break even, based off kWh.  It will happen, but solar prices will hopefully continue to drop.  And also, it gives you time to find a better company to work with.\n\nMy energy use to give you a baseline comparison.\n\n* We used used 8244.2 kWh in 2021 (TEP lets us download by-the-hour use)\n* Our total electric bill for 2021 was $1,208.06, for an average of 14.65 cents/kWh.  This includes all service charges, fees, taxes, etc.  The \"just Electricity\" rate is a variable \"time of use / time of year / demand rate\" so I can't give a straight electricity rate.  [TEP Demand TOU is 6.2 to 9.9 cents/kWh, plus a demand charge of $10.2 to $14.8 per kW](https://www.tep.com/demand-tou/)\n* I used 1,545 kWh (most ever) during July 2022--it was a weird outlier that made me wonder what was up because we also had a cooler July than 2021.  During spring/fall it's about 500-600 kWh per month. \n* From Aug 2021 thru July 2022, I project I'll use 9,900 kWh due to higher use.\n* We have 2750 sqft house in southern AZ.   8244.2 kWh ÷ 2750 sqft makes makes us relatively efficient at 3.0 kWh/sqft.\n\nSolar:  I selected a 8 kW system with 20 panels/400 watts and microinverters, and a Year 1 production estimate of 13,880 Kw. That's about 160% of last year's need when I gave them the electrical info, about 140% because I used more electricity in 2022. I'll be turning the a/c down and running the pool pump more after solar is added, while also performing efficiency upgrades over time.  We don't have net metering (closer to 63% metering), so I want extra panels to bring my total electrical cost closer to zero.  ([TEP's credit rate for 2022 is 7.81 cents/kWh](https://www.tep.com/thinking-about-solar/))\n\n* Number of panels: 20  REC400AA Protrust  / 400 Watts per panel\n* System size  8.00 kW\n* Number of inverters:  20 IQ8Plus-72\n* Year 1 Production Estimate  13,880 kWh\n* Cash Purchase:  $19,600 or $12,720 after 30% Federal and local 1k rebates.\n* Loan Total Cost:  $30,502 using 20 years/4.79%, $127/month  (Average electric bill is $120/month)\n* **Price per Watt, Cash:  $2.45   ($ 19,600 cash ÷ 8,000 watt, not watt production or rebate amounts)**  This is what you should be using for comparisons.\n* FYI only -- Price per Watt, Cash after rebates:  $1.59   ($ 12,720 ÷ 8,000 watt size)\n* FYI only -- Price per Watt, Financed : $3.81   ($ 30,504 total loan cost ÷ 8,000 watt size)\n* All self-generation costs are lower, even when using TEP's lowest cost/highest inconvenience to the customer plan.  I have to cut back during certain hours of the day, and work to ensure as low a load as possible--don't run the washer *and* the dryer simultaneously, don't run either when the pool pump is on, etc.\n\n**3 local quotes came  from 2.37 to 2.45 per watt,** a fourth local company was higher ($2.70/watt IIRC) and a 5th from Phoenix at $9.23/watt.  I did not include any \"driveway drive-by\" or call-by-phone solar.  The two lower cost quotes (2.37/2.40) used string inverters and faster degrading panels.\n\n* I prefer the microinverters for easier expansion/no single inverter point of failure.  I also prefer the IQ8 plus series which allows the future ability to put in a \"cutoff\" box and run my own home-only grid if power is lost, in case I do decide to add that later.  \n* The panels warranty is for 92% output after 25 years, vs other installers that were all rated at 85-86% after 25 years.\n\nI chose the $2.45/watt local company with years of experience. They spun off from the #1 installer, their equipment better matched my needs (microinverters), and used higher quality panels, and they're integrated into a local credit union for financing.\n\nSee neighborhood dot com and see who your neighbors repeatedly recommend (not just one time).  Same for angies list.  Try energysage dot com and they'll get you at least 3 bids.  Compare the responses to online reviews.  Etc.  I whittled it down to 4 from energysage and 3 local companies I called.  My #1 pick has such a good reputation, they're backed up an entire year.  I went with my choice #2 who can install late September (now late October).  I also recommend a local company you can drive to, not a national company you hope to get on the phone if something goes wrong.  However, I hear on the solar boards that the national companies are often less expensive, and many people have had good luck with them.\n\nAdditionally, this a solar energy sub, but a general goal here seems to be energy and/or financial independence (i.e a fixed loan cost while the cost of electricity continues to increase).  One thing I don't believe gets mentioned enough is energy/insulation improvements.  Have you insulated your walls/attics really well--board insulation up against the inside of the roof, roll or spray insulation on the floor of the attic/roof of your rooms?  A lot of homes are slapped up for lowest selling cost--builders don't put in extra insulation if you don't ask.  Many electric companies offer free energy efficiency surveys.\n\nSee this this post from 2018:  [Why good insulation will save you more than solar in Phoenix](https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/7vo7pd/why_good_insulation_will_save_you_more_than_solar/) Used to be a gallery, but you can see how he started the build.  It's obviously situational depending on house style, but many older homes have old (low insulation value) insulation, or even no insulation in the exterior walls.  Spray-in insulation is competitive (compared to a full solar array) and that's even cheaper than \"new walls + insulation\".  Prices have gone down for solar and up for wood, but overall insulation (energy reduction), window coverings, etc, are all great ideas to pair with solar (energy generation).\n\nMix and balance energy efficiency upgrades and solar.  Can you decrease your electrical use to reduce your power needs?  For example, my current/future plans include:\n\n* Paint the house from sand brown to white.  Done in 2018.\n* Repairing and \"repainting\" (elastomeric) my flat roof white.  It's off-white now, and needs repair.  This was just completed this week, prior to scheduled solar install.\n* More efficient replacement to my HVAC (25 years old)\n* A newer variable speed pool pump system (15 years old).\n* Similar upgrades for all the old appliances that came with the house.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"yes","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"yes","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"yes","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.21705222838014984,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28693219820586563,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21678179129253294,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1725055674711863,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16118872315938512,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.23292870757209386,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.12781311990693212,"solar_1":-0.3081138012674195,"solar_2":-0.18618269479428062,"solar_3":-0.04412588576572792,"solar_4":-0.15842866445612752,"solar_5":-0.0352882740456432,"solar_6":-0.27381500205062814,"solar_7":-0.025118575009400956,"solar_8":-0.13603294656059006,"solar_9":-0.18285751334808342,"solar_10":-0.24071654180685678},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"no.","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options (wants to purchase a specific type of solar system with microinverters and prefers lower price per watt)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers (author mentions comparing quotes with them)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.

Car culture is so much of a norm in the U.S. and Canada that it can become easy to become complacent about driving — even though bicycles are amazing and more people should ride them instead of driving everywhere!\n\nWhen it comes to emissions from food, there are some good online references you should be able to search for that give info on the carbon footprint of different types of food. The simplest things to remember are:\n\nBeef ( and goats, sheep, etc.) carries a very high carbon footprint — basically the worst food you can buy when it comes to the impact on climate change.\n\nOther meat, such as chicken, is significantly better than beef. Still worse than plants, though.\n\nCheese is pretty bad, too, since it's from the same animal as beef, but eating cheese from cow's milk doesn't cause as much of the problem as eating the meat of a cow.\n\nPlants are generally much better to eat, in terms of impact on the planet, than anything that comes from an animal. That's why some people go vegan or vegetarian, but if everyone would just eat LESS meat (especially beef), that would be much better for the planet than a few more people going vegan. It doesn't have to be all or nothing.\n\nAnd of course, once you've already bought some groceries / ordered some food, you want to make sure to use/eat it before it goes bad. Nearly everyone wastes some food, but the less we waste, the better.\n\nAs for home energy — if you rent your apartment, there isn't A LOT you can do, but you can try to avoid wasting energy when you can. Adjust your thermostat when you leave (a \"smart thermostat\" can help with this), and dress for the season so that you're comfortable with less heating/cooling necessary. You can look up how much electricity different home appliances and items use and prioritize not wasting energy with the biggest-impact things. LED lightbulbs use very little energy, for instance, so you're better off thinking about your heating and cooling system. Washing machines and drying machines for clothing also use a lot of energy — especially drying machines, which is why hang-drying clothes is better for the planet than using a drying machine.\n\nThose are some thoughts of mine, from memory! I tend to obsess more over transportation emissions than other areas, though, simply because it's so obvious and because cars make everyone else's life so much worse in other ways, too (risks of hitting people, air pollution right near where people walk, traffic, waste of space due to parking lots, etc.).","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.02297131468852361,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2541025813779609,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12858262374521917,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.32234879997696037,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.17498421789393387,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2364379464400601,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.25828700955115824,"solar_1":-0.01569259634804136,"solar_2":-0.15177608548443472,"solar_3":-0.0027155388864533356,"solar_4":-0.0014867644204059616,"solar_5":-0.0005267104631154022,"solar_6":-0.00035570622761345777,"solar_7":-0.0023662034485217496,"solar_8":-0.0008196916242013685,"solar_9":-0.004617601446322321,"solar_10":-0.0228709173873843},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

This search is fruitless, I think, because there is no clearly defined goal, \"healthy\" is very diffuse.\n\nThere are distinct health benefits to veganism, of course, the link between processed meats and colorectal cancer is well-established -- but we don't really know that much about long-term advantages or disadvantages. Food remains an incredibly tricky area for scientific study.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Michael Pollan has given the only dietary advice most people need: eat food, not too much, mostly plants. (Or *only* plants, I suppose, in our case.) Unless you get something else, that'll probably keep you going for a good long while.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00038326327194226906,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25438109465737924,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.12378204809051217,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.04622987176602086,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18954726946928654,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21822001698671417,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1040340983842422,"diet_1":-0.1370473382845887,"diet_2":-0.001965295396075817,"diet_3":-0.08254723687665926,"diet_4":-0.0011731015183613636,"diet_5":-0.000573400155796359,"diet_6":-0.001283335623156745,"diet_8":-0.00019008923178868523,"diet_9":-0.0022819675141363405,"diet_10":-0.018573202048476862,"diet_11":-0.0024022218628185024,"diet_13":-0.010172412425163202,"diet_14":-0.13294414377984745,"diet_17":-0.0005145183143516382},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/Mixed.

This means the cats need to have full autonomy to come and go as they please, carefully monitored diets, and careful vetting and supervision of visitors. The interest always needs to be on the cat's health, which *unfortunately* can conflict with the need to run a profitable business and make customers that feel entitled to the cat's entertainment/bodies angry. \n\nI wish that every single cat cafe owner has the best intentions for the cats, but unfortunately we have many examples of exploitative profit-driven cafes.

Maybe supps will put your mind at ease, then take them, but I think they’re largely a frivolous expenditure.\n\n* https://www.theveganrd.com/2012/01/omega-3-fats-in-vegan-diets-a-quick-primer/","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0006788681106021007,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25605594670895626,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.18350266482481872,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1383993818114201,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.08028101309137128,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18929269906644208,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07939692853930562,"diet_1":-0.2914155864242173,"diet_2":-0.002869795794443538,"diet_3":-0.1757297196406095,"diet_4":-0.16750702700422457,"diet_5":-0.006821272044665723,"diet_6":-0.1962997114751488,"diet_8":-0.0009111555991694331,"diet_9":-0.00836558875744231,"diet_10":-0.006819078737559418,"diet_11":-0.007444353354609727,"diet_13":-0.003536590365304922,"diet_14":-0.06065098052204121,"diet_17":-0.0004971040252712555},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

I can empathize with a murderer without condoning murder.\n\n1. It does invalidate your veganism. You just make a blank statement that people should accept as fact but I'll give an example. Imagine donating money to save the rainforest then at the same time supporting someone (which you do in a relationship) who lights the rainforest on fire. Sure you're donating to save it but you're also helping it be burnt down...it invalidates it.\n\n2. Again, you're just making a statement that doesn't make sense. I can agree that it doesn't mean you hate animals but you are supporting the suffering of animals by participating in their commodification. Every time they purchase animal products they are supporting the industry and helping it exist. \n\n3. Okay? Irrelevant. Are you telling me that you wouldn't mind dying as long as it happened humanely? No, of course you wouldn't. This is the stupidest argument you've made yet. You also compare wild animals and humans as though that is the standard we should be setting for ourselves. \"Oh we are doing better than a coyote so we are doing fine!\" That's just dumb. No shit humans kill animals more humanely than other animals...that doesn't mean we should be killing them. And no shit some of them suffer less than they would in the wild (and others suffer way way more) but they wouldn't suffer at all if humans didn't purposely bring them into existence to suffer and ultimately be killed.\n\nYou're trying to argue that you would be fine being born into an existence where your sole purpose is to sit in a tiny cage, eat shit food, get raped, and then be murdered as long as that murder is more humane than it is in the wild....do you not see how fucking stupid this is? Hence why I said most people are just trying to inflate their own ego. You are just trying to take whatever position gets you the most acceptance from your peers and the majority of people are fine with animals suffering for their gain.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"unclear","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.2255975538030689,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2275044247508049,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.314970324434365,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25961771378665677,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.264864703654835,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21067430234203735,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04558622154096762,"diet_1":-0.09817659327139457,"diet_2":-0.2217992488114954,"diet_3":-0.11895674913912443,"diet_4":-0.15958464675350115,"diet_5":-0.18916061734004566,"diet_6":-0.13619291570891315,"diet_8":-0.02431285825756883,"diet_9":-0.04822298550667862,"diet_10":-0.17069185990840197,"diet_11":-0.28998067459283733,"diet_13":-0.17901652803023657,"diet_14":-0.0771098548576232,"diet_17":-0.29141734098925554,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.10632624663412571},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
