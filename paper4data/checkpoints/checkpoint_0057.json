Ecoboost was a big risk for Ford 10 years ago and it appears to have paid off really well\n* The Energi and focus EV are sold in all 50 states in decent numbers, even though it is more or less a compliance vehicle\n* They are the only company that has hinted at making a full size truck hybrid. GM and FCA have basically scoffed at the idea.\n\nI'm not sure which way Ford is going to go. I get the impression that they are like most legacy car manufactures stuck somewhere in the middle with most of the company wanting to continue making ICE cars with a few people wanting to push EVs. The rumors are that Bill Ford wants to push EVs much harder than the board. We'll see where it lands. \n\nMy impression is that EVs are getting A LOT more attention at the leadership level now that Tesla is starting to compete with their luxury cash cows.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"1","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.04193794975678126,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09897869352396356,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.22347430107468907,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2794619155643599,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.23527261707037692,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19618223132747784,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.24749459396116436,"ev_1":-0.10412269231702531,"ev_2":-0.24525910052863154,"ev_3":-0.04795135179301724,"ev_4":-0.09540539854303158,"ev_5":-0.09851547962084088,"ev_6":-0.08411710976999984},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Wireless can already charge at 7.7kW output power and solutions up to 19.2kW are on the horizon (which is the upper bound for L2), although 22 seems to be a popular number.  Yes, there is an efficiency hit with wireless vs conductive but conductive isn't 100% efficient either.  It comes down to the losses in your power electronics and converters.  Wireless is about the convenience factor which, when coupled with self-drive, is very likely going to overshadow the idea that a few % is completely unacceptable.\n\n&gt;recharging a 10-20 miles at a time at the grocery store or running errands so you don't have to recharge every night or for long periods of time\n\nExcept that's what I do right now on L2.  My point is that unless your car is regularly running long distances with no time in between to charge with L2 then you're going to have a lot of downtime during the day.  When your can can automatically drive/park then it can automatically charge and this downtime can be used to keep it charged as necessary.\n\nAdditionally, DCFC is a lot more expensive to put in and less efficient than conductive charging plus slightly worse for batteries.

On average roofs need to be replaced every 10 years (much less for high quality metal and tpo roofs). If your installer says they will cover the cost of dismantling storing and reassembling the system every time the roof needs work, then you need that in writing, and you have to hope the company stays in business for the 30 years your panels are going to last. You also have to wait around with your roof leaking and causing tens of thousands in damage until they get to it (I'm guessing Tesla will be about 6 months behind on those work orders). Many companies do not include this service in the price and charge $500 to $3000 for disassembly storage and reassembly. If you have a shingle roof, plan on re roofing 2 to 3 times during the life of the system, more if you live in a hail zone. For these reasons you might consider getting a nice metal or tpo(for flat roofs) roof that will last the life of the system before you have the solar installed. Even better, don't get the system on your roof at all, do a ground mount or build it on a shade structure. Break even point calcs need to include this maintenance, and is usually closer to 20 years. So yes it will pay for itself, yes it will help the environment, but no it's not a no-brainer, and any significant water damage during the life of the system will put you upsidedown, potentially to the tune of hundreds of thousands if you have a nice house and a bad install.... picture a horrible leaking roof, in the rainy season, and tesla is 6 months out... now you decide you cant afford the water damage and must fix the leak now! So you pay a random electrical or solar contractor $5000 for emergency disassembly, and a roofer who knows how much to fix the roof, then tesla tells you that the warranty is null because you had somebody else work on the system. Run, don't walk from Tesla.

Some do this merely by monitoring back EMF from the motors, almost anything in a traction application where significant standstill torque might be encountered use auxiliary encoders (either Hall sensors on the motor phases, or a separate quadrature incremental encoder).\n\nAlmost any decent motor controller in existence also has current sensing/current limiting in order to avoid burning something out/blowing a fuse in a stall condition.\n\nThe same things that prevent damage in a stall condition will pretty much automatically prevent damage in a condition where the motor's setpoint differs vastly from its current operating point.\n\nSome motor controllers operate in a \"speed\" mode where the throttle requests a particular speed, and may also request direction.  Most electric forklifts are like this.  They will usually have a PID loop that attempts to achieve the speed setpoint, while not exceeding any safety limits.  They may also have additional configuration outside of the PID loop that says what to do in the case of a significant setpoint change - for example one manufacturer I'm familiar with (I won't name names due to potential NDA issues) has a variety of acceleration/deceleration parameters that will cause the speed request to change slope depending on operating conditions.  (For example, returning throttle to neutral can be set to have a gentler deceleration rate than moving from positive to negative throttle.  As I mentioned in another comment - moving from positive to negative throttle as a way to apply braking is standard operating procedure in most electric forklifts, and is called \"plugging\" in the industry.)\n\nOther motor controllers can operate in a \"torque\" mode, in which case \"negative throttle\" is just an alias for \"braking\".\n\nMost BEVs probably operate with a throttle map that's a sort-of hybrid of the above two in order to feel more similar to how an ICE feels in terms of throttle response - not entirely torque, but not entirely speed.  (For example, I know I need to apply more pedal when going uphill in my Bolt regardless of which throttle map I've selected, indicating it's at least partly torque mode, but I also know that commanding a specific amount of torque requires different pedal positions depending on current speed, so it's partly a speed mode too.)\n\nBut as I've said in other comments, in any even remotely properly designed system with the \\*possible\\* exception of the Taycan (and that system is so well designed I'm sure the engineers have interlocks to prevent downshifting that gearbox when you shouldn't), giving a vastly different throttle request to the current operating state such as throwing it in reverse will, at worst, cause full regen.  The biggest risk here might be that it forces full regen even if you start skidding and aggressive regen will cause a loss of control.  And as I've said before - this is actually standard operating procedure for most electric forklifts, which usually have a bidirectional throttle control.  Pull the handle/lever back for reverse, push forward to go forwards, and if you're going forwards, pull the lever back to brake more aggressively than just returning to neutral.  Roadgoing BEVs are different in that the throttle control always commands a single direction.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-2.4834789655869827e-05,"1.1.1_stance":-0.05727808419019311,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.022909863541523617,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.03042572581519683,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.16996816602361675,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.21514419259666617,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.06717122594515483,"ev_1":-0.006005341012496501,"ev_2":-0.00020466477326408494,"ev_3":-0.0006476511298387777,"ev_4":-0.00020704700667314077,"ev_5":-0.0018579523712105583,"ev_6":-0.1921366015158128},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (companies and electric forklifts mentioned, but no possessive indicators of personal connection)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

For example if you are in the US and drive on the right side of the road you want to put your right foot forward. This is so that if you accidentally get hit by a car door that is opening next to the bike lane which most people typically ride in. Your right shoulder will be forward and your chest area is less exposed. This way your shoulder protects your vital organs in the event of a crash. And then you reverse this if you ride on the left side of the road.

I rent my current house and signing for a Bolt soon. What can I do with this without crazy modifications to the garage?\n\nIMO there are 3 options (in order best to worst):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOption 1: Remove the outlet and hardwire a [ClipperCreek LCS-20](https://store.clippercreek.com/level2/level2-12-to-15/lcs-20-lcs-20p-16-amp-level-2-ev-charging-station?sort=p.price&amp;order=ASC) in it's place.\n\nClipperCreek chargers are the highest quality units and this unit can work with the existing wires connected to the L6-20.\n\nWhen you move out you can pretty easily put the L6-20 back in place.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOption 2: Replace the outlet with a a normal 6-20 outlet and get a [Webasto Turbocord](https://store.evsolutions.com/mobile/turbocord-dual-120240v-plug-in-ev-charger-p28.aspx).\n\nThis has the advantage of allowing you to unplug the Turbocord and take it elsewhere easily, which is especially useful because it can support plugging into either a normal outlet or a 6-20 for faster charging.\n\nAgain, this is pretty easy to undo when you move out (the L6-20 can be put back in place).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOption 3: If you really do not want to remove the L6-20.\n\nYou can use a L6-20 to 6-20 adapter which will allow a [Webasto Turbocord](https://store.evsolutions.com/mobile/turbocord-dual-120240v-plug-in-ev-charger-p28.aspx) to be plugged into the current outlet.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that most charging stations have sensors in the plug to detect if the outlet is overheating, however if you use an adapter like this that sensor won't work, which could be dangerous. (If the outlet were to overheat it would probably just melt the outlet, however worst case it could start a fire)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll of these options allow for charging at 3.84 kW, which is good for about 12 miles of charge gained per hour.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","ev_1":"no","ev_2":"no","ev_3":"no","ev_4":"no","ev_5":"no","ev_6":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00039251482909700525,"1.1.1_stance":-0.25482287632449924,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20484340854607863,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2242439552581596,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.3413273881234318,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27074536212716266,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1858187826971213,"ev_1":-0.12223581893723247,"ev_2":-0.2788361431044245,"ev_3":-0.09536563349709468,"ev_4":-0.26880858047966966,"ev_5":-0.10538737826303357,"ev_6":-0.11326763639418846},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

To wit:\n\n&gt;So many rooftop solar cells are being installed that the market for local utilities is starting to shrink.\n\nNo.  Not even a little.  The skinny little yellow line in [this chart](So many rooftop solar cells are being installed that the market for local utilities is starting to shrink.) is what he thinks is disrupting utilities.\n\n&gt;A public distaste for coal [in the U.S.] is now very strong in the US. No-one would think of building a new coal plant there.\n\nIt's not about public distaste, it's about an overzealous EPA.\n\n&gt;The maintenance of wind farms and installation of solar cells are fairly labour-intensive and they’re healthy jobs.   \n\nNo so healthy for the workers that fall to their death from windmills or from roofs.\n\n&gt;Last year China announced that it would build seven wind mega-complexes – of at least 10,000 MW capacity each.\n\nThat's nameplate capacity.  Divide by 3 or 4 if you want to compare it to coal, nuclear, or combined cycle natural gas.  Once you do, you realize China is building more nuclear capacity than wind capacity.\n\n&gt;I’d need more numbers to do the arithmetic but I don’t see why with a little imagination and adaptation, we can’t run our countries entirely from renewable sources of energy. \n\nHe clearly hasn't researched this.  The plans for Europe to go fully renewable including building huge solar farms in the Sahara and huge transmission lines from Africa to Europe.  It simply isn't feasible.\n\n&gt;They are all manageable. If you have one wind farm, it fluctuates quite a bit but with two, it fluctuates less. And if you have wind farms across the country connected by a national grid, then wind is baseload.\n\nSuch a common fallacy.  If you cast a wider net to get more stable wind, you've also netted more and more customers who need power.  The places where the wind is blowing can't produce enough energy for that wide geographical area.\n\n&gt;Look how quickly the US restructured its whole economy in 1942. At beginning of 1942, the automobile companies were producing automobiles. By the middle of 1942 they were all producing tanks and planes. It didn’t take decades or years, just a few months and they totally converted.\n\nWhat was U.S. debt like before that transition?  What was it like after?  \n\nWorse than that, Brown clearly can't distinguish between transitioning from one type of machine to another versus transitioning the world's energy supply.  Producing energy is not solely a function of building the right machines.\n\n&gt;I’d like to see him ban the sale of coal and oil.\n\nYeah.  As if Obama isn't under fire already for executive overreach.  That would get him tossed right out of office.  If Brown thinks the economy wouldn't entirely collapse after such a move, he's dumber than the rest of his interview suggests.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"against"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00012944537835816541,"1.1.1_stance":-0.36164458841085434,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.05711690274377664,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11482224830736716,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.272156882641184,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.009224374584543208,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2433786423256,"solar_1":-0.009404616430401802,"solar_2":-0.02210438996553421,"solar_3":-0.0549676640269657,"solar_4":-0.002028872879842917,"solar_5":-0.0437092111290743,"solar_6":-0.08492722203178953,"solar_7":-0.0758211649954319,"solar_8":-0.0022824459398786225,"solar_9":-0.006434477269067429,"solar_10":-0.12107697625954945,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.0498377134402593},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"other (Brown is referring to 'him' as a generic person, not a personal acquaintance)","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"against.","1.3.3_second_order":"None.","solar_1":"No.","solar_2":"No.","solar_3":"No.","solar_4":"No.","solar_5":"No.","solar_6":"No.","solar_7":"No.","solar_8":"No.","solar_9":"No.","solar_10":"No."},"year":2014},{"comment_index":16601,"comment":"The whole point here, is that several people say things like \"if 99 doctors all said...\" something about a person's health, a reasonable person would not question the doctor.  I say, question the doctor, since they are fallible as the next guy, often rely upon outdated information and pure guesswork, and it's not their health, but you own.  If the diagnosis and treatment are wrong, the doctor could lose some money, or at worst a bit of reputation.  The patient receiving the incorrect diagnosis and/or treatment can lose his life. \n\nI read a wonderful book about the circumstances around the death of former US President James Garfield.  This was after the discovery of germ theory, and after Dr. Lister began promoting hand-washing and sterilization of medical instruments to promote a more sanitary environment for patients.  The Doctors who treated the President after he was shot, however, were unimpressed with the idea that something they could not even see might affect the health of a person, and used \"Tried and True\" methods of treating him.  He died, not of his gunshot, but of infection introduced largely by their attempts to find the bullet.\n\nI was not trying to suggest that medical doctors had anything to do with climate science, but that the argument \"If 99 Doctors told you that you were sick and needed treatment, would you continue to listen to one that said you were fine\" or some other such argument.  \n\nIf a Doctor tells me I'm ill, I would expect that doctor to back up the statement with some evidence.  If I look at the evidence and have questions, I will go home and look up everything I can find about the condition I supposedly have, to see if I agree with the doctor.  If I do, then we proceed with costly and dangerous treatments.  If I don't, then I'd better have a good reason for not agreeing, right?  I'm generally not going to spend a lot of money and endure painful and invasive treatments on the idea that I *might* get sicker in the future.\n\nOf course, if a Doctor tells me that eating fruit is good for me, and I like eating fruit anyway (even though fruit is more expensive than, say, potato chips) I might very well add some fruit to my diet.  Not because I'll die if I don't, but because they are good for me and I like them.\n\nThis is the main problem that I have with the current way things are being done.  There are too many people who are not saying, \"even though it is more expensive, we should start putting more Solar PV and wind generators in our energy mix.\"  They are saying, \"if we don't make dramatic changes to our energy sources *right now* there are going to be severe consequences - flooding, species extinction, famine, war, disease, and quite possibly the end of civilization as we know it.\"  \n\nI'm quite happy with the idea of adding solar PV and wind to our energy mix.  I'm quite happy with the idea of moving from fossil fuel based energy to something 100% renewable.  Those who do so are forward thinking individuals, and eventually I'd love to see everyone contribute.  I just don't like the idea that we're holding threat of extinction over the heads of people to achieve the goal, especially since I'm not seeing enough evidence that we are heading towards that eventuality. \n\nIt's as if the Doctors in our earlier discussion said, \"never eat butter again, or you will die before you get to retirement age.\"   My grandmother ate the \"wrong things\" every day of her life.  Lived to be 88 years old.  My other grandmother is still alive, blind and senile now, but still demands her bad food choices and a stiff drink or two in the afternoon.  Doctors are not all-knowing, and have been known to be wrong.  Even climate science doctors.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003865174755143623,"1.1.1_stance":-0.142307563687676,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.17621307975068498,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.1185695703021024,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.26696422867591924,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1753833977266811,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0679717139088704,"solar_1":-0.012874158943304792,"solar_2":-0.047372946353182975,"solar_3":-0.0302146844745342,"solar_4":-0.0030323843651179536,"solar_5":-0.0010662916683941148,"solar_6":-0.009155807198112598,"solar_7":-0.0029943328797041127,"solar_8":-0.002771178164645486,"solar_9":-0.004869438023888506,"solar_10":-0.08960053305781912},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

It's a work in progress. In theory, adding solar panels one at a time should work perfectly fine. However, there are a couple of things to watch out for. \n\nIt would be best if you could start off using the largest charge controller you plan to ever need. If you start with a small charge controller and upgrade, you may find yourself also having to upgrade and redo the wiring along with it since the smaller charge controllers can't accept very thick wire.\n\nWhen you increase from, say, 5 panels to 6, you might end up having to change your wiring scheme a bit to accommodate the upper limit of your charge controller. For example, you might wire 5 panels in series to increase voltage and keep your wire size as thin as possible. But then when you increase your array to include the 6th panel, you may have to wire your panels in 2 strings of 3 panels each. So, you'll have to plan ahead and install a combiner or junction box so that you aren't poking more holes in your roof than necessary.\n\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head.

Aside from that, I don't really feel the warranty is an issue - though we haven't been installing panels for 20 years, I see no measurable difference in durability between brands.  Panels are solid state with very few points of failure in the first place, and aside from one notable instance in BP panels, my memory strains to find another issue with any company's manufacture.\n\nFor the additional cost of SunPower panels over other brands, you can pretty much buy an entire set of replacement panels at the 12 year mark and have the same warranty coverage, and resetting your degradation stats by having brand new panels.  So where's the benefit?\n\nAesthetically, many other brands like SolarWorld, Axitec, and LG have black backsheets that make for a much better looking, all-black installation.  If you want to really think outside the box, we also install Stion panels, which use thin film CIGS instead of silicon and have no leads on the front of the panel.  They look really slick and have a lot of technological advantages over silicon.\n\nMy conclusion is that SunPower offers some small advantage for some users, but at a cost that outweighs any benefit.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0002610622808181991,"1.1.1_stance":-0.11169948244955208,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2475708400209745,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11330668162554502,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.003949868648078336,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.26390636498138553,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07351482360293933,"solar_1":-0.23404019917264426,"solar_2":-0.007834038401294189,"solar_3":-0.02491669968003407,"solar_4":-0.024720624045585282,"solar_5":-0.0016735451354179531,"solar_6":-0.013380514951374304,"solar_7":-0.003961610149417538,"solar_8":-0.0046426923627223005,"solar_9":-0.08082421594735933,"solar_10":-0.007188764672415952},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent.","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed.

And the quote that I got from my insurance agent for adding the array that I bid out for from our local installer was actually $136/month, not $100 - because before I went with a lease, I bit out with two local companies for installations and then asked my agent what my insurance would go up to.\n\nThe root of the question of leased vs. buy (vs. loan) is really what you think the residual value of the array will be after the lease is over.  In my opinion, I figured not much.  Already, when I put my array in I was supposed to get 240W panels but they increased them to 250W for free because the panel efficiency had gone up in just a couple of months.  One of my co-workers just put in an array with 315W panels.  This is just in two years - what will it be like in 18 more years.  I took a gamble, with $8200 of my money - prepaid up front - to lease an installed 6.3kW solar array with the ideal that in 18 years solar will be so much better that I won't want my 6.3kW array but will want whatever they are selling then.  And if I gambled wrong, I can buy out the lease at the end of 20 years and pay what's left to keep the panels and I can keep them - for only a few thousand dollars more than if I had bought the array outright from the start.\n\nI don't know that I would have installed solar without the lease - because the price was so low and I could afford $8200.  I've never understood the complete animosity on /r/solar to those of us who leased.  I would think the idea of a forum about solar power would be to encourage it's adoption, not to downvote those of us who support leasing because we think it makes solar affordable.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro but lack of options","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"yes","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"yes","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.29262408866858275,"1.1.1_stance":-0.16360586630988116,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.1711984580341479,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.19789546967834978,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.04673267263922298,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2509443376972236,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.22729297470505117,"solar_1":-0.23964921597069463,"solar_2":-0.14398956528201426,"solar_3":-0.159392270753699,"solar_4":-0.22250339115913595,"solar_5":-0.011412124780084318,"solar_6":-0.052947960129434556,"solar_7":-0.050390366047698386,"solar_8":-0.16284023929262625,"solar_9":-0.03146392540797649,"solar_10":-0.17550711568830796},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.

You need a renewable (battery) based generator that allows gas/propane/diesel generator to add additional power to charge batteries.  Solar, for example, in most residential applications, are 'grid tied' meaning they only work when you have grid power, and excess solar energy is pushed out to the grid (which you receive credit for on your power bill). Solar or wind by itself cannot be be plugged into your typical backup generator, as the solar inverter won't be able to cut on without the grid, or even if it could, you'd end up sending excess power not out to the grid, but to the generator (or have the generator send excess power to the inverter) causing one of the components to fail. What some people do to store the solar energy for back up purposes is to install a battery bank with a separate inverter. In this situation, the solar energy is stored in batteries, and then the battery power feeds your house. Some people add a traditional generator to the mix so that they can still charge their batteries in case they go days without sun, or as an additional backup to system failure. Many of these battery inverters allow a generator hookup, and more advanced ones can auto-start the generator if need be. However, all of this extra equipment gets expensive, so not many people opt for this. Solar is much more economical if utilized for the purpose of reducing your typical power bill, and not used for back up purposes. Off-grid solar sometimes makes more sense if the price to run new power lines out to remote locations is more than the cost of the solar, equipment, and batteries. But you mention suburban home, so I don't think you are looking to go off grid.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"coworkers","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0001423542998963967,"1.1.1_stance":-0.28266669142907386,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.31074417458701364,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.3299687216815011,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.07157017966876723,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.2940766150873967,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.3636783944578686,"solar_1":-0.013041481715238964,"solar_2":-0.006953399895185915,"solar_3":-0.0010584681331238244,"solar_4":-0.005972200980371174,"solar_5":-0.0008099957425050283,"solar_6":-0.00041404620969842654,"solar_7":-0.0005001207864552271,"solar_8":-0.0002937653947204429,"solar_9":-0.011293412280792836,"solar_10":-0.005087547052729254},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

How long have you been studying corals? Do you take trips out often and travel much? How much steel and fossil fuels are needed to allow you to live such a life? Should those things be reserved for those in your position and not given to the rest of us? Why? I find in my experience those who are loudest about being green also have larger carbon footprints. \n\nOkay, let me take it a bit further..... litter and direct destruction of the environment is bad. Ocean Acidification? Click bait. \n\nSo the US is cutting Carbon emissions. We would cut them even more with nuclear, but people lobby against it. Do you want us to exclusively use solar and wind? Do you realise how much steel and concrete go into a single wind turbine? How much carbon is emitted in the mining of the raw materials, transport, and production? All it does is put the carbon footprint somewhere else in the world, and for what - destabled power grids? It takes roughly a football field worth of solar panels to power 10 US homes. \n\nOn another note, why are we expected to believe that the 230 or so parts per million CO2 we have added to the atmosphere (that is a change pf 0.023%) is the primary driver of climate change? We are seeing big changes occurring all over our solar system driven by natural processes (likely from the sun which makes up 99% of the entire solar system). Why are the changes on those planets and moons natural, but the changes here are man made? How can we not be being affected by whatever is affecting everything else near us? Our models thus far do not even incorporate any variables that would answer those questions; like it is all a closed system, which it is not. \n\nAll of this is to help explain why people are skeptical of AGW (there is far more than even mentioned here). There are loads of nuance to the topic which the media does not want people to consider or think about. They don't want us to think. Those who think about it generally realise that resources are being wasted chasing the bogeyman while other, more important issues don't receive enough attention.

But it will require probably a decade or more to prove to investors that the reliability is there - so at best they are maybe 20 years out - and I think unlikely to be a player. Honestly, CdTe has a generally proven track record, low cost, and some sort of a CdTe/Si or CdTe/CIGS tandem is much more probable than a perovskite tandem in the next 10 years.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"yes","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0003691218007588759,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2126501369266407,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.2080049492243207,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.32619581564322936,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.246385494443044,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.27147237415612596,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.04984412000825008,"solar_1":-0.07267612780711633,"solar_2":-0.07795244325827486,"solar_3":-0.1116504352258687,"solar_4":-0.050669233580044326,"solar_5":-0.07400688491300873,"solar_6":-0.08798106436339499,"solar_7":-0.03669065176169776,"solar_8":-0.1516765851289771,"solar_9":-0.01312726674657938,"solar_10":-0.1582075972018894},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

Carbon-free electricity however would require either a great investment in nuclear power plants, vast amounts of hydro-electric dams that are incredibly damaging to the environments they flood, or some futuristic battery that we do not have. Even if we switched, had all of the solar panels and wind turbines we need to power the US, we would still need SOME form of carbon powered electricity so that we could meet spikes in demand and provide stable electricity output not determined by the gust of wind or sun coming out from behind a cloud. I say this as an active worker in the solar industry, it is not possible to only use wind and solar with our current technology. Unless you fancy the ideal of your power cutting in and out as the wind dies down or the sun gets covered by a cloud. Which would create enormous problems in supply-chain management, your ability to heat and cool your homes and water, cook dinner, wash clothes etc.\n\nI firmly believe we should invest in renewable energy, not arguing that.

When you say they don't buy back your excess what does that mean? Net metering means they don't buy it back, they credit you without buying it, so you can use it at a different time. Without net metering you get paid immediately for overproduction, and then must buy it later, often even if it's the same day. Crucially, the payout rate during peak is usually less than the cost during off peak so you need to grossly overproduce to get a zero bill without net metering. \n\nAnyways, the alternate solution is batteries, you store the energy yourself and use it at night, so you hopefully don't send anything meaningful or consume from the grid, but it still happens sometimes. One of the benefits of batteries is they can also work the other way, you consume at night and get cheap rates, then wait for the rates to peak and discharge into the grid and pocket the difference in price. \n\nAnyways, with soar sized for 100% you'll always get some days where you overproduce, and the way the grid works, the excess always goes into the grid, you can't stop it really. \n\nAnd all of that, I'm not sure how it would affect how it affects using the different options, especially if your consumption is near zero anyways.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.00010346534933584432,"1.1.1_stance":-0.09147167552412157,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.20050370836780118,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.25119329439466676,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.174270002588899,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.1629930385660393,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.07629034374258481,"solar_1":-0.21319888439787188,"solar_2":-0.06901421145370376,"solar_3":-0.06943168226644048,"solar_4":-0.10484670436368466,"solar_5":-0.0035288508709830544,"solar_6":-0.0007483037661586422,"solar_7":-0.008446297734432543,"solar_8":-0.002378360582345825,"solar_9":-0.04107541849800356,"solar_10":-0.1466169629735911},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear.

You are confusing base load power sources and dispatchable power sources. \n\nBase load power sources provide constant power at all times of the day. Nuclear is an example of this. They cannot increase or decrease their output much, they just provide a flat power supply. Nuclear **cannot** do this at all. Nuclear does exactly nothing to help in the times when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. In order to do that, nuclear would need to be able to quickly turn off when the sun is shining, which is just not cost effective for nuclear to do. \n\n[Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power) is some needed reading for you.\n\n> As a thermal energy generating power station, CSP has more in common with thermal power stations such as coal, gas, or geothermal. A CSP plant can incorporate thermal energy storage, which stores energy either in the form of sensible heat or as latent heat (for example, using molten salt), which enables these plants to continue to generate electricity whenever it is needed, day or night. This makes CSP a dispatchable form of solar. Dispatchable renewable energy is particularly valuable in places where there is already a high penetration of photovoltaics (PV), such as California,[12] because demand for electric power peaks near sunset just as PV capacity ramps down (a phenomenon referred to as duck curve)\n\n\n\nDispatchable is what you are talking about. Something that can quickly ramp up production when demand is high, and quickly turn back off when the demand is low again.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","solar_1":"no","solar_2":"no","solar_3":"no","solar_4":"no","solar_5":"no","solar_6":"no","solar_7":"no","solar_8":"no","solar_9":"no","solar_10":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.0010703899988584453,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2176431628775303,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21139135433143513,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.2340258257251033,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.4488032423760444,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.20215881598371477,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1022893158660736,"solar_1":-0.007391149949398823,"solar_2":-0.033366805456656344,"solar_3":-0.013344528575544246,"solar_4":-0.0024797277953136168,"solar_5":-0.007642719819462703,"solar_6":-0.000849143834784627,"solar_7":-0.0028416495745962798,"solar_8":-0.0007559387783355002,"solar_9":-0.02966871835330191,"solar_10":-0.1966662736098297},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"Neither/mixed.

Now we rarely buy anything with a label on it because it's more fun to cook from scratch.  \n\nOreos are like the best fucking thing ever, and the more vegans that crop up the more companies will listen!  Skittles recently became vegan too by getting rid of gelatin (watch out for those hooves, they're everywhere).  So many companies are realizing it's a no-brainer to get rid of their easily substitutable animal products.\n\nAmy's makes an AMAZING line of ready-made vegan products. 93 microwavable dinners, soups, chili, pot pie, whatever you can think of they'll have it.  This is a great place to get your easy meals done when you're still figuring out the cooking part.  \n\nFor easy meals that take ~5 minutes to make, buy some Island Soyake from Trader Joes, saute some broccoli in a pan with just that and then dip that shit in ketchup.  PS, ketchup is the vegan ranch dressing -- it goes on everything.\n\nI apologize for the stream of consciousness writing, random stuff pops into my head.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"partner/spouse","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"1","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"yes","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"yes","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.008743246085941792,"1.1.1_stance":-0.01669421314727515,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.14152182824824422,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.13163257235040268,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.18220602129939537,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.024451414991441805,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.1528020181770747,"diet_1":-0.02061682100854038,"diet_2":-0.08151510325825484,"diet_3":-0.017639809113461524,"diet_4":-0.16460316980287198,"diet_5":-0.010949529945113076,"diet_6":-0.08580199481608967,"diet_8":-0.0005851695365587754,"diet_9":-0.2128877490758896,"diet_10":-0.12262621970091914,"diet_11":-0.0006355462610372342,"diet_13":-0.26195875256752643,"diet_14":-0.005562010859042251,"diet_17":-0.09641825727851483},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"Pro.","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present.","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.","1.3.1_reference_group":"wife and I = partner/spouse.","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro.","1.3.3_second_order":"weak.","diet_1":"NO.","diet_2":"YES.","diet_3":"NO.","diet_4":"YES.

We raised our glasses in a toast to the historic gathering and the wonderful activists from around the country. We belted out “Ain’t gonna study war no more” and other peace songs in three-part harmony. We laughed raucously as we enjoyed each other’s company. And we closed with a congo line that snaked out of the tent. Suddenly, while basking in the warmth of the camaraderie, I felt someone’s hand smashing into my face. It was so quick I didn’t have time to even close my eyes. With goo dripping down by face and my eyes burning, I realized I had been “pied.” I invite you to see the photos and video that my attackers posted online.

Medea was also pied very directly straight in the face (see the video linked here) where as Lierre was hit only on the top and side of her head (see video link above). vegan haters everywhere have been acting like pepper was rubbed directly into her face, almost as if it was punched into her face, completely smeared. it was a typical pieing, but she has her worshippers all worked up into a frenzy now. did Medea immediately yell out, \"call the police?\" did she say, \"I don't care about anarchists?\" nope. and nope. she took it in stride and even made a funny post about it later. so much different from the humorless vegan-hating Keith.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"0","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"0","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"no","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.014657849989210566,"1.1.1_stance":-0.050411623439549656,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.21889435166129786,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.23328363225444998,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.27449889610418016,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.19158172265955248,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.005093155678575083,"diet_1":-0.03373554424615577,"diet_2":-0.004585455889658381,"diet_3":-0.047843411324720364,"diet_4":-0.0028219989168671114,"diet_5":-0.0018696306154500537,"diet_6":-0.0013645932031067787,"diet_8":-0.0006561307709489483,"diet_9":-0.0037466914606435844,"diet_10":-0.00606985002135237,"diet_11":-0.009340566979517462,"diet_13":-0.0014318423612470117,"diet_14":-0.010602835043149147,"diet_17":-0.0008434377547625141},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"No.","1.1.1_stance":"neither/mixed","1.2.1_descriptive":"absent.

I am very political generally but on veganism I try to lead by example.  I do not bring it up.  However, if someone else brings it up, and, especially when they say stupid or ignorant things about vegetarianism, then I do most assiduously defend.\n\nAnd when doing this, you can remember something Isa Chandra once said [pp]: \"I don't think vegans have an image problem, I think the rest of the world has an animal cruelty problem.\"\n\nDon't be obnoxious.  Don't proselytize.  Lead by example. Learn how to cook so deliciously that if anybody tried your food they would instantly stfu.  But if someone else brings it up, especially in a malicious or patronizing way, then be like Carradine in Kung Fu in complete self-defense and lay them to waste with your arguments.  If logic doesn't work (and often won't), point out that empathy for other creatures and resistance to animal cruelty cannot be learned, and agree to disagree.\n\nFinally, most vegans I have met are really nice people.

You can contribute a lot more by creating videos, writing articles, creating your own organization, your own website, publishing recipes, etc. \n\nIt seems sometimes our tiny actions don't matter, but they can really make a lot of difference over time. The way you vote with your money can make or break corporations for example. The absolute best way to help veganism is to create your own vegan organization, like \"Mercy for Animals\" and \"PETA\" for example. Just look at this amazing roster of people who all want to change the world: http://www.mercyforanimals.org/about (scroll down to where it says: Our Team)\n\nCreating your own organization is difficult. The next best way is to become a supporter of these organizations by donating money to them. Another way is to become an activist, volunteer, protest in public, or join online oganizations like: http://www.thehumaneleague.com/fast-action-network/\n\nAnyway, you have skills.

I'm a Nurse, I went to school and I believed in the medical model and the medicine we gave to patients. That being said, my values shifted once I worked directly with the public who where taking antidiabetics and coming in with blood sugars in the 800's still and in diabetic ketoacidosis (serious risk). Before I get into the nutrition side of things I want to ask you a few questions about things I questioned as a Nurse in America. Do you believe that our health care system focuses on preventative care or more on fixing the problem as it arises? Do you feel that you see more ads on tv about physicians suggesting a healthy diet versus a pharmaceutical company trying to sell you a drug? Have you seen ads on tv about \"you may be entitled to compensation if you had a reaction to xyz medication\". When you visit a physician for a problem do they lean more towards lifestyle changes (diet) or go directly to handing you a prescription? Do you feel that when you go to a physician they give you all of the information you really need? All that being said most diseases can be prevented with lifestyle changes and the major ones can be prevented for the most part aside from genetics. In yet, no one tells the public this, there are no ads on TV to tell you that you can cure type 1 and type 2 diabetes with a vegan diet and avoiding processed foods. No one on tv will tell you that you can greatly decrease your chances of a heart attack by decreasing and eliminating your meat intake therefore decreasing your LDLs and total cholesterol (cholesterol is only found in meat/dairy/eggs; it's what builds up in your arteries and forms plaque; leading to atherosclerosis, angina, heart attacks), no one on tv tells you that processed meats are considered by the World Health Organization are a carcinogen and red meats are likely to be carcinogenic. No one on tv tells you about the hormones added to your meats and milk, the mercury and oil in your fish, the pus and blood in your milk. Why don't they tell you this? Because the health care system would loose money. And if the health care system loses money the pharmaceutical industry loses money. Big pharma runs the USA. They have their hands in tons of pockets. Why do you think the food industry started labeling things low fat/sugar free - to jump on the pharma side of foods. Pharma actually buys into the food industry by making meals specific to cancer patients with additives to help gain weight. So as you can see it's corrupt. The food pyramid/my plate is backed by fast food restaurants and the meat industry. So now that you understand the corruption of health care, pharma, and the food industry you can better understand the articles and studies performed in medical science and the food industry. Studies need money in order to produce results so they get funding. When you read an article that states \"Milk provides an excellent source of calcium and builds strong bones\" if you look at the funding it's provided by the diary industry. If you read articles for the meat industry you will see that they too are funded by the meat industry. These are the beliefs our culture has taught us from babies. \"Milk builds strong bones &amp; You need meat for protein\". Did you ever hear a slogan that said, \"Eat kale/quinoa/rice &amp; beans get your protein\", I think not. So you can see the pseudoscience in our already held cultural beliefs. When something is funded by the industry it's promoting it's not to be trusted. That being said there are a lot of articles that are not funded by veganism that have shown the numerous health benefits with a whole foods plants based diet, one of which being The China Study and how eating meat is directly related to the populations rate of cancer, and another linked to veganism and reversing diabetes. There's also a really cool one that took patients who had either had widow maker heart attacks or where on the road to having them and switched them to a whole foods plant based diet and they went back into the cath lab and their coronary arteries were completely free of blockages in turn reducing their risk of a heart attack and cardiac arrest.\n\nSo all that being said let me jump to some of the nutrition facts:\nOur body makes it's own cholesterol we don't need any more. Milk from dairy cows is shown to be linked to osteoporosis. (Opposite of what culture has told us) The counteries that consume the highest amounts of milk have the highest rates where as the lowest have the lowest rates. Cows milk is acidic to the human body so the body compensates the acidity to prevent metabolic acidosis by drawing calcium out of our bones (where it's stored) to neutralize the body, this leaves our bones week and fragile (osteoporosis). Dairy milk is not only extremely cruel but filled with hormones and antibiotics and the cows who are being milked live in filth (filthy food yummmm), have mastitis (inflammation of the breasts - which results in white blood cells rushing into the area and being transfered into the milk - aka pus, hello infection!), and blood from being over milked. Pasturization does not get rid of this in milk and infact there are laws to allow up to certain aspects of white blood cells in our milk. Red meat and processed meats are carcinogenic as declared by WHO - I mean if I'd trust anyone it would be WHO and the CDC. Chickens have the same problems with living in filth, recieving hormones, and antibiotics. Also we give our cows B12 injections so that we can get B12. When we could just take a B12 supplement. Pigs same story. Animal meat also decomposes differently in our bodies than in a carnivorous animals body. Our intestines are longer than theirs so when we digest the meat it sits in our body longer and we absorb more of the carcinogens, hormones, cholesterol, and antibiotics. Oh and it's flesh laiden with germs. They also use ammonia to clean meats in factories. And 80% of the USA's antibiotics are given to the animals that are eaten. Now we see superinfections in hospitals as a result such as sepsis and it's killing people. Lastly, it's not something you need to survive and all of the vegans plus the vegan atheletes and people who have reversed their chronic illnesses by switching to a vegan diet are evidence that you don't need a study/article to show you the truth. \n\nI ethically can not sit here as a Nurse, knowing what I know in the medical sciences and seeing patients dying from this vicious cycle. I don't believe that the medical model is ethical anymore and this is a big reason for it. Thankfully there are numerous Doctors that don't believe in our current medical model and are actually giving patients the help they need and seeing results. I also have seen a change in my health and family members by cutting out meat.\n\nI hope that I was able to better help you understand this from this point of view.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"pro","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present","1.2.2_injunctive":"present","1.3.1_reference_group":"other reddit user","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"pro","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"yes","diet_2":"yes","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"no","diet_6":"no","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"no","diet_13":"yes","diet_14":"yes","diet_17":"yes"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.05940479288494771,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2929789621088956,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.09920953824787074,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.11381782489744174,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.20755064696572845,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.18138134368486386,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.0022309982062627873,"diet_1":-0.29110508156206566,"diet_2":-0.16293935425708214,"diet_3":-0.12338429388941563,"diet_4":-0.09041866503509795,"diet_5":-0.15204485285084482,"diet_6":-0.0538961040832433,"diet_8":-0.12411998647682292,"diet_9":-0.18047962206765078,"diet_10":-0.20885553373269372,"diet_11":-0.31777894598994405,"diet_13":-0.21522291280795186,"diet_14":-0.15772768353655972,"diet_17":-0.12295501791957329},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.","1.1.1_stance":"pro\n\n(Note: The author expresses a personal shift in values and questions the current healthcare system, but ultimately advocates for a plant-based diet based on scientific evidence and health benefits.)","1.2.1_descriptive":"explicitly present (contains self-reported behavior as the speaker is a nurse)","1.2.2_injunctive":"present.

Narcissistic predators often try to control your way of thinking. What might seem like a simple suggestion WILL turn into more suggestions by him, and they are almost always said in a way where it's meant to put you down, your lifestyle choices, what you wear, who you talk too or see.\n\n- You're still very young and in the \"teens\" and toxic men often seek out women your age as a means to control them and it's almost always usually followed by toxic sex. You can tell this by how pushy he is with you on that matter. Men like this, view you as more of an object than a human being.\n\n- He doesn't tell you that you are attractive, but he's willing to sleep with you? This is also a narcisstic behavior where he's actually trying to diminish you as a person. Normal boyfriends or even sex interests tell their girlfriends or whoever they are beautiful, whereas narcisstic ones will never tell you that you are attractive so that you don't go thinking that you have any value, or that other men will want you. They want you to feel like nobody else would like you or find you beautiful. This is a method of control.\n\n- You said you are AFRAID of telling him about something that should be a beautiful and well understood thing. You being afraid just tells me that his general reactions scare you and make you nervous. Which is also a massive sign of abuse. \n\n- You are 100% a victim. You deserve better. Never hide who you truly are, ever. You are vegan, well loved by people deserving of your love. You ARE beautiful. There ARE better men out there who will love you to the moon and back. \n\nYou must detach now. It might be painful but I assure you it's far better than enduring years of potential torture. \n\nI am a former abuse victim to a man like this long ago and it tore me apart. I became suicidal. That is why I immediately notice it when women like yourself speak about what they are going through with people like him. Please stay strong and I hope to God that you honestly run away from him.

Yet existing understanding of the environmental impacts of exclusively pasture-based systems is limited by a lack of clarity about cattle herd dynamics. We model a nationwide transition from grain- to grass-finishing systems using demographics of present-day beef cattle. In order to produce the same quantity of beef as the present-day system, we find that a nationwide shift to exclusively grass-fed beef would require increasing the national cattle herd from 77 to 100 million cattle, an increase of 30%. We also find that the current pastureland grass resource can support only 27% of the current beef supply (27 million cattle), an amount 30% smaller than prior estimates. If grass-fed systems include cropland-raised forage, a definition that conforms to typical grass-fed certifications, these supplemental feeds can support an additional 34 million cattle to produce up to 61% of the current beef supply. Given the potential of forage feed croplands to compete with human food crop production, more work is required to determine optimal agricultural land uses. Future US demand in an entirely grass-and forage-raised beef scenario can only be met domestically if beef consumption is reduced, due to higher prices or other factors. If beef consumption is not reduced and is instead satisfied by greater imports of grass-fed beef, a switch to purely grass-fed systems would likely result in higher environmental costs, including higher overall methane emissions. Thus, only reductions in beef consumption can guarantee reductions in the environmental impact of US food systems.","answers":{"1.1_gate":"1","1.1.1_stance":"against","1.2.1_descriptive":"unclear","1.2.2_injunctive":"absent","1.3.1_reference_group":"other","1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":"neither/mixed","1.3.3_second_order":"2","diet_1":"no","diet_2":"no","diet_3":"yes","diet_4":"no","diet_5":"yes","diet_6":"yes","diet_8":"no","diet_9":"no","diet_10":"no","diet_11":"yes","diet_13":"no","diet_14":"no","diet_17":"no","1.1.1_stance_recheck":"unclear stance"},"logprobs":{"1.1_gate":-0.24235598457708046,"1.1.1_stance":-0.2595770262920195,"1.2.1_descriptive":-0.23418695492295524,"1.2.2_injunctive":-0.21519613348107192,"1.3.1_reference_group":-0.2765732633762799,"1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance":-0.14453968788051727,"1.3.3_second_order":-0.2004435248688113,"diet_1":-0.0895660886785663,"diet_2":-0.20209729521351014,"diet_3":-0.08553587920587583,"diet_4":-0.0651580984776956,"diet_5":-0.13704400614606194,"diet_6":-0.19106321769778645,"diet_8":-0.01568948582886757,"diet_9":-0.04188189829922825,"diet_10":-0.1289131625647618,"diet_11":-0.08415829114922589,"diet_13":-0.018889137369114906,"diet_14":-0.13618139827642206,"diet_17":-0.01802688533643959,"1.1.1_stance_recheck":-0.05286684270904516},"raw_responses":{"1.1_gate":"Yes.
