I do not expect any major changes to occur when the patents expire because Li-Ion is a superior technology in almost every measurement (weight, volume, charge and drain efficiency, etc).  NiMH's major advantage is cost/kWh, and it looks like Li-Ion, being led by Tesla especially with the coming Gigafactory, is likely to take that away and reach cost parity at least by 2020.  Considering it takes 5 years to put a car out, it doesn't make sense for anyone to start working on NiMH at this point.\n\nThe main vehicle usage for NiMH currently is in hybrids, and as others have mentioned, many of the makes are expected to switch over to Li-Ion for their future models.",

I've heard it has excellent packaging given its size, but the specs indicate the second row is a little smaller than the Cruze.\n\nHowever, the killer for road trips is the small capacity of the range extender tank. 2.4 gallon tank and around 40 mpg in range-extending mode. The i3 takes about 5 minutes every 80 miles in RE mode to refuel.\n\nThe Tesla Model S 85 takes about 20 minutes every 150 miles to refuel *assuming* Superchargers are available along the route route.\n\n* 200 mile road trip: 0 stops S85 (0m total), 1 stop i3 (5m total)\n* 300 mile road trip: 1 stop S85 (20m total), 2 stops i3 (10m total)\n* 400 mile road trip: 2 stops S85 (30m total), 3 stops i3 (15m total)\n* 500 mile road trip: 2 stops S85 (40m total), 5 stops i3 (25m total)\n* 600 mile road trip: 3 stops S85 (50-60m), 6 stops i3 (30m total)\n\nA more traditional plug-in hybrid like Fusion Energi has about 600 miles of range with a full tank.\n\nTo me, the somewhat less frequent / longer Model S stops would be better spaced for a road trip, particularly if you're traveling with other people and pets.",

"comment": "&gt; Because it's sold a sin tax\n\nThat's how it's portrayed by \"skeptics\" and the political right which casts all taxes evil, and in particular those that hit wealthy people the most.\n\nIn reality, it's no more a \"sin\" tax than any other tax on some good. We already have a fuel tax which is almost universally accepted. That's very similar in nature and yet it's not perceived as a sin tax either. \n\n&gt;  and, again, it's regressive.\n\nDid you say that before? You said it redistributes wealth, which can go either way. Saying it's regressive isn't a particularly clever argument because *all* flat-taxes are regressive before they are specifically tailored not to be.\n\nI repeat, you could simply ease labor taxes instead, proportionally to how much you can expect families to spend on the carbon tax.\n\nAustralia showed how simple it is to implement a carbon tax that's socially fair. They used part of the proceeds to compensate lower-income families for their expenses. Those families hence were better off than before, and still had an incentive to lower their carbon footprint.\n\n&gt; The rich are still going to buy their yachts and SUV's, but the poor will have to make do with bicycles. No matter how much tax incentives there will be, they won't afford a Tesla\n\nI don't see how that can be an argument for anything, all you're saying is that the rich will still be rich and the poor will still be poor. That's true for all taxes. Unless of course, you implement the carbon tax such as it was done in Australia. \n\nIn Australia, that did actually lead to a reduction in carbon emissions, btw. The right wing government then of course immediately dismantled the scheme and replaced it with one that hands out taxpayer money to big polluters.",

It seems like the perfect way of convincing current scooter users to change with the quick battery swap time, but I think distributing these \"battery kiosks\" will be the main issue. \n\nI think charging at home / work is a convenience, especially as scooters would have such small batteries, a normal 240/110v outlet could be used. I see it as a con that they've left that ability out on Gogoro.",

As geo38 pointed out, we have absolutely no information on what the Model 3 is going to look like or what its full set of features will be.  All of your arguments boil down to how you think the Bolt is just the electric version of the Sonic.  It may just be that the Model 3 will have to sacrifice on a lot of things in order to meet their \"mass appeal\" price point.  It may indeed be in the exact same class as the Bolt.  In your case, you've already declared that the Model 3 is a superior vehicle even though it doesn't even exist.",

"comment": "I think the underlying truth is they can't handle the random levels of power added to the grid once connected levels reach a certain point.  Utilities and grid managers are constantly trying to balance fluctuating short term demand and forecasting upcoming demand (hour, day, etc.). If a distribution leg has 3% distributed energy feeding it dynamically that is a different scenario than if it has 10%, just to pick hypothetical numbers. That is why I think Arizona and California (and maybe NM) were some of the earliest to begin to address the situation. And not that the solutions are optimum for the ratepayer, but the PUCs and utilities probably knew it would take a few years of back and forth to get a livable plan so they started early.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to address that future problem was the use of demand management. Having behind the meter storage that the utility can somewhat control would give them the ability to handle higher levels of distributed energy. That is part of the theory behind escalating use of EVs, too, where their storage/charging balance can be address by whoever is controlling or managing the grid at that specific location.",

The truth of the matter is, unique platforms offer only minor benefits and for now is mostly Tesla and equivalent marketing speak. With the infancy of the tech, and the insane maturity of normal ice based platform tech, the truth is that carmakers would be far better off investing money into modifying their own platforms for EV",

If charging gets down to, say, 5 minutes, that still means that in order to support the same vehicle throughout, we'll need 5x the number of chargers as there are gas pumps currently. PHEVs will probably be more desirable for long distance travel for quite some time IMO.",

You may have to turn it on each time you get in the car; depending on the car's software.  \n\nIn standard mode, the PHEV should automatically run the engine to charge the battery if it gets too low.  I guess it could become an issue if you're planning to leave the car parked for an extended period without driving it after running electric range to zero.  \n\nHow many miles are you thinking you'll be putting on the car?  It may make more sense to buy a hybrid.  Cheaper.  Better fuel economy than a PHEV when running in hybrid mode.  Could also buy a BEV, but it'll cost you more up front and you won't have a choice but to charge it when it gets low.",

The model 3 long range is rated at 130 MPGe.  I'm not sure what the engine weight is, but I suspect if you replaced it with battery you would have pretty comparable range and efficiency.\n\nThe only thing they might be behind is battery volume, but automotive manufacturers aren't making their own cells anyway.  Tesla's Nevada gigafactory is a partnership with Panasonic for instance, a Japanese company no less.  So maybe they are behind in the sense of not having any big public partnerships like that.",

The other big non \"capitalist\" piece being massive fossil fuel subsidies&gt; I worked int he legal department of the Alaskan Attorney General's office and got a taste of the incredible subsidies we provide to oil companies to get a tiny sliver of the immense life giving profits they provide through taxes after subsidies. Fuck them all honestly. Its such a dishonest comparison and its so widely misunderstood. I hope Rivian goes the Tesla route as well and the dealership network that has been a burden for so long goes the way of the dodo. I say that knowing full well that it will happen anyway and most OEMs will prob go out of business trying to adapt to a shift which will kill their century old business model.",

VW's legacy, brand, build quality and reliability may mean more to the average consumer than a more responsive infotainment system or more efficient battery. Its all up in the air at this point, we will see how mass consumers digest these car in the states and china. EU numbers may not translate to other markets but it already pokes holes in the years ahead product cant be competed by legacy auto for the next 5 years. If musk announces a concretr 20 to 25k model 3 soon ill gladly eat my words.",

A 9.25 kW system should be in the $30,000ish range +/- for cash price. \n\nSince most people try to pay off loans early, you are better off going with a low(and sometimes no) lender fee loans. Yes the interest on low/no fee loans can be 10% right now, but if you finance $30,000, you will get a $9,000 tax credit so system net price is $21,000. Then pay off as much as you can every month (and use the tax credit to make a large payment when you get it). \n\nIn the end you will save a bunch of money and own the system",

Renters are not going to make several thousand dollar investments in property that is not theirs even if they have the money. Will an apartment complex even have the available service capacity from the utility. This is both from a customer equipment sizing and the utility infrastructure coming onto the property.\n\nI live in a metro area approaching one million residents. I know of one apartment complex with a parking garage. And those garages were built years ago so they may or may not have a service capacity for EV charging. (It was really weird in the garages were built long before the apartment.) Everything else is parking lots that may or may not have carports.",

And maybe it will have a place one day, but our infrastructure is no where near ready to sustain it.  They are forcing it.  We have blackouts now, can u imagine if everyone drove electric vehicles.  Also electric vehicles need much more research and development.  In Summer u don't get near the mpgs with the air conditioner running.  And if and when you do run out, u cant be brought a gallon of electric when stranded on the highway.  They are catching fire randomly and frequently, u don't  pay for gas but their price point is way too high which is why they're not being sold. And wait till the battery needs replacing, it's like 10k",

The market for EV SUVs is a very nascent market, and most of what's out there now is very underwhelming and/or expensive. The R2 is to Rivian what the Model 3 was to Tesla. They clearly have a high-quality product, good leadership, as well as HUGE investment from Amazon and Ford.\n\n> Good luck I guess, but I'd say there is a higher chance of losing most of your money than of it ever hitting 10-20 times its current value again.\n\nWhy the pessimism? I'm in at an average of $11. While it's not impossible, I do not see a likely path where I'm going to be slapped by their stock prices in the long run.\n\nI think many of you are confusing long-term positions for short-term gains on day trading.",

You've been loaning money out as follows for 200 years:\n\n1)  you give customer A $2 million dollars, and customer A starts paying you back on that $2 million dollar loan at 6% interest a month or two after the loan is originated.\n\nNow all of a sudden, customer B walks in and says, hey, I want a $2 million loan, but I can't start paying you back for the next 10 years.  \n\nWhat would you do as a bank?  Loan the money?  No.  You'd keep loaning to customer A customers and tell customer B customers to take a hike.\n\nThis is not to say that solar energy is a bad investment.  If I said to you, here, you can either pay an electric bill to your power company for the rest of your life, or you can buy these solar panels for the amount you'd spend otherwise for the next 10 years, and starting in about year 10, you'll have recouped your investment and you'll have free energy for the rest of the life of the system -- that's a decent return on your investment.\n\nAs cheap as solar power is getting, it still has really high start up costs.  Because of the opportunity costs of such a long term investment, there's no real good way to finance solar.\n\nThere have been some creative financing ideas to come along.  [Solar Mosaic](https://joinmosaic.com/) is one way of financing solar projects.  [CloudSolar](http://www.gocloudsolar.com/) recently had an indiegogo campaign, which was another way of financing a solar project. \n\nBut if you want to invest directly in solar, and not just in companies that make solar equipment or have industrial solar farms, the only thing that comes close as a financing vehicle are the [solar bonds that Solar City offers.](https://solarbonds.solarcity.com/)    \n\nSolar City can afford to offer the bonds because it's a huge company with an established stream of revenue. \n\nYou could be a solar farmer if you had a ton of money, and didn't mind investing all that money into a solar farm that will take you 10 years or whatever before you even make your initial investment back.",

"comment": "Quality and price are the biggest factors. Some distribution deals limit your choices for you already (for example, if you are a Sunpower dealer, you get better pricing if you buy racking and inverters from Sunpower along with modules, and they only offer 2 inverter brands, ABB and SMA).\n\nAlso, installation circumstance. If there are possible shading issues, or design limitations (multiple small roofs with different orientations), you will need either optimizers or micro inverters. Otherwise, if the customer is in full sun and doesn't have any design limitations, it's cheaper to go with a string inverter (though sometimes the customer may want a specific product, or you might want to offer the more advanced monitoring and slightly higher efficiencies that optimizers/micros offer).\n\nIf your client is an electrical contractor that just dabbles with solar, more times than not they are just going to want Enphase, as it has a lower learning curve, less NEC issues to consider, and requires less specialized balance of system components.\n\nIt's hard for installers to keep up with all the different brands and changing technologies. And it's more complicated to stock multiple brands, so they usually just pick one or two brands. Leasing companies in particular have little customization and stick to a cookie cutter model that they can just roll out for everyone. Point being, it's going to be hard to get companies to change brands. They already know what are the best brands, and they are familiar with the products they already use. You need to offer something, like a more advanced technology, or a much better price, or find a new market that works for you (like turning established electrical contractors into solar contractors).",

"comment": "Could easily be the \"lower density\" batteries that run off the assembly line. Similar to module sorting in the solar industry. If the same supply chain could be fed into both cars and homes, this would effectively ensure that Tesla had the \"highest density\" car batteries available.\n\nHowever, the point that everyone above seems to be missing with regards to deep cycling, lithium ion vs. AGM etc. is that the SOFTWARE could be the most important part of the entire system. \n\nIf Tesla produces the best energy management software that integrates distributed storage + solar array + electric vehicle, they secure their positions for tesla batteries, SolarCity, and tesla cars. \n\nIf it's the same price and the performance specs, you make your decision off additional features. The Tesla battery bank will likely have the most \"features\" that interest a consumer.",

"comment": "They're getting screwed. Solarcity's model was very tight to begin with. Offer 10-20% savings and hope that the client will pay for 20 years. With net metering 2.0, California (where most of solarcity's clients are) will switch to time of use (TOU) charging. \n\nRight now, clients pay by tiers, with those consuming more paying more out of higher tiers (like how taxes work). Solarcitys hundreds of thousands of PPAs and leases work because by reducing clients consumption from the grid (and relying on net metering), they are shaving away the most expensive tiers.\n\nThe issue is that now utilities are fighting back. There really is no economic reason to compensate users out of their most expensive tiers when production is happening at a time when electricity rates are cheap. Solar produces most electricity from around 11am-3pm, but peak hours are from 5-7pm. So utilities now have surplus electricity during sunny times and still need to generate the same as before during peak times. \n\nThe main change was that now net metering will work like the industry always has. You set up different schedules and depending on supply and demand at these times is how the price of the kwh moves. So now as more solar gets deployed, electricity prices at noon will fall more and more. Which means all of that surplus generation that used to shave off the expensive tiers will be worth less and less. And the biggest issue is that these schedules will be revised constantly. So as more solar is installed, peak hours will move accordingly and will always be at a time when there is no solar. \n\nCalifornia has always been seen as a leader in electric industry, so by doing this, they have set the precedent that probably many other utility companies will follow. \n\nIn a nutshell, customers with solar PPAs or leases will stop saving, which will lead to defaults, which will lead to a higher cost of capital for solarcity, which basically strangles their current business model. They won't go out of business, but you won't see the same growth and profitability that was expected of them. \n\nAs a solar professional, I can't say that I disagree with the utility's decision as it was bound to happen and it makes economical sense. That's what happens when you give too much subsidy to an industry. It grows without necessarily making economic sense and fails when it eventually has to play by the rules.",

"comment": "A little nitpick here since we were discussing this topic of solar on the side of buildings in light of the recent NREL report that promoted an outrageously lowball figure on rooftop solar potential once again for whatever reason while touting it as if it was an exciting new high figure. When we say that \"putting silicon solar panels on the side of a build is not economically viable\" that's not a hard fact but a potentially possible situation given market conditions which are in a state of constant change.  That might sound like I'm being overly tedious in my definitions but it's a key political point from my perspective which I hate to see casually glossed over as if it were some hard-fast law which must not be violated. \n\nMoreover, if we were to calculate the costs of placing any form of solar conversion device in less than absolutely ideal placements we would not want to fail to consider durability over the course of decades. Not to dismiss the organics but I rarely see plastics of any sort that can make it in harsh desert sun for decades on end because UV is brutal on polymers.",

All the way back to CO2 being turned into the \"waste product\" O by the first forms of life. The resources we're running out of are mainly a problem for humans. At some point we'll simply die out and life on earth will continue without us. Even after an atomic war it would.\n\n&gt; But assuming humans aren't doomed, technologically advanced societies are the ones who are causing the problems with the earth, so they should not have children because they accelerate the problems.\n\nThat's just plain wrong. We were making animals extinct way before any major technological breakthrough and everyone would without them. Third world countries are using oil less efficiently and have practically no environment protection laws. If we stopped technological advances now the oil would be gone within half a century, while we're on a good way to &gt;90% recycled solar panels.",

If you keep using the equipment but don't transfer the contract, perhaps they have the ability to stop you from using the solar array. \n\nI doubt, however, that you have the liability to maintain the solar array for 20 years. The contract is probably worded such that you are only obligated to provide the SRECs if the solar array remains in operation at the property, not that you MUST maintain it. It's not a maintenance contract. You aren't being paid to maintain it.\n\nNow if this a lease of some sort, it's a different issue entirely. Post a copy of the contract you need to sign or whatever if you want help deciphering the contract terms. Not really enough specifics to go much further.",

Some examples:\n\n* Riding a bike or using transport instead of driving my car\n* Flying instead of using a train or boat\n* Giving away money to charities doing fantastic work around the globe\n* Boycotting companies that treat their workers poorly\n* Ensuring my food is locally produced to minimize damage to the environment\n* Unplugging electronics when I'm not using them\n* Avoiding electricity during peak hours\n* Installing solar panels on the roof\n* Composting my leftovers\n* Buying organic veggies only to spare mother Earth\n* Helping the homeless and needy in my community\n\nAll those would be great things to do, but I choose not to do them, or not all of them, because I have other priorities and only a limited amount of time/effort/energy/money left over after taking care of my responsibilities.

Basically I was able to charge a Kindle HD8 from around 12% to around 78% in about 4 hours, using just the morning sun on a partly cloudy day here in Maryland.  It is said to convert at 23.5% efficiency.  In any case, I thought that was pretty good.  I have not tested the Suaoki model though.

"comment": "Its not much of a guide but here's the basics:\n\nFirst you want to start with your usage. Check your monthly bill for this. Lets say you want to generate 1000kwh. I'm not sure what the peak sun hours are in your area. I'm in Texas and have an average of about 5. Peak sun hours aren't the amount of sunlight hours. Since solar power production varies so much from morning to noon and to evening knowing the peak sun hours helps us calculate the average production. For this lets assume 5 peak sun hours. A quick google search and you should be able to find yours.\n\nNow we can calculate the size of the required array. 1000kwh monthly / 30 days = 33 kwh per day / 5 peak sun hours = 6.67 kw of solar panels. If the panels get any shade it will have a negative impact on their production. Also there are inefficiencies  in the system. I'd start with assuming 10% but try to figure out the real inefficiency of the invert you end up with. Also there are transmission loses in the wires.  Lets assume you have a little bit of shade in the mornings/evenings and with inefficiencies lets round up to a 7.5 kwh system.\n\nNow you can start selecting your inverter. It needs to be able to put out split phase 240v and 7.5 kw's (for this example). I'm not too familiar with grid tied inverters so I don't have much more info. One thing though is sometimes it makes sense to over size the array and under size the inverter to maximize output and keep costs lower. So maybe we put up 8 kw's of solar but still stick with a 7,5 kw inverter. We might have a couple of hours where the inverter is limiting the power but the majority of the day the output from the panels is no where near their rated amount so little power is lost.\n\nFor the solar panels themselves, don't go with the small 100w panels. You want the larger kind as they are most cost effective and are intended for systems like this. Most people I've heard from go with 250w+ size panels. It really depends on what you can get a good deal on and what fits your location. Pretty much every panel should last 20-30 years without any issues.\n\nI hope I've helped give some direction for you without creating too much confusion.",

"comment": "I believe so, and on the Tesla website you can order up to 10 Powerwalls in a single installation, so that tells me they are designed to work quite well together.\n\nJust do your sums - the Powerwalls come with I believe a 10 year warranty, which means after 10 years they are probably getting close to the end of their life.  So divide the cost by 120 months to work out what you're effectively looking at each month.\n\nTwo Powerwalls will give you either 24 hours of power or 12 hours with more powerful devices able to be powered (dryer, microwave, etc.)  It's a lot of money for battery capacity you might not use though.  You will probably get more benefit by putting the money into more solar panels instead.\n\nThe reason for this is that if your panels take a day to charge the Powerwall (along with providing you power during the day) then you'll have continuous power as long as it's sunny - panels by day, batteries by night.  But if it's cloudy and your panels are only providing 50% power, then your Powerwall won't fully charge from the night before and you'll go without power for a few hours the next night after it goes flat.  Adding a second Powerwall won't help if there's not enough sun to charge it up - you might be able to last for one whole cloudy day without grid power by having a second Powerwall, but a week of rain?  You'll need 10 Powerwalls to ride that out on batteries!\n\nBut instead if you (for example) put in twice as many solar panels, then it means your Powerwall might fully charge in only an hour - which of course seems pointless until you get a cloudy day, the panels are running at 50% or less, but you can still charge everything up within a day, and so have power all night as well.  This will give you a better chance of having uninterrupted power, because you'll be able to capture more power from less sunlight.",

I’d stick with sunnova, sunrun, horizon, or baker electric. Sunrun is probably the best. I don’t recommend going with a mom and pop like planet solar if you’re going to lease or get a ppa. In 3 years, all the mom and pops will disappear because the market will be too saturated with solar and only the top handful will have the ability to service. The mom and pops will sell your service to another company that you won’t have a choice in choosing. Feel free to ask me any questions if you want to make sure you’re getting a good deal.",

The rate depends on when it was certified, but I get paid about 1/3 the price per unit I'm charged for import. Once you're on a given rate it's index linked for 30 years.\n\nPayback is less than ten years, and would go up if I also paid for storage, but down if I got another ev.\n\nNet metering is a awesome deal for the consumer, but long term I think demand side management has to be the solution.",

I don't mind paying a little more for quality but damn.  \n\nHe said the price difference is largely due to the efficiency rating of the panels.  He said, because I wanted maximum power but limited space, he quoted me with the second most expensive panels they have.    If I was willing to drop my power requirement to say \\~11,000kwh.\n\nHe also said he was skeptical over solarZ trying to fit 23 LG panels.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked the SunPower guy to use the panels with the best \"bang for your buck\".  \n\nthis is what I got\n\n[https://www.screencast.com/t/uPCsupK2Js](https://www.screencast.com/t/uPCsupK2Js) &lt;panels and production\n\n[https://www.screencast.com/t/7coYegSS](https://www.screencast.com/t/7coYegSS) &lt;pricing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am down to 18699. that seems a whole lot better, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said that while SolarZ's production estimates are a little higher but the SunPower panels hold up better against heat and its energy production stay pretty consistent.

"comment": "The total solar array is 10 kW, which means 10 kW in the unlikely situation that the sun is *directly* overhead (so we're within a few hundred miles of the equator and it's the right time of year and it's noon), it's not cloudy, and the panels are clean, it actually produces 10 kW. OK, let's assume it's noon, we're using zero extra power to do anything else on board like run that water distillation or anything else, and all of the power from the solar array is going to the engine. That's going to give you... 14 horsepower, which is a low-end riding lawnmower. That's great for a bass boat on a lake; that's not going to propel this forty-foot houseboat across oceans very quickly. They tout \"no noise or vibration\"-- yeah, I bet, because that's kind of underpowered for a boat this size.\n\nBut OK, the engines are rated for 20 kW, which we'll call 30 horsepower because I'm rounding up. (So now it's a high-end riding lawnmower, or a pretty decent motor for a small lake boat.) So let's imagine that between battery and solar panels we can run at full power for 6 hours. I'm figuring 6 hours x 10 kW from the solar panels (as previously mentioned, that's imaginary and you will never actually get that much for more than an hour a day) and 6 hours pulling 10 kW from the battery, which is the entire capacity of the battery. Let's further assume that there's an additional 8 hours of cruising under less-than-ideal solar conditions (you know, morning and afternoon where the sunlight isn't square on the panels) where you can cruise at maybe 8 kW. I suspect this is where the \"more than 100 nautical miles (185 km) in a single day without stopping\" claim comes from. That's a 14 hour day and at the end of it you're drifting with a flat battery, in the dark. Fine if you made it to your next port; kinda shitty if you're in the middle of the ocean. When the sun comes up the next day, you're not going to be able to go anywhere near as far or as fast because you started the day with a full battery.\n\nThe other claim is \"Azura Marine claims that the vessel can continuously cruise thanks to its large 10 kW solar power system and 60 kWh battery pack.\" And frankly, I cannot square this with the other claim about a day's range unless I assume we're cruising at way, way less than full power. Let's imagine that solar panel puts out full power for an entire 12-hour day. (This is beyond imaginary without an array of panels that tracks the sun, which would be *monumentally* stupid on this boat because they'd act as a sail and get ripped off in surprisingly light winds.) That's 120 kWH to work with. We've got 24 hours in this \"continuously cruising\" day, so we're cruising at only 5 kW, and further assuming that we use zero power for absolutely anything else. \n\nI think what bugs me about this article is that they're pushing this as a \"crossing oceans\" craft, which it would be *terrible* at unless by \"crossing oceans\" we mean \"island hopping in an archipelago where you're rarely out of sight of land\". It's probably no accident they unveiled it in Bali, where it might be worth something to hop tourists from island to island for a week, though you'd almost certainly need to plug it in every single night. What they've actually built here is a pretty kick-ass houseboat. This would be amazing on a big flat inland lake, or in a bay. (I know live-aboards in the San Francisco Bay who'd die for this thing.) The harbormaster might get pissed if you're constantly pulling 1500 watts to charge the thing, but why bother-- you can probably go five or six days without moving it.\n\nFurthermore, why is the battery pack so *small*? 60 kWH is medium-sized for a car. This thing is three times as long and costs ten times as much as most non-sports-car EVs; if you actually wanted to do any travel longer than a single day from port to port, it should have at least 200 kWH. There's a shitload of room on board to hold it compared to a car. Up the price to $550,000 and have a real battery in that thing.",

"comment": "There are two sources of food we CAN use – animal and plant matter, and our dietary choices have to be somewhere on the spectrum between 100% Plant-Based diet and 100% Animal based diets. Both require taking life, but until humans are able to affix solar panels to our heads to photo synthesize like plants, we’re stuck with the dilemma.\n\nWhen you abstract the process like that then sure, they’re very similar, but would you also walk into a confession in church and say ‘Sorry Daddy, I’ve been very naughty,’ instead of ‘Forgive me Father, for I have sinned?’ These things might, by definition, mean the same thing, but reality and common sense dictate otherwise. Most folks will intuitively feel very different watching wheat get harvested, vs watching a pig squeal in fear and pain as it’s getting gassed.\n\nWe know for a fact that pigs, chickens and cows feel pain: we don’t *need* to do any studies to to find out if *if* pig, chickens and cows feel pains. Of course they do: their screams are similar enough to human screams that we know intuitively they’re experiencing agony.\n\nOf course, we shouldn’t discount the possibility of plants feeling pain. I’m not familiar with science behind plant conscious/sentience, but I doubt it’s going to be as simple as ‘plants feel pain, just like us. Surely it’d be on a spectrum? Plants have no ability to respond to stimuli immediately like mammals do, , so feeling pain as acutely as a mammal does … doesn’t seem like it’s in the plant’s evolutionary  best interest?\nLike, I said, I don’t know much about the subject so if I’m wrong here, lmk. \n\nBut even hypothetically if plants DID feel the agony of being harvested as much as animal might feel the agony of getting their throats cut open, we should IMO, aim to reduce that suffering as much as possible by eating more fruit* – the parts of plants they probably want to be eaten – and not harvesting so much plant life to then feed to animals to then feed us. We might never be able to switch to a fruit/photosynthesis-based diet, but we can do the best we we’re able with the tools we have.\n\nJust my $0.02.\n\n*there is a diet called fruitarianism, where people just like, eat fruit and water. AFAIK this isn’t healthy, and most of the ‘why I’m no longer vegan’ videos I’ve seen on YouTube we’re actually fruitarians.",

"comment": "Just got my Tesla solar + Powerwall X2 on Earth Day... today I was 81% offset from grid.  Powerwalls are baked into my loan, so my thought is that it makes sense to have them on a monthly basis, as without them, you have more times where grid needs to supplement the sun, and roll the meter for the utility.  I’ll keep people posted on how it actually plays out, but I do love that when the sun peaks behind a cloud, Powerwall jumps in to keep you off grid.  I don’t think anyone is wrong here, but interested to do some cost analysis after my first month and plan to share!  \n\nFull disclosure- I have worked for Tesla on the automotive side for 7.5 yrs",

"comment": "One week after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency could not regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants because the agency lacks congressional authorization to do so, the Biden Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a rule targeting CO2 emissions from highway vehicles, for which DOT also has no legal authority.\n\nDOT’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is proposing a rule that would require states and municipalities to “track and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions on their highways.” In keeping with a regulatory tradition that is as longstanding as it is misleading, DOT assures the public that the “carbon reduction program” contained in the rule will be “flexible,” allowing state DOTs and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to “set their own targets”.That flexibility quickly disappears, however, when the DOT adds that the declining targets must “align” with the Biden administration’s “net-zero targets” as outlined in two executive orders and commitments made at the International Leaders Climate Summit.\n\n➖ The scheme to have state DOTs and metropolitan planning organizations set ever-declining targets for emissions from on-road vehicles has no basis in law. Congress has never instructed DOT to take any such step. As close as it came were a few provisions in last year’s bipartisan infrastructure bill which established a few CO2 emissions-reduction programs at DOT. But nowhere in that legislation was DOT granted the authority to require vehicular emissions targets, much less targets that serve any “net-zero” goal.\n\n…..\n\nDoing away with conventionally-powered automobiles, and replacing them with EVs, has been part of the Biden administration’s larger war on fossil fuels. While sales of EVs continue to creep up, so do their prices, keeping them well beyond the reach of ordinary Americans. The cost of the raw materials that go into EV batteries continues to soar, and the recharging infrastructure needed to support the millions of EVs said soon to be zipping down our highways is barely in its infancy.\n\nNeither the Biden administration nor the automakers thumping their chests over their embrace of EVs have offered any realistic explanation for where the electricity for all these EVs will come from in a post-fossil-fuel world. Certainly not from wind mills and solar panels. Nor has sufficient thought been given to how today’s already shaky grid is going to hold up under the stress of providing power to a growing number of EVs.\n\n➖➖➖\n\nIt does seems as if the Biden administration can use a lesson in US Civics.\n\n—Charles Rotter",

No, I am not a denier. Rather, I am not willing to panic just yet. \n\nOn the other hand, I have owned EVs for just shy of a decade, now, and love them. I own a Nissan Leaf, charge it with the solar panels on my roof. I have several electric bicycles and escooters, and have reservations in for a Cycbertruck, but will buy a Ford Lightning F-150 instead if it comes available first. When the Leaf dies, I’m thinking of replacing it with an Aptera.\n\nThis is indeed a culture war. The left has vilified Conservatives so harshly that we have “circled the wagons” so to speak. I’m vilified for the circumstances of my birth, factors that I had no control over. I was born a straight white male person in the South. For that, I have been made “the enemy” by the left. I’m the example you guys point to for every perceived Ill in this nation. I don’t hate anyone, but I’m regularly accused of hatred and hate speech when I say things about the world, even things that would get agreement if I’d been a minority, female, gay or anything but what I am. \n\nYou want Conservatives to buy products you like?

"comment": "Toyota (seriously they were so far ahead of everyone else) did it but only to run a circulation fan in their cars on the 12V system because they knew the cost of hooking it into the battery system was more of a likely parasitic drain on the traction battery.\n\nA major problem with small solar arrays is developing the voltage to actually initiate charge on the traction battery.  Remember most modern systems are between 300 and 800 volts and even with transformers its hard to get small scale photovoltaics to get above the threshold to initiate charging.",

I'm on long island, different utility, but that plan would have me paying $250/mo after installing solar until it was recalculated and then it would probably have recalculated at $100/mo for the following year.\n\nYou have net metering in NY, your bill is going to immediately go down to lower than whatever your balanced bill was, and if you have over 100% offset it's going to be flat anyways by May and stay flat forever. Balanced billing will make you pay extra for nearly two years, build some massive credit, and generally just make your bills not balanced. It's very counter intuitive, but you pay way less without it.",

Western countries need to bolster their grid with more power plants to support EV's.  Solar panels and turbines are relatively useless until R&D for energy storage catches up. if WW3 does not break out over the next decade so we countries can invest money into R&D, maybe some good news in 15-20 years. those who are capable should move to countries that won't be as impacted.",

"comment": "Lentils with rice is a cheap and potentially yummy way to get protein, as well as a lot of other good nutrients.  There are a million ways to cook variations on the two and it is popular in parts of the Middle East, Africa and India.  For example, [Dhal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal).\n\nStill, as long as your diet is varied and includes some nuts, legumes, vegetables and grains you will probably be fine on protein.  Here is some more \"official\" info:\n\n&gt;The main protein foods in a vegan diet are the pulses (peas, beans and lentils), nuts, seeds and grains, all of which are relatively energy dense. As the average protein level in pulses is 27% of calories; in nuts and seeds 13%; and in grains 12%, it is easy to see that plant foods can supply the recommended amount of protein as long as the energy requirements are met.\n\n&gt;The 1988 position paper of the American Dietetic Association emphasized that, because amino acids obtained from food can combine with amino acids made in the body it is not necessary to combine protein foods at each meal. Adequate amounts of amino acids will be obtained if a varied vegan diet - containing unrefined grains, legumes, seeds, nuts and vegetables - is eaten on a daily basis.

"comment": "&gt; Do you believe that pet owners keep dogs captive and exploit them for companionship? Or is it a mutually beneficial relationship?\n\nFirst off, I don't think those two things are exclusive. You can exploit someone and they still derive a benefit from the situation. However, that does not mean that it justifies that exploitation.\n\nI do believe that the reason so many domesticated animals are in human homes is because people want them there for their companionship and amusement. Because the animals almost never get a real choice in the matter, that is exploitation. It is exploitation from the moment they were born, suffering from generations of selective breeding to make them more fit for us but not for their own health and happiness. They have been made more and more dependent on us so that even if they were not kept by leash and fence, their own bodies betray them. And it is certainly wrong that their mothers are made to breed only to have their babies taken away. Even if the best of situations and \"backyard breeders\", the pet industry is cruel and unnecessary.\n\nThat said, I do believe it is important to distinguish between buying/breeding pets and adopting/rescuing homeless animals first and foremost *for their own sakes* because they would otherwise be killed. Such is the system that they can't just be let loose to live on their own. We created them to live in our world, which was cruel and unjust. Now, we owe them what life they can lead in it, imperfect though it is. Rescuing animals, therefore, is a very vegan action. However, we should do so in ways that minimize suffering to the animals involved, feed them vegan food if reasonably possible (much easier for dogs and herbivores than for cats), and be sure that others know the difference between pets and rescues so that we do not accidentally encourage them to go out and buy animals.\n\nI hope that helps clear things up!",

"comment": "I don't think anyone thinking critically about the situations could deny that there are similarities between animal exploitation and human slavery.  However, I feel very strongly that such comparisons do a lot to undermine the argument for veganism.\n\nMost of the problem is that the comparisons are often used in a simplified argument that *owning animals is like slavery; slavery is wrong; therefore owning animals is wrong*.  For this argument to succeed it *does* have to equate owning animals with slavery, because it's using the wrongness of one to imply the wrongness of the other.  Because most people will deny that the two are equal, non-vegans are not going to be convinced of anything.\n\nSo, why bring it up at all?  Focus on those things that are different between the two situations, the points that stop non-vegans from abandoning the thought that: *owning animals is not like slavery; therefore it's okay*, in favor of *owning animals is wrong for reasons X, Y, and Z; therefore it's not okay*.  Those reasons can include points that are common with reasons slavery is wrong, but outright comparison to human slavery should be avoided for maximum argument winningness.  \n\n*edit for full disclosure: I'm not a vegan, but have been considering becoming vegan.",

"comment": "my sister lived in japan for a couple of years they hide pork mostly as broth in things you wouldn't expect like veggie soups and you will be hard pressed not to find things that have fish in them its flavor they like. to stay vegan you would have to shop at the store buy whole foods and make hem yourself that's what I do at home I don't trust people to make food to my standards. I would give some thought to putting being vegan on hold so that you don't feel like you limited your experience to enjoy the Japanese culture for what it is without bringing your values. its a whole different flavor palate you might like something new like mayo and shrimp Doritos sis came back loving those to adventurous for me lol.",

"comment": "This is bullshit and unavoidable.  The bullshit is that people go out of their way to tell you how vegan they are.  The unavoidable part is people telling you they're vegan.  Why would that possibly be unavoidable?  Let me break it down for you.  \n\nIf you hang out with someone for more than a few hours, what are you likely to eventually do during that time?  If you work with someone and get to know them, what will you likely do with them from time to time?  When you're at a party, gathering, function, conference, etc., what is one thing you're going to do?  Answer to all of the above: Eat together!\n\nBut when someone with an \"abnormal\" diet (vegan) eats with people unaware of the diet, they will at some point ask questions about why you're ordering weird food, why you're giving the waiter restrictions, why you are or aren't eating certain things available to you.  You can start by just saying you don't eat meat/dairy.  They'll then ask why.  Then you say you're vegan.  They'll (very) often continue prodding and ask why you're vegan.  Now, you've told them what you do/don't eat, that you're vegan, why you're vegan, what drove you to make the change, and so on and so forth.  And this is only from you answering their questions as simply and concisely as possible.  There's nothing wrong with them asking questions, unless they're a dick about it or they then go on to say how preachy you sound.\n\nTL;DR  Vegans eat vegan food.  In their company, others ask about it and sometimes call vegans preachy after receiving concise answers to their own questions.",

I don't buy eggs from the store, I don't buy meat, I overpay for just about everything I buy since I have to get a lot of crap at Whole Foods (i.e agar agar). So I don't see why this would even be an issue.\n\n/rant",

Often times it is not going to be easy but the challenges I've experienced due to veganism are the most meaningful to have! :) \n\nLike other suggested lentils and beans are very cheap and tasty. They are also very versatile and you can make a lot of dishes out of them.\n\nMy personal favourite is tempeh. You can use it as a replacement in the meat dishes you've been used to, like stir fries. You can also marinate it in soy sauce and garlic and pan fry them. You can use them as burger patties as well!",

Most studies I heard about said 'ANY amount [of animal products] is bad for you', and like smoking it is simply a statistical game, if you're really unlucky your first bite/smoke will actually kill you (by triggering cancer). \n\nWith regards to the arterial plaque I spoke about earlier, thats of course a build-up that requires a more ongoing stream of animal products since effectively it needs to build up faster than the body can cleanse. (the Ornish and Barnard studies show that switching to fully plant-based diet will actually reduce plaque!). My very wild and mostly unfounded guess therefore probably 10 grammes per day will be cleanable by your body, given that the 'normal' amount of meat (100g/day) builds your plaque at a rate that starts to become mortally dangerous at say 55yo\n\nTL;DR: It's all a matter of how fast you're willing to speed towards a more and more crappy health, and given that being fully plant-based can heal you at a certain rate, best guess is 10grammes of animal products a day.",

I believe we can do more good by saying that every bit of abstinence from animal farming counts, rather than saying only total abstinence is acceptable. I'll agree though, oddly enough: only total abstinence is acceptable, but I'm not winning many hearts &amp; minds with that attitude methinks. Veganism is the right thing to do, but we need to accept that ethical progress happens one step at a time. If someone is vegan 50% of the time, I'm more interested in saying that's great that they at least care that much, than I am interested in saying that's not good enough. \"That's not enough: you're doing a bad thing.\" -That attitude, I believe, turns people off. Now, Gary Yourofsky preaches a total abstinence approach &amp; he has done a whole lot of good with his lectures it seems. \n\nAnyway, I don't need to praise animal farming at all in order to, again, accept that progress happens a step at a time. Abolition is right, but putting people's back up &amp; telling them that it's all or nothing isn't always the best approach. We need to be politically savvy: whatever works best to advocate veganism is best, &amp; I'm sceptical about the \"abolitionist approach\". I'm an abolitionist but if someone say they're trying to eat fewer animal products, I'm not going to say, \"That's not good enough.\"\n\nedit: I asked the executive director of The Humane League that exact question at the Atlanta VegFest &amp; he gave a pretty good answer, ~41:15, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyuO0kqpd7k",

"comment": "I know there are conflicting views on this, and I completely respect all sides of this argument. I do purchase items that were created using animal products from second hand stores. Often, I purposefully look for items that are very outdated and out of \"style\" and bring them home to re-purpose into something new. \nI have ethical reasons for doing this, as well as personal ones. For example, I have seen so many leather and fur items tossed into dumpsters and on the sides of roads (think old leather couches) destined for landfills. Knowing that I can do something to help with an environmental issue like the amount of \"trash\" we've accumulated feels really good to me. I also hate the idea of an animal being killed for it's skin, only to be tossed out a season later because that jacket or purse isn't in style anymore. Recreating or using those items feels like a way to respect that life and make sure it isn't forgotten. \nAlso, I work as a naturalist and am often around the bones, fur, and skin of many wild animals. I would never support the hunting or killing of any animal (I could rant for hours about how much I hate trophy hunting). At the same time, if there is a way to have those remains on display for education, whether through natural deaths or by purchasing them second hand, I think there is a lot of good that can come from people gaining experience and knowledge in a tangible way.\nI know there are plenty of others in the vegan community who wouldn't purchase or own any animal products secondhand or even things they owned pre-veganism. That's really great for them, and I admire their commitment to the cause and to ensure no one can accuse them of being hypocritical. At the end of the day, it's not at all a black and white choice. Ask yourself questions, do some research, consider the many other issues connected to humanity's use of other living things, and know that even the littlest steps towards compassion towards all life are accomplishments to be celebrated.",

We can only hope that they will see their hypocrisy, but many people will gladly change their morals rather than behavior.  But that's on them.  Vegans can't be afraid to point out hypocrisy for fear of shifting goalposts.  We just hope that they start to recognize their own BS when they're ok with killing dogs, or trotting down the path of total moral relativism and nihilism.

Just go to your local downtown with a bucket of chalk and write things like \"Peace begins on your plate. Choose compassion, choose vegan.\" Or \"Vote for peace 3x a day. Vote vegan.\" Or \"Dont let your body be a graveyard for murdered animals.\"\nThings like that!\n\nMy personal belief is that silence is complicity. It isnt right for us to just sit by and not participate... there are billions of animals inside of factory farns right now even though we are personally contributing to it. We should be the voice that we would want other people to be if we were the ones inside of those hell holes.\n\nI understand it is difficult at first to do any kind of outreach.. but the discomfort you get from confrontation is nothing compared to the mutaliation and confined these innocent animals suffer through every day..\n\nJust take some baby steps, and it will get easier and easier to be a voice for the animals.",

How about this: don’t go out of your way to eradicate insects habitats from your yard or surroundings but if they’re in your kitchen or latched on your skin, they are fair game. Mosquitos, termites, fleas, ticks, bed bugs etc are all very close to us by evolution and it’s hard to live pragmatically if you don’t draw some lines somewhere.",

Their tofu is amazing.\n\nWhat I usually do is cut it into cubes, glaze it with a little soy sauce. And gently bake it in the over for about 15 minutes. Then add it to a stir fry with mixed vegetables and rice. Ideally with a sauce if sone kind. A vegan curry sauce is a good choice.\n\nI love tofu.",

"comment": "Vegetarianism is good when used as a stepping stone. It’s kinda like vaping to quit smoking. If you vape for a couple weeks while you transition to non smoking awesome, but if you just keep vaping you haven’t really changed anything.\n\nGoing vegan, on average, saves 1 animal a day so 365 animals a year.\n\nReplacing all of your meat with meatless alternatives (going vegetarian) saves 25 animals a year.\n\nIt would be better to go plant based one day a week, than to go full time vegetarian. Plant based Monday’s = 52 animals saved a year, vegetarian all days = 25 animals saved a year.\n\nMy problem is more with the idea and terminology of vegetarianism. So many people think this is enough, but truly it isn’t, but I believe vegetarians (for the most part) want to help the animals and are just ignorant to the amount of suffering they inflict.\n\nA vegetarian is a lot easier to convert to veganism than a carnist, but vegetarianism should never be end game.",

As someone mentioned earlier, cats don't have meaningful amounts of amylase, so carbs largely pass through them undigested in the same way that fiber does for humans.\n\nDo you think humans should be following a carnivore diet, so we don't accidentally eat indigestible fiber?",

"comment": "I think penguinz0 is a hypocrite.... Hard for me to watch him trying to justify eating meat. Honestly, to me, he was flat out wrong. He's just indirectly harming animals, still contributing to it. It's hard to demonize her, while knowing the horrors of the animal agriculture industry. To me she may be worse, but it's all horrific.  BUT, he's exactly right that vegan gains behavior and shaming people is probably the worst way to promote the cause. Even if that's what I believe, it's still not going to convince anyone to point out how much harm they are doing. That's just not how people work. It's best advocacy imo to be positive and open. I think even this thread demonstrates that. I'm sure the people trying to convince you to go vegan in this thread will not have been successful because the approach is aggressive. Personally, I don't approach people at all or tell them what they should do, or point out their hypocrisies. Because it just doesn't work. I also don't appreciate veganism being compared to religious people's beliefs, as what we feel strongly for is what's happening in the real world. Death and suffering in the world we live in. Just something to think about to put perspective on why people are so passionate...",

You've already said you like the taste of someone's flesh and that you find the taste of someone's flesh more important than someone's life.\n\nGood news is that you can replicate that flavour without having to resort to cruelty, exploitation, and injustice. Not only that, but being Vegan is also better for the animals, the environment, and your health.\n\nSo why support/do something that is harmful to not only the animals and the environment but also to you when there are Vegan alternatives available?",

Actually, he’s a “lacto-ovo vegetarian, meaning he will eat dishes with milk, eggs or cheese, and occasionally (but not preferably) chicken. His preference is for hearty vegetable/pasta/cheese dishes, eggplant, lasagna, etc.”\n\nFrom the linked [Politico article](http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-agriculture/2015/05/house-poised-for-action-on-cool-senate-readies-to-take-a-swing-at-wotus-ben-carson-the-vegetarian-option-212543).

I was excited so I ate vegan anyway for the first couple months, but then I figured it was about time I made room in my freezer for vegan burger patties and stuff. So I made bacon for breakfast, then I had a bacon version of carbonara, etc. And at first when I was cooking it on the stove I thought, wow, I'm really going to miss this stuff.\n\nBut then I ate it and I was like, wait, hang on a second... And I realized that the most alluring thing about bacon is just the smell. It doesn't even taste that good. It's just salty and chewy.",

"comment": "When you live in a capitalistic hellscape that prioritizes profits over human lives, let alone animal lives, a mega fast food chain such as KFC, McDonald's, BK, etc, they're not going to just say \"Hey we decided to become a 100% vegan restaurant next month\". No. They're not and it's honestly delusional to think one would, at least in the next couple years. \n\nUntil that happens, you know what will be the options for vegan places? \n\n1. Locally owned vegan restaurants that can slowly expand, but might take decades to even leave their state, let alone to the other side of the country\n\n2. Chains that kill millions of animals but have locations in just about every city in every state starting to add one or two vegan options\n\nLike I said, if you still don't want to support them, that's fine, go for it. But if you want veganism to be available to everyone, and for relatively cheap, the least you have to do is be happy chains add those options. \n\nKeep on mind too that not everyone lives in vegan friendly areas. There's not a single 100% vegan restaurant (not even a vegetarian) where my family lives, and when I visit them and they want to go out to eat, I have to decide between having bread at a locally owned place, or having \"chicken\" or a \"burger\" at a chain restaurant, can you take a guess which one I'll pick?",
