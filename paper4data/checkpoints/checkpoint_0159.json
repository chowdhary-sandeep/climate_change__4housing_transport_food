"comment": "I was inferring, apparently incorrectly that you were saying that you know 5 people who said climate change wasn't happening, which is actually what a LOT of Congressional members actually believe. \n\nDo not dismiss these people as fringe, fringe means that there is little influence. These guys are backed by oil industry like Koch and more. These guys have HUGE influence over local, state and federal levels. Dismissing them is a mistake. \n\n&gt;a) retooling an energy infrastructure is incredibly expensive, and is being demanded at a time of economic weakness.\n\nThe costs of creating and pushing a new industry will be outweighed by the development of a new industry. This is how the market works. The old way is one of the reason that we are in the economic downturn we are in - our reliance on oil that continues to grow in cost, both in dollars and in neighborhood costs. \n\n&gt;b) simply making energy more expensive in order to reduce use has drastic economic consequences, especially on the poorest who pay the highest percentages of their household income on energy.\n\nThe LEAST we could do remove the billions in subsidies the industry currently gets into alternatives like geo thermal and biomass.\n\n&gt;c) climate activists opposing nuclear power.\n\nThat is going to be an uphill battle on the backs of the various disasters that have been out there. You say - \"In sixty years of civilian nuclear operations, nuclear power has the lowest number of fatalities per watt-hour produced, even lower than solar or wind.\" Can you cite that?\n\n&gt;d) not having a good substitute for liquid transportation fuels.\n\nThis is also partially because of the oil industry pushing against public trans and alternative trans. Don't believe me? Just google it. \n\n&gt;e) solar and wind are intermittent and don't produce baseload power.\n\nThat is ignoring other methods like geothermal, biomass and a few others. The thing is that we are still thinking in the current grid mentality. I envision a world grid made up of interconnecting micro grids with household/building production with micro solar and micro turbine yet connected to every location that receives sun and wind. \n\n&gt;f) natural gas is currently cheap.\n\nFor now, but it hasn't included the neighborhood costs and the other externalities that come with retrieving and using the product. \n\n&gt;g) there is no good grid-level storage technology to deal with intermittency.\n\nTesla and many other companies are currently working on this. There CURRENTLY isn't an awesome solution but I like it better than oil and gas. \n\nI don't think that those who are trying to create a new approach to energy and our environment are the problem. I think that those who use their money and influence to obfuscate the issue and keep us in a terrible position are the problem. \n\nI think I am now done with this conversation. Thank you.",

They do their back-of-the-napkin calculations and claim how inefficient and/or expensive it is.  I wish people would be more open minded about the idea.  If cars like these can go 700 km using only solar panels, surely an electric car can benefit from a solar panel or two on top.  Nobody is claiming to run a whole electric car on solar panels, but it could surely extend the range or trickle charge in a parking lot.  And better yet, with solar paint cells being developed, the whole exterior of the car could be used to produce power.  I think we need to be thinking more like the men and women in this video.",

"comment": "I'll look it up for you tonight (it's noon here at the moment) and will try to provide a good translation. As for using grams per km for the lifetime, they basically defined the lifetime as a fixed # of kilometers, I'll look up the exact numbers.\n\nEdit: Okay, let me give it a try.\n\n&gt; Specifically, which vehicles they're using as examples\n\nAs examples they use the Nissan Leaf, VW e-Golf, and Opel Ampera, however...\n\n&gt; and whether the calculations factor in raw materials acquisition/transport as well as the manufacturing process itself.\n\n...a lot of meta-analysis has been done, combining the results of various studies. A rough translation of the first part of chapter 3.2.1\n\n*The CO2-emission during production of a vehicle is determined by the sourcing and production of required materials, the transportation of those, and assembling the vehicle.  \nThe CO2-emission bound to the production of a Li-ion-battery is determined by the used technology and configuration, however as a guideline we use 150kg CO2 per kWh battery capacity (Van Gijlswijk,\n2014)*  \n  \n*For a 'mid-size' car with a battery of 24kWh this means a CO2-emission of ~3,5 tonnes for the battery.*  \n\n*The production of an electric vehicle excluding the battery leads to a CO2-emission of 7 to 10 tonnes. This is about similar to thethe production of a conventional vehicle, although not all referred sources agree (Ecoinvent, 2014), (Hawkins, 2013), (Odeh, 2013), (Notter 2010), (Helms, 2010). The latter two sources result in clearly lower CO2-emissions for a conventional vehicle.*  \n  \n*For this analysis we use a 'base value' of 8,5 tonnes CO2 for the production of the vehicle and a premium for the battery and extra electric components. Next, a premium has been added for maintenance (1.2 tonnes on the lifetime) and recycling (destruction) at the end of the lifetime.*\n\n&gt; Also, it's quoting grams per kilometre for non-use-phase emissions, but those are fixed emissions that don't scale with distance - so how many kilometres total is the study using for these calculations?\n\nThe assumption is a lifetime for vehicles of 220,000km.\n\n&gt; Last question, does it separate the emissions for construction and destruction?\n\nYes, see the paragraph(s) above.\n\n**Sources** (so you could look up some of the other studies)  \nEcoinvent, 2014  \n*Ecoinvent database, version 3.1, Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories (2014)*  \n  \nHawkins, 2013  \n*Hawkins, T.R. et al., Comparative Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Conventional and Electric Vehicles, Journal of Industrial Ecology, Volume 17, issue 1, pp. 53-64 (2013).*  \n  \nOdeh, 2013  \n*Odeh, N., N.

This month?  No?\n\n&gt; Some Model 3s will deliver to regular customers months before the iPace, yes. Will they be partially handmade? We don't know. Also, some people who don't own Teslas or who live in locations that are low priority, may still be waiting a year or more to get a Model 3, by Teslas own estimates. Those people may get an iPace sooner.\n\nWhy are you trying to make this about the Model 3, anyway?  Tesla has been shipping cool cars for about nine *years*...and the iPace is far more likely to be priced like an S or X than like a Model 3.  Articles are saying \"under $100K\" - that's not a Model 3 competitor.\n\n&gt; Again, point is that the iPace isn't as far behind the Model 3 as some would have us believe or even some of the posts on this thread would indicate.\n\nYour original point seemed to be that the iPace was as far along as the Model 3 because there are prototypes \"driving around.\"\n\n&gt; I don't have any interest in the iPace or the Model 3\n\nOkay, enjoy your i3 then?  I'm not sure what to say.  I am also cheering on the advancement of EVs in general, and I hope that other manufacturers actually do catch up to Tesla soon, and that more of them are cool cars and fewer are commuter boxes and weirdmobiles.  EDIT: And who knows - Jaguar may deliver in the next couple of months - but we've been hearing a similar narrative from other manufacturers for years now, so I'll believe it when I see it.",

"comment": "I bring up infrastructure because will always be a major problem with hydrogen. Yes it is possible for gas stations to convert over to hydrogen stations, but they can't just reuse gasoline pumps. Hydrogen has to be stored in compressed tanks. That's why there are only [34 stations in the US](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/results?utf8=✓&amp;location=&amp;fuel=HY&amp;private=false&amp;planned=false&amp;owner=all&amp;payment=all&amp;radius=false&amp;radius_miles=5)\n\nNow compare that to [1,700 DC charging stations](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/results?utf8=✓&amp;location=&amp;fuel=ELEC&amp;private=false&amp;private=true&amp;planned=false&amp;owner=all&amp;radius=false&amp;radius_miles=5&amp;ev_levels%5B%5D=none&amp;ev_levels%5B%5D=dc_fast&amp;ev_connectors%5B%5D=none&amp;ev_connectors%5B%5D=CHADEMO&amp;ev_connectors%5B%5D=J1772COMBO&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=none&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=AeroVironment+Network&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=Blink+Network&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=ChargePoint+Network&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=EV+Connect&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=eVgo+Network&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=GE+WattStation&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=Greenlots&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=OpConnect&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=SemaCharge+Network&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=Tesla&amp;ev_networks%5B%5D=all). Note this does not include the tesla network, level two stations, or home plugs.\n\nCosts may drop, but it still has the same problems as gasoline. It has to be produced, packaged, and transported. At best it might get as cheap as gasoline, since packaging and shipping are a major part of the cost of a gallon of gas. \n\nI will be impressed when somebody can make a trip from LA to NY with a fuel cell vehicle. That will be an important milestone. Meanwhile gas and EVs have been doing it for years. \n\nYou are also forgetting the $37,500 Chevy bolt. It gets 238 miles per charge and has already completed cross country trips. \n\nAnd here is the important thing to remember about EVs, the grid can handle them today. Simply charging at night when power demand is low. In fact some places will pay people to charge at night. When are hydrogen fuel cells going to pay people to charge?\n\nThe fundamental problem with fuel cells is that they aren't as good as gasoline cars are today. And if they aren't better, people aren't going to switch. Meanwhile EVs continue to improve and continue to go down in price. EVs simply have too far of a head start for fuel cells to catch up any time soon.",

And by doing something about it, I mean, why are we not attacking the real problem instead of this bullshit of cleaner cars, windmills and solar panels, and policy, none of which really has anything to do with solving the problem. \n\nLook at it this way: If there was an asteroid the size of Texas headed to the earth, with mathematical certainty of death to one and all, the entire population of the earth would stop in its track to do anything to destroy the threat or make plans to leave the planet. Right? Everyone would quit their jobs and either work towards solving the problem, or just celebrate our final days on earth. \n\nSo why is CO2 warming not seen in the same light? If CO2 spelled certain doom for the earth, we would not be creating policy and electric cars, we would either be building a spaceship to get the fuck out of here or one hell of machine to suck all the greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Did any world leader go to their brightest and best scientists to tell them to build either machine? \n\nNope. \n\nAre we, the U.S. doing that? Nope. Did Obama or anyone ever go to NASA and request this? Nope. It's been nothing other than this bullshit of creating regulation, which if you sit down and add it all up, is not going to do anything. 6 to 8 billion people on the planet, China and India coming alive....even if we all cut way back, the numbers of CO2 production/release are crazy!!\n\nSo if it's a so called real threat, then why not an equal reaction to the size of the problem? \n\nAnd if it's not a real threat, then how much of a threat is it? And if we can't calculate that, on this simple 1-10 scale, then how we can say for any certainty that it's real or not? \n\nIf we polled all the climate scientists and ask them this question, scale it 1 to 10, would they all say \"6\", or \"8\" or \"2\"? And with any variance of +/- 3 then why?",

"comment": "That's taking into account average electric costs. The cost of electricity to move a car a given distance is significantly cheaper than gasoline. The base model Model 3 can go 220 miles on a 50kWh pack. The average cost of electricity in America is 12 cents per kWh. So that's about $6 for a recharge. For comparison, a Camry gets 29mpg in the city and 41mpg on highway. At city mileage you'd need about 7 gallons of gas to go the same distance. At current gas prices that would cost you about $18. At highway mileage you'd need about 5.5 gallons which would cost you about $14. So at average electric prices and average gas prices, fuel costs are somewhere in the range of 1/2 to 1/3 the cost compared to gas.\n\nThe exact amount depends on your local electricity prices (here in Georgia my rates are about 7 cents per kWh). In some places it can actually be much cheaper as it's possible to pay lower rates to charge overnight when overall grid usage is low.",

Bear in mind that the Camry I mentioned will burn about $6K in gasoline during a 5 year lifespan (roughly) presuming only minimal change in gasoline prices during that time (not a safe assumption in my opinion) while the Model 3 will \"burn\" about $2K in electricity. Presuming all other maintenance costs remain the same we have still shortened the gap between the Camry and the $35K Model 3 by $4K. Bear in mind that's also not a safe assumption because you have lots of maintenance items with an ICE (oil changes jump immediately to mind) that you won't have with the Model 3 during that 5 year period so I'm actually giving the Camry an unfair leg up straight off the bat.\n\nYour base Camry is what; $27K give or take? Considering the $4K gap in fuel costs for a five year lifespan that brings the 5 year total cost differential itself to around $4K... or what many people would spend on options for the Camry that might be standard on the Model 3. \n\nSo yes, given that logic the Model 3 at $35K is definitely a mass-market car... and notice that I'm not even including the tax incentive that right now puts the Model 3 at basically price parity with the Camry...",

Personally, I'd like to see the rest of the world move in a *slightly* more Norweigian direction.\n\nHowever, this is a matter of politics, not a matter of technological merits. \n\nICE technology has room to grow in terms of efficiency, and batteries have a very long way to go before they can approximate the energy density of fossil fuel.",

It's bait language media use because it makes Tesla fans angry (and they click the link) and Tesla haters happy (and they click the link).\n\nFurther, just on the side:\n\nEvery battery lab globally is trying to reduce cobalt content in the cathode, because cobalt is expensive and not the chemical primarily responsible for energy density (which everyone tries to increase). Cobalt-free batteries have also existed for a long time on the low end in the form of LFP and LFMP CAMs; and may soon be reality also on the high end (in the shape of NMA).\n\nAudi will sell their second electric SUV (Q4 e-tron) in 2021, for what it's worth.\n\nJust looking at range is an incredibly one-sided manner to judge a car - cars are about much, much more than that. Especially high-performance cars such as the Taycan (which in the real world goes further than 212 miles) are not about efficiency and never, ever were.\n\n[In Our Testing, the Porsche Taycan's Range Nearly Equaled That of the Tesla Model S](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a30874032/porsche-taycan-range-test-tesla-model-s/)",

In Shanghai they were able to finally implement all the lessons learned from Fremont and thus those vehicles have their QC issues solved. Fremont's never been able to stop production with the intention of fixing their QC because it would cost too much money. If the factory shut down for a month to fix 3 and Y QC that would be a huge blow to Tesla. I hope the Texas plant will allow them shutdown Fremont for a bit since the Model 3 needs it -- at least with the Model Y you'll be able to order those from Texas but it doesn't look like they'll be making 3s in Texas.",

"comment": "If your situation allows it, going electric is 100% worth it. I worked out my mom getting a Tesla Model 3 for our family's car 7 months ago now (wow!) and recently bought a 2013 Nissan Leaf for my first car. I even got us an electric lawn mower and all three of them are the best purchases we've made. I know you said used (which is better for the environment too!) but do you have a price range and any sense of how you'll be using your car? You're really not going to find any used pure EV cheaper than a 2011-2013 Nissan Leaf (~$3k-$5k), but they can only go like ~60-90 miles on a charge. If you own a home or have very close charging and travel, on average, less than 50 miles a day than this works. You get all the benefits of an EV for cheap: I haven't had to do any maintenance on my Leaf and I charge for free at my local city hall. I have a feeling a Leaf might not be best for you though, so luckily there's a handful of higher-range EVs. One place to look is the BMW i3, it has about twice the range of a similar Leaf and therefore costs about 2x-3x the price. There's more pure EVs to look into, but if you have to go hybrid I would strongly recommend looking into used Volts. They actually used the better hybrid system and seem quite competent. I was just talking to a Volt owner the other day and he loves his. However, you will have more maintenance and still have some of the pains of an ICE car. For example, his car was overheating on a road trip recently. The electric part was totally fine, it was the engine that was having issues.  \n\nAs I'm sure many on this subreddit are, I'm happy to answer any questions you have! The world of used electric cars can be especially confusing. I was there a few months ago before I bought my car lol",

You might be able to charge using the dryer outlet. \n\nAs for charging, you can definitely charge at a fast electrify america (EA) charging station but you’ll be spending quite a bit of time there and 150amp and up stations are relatively expensive to juice up compared to home. \n\nDo you have charging at work? That could definitely make this work. \n\nMy only other suggestion would be to consider a used Tesla with TRANSFERRABLE free unlimited supercharging that’s good for the life of the car. Then you’ll be able juice up in about 20 or so min per day and it won’t cost you much at all. \n\nI think if I were in your position, I would not do an EV and would consider getting a Toyota RAV4 prime that’s electric for 40-50 miles and then hybrid the rest of the time. If you can charge on 110 at home and work, you’ll barely use any gas and you won’t be stuck if you *ever* don’t have the option to charge.",

"comment": "My dad tried to buy a Prius Prime, but there were none available in SoCal.\n\nMy point is that if you take the words of the CEO Akio Toyoda seriously, Toyota thinks hybrid is the future. My point is that their strategy hasn't changed since the mid-90s. In fact, they have released numerous disinformation campaigns doubting the efficacy of EVs (\"we do self-charging EVs!\"). \n\nToyota, in 2022, stands alone in their electrification strategy. They would prefer hydrogen cars, which seemed reasonable during the Bush administration. 20 years later, hydrogen has proven to be DOA.\n\nYes, Toyota has literally sold thousands of PHEVs since 2018. They have also sold 0 full EVs. Tesla sold 350,000 EVs last quarter.\n\nhttps://cleantechnica.com/2022/08/26/us-electric-vehicle-market-growing-yet-tesla-still-dominates/",

If they can afford a car they buy it used. \n\nDeclaring that EVs must meet an affordability standard of \"affordable to everyone\" is simply not possible. If you only offer incentive to buy the cheapest EVs that can be made then the market would consist entirely of small, short-range EVs which are adequate for commuting but not capable of replacing ICE cars let alone ICE trucks which use prodigious amount of fuel. Those EVs would be primarily adopted by two car families who keep an ICE for long distance travel.",

Tesla is the main one driving this effort, but Ford, Chevy, and the main OEMs have stated almost 0 commitments to building this. If they want EVs to be the name of the game, charging investments is the only way to spur future interest. \n\nKeeping ranges low helps control costs at the expense of customer needs. Continuing to rely on customers to define their own charging needs (i.e. at home) is a surefire way to kill interest when customers want to use EVs in the same way they use their vehicles today. Daily city driving may be manageable for your urban users, but urban users have been on a downward trend of drivers given the investments of public transportation. If a customers office area does not have charging capability (or limited charging space) it kills the interest even more. \n\nThe only way they maintain interest is to increase ranges to what is comparable to a single tank of gas. And at the same time investing charging infrastructure to be co parable to filling a tank of gas. \n\nThere's a whole other dispute on how regions will tax EVs (which can be a net detriment to EV users if not driven frequently). While thats a seperate topic, it's also related.",

But probably more realistically, women journeying late at night and rapid or destination charging in some strange remote area. They might get spooked by anyone. It's not a \"must-have\" accessory, but if it provides reassurance I don't see the harm. The trick is making it work properly under all conditions, which they may not have achieved.

Even with the \"worst\" example of unreliable mainstream EVs, most of those batteries technically still outlasted the cars. Nissan CVTs on the other hand...\n\nNo battery is immune to degradation, but we've come a long way with modern vehicles having much better BMS logic, thermal management, and cell chemistries.",

Tesla has a handful of prototypes of their truck concept, but no one is making these things at scale. The MWC standard isn't even published yet, and none exist in the real world. Few to none of the existing 350kW CCS/NACS charging stations work even for pickups with trailers, because very few use pull-through lanes. \n\nIt's absolutely possible, but it's just not practical in the short to mid term. We're at least a decade out from battery electric long haul trucking being viable, much less taking over the industry. That's just not fast enough. We would keep working on electric trucking, but we can't bet the whole farm on getting that working when we already have a solution that works *right now.*",

Unfortunately pushing the motor beyond its set speed - or when it isn't powered - isn't actually very effective, because it provides significant resistance. \n\nI also think you'll just have to learn to ride a bicycle - as an exercise tool, a mid-drive ebike with torque sensing is *a lot* more effective than any scooter.",

You can probably get down to $25-$30k with another installer, then use some of the savings for efficiency upgrades. \n\n\nThe price of caulking your exterior windows and taping ducts is $20. Replacing all your lights with LEDs can run several hundred depending on your house. But these two measures alone can drop your bill ~5-10% per month (or more, depending on age of your house and your source of heat).\n\n\nIn the longer run, look at the big energy hogs - appliances. If you have electric water heat, get an on demand heater. As your appliances die of old age, replace them with high efficiency units. If you have an attic, make sure it is well insulated. If you have an unfinished basement or crawlspace, make sure your first floor is properly insulated.\n\n\nThe cost of efficiency upgrades is far cheaper than that extra kW of solar that you are trying to squeeze on your roof with Sunpower panels.",

"comment": "I'd trade extra power for decent internet service.. \n\nAn amphour is using 1 amp for 1 hour. So 35 amphours is using 35 amps for 1 hour -- usually this is used to measure DC, and I've not seen a kill-a-watt report amphours.  I have no idea what you're reporting here.  \n\nYour laptop is going to use 30 watts. Consider 30 watts for 2 lights. A monitor might use 100 watts, and a small dorm refrigerator can use 100 watts, but only run every few hours. And, you can turn it off at night.  Misc other router/wireless/etc will be about 40-80 watts.  \n\nSo for absolute basics, at night you can run your lights, laptop, and monitor, and wireless, let’s say, 200 watts AC. Add in 20% correction factor, and call it 250 watts. Divide this number by your DC voltage (24) to get amps (11) and multiply this by the number of hours you are consuming at this rate - let’s say 12 hours, which means you are consuming roughly 132 amphours.  You will need to double (and I would triple) this, at an absolute bare minimum to keep your batteries up. With this size load, I would consider at least 400 amphours of storage.  To charge this battery bank, you need to 15% of the C20 rate. The C20 rate is basically how much energy the battery can release over a 20 hours.  To charge your 400 amphour (C20) battery, you need  ~60 amps. Multiply this by your battery voltage (24) to get watts necessary for bare minimum charging — 1440.  If you are in the southwest US, you’ll get 8-10 hours of sun in the summer, and 4-6 in the winter, which means if you draw your batteries down to 50% every day, you should be able to fully charge your batteries on a cloudy winter day.  During the summer you’ll have leftover power to run your fan, a 800 watt window air conditioner, and other stuff.  \n\nNow if you can lose the monitor, or work a few hours earlier (start work at 4AM/PM) you can radically decrease the size of your power requirements.  But, given the other factors, I would still opt for a larger system. I estimate the above is about $500 for Costco grade golf cart batteries, and 2400 for 8x270 watt solar panels. You’ll need an inverter and charge controller still, but you can figure that out, as it’ll depend on what you go with.",

"comment": "I would seriously reconsider choosing Hundai as your panel manufacturer. You have such amazing state incentives (as far as I can tell) that you should take advantage of it now and go with a company like Sunpower. The devil is in the details with warranties and you could end up regretting skimping on the panels.\n\nIf you get sticker shock from Sunpower, take a look at SolarWorld.\n\nAlso, see if they can use Solar Edge Optimizers instead of microinverters. I have replaced so many enphase microinverters it's crazy. SolarEdge is higher efficiency and offers the same advantages of enphase with a lower price. \n\nGlad you're going solar!!!\n\nAlso, you will be able to take 30% off the gross sticker price. I don't know where andres is getting his info but regardless, you need to talk to a CPA about that part, NOT your solar company. Every customer I have sold to has taken 30% of Gross no problem.",

Your Co-op is crediting you the average price that they pay for electricity. The Co-op still has to pay for the infrastructure used to transmit electricity and pay employees. Your Co-op is treating you like any other electricity seller.  \n\nHowever, in your scenario, solar generation has 2 benefits which are not accounted for.  First, the solar generation you provide is carbon free, excepting the materials and energy to create and distribute the solar panels.  Second, solar generation produces during high demand periods, therefore its likely the generation you produce should be valued higher than the average energy generation price.\n\nI would make your argument based on these 2 points.",

"comment": "Their longevity is reasonably well understood: \"We don't know how long they live because the early ones we can find to play with are still alive and can be made to store useful energy.\"\n\nhttps://damnthematrix.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/why-i-chose-nickel-iron-batteries/ is a copy of a paper on that - 85 year old batteries were restored to a useful amount of their original capacity.\n\nAs for cycle life?  Probably not worth even worrying about.  They last basically forever, with the occasional electrolyte replacement every decade or so.  And you can't really hurt them by draining them fully (though I believe they will freeze, which can damage the cases and elements, if significantly discharged).\n\nThey have a few significant downsides for energy storage applications, though.\n\n1. They're insanely heavy.  Not a huge deal for stationary storage.\n2. They go through an awful lot of water compared to lead acid, and especially compared to lithium (which doesn't go through any).\n3. The charge/discharge efficiency is really bad.  It's in the 60% range for watt-hours, if you're lucky, so you have to put in a lot more energy than you get out - which, off grid, means more solar panels.\n4. They don't handle high C-rates for charge or discharge, which means if you need a lot of instant power out of them, you need a really big bank.\n5. Their self discharge rates are significant.\n6. The 1.2V/cell nominal voltage means you need a *lot* of them for any sort of reasonable voltage system.\n\nThey have their uses, and if you value longevity over other factors, they're certainly worth considering, especially as there are new batteries being built.  It's entirely likely that an off grid pack of nickel iron cells would literally last the life of the owner, with only the occasional electrolyte replacement.  That's certainly worth something.\n\nBut the downsides of them, and the difficulty of acquiring them, make them a hard sell for most use cases.",

People that go to the show and listen to the experts will begin to understand why.  \n\nHere's a great video featuring Stan Osserman and Paul Ponthieux from the [Blue Planet Foundation](https://blueplanetfoundation.org/) (World Leaders in Solar/H2 Tech) with details on why H2 storage makes sense:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKk-dkeWkg  \n\nHow long are all those acres of batteries going to last? Are the replacements factored into the cost? Are they going to be recycled or dumped in landfills? Who's going to pay? Why aren't these questions asked in the articles that hype battery storage?",

I shut my basement fridge down for 8 hours each night and it hardly loses any temperature.\n\nAs for storing energy, I don‘t think that your landlord would tolerate you running a battery like a Tesla Powerwall, since effectively you would be stealing money (because less goes to the grid). And it‘s a 10k investment overall so it wouldn‘t actually pay for itself. But you could ask if he would put one up so you can use the stored energy at night instead of during the day. And maybe pay a small premium.",

"comment": "I got the Tesla-Panasonic 325s. I almost didn't. I almost went with the lowest quote of $2.30 PPW. \n\nThe Panasonic, SunPowers, and LGs are all a little more expensive (as they are the most efficient on the market). I got the Panasonic for $2.48 because the sales rep screwed something up (they are normally a bit more). Normally, I think they only go down to ~$2.68 in CFL (which is the same price I was quoted for the SunPowers).  So, for my purposes, I knew they were ~$.22-$.23 more that the Co-op (after 30% tax credit actually $.15 more) or for 8 kWh system about ~$1,200 bucks diff. \n\nI financed, and Tesla gave me a better deal than GreenBank. GreenBank was 5.9% with a $500 closing costs. Tesla was 2.9% with $0 closing costs. so, $1,200-500=$700 difference after closing costs. With the better interest rate, I actually end up saving a little money getting the more efficient (~19-20%) Panasonic panels. \n\nWhen I looked at all the numbers, it seemed like a decent deal. I am sure I will look back in a year or two and hear about people getting them for even less. I got quotes in November 2017 and heard about the potential solar tariff. That was good motivation for me to install.",

"comment": "&gt; You also totally miscalculated inverter efficiency of a SolarEdge system because you're looking at only the inverter efficiency and not considering the efficiency of the optimizers.\n\nYou seem to be forgetting the difference of AC coupled and DC coupled.  The inverters are 99.5% efficient or better.  \n\nHowever it depends on what is happening. With DC coupled: If you are using the battery then the optimizers are not in the loop.  if you are charging the battery from solar then the inverter is not in the loop, if you are charging from grid then optimizers are not in the loop.\n\nWith AC coupled one or both inverters are in the loop: both for charging from solar (much higher losses), one if charging from grid, one if supplying from battery the bimodal is less efficient than the StorEdge inverter so more losses with AC coupled.\n\n&gt; The reason I brought up the 7600H is because a 7600H with a Powerwall 2 is going to wind up a better system than a StorEdge + LG RESU10H. That's apples-to-apples.\n\nwell except with SE7600H and powerwall you have TWO inverters and higher losses due to the second inverter with less effciency than the SE7600A, also two companies (SolarEdge and Tesla).  \nWith the SE7600A you have ONE inverter with higher efficiency and single monitoring, single system controlling things (LG is just a battery, like PV modules).\n\n&gt; That we prefer Enphase is honestly unrelated\n\nExcept even more inefficient...  and still two companies controlling things (Enphase and Tesla).\n\n&gt;  The 7600H+Powerwall 2 will provide more total production from solar over the course of the year\n\nThe lack of efficiency in the powerwall2 AC coupling will more than make in higher losses to the 1% efficiency difference of the ST7600A and SE7600H\n\n&gt; With respect to oversizing and clipping, you should do more research, because you're probably undersizing systems for your clients.\n\nNo No No. What you THINK is happing would be OVER sizing an inverter not UNDER sizing the system.   However you would be wrong.  \nThere is no reason with SolarEdge to clip at all, though most people design systems with slight clipping on solaredge.  Other brands have a slight advantage for a little clipping but not solaredge which has a very flat production curve and very slight difference in cost from one model to the next size up.   \nHowever I have a LOT of experience modeling, designing, and making PV modeling systems.   \n\n&gt; 1 or 2% clipping is perfectly acceptable if the corresponding increase in overall production warrants it. \n\nSee this is the falsehood.  Clipping with a highly efficient inverter with a flat production curve has NO benefit from clipping only losses.  There is NO INCREASE in overall production with SolarEdge and clipping.  There is with other inverters BUT if you were to switch the other systems to solaredge there would be an INCREASE in production at the same size and no clipping.   See the falsehood now?  \n\n&gt; You wind up with a wider PV production curve even if you shave a little off the top.\n\nSee more silly falsehoods.   With inverter systems like SolarEdge you wind up with wider production curve and NO shaving off the top.  Using limited inverter capacity like enphase and worse enphase can't share inverter capacity, you end up with just loss.\n\nTell me again how you are desiging the best systems for your customers again?\n\n&gt; In short, you're defending an inferior product based on false premise.\n\nUm, who is it that thinks clipping is good?  \n\n&gt; I honestly am not sure whether I believe you're in the industry or not\n\nfunny but facts do not depend on you believing in them.  \nI have no problem believing you are an enphase &amp; Tesla sales drone as you have been spitting out the company lines with little thought to the validity of the claims.",

Batteries don't get lighter as they pump out their energy.  \n  \nA battery electric aircraft will have to be 300% better than jet fuel and gas gen efficiency than a gas turbine in order to be competitive.  \n  \nThere is no such technical limitation on ships. Theoretically a container ship with an integrated solar array would be slower but probably more economic to run in the near future.",

You can dart around everywhere so effortlessly. It’s like a big invisible rubber band flings you around. So quiet inside. No more oil changes. Never going back.\n\nI have a Leaf Plus, gets 250 miles of range around town and 210-220 on the highway. Drove that and the Bolt before buying...the Bolt is a very cool car also, but the Leaf was way more comfortable and has adaptive cruise control. Tesla was (1) way more expensive (2) couldn’t be test driven (3) etc and so on. Their powertrains are superb from what I’ve heard, but the quality concerns, 50% price premium and annoying cult turned me off.\n\nI charge 99.5% of the time at home, probably once a week to take the battery from 30% to 70%.\n\nDepending on where you live, you may have several to try out, have fun driving as many as you can!",

"comment": "Funny, I just answered a similar question not 10 minutes ago. The first two estimates are very high even with the panel upgrade. The last one is insanely low and not priced to be around in a year. Tesla is the absolute undisputed low price leader at the moment but the experience is horrible and post sales service is a joke. Just read the reviews. Anyone who has shopped enough or ever looked at Wish knows that if it is too good to be true, it probably is. To make these numbers work, they are cutting somewhere else and you will definitely pay the price. Sunpower does have the highest efficiency but are you willing to pay many thousands more for a 2% difference compared to LG or Panasonic? As for the rail system. If you go with Unirac in black, you are good to go. That shit never fails unless the installer sucks. Odd that it would even be a price differentiator. Any company that is serious about supporting your system for 25 years would go that route anyways. Bottom line, go with any of either LG or Panasonic or Sunpower with Enphase IQ microinverters and for no more than $2.75/ watt assuming a  concrete flat tile or comp shingle roof. A panel upgrade should not add more than $2200 unless you are going beyond a 200A panel.",

But if the grid goes down, I guess the power has to go somewhere right? Maybe queue home automation to activate my heat pump in the least efficient fashion possible?\n\nIf we had true microgrids around here I could just transfer excess to my neighbors. I think we're a bit away from that at the distribution layer, at least in this part of the US (Texas).",

That's what led me to create more intelligent digital controls for optimizing solar and batteries. \n\nfor example if you wanted to do more solar you could get too deep freezes instead of one and fill them both halfway up with gallon jugs of water and then you have the storage space of one deep freezer except it also has a giant ice battery. So now your freezer load can go into your solar build, And you can use any freezer you want used inefficient clunky whatever.\n\nI'm all about putting that stranded solar energy to use and so few understand the need until they're facing a utility monopoly that hates solar power.",

Went back and watched the video...forgot wind has more than solar at the moment, but that's going to change sooner than later obviously. I'm betting the main reason the government hasn't invested as much in solar is the fact all the vast majority of panels aren't made in the US, and 10 years ago solar numbers weren't nearly as good...so it isn't \"self sufficient\" as a country.\n\nSolar tech is still improving along with battery storage. And doesn't kill large predatory birds (it's not the number of birds it's the kind of birds that get killed).\n\nI also grew up near one of the first major wind farms. It's so neat the first couple of years but then turns into an eye sore not unlike power lines and IMO killed the view of beautiful desert.\n\nInvesting in wind is a waste of money.

Solar companies want to close a deal with you, and they know adding batteries will put that at risk, because they may have to wait months to get them.\n\nOn the other hand, batteries are really an expensive and inefficient way to back up your home. If you truly want backup in a grid outage, you are better off going with a generator - it will be substantially cheaper and can back up your whole home for extended periods of time. \n\nA Tesla Powerwall, for example, will only be able to back up some of your electrical loads, and will likely run out in several hours if you use it extensively.",

Ive done my research on SunRun, they laden their sales people and sales retail ambassadors (home Depot, Lowes, Menards Kiosks people) with commissions and trips to Cancun and Caribbeans. While Tesla does nothing of that nature. Same with Vivint Solar. Vivint and SunRun are the popular 2 besides Tesla. Its an easy choice, im going with TESLA. Research tells me even the ComED inspector does comes out afterwards always says, \"Tesla always gets it right\". To me, its  a no brainer and definitely the safer bet.",

"comment": "We need more information. Start with the model of your sunny boy. The 10.0 is 10kw, so either you have the wrong model or my Google Foo failed me.\n\nSecond, who is telling you this? The Powerwall is installed with a gateway. The gateway goes between your grid connection and your house, it will island your home during a power outage and tells the pw to start producing from the batteries. This gives your sunny boy a \"grid\" where it can sync to and start producing (also known as AC coupling) . This production from the sunny then can aid on powering your loads, meaning the pw inverter does have to work as hard. If you produce more than you're consuming then the extra power is pushed into the battery of the pw. Each PW has a 5.5kw inverter so if your solar is much higher than that they may tell you that you have to install more pw to spread out all that power.\n\nThat being said. The pw can change the frequency of the sinewave to curtail the output of its too high and the batteries are near full.\n\nIf whomever is telling you that the sunny won't charge the pw on a grid down scenario can't explain what I just mentioned above then they need to go back and read a few more documents on how the damn things work.",

"comment": "Very few utility companies truly want and support net metering. On the surface and in the glossy brochures with pictures of endless forests and clear blue skies on the cover they do, but IRL, no. It cuts into their profits. If they sell something for what they bought it at, well, that obviously doesn’t make good business sense. Also, your utility company in not interested in saving the planet, they are interested in selling you utilities for the prices they dictate, and also gonna tack on as many other fees as they can.\n\nYou’re lucky, your sell and buy costs are close to the same. Many people on here live in areas where they have changed net metering laws arbitrarily. Often people who still have good net metering deals get hit with infrastructure access fees or additional surcharges that erase their gains.\n\nI’m lucky, where we live we are in a micro generator rate from March to October, get paid 0.28/kWH and we generate about 2.5 MWh/year excess so our exports completely erase both our AC and gas bills, including all admin fees, for 7 months out if the year.\n\nRead the fine print on the back of your bill!",

Solar is not designed to sell to people who don’t understand opportunity cost. Nobody is arguing that you can take your money and invest in other things and make a nice return. It’s just simple that your electricity bill is not going to go away and you are using money that you are already paying to SDG&amp;E to go solar. We are not adding a bill to your budget. We are using what you are already paying. Even customers on CARE and medical baseline can justify going solar.",

Not to talk of the subsidies and tax incentives which all but guarantee a no lose scenario \n\nSo again how I’m the hell are they losing billions of dollars????\n\nSo you are okay with slavery as long as it’s in service of new Teslas and solar panels? Who cares about Africans right? \n\nStill keeping the old American traditions alive I see.",

When you add a SE battery, they will significantly reduce the cost to upgrade the inverter to the HomeHub inverter which is a HUGE upgrade. The cost of the HomeHub to my company under the promo is like $800. We, like many installers I’ve spoken to, are throwing in the cost of the inverter for free (about a $4k cost with markup included without the promo).\n\nI actually had 4 execs from SolarEdge corporate  to my office last week requesting to work with my engineering and policy team to model and test their soon to be released, redesigned residential battery system to optimize its performance for the net metering tariff changes coming to my state (IL) in 2025. I grilled them harrrrrrrd on our past experiences with product reliability on the previous generations of their single-phase and 3-phase inverters, and asked them what they have done to ensure improved quality moving forward, and to provide data from the field on the new USA-made HomeHub inverters. \n\nThey apparently spent an incredible amount of time and money identifying which components needed to be improved; the most important of which was to replace the commercial-grade capacitors with industrial-grade, which has led to a 50+% reduction in failures. Out of 8000 HomeHubs in the field, the failures are in the low single digits.\n\nThe HomeHub platform is pretty badass. It’s extremely flexible and allows for whole home energy management, bi-directional DC fast EV charging, generator integration, and bunch of other neat stuff. Definitely worth a look. \n\nSorry to muddy your waters further but… if considering SE, you may want to wait. The new generation of their single-phase battery system that is coming out is pretty awesome. LFP instead of NMC chemistry (so less likely to burn your house down), modular, stackable and upgradable battery blocks that go together like legos. Each block is 4.4kwh and a full stack is about 20kwh in about the same space as the current single 10kwh unit. Can put up to 70kwh on a single inverter. It’s rad. \n\nWe’re fairly product agnostic and install a range of inverter products (SE, Enphase, CPS, Fronius, etc). We also install every battery mentioned by you and others here. As an owner, I can get pretty much any of it installed at cost, and if it means anything, after what I learned from the SE team, my wife and I will be doing a SE system in the spring on our new home. \n\nThat said, you honestly can’t go wrong with any of the choices you’re considering aside from the LG; they really do suck; badly. \n\nBest of luck! Feel free to DM if I can be a resource. If you can’t tell, I like talking about this crap lol",

"comment": "I've done both DIY solar and worked with professional installers, so I can speak to the pros and cons of each approach. It's true that going the DIY route can save you a lot of money upfront - when I built my off-grid cabin, I was able to put together a 2kW system for around $5k in materials, whereas quotes from installers were coming in around $15k for a comparable setup. That's a huge difference.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, there are some important caveats to consider before diving into a DIY solar project, especially if you're looking at a grid-tied system for your primary residence:\r  \n\r  \n1. Safety: Working with electricity is inherently dangerous, doubly so when you're dealing with the high voltages and currents in a solar array. I'm comfortable with electrical work, but I still had a healthy respect for the risks involved. A misstep could mean serious injury or worse. Professional installers have the training and equipment to mitigate those risks.\r  \n\r  \n2. Permitting and inspections: Getting a DIY solar system permitted and approved for grid connection can be a major headache if you're not familiar with the process. When I installed a grid-tied system on my suburban home, dealing with the utility and the building department was by far the most time-consuming and frustrating part of the project. Installers handle this stuff day in and day out.\r  \n\r  \n3. Warranties and support: With a DIY system, you're on your own if something goes wrong. When a squirrel chewed through one of my power optimizer cables, I had to troubleshoot and replace it myself. If I'd gone with a professional install, it would have been covered under warranty.\r  \n\r  \n4. System design and optimization: Putting together an efficient solar array isn't as simple as slapping some panels on your roof. Factors like shading, orientation, and component matching all come into play. I spent hours poring over string sizing calculators and interpreting spec sheets. Installers have software that makes this a lot easier, and the experience to avoid suboptimal configurations.\r  \n\r  \nSo while I'm a big proponent of DIY in general, I think it's important to go into a solar project with eyes wide open to the challenges and potential pitfalls. If you're committed to learning the ins and outs and don't mind putting in the extra legwork, you can absolutely save a bundle by doing it yourself. That's the route I went with my cabin, and I don't regret it.\r  \n\r  \nBut for my home system, I ended up going with a professional installer, even though it cost more. I wanted the peace of mind of having everything permitted and warrantied, and I was willing to pay a premium for that. Plus, the installer was able to get me a great deal on financing and helped me navigate the tax credit and SREC process, which offset some of the added cost.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, I think it comes down to your personal comfort level, the specifics of your project, and how much you value your own time and hassle. If you're an experienced DIYer with a simple off-grid system in mind, I say go for it. But for a complex grid-tied array, especially on an occupied home, I wouldn't fault anyone for leaving it to the pros. There's no one right answer, but it's important to make an informed decision based on your unique situation.",

"comment": "Interesting that the Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs since their claim of damages was for \"risk of dying during heatwaves\".  In the U.S., one must prove actual damages to have \"standing\" for a claim, at least as I have seen cases judged.  As example, Elon Musk recently walked scot-free from an investor lawsuit over his blatant lying about the status of Solar Roof Tiles to win stockholder approval for Tesla to buy Solar City to save his cousins and brother from large losses in bankruptcy.  The judge ruled \"no standing to sue\" since none of the plaintiffs showed they were harmed because the stock price later rose.  It seems that CEO's can now blatantly lie as long as it doesn't hurt the stock price.  Steve Jobs would be thrilled were he still around to grift that.  Perhaps their claim in a U.S. Court would need to be that they bought life insurance and their premiums are higher due to Climate Change.",

"comment": "Howdy there! You are asking some solid questions. \n\n* **Sizing for Peak Usage:** You don’t *have* to size your system for that 3600kWh peak month, but it depends on your goals. If you want to cover all your usage year-round, you'd size for the annual average, then factor in net metering (if your utility offers it). You’d overproduce in low-usage months (selling back power) and underproduce in peak months (buying some from the grid). If you're going off-grid, then yes, you'd need to cover that peak *plus* have a battery system for storage. \n* **Ground Mount vs. Roof Mount Cost:** Ground-mounted systems are pricier because they involve extra materials (like racking and concrete for the foundation), more labor for installation, and sometimes permitting fees. Roof mounts, on the other hand, piggyback off the structure already there—your roof. \n* **Ground Mount Tracking Systems:** Tracking systems are cool (literally—they move to follow the sun for max efficiency), but they’re more expensive and add complexity. If you want \"set it and forget it,\" stick with fixed panels. Simplicity is usually the way to go unless you’re really into tech. You can compare the difference in output and payback period if you would like as well.\n* **Maintenance and Troubleshooting:** Solar is generally low maintenance. Most systems run for years without much fuss, but you'll need to clean panels occasionally (dust, debris, or snow) and maybe replace an inverter after 10-15 years. Avoiding tracking and sticking with a reliable installer minimizes headaches.\n* **Maintenance Contracts:** Not a must-have. Most people don’t get them unless they’re in extreme environments or just want peace of mind. Panels themselves have long warranties (20+ years) and are super durable. Inverters or batteries might need more attention, but even then, it’s not constant.\n* **App Integration Concerns:** Yep, most systems today come with apps for monitoring. You don’t *have* to use the app, but it’s helpful for tracking performance. Some systems store data locally, so even if the app dies, your system keeps running fine. Just pick a trusted brand with a solid reputation to minimize tech-related headaches.\n* **Midwest Acreage:** Perfect! With all that space, you can optimize placement for max sun exposure. Ground mounts also mean you’re not limited by roof orientation or shading, so you’ll have more flexibility.",

The fact is that many of our nice *vegan* plant products need pollination. So how should we achieve this without using insects? Using bees has the advantage that the bees' lives are worthy of protection by the bee keeper, because they also make honey. So they're cared for. \nThe alternative would be using bumblebees, who are just left to die after the pollination is done. So from what I know, at least in Germany, honey (and especially organic honey) may not be *vegan*, but is the ethical choice if you want to be responsible for less animal deaths. (Some bees probably die in honey production but that's not much compared to the bumblebee alternative.)\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong!\nRegarding the article, I really don't like how they tossed the food in the trash. It's just a waste, as long as they don't have an overwhelming feeling of disgust towards the honey.",

"comment": "Honey isn't vegan because we \"destroy\" queens once they slow down in production.  Queens typically live 3-4 years before this happens, but will live much longer naturally.  If keepers didn't kill queens, then us eating honey wouldn't be an issue.  Bees always produce far more honey than they can possibly use, especially if they are allowed to swarm.  Its usually determined by the space given in the hive.  The bees will fill ever available inch of space with either honey or larva.  They always overproduce, an active hive produces an average of 100lbs of honey each year in a temperate climate.  They never use all of this honey and will keep producing as long as the hive is alive.\n\nSome keepers think that bees overwinter better if the honey is replaced with a sugar syrup mixture, but I'm not sure how I feel about that or if its worth the trouble.\n\nEssentially if you have your own hive and treat the bees properly and don't destroy the queens you can produce cruelty free honey.  You'll need a bee suit to prevent the workers from stinging you (this kills them).  But I've sure it can be done with the proper time, consideration and effort.",

The way that they have done it does not show the true picture considering that people need to consume a certain number of calories in order to survive. E.g. 4 oz of meat will contain more calories than 4 oz of brocolli, so the person eating the brocolli will have to eat a lot more of it. \n\nI believe the brocolli (and other vegan foods) will still come out on top, but I think its dishonest to present it the way it is.",

Buddhist monk cuisine is vegan-friendly.  Macrobiotic restaurants are mostly vegan, just ask them about the presence of fish and they will likely understand!\n\n[Here](http://isitveganjapan.com/)'s another really good resource!\n\nAlso once you have experienced eating vegan in Japan, could you maybe check back here and let us know what you found most useful?  I will be in the same boat later this year when I visit my sister there.",

"comment": "Firstly, I didn't say \"the C word\" at all. I said a serious liver disease. I probably could have phrased it more diplomatically - \"*could be* an indicator of a serious liver disease\" - is that more to your liking? You're correct, I am not a medical professional. However quite some years ago now (prior to being vegan), my elevated B12 levels were my GP's first clue into what other doctors had diagnosed as \"general fatigue\" or \"depression\", and that actually turned out to be hepatitis. Other than the b12 and terrible fatigue, the disease was asymptomatic.\n\nOf course I do not know your history, but unless I am seriously mistaken, you are a member of the species homo sapiens or at the very least some kind of ape, and do not have any wildly different physiological processes than the rest of us. Sure there are other possibilities but none of them I would want to have, and none that I would be so casual and flippant about. Unless you already have a history of illness that would affect hepatic function I would want this checked out properly. But it's your life and your decision of course. \n\nI am concerned that you are spreading misinformation like \"too much b12 in bloodwork isn't bad\", when in fact in can be an indicator of something fairly serious. That is of course unless you supplemented or ate prior to the blood being taken, which would have skewed the results. In that case though I would be concerned that the data is in no way useful at all and isn't a useful indicator that your actual b12 levels are normal. \n\nYour nurse saying that \"lay off the b12 consumption\" is equally worrying. \n\nAs for why I'm suggesting these things, it's because I care if someone gets bad advice, and spreads bad advice. A sickly vegan reflects badly on us all, after all. Despite me often phrasing things rather sarcastically, I wouldn't want your doc/nurse to have missed something and for you to get ill. I have been there, and I wish someone had picked it up earlier for me.",

Some now do enjoy vegan meals just because they found a recipe or menu item so good.  \n\nI think a large part of why people are hesitant to go vegan is because *any* change can be tough get started. People think going vegan is hard and it's not so much that *being* vegan is really all that hard, it's that the change takes some time/energy to adapt to new habits, new recipes, deal with the inconvenience of having to research places to eat and deal with people's attitudes, and alter traditions. It's easier to just stick with the status quo.  \n\nOf course, there are still some people who think that all we eat is plain tofu and steamed broccoli. So, I'm all about introducing people to more delicious vegan choices.",

People will always ask the same questions, so be prepared to answer them politely and develop your elevator pitch. \n\nThe first time you go to a non vegan restaurant with a group will be nerve wracking, or at least it was for me. Avoid tapas restaurants for a little while while you can (that was my first large group experience, it didn't go well). Also if you're going to a new restaurant call ahead and ask, most of the time they will be helpful. \n\nAlso, it was said earlier, but learn, learn, learn allllll you can about the animal exploitation industries and the concept of Speciesism. This will act as motivation to continue until you no longer see animals or their secretions as food.",

"comment": "Take a B12 supplement. Plants and fungi don't make it. Bacteria do, but not just any bacteria. There are a lot of myths on alternative ways to get B12. Be skeptical.\n\nTake vitamin D if you don't get a lot of sun exposure (not directly related to veganism, but still something people often are low in). D2 is vegan, D3 usually isn't but you can get vegan D3. Make sure you get enough iodine (iodized salt or seaweed sprinkles, you don't need much). \n\nTry to up your omega-3 intake and lower your omega-6 intake. If you choose to use oils, look for high omega 3 oils. Use in moderation, preferably not heated. Chia seeds are really easy to sprinkle on food or add to drinks for omega-3s and other nutrients. Flax seeds can be added to smoothies and other things, but need to be broken up or else they'll just pass right through since they're tough. \n\nDiet-wise, eat plenty of \"beans and greens\" -- dark leafy greens like collards, kale, mustards, turnips, and legumes like beans, peas, dahl, peanuts. That will help you get enough protein, iron, and calcium, especially. It's not hard to get enough protein if you 1. eat enough (i.e. aren't on some super low calorie diet) and 2. get most of your food from whole foods and not junk food (stuff with added sugar and oils and flour). You do not have to specially combine foods to get all your amino acids. Most plant foods will have all the essentials and you can get the minimums. The only issue is that grains are particularly low in lysine, so be sure to incorporate high lysine sources into your diet as well like legumes, quinoa, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, and seitan (grain based, but higher protein so higher lysine). Beyond the beans and greens, add in what you want -- other veggies, fruits, fungi, grains, nuts and seeds. Don't forget herbs and spices, too! Food doesn't need to be bland and many seasonings are actually very nutrient dense and have other medicinal benefits! \n\nAll that said, don't stress about it too much. It's not that different from eating a healthy non-vegan diet. And a bit of junk food here and there isn't the end of the world. Just find the right balance! \n\nI highly recommend the books Becoming Vegan, Vegan for Life, and Eat to Live. http://www.veganhealth.org is also very good.",

"comment": "Wrong. Vitamin D from the sun, vitamin E from plant-based oils and fats. From the Vegetarian Society:\n\n&gt;Vitamin K is present in dark leafy greens such as cabbage, kale, spinach and broccoli, vegetable oils such as rapeseed, soybean and olive, but not corn or sunflower oil. Smaller amounts are found in eggs and dairy products. Human gut bacteria can also synthesise a form of vitamin K.\n\nVitamin A isn't readily available in a plant-based diet but margarine and spread can be fortified with it. Only a small amount is needed because the body stores the vitamin so well. Vitamin D is also found most easily in fish and eggs and but can also be fortified into vegan foods or, as I already said, obtained from spending time in sunlight.",

"comment": "Tl;DR; Vitamin D deficiency is really bad, and most official recommendations are very likely lying.\n\nI recently found out the hard way that I am vitamin D deficient (through a blood test). I live far up north (Sweden), and I typically avoid exposure to the sun even during the summer. This really is unrelated to me being a Vegan. But I'd like to share some of the things I learned.\n\nI've been taking a [multivitamin](http://www.vegetology.com/collections/vegans/products/vegvit) as my primary source of supplement, which gives me 200 IU (100% RDA). After some research and guidance it turns out that this level is very likely to be complete bull. The best source I've found is this [non-vegan one on nootropics](http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#vitamin-d), which really is about optimizing your cognitive ability through the use of drugs and supplements.\n\nBy going through references it seems that the closest recommendation by an official source comes from the [Vitamin D Council](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/), a nonprofit, which has a [recommended daily dose of 5000 IU](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/how-do-i-get-the-vitamin-d-my-body-needs/) and some handy information on how your exposure to the sun affect your intake. They have an article on this topic [explaining the details](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/blog/why-does-the-vitamin-d-council-recommend-5000-iuday/) (including scientific references). The real value is **70-80 IU per kg of body weight** from all sources (supplements + sun exposure).\n\nIn short, if you want to avoid the effects of Vitamin D deficiency, make sure you do the math, and [buy a proper supplement](http://www.vegetology.com/collections/vegans/products/vitashine-2500iu-tablets) that allow you to dose according to your need. The effects of deficiency include a bad immune system, depression, autoimmune disease, and a significant increased risk of certain cancers.\n\nGet a blood test done if you suspect that you are deficient. If you live far up north, vegan or not, you most likely are. In Sweden, you can ask your GP, and if they are refuse you can [buy one here](https://werlabs.se/) which is the same type that they would use.\n\nThe canonical vegetarian [D2 supplement are not as efficient or easy to dose as D3](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/blog/meta-analysis-looks-at-efficacy-of-d2-vs-d3/). And [might even be harmful to you](http://www.vitamindwiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=2138).\n\nLast note: Don't take D3 supplements in the evening, it [seems to hamper melatonin production and make it hard to sleep](http://www.gwern.net/Zeo#vitamin-d).\n\nI hope this information will help others. You don't have to learn it the hard way.",

"comment": "Main focus with vegan eating: take a B12 pill, add chia or flax seeds whenever you can, and make sure you get enough calories! If you eat a decent variety of food, the nutrition will sort itself out very easily.\n\nBreakfast:\n- Peanut butter on toast, sprinkle hemp hearts, add jam if you want\n- Oatmeal with cinnamon. I add in frozen berries, hemp hearts, chia seeds, and/or ground flax\n- Smoothie (get a nice blender, I use it every day! Great for smoothies, salad dressings, and pasta sauces)\n\nLunch/Dinner:\n- Sandwich: Add lots of whatever veggies, use hummus or black bean spread for extra calories/protein, can always put chia/hemp seeds in as well. Avocado/guacomole makes any sandwich better!\n- Pasta: Anything you want really, just replace the meat from your favourite pastas with either tofu, tempeh, seitan, beans, chickpeas, or a veggie meat alternative (whatever seems to make sense)\n- Salad: Take any salad, put it on a huge bowl of brown rice or quinoa, add in chickpeas/beans/tofu, and you have a delicious/filling meal! Find a salad dressing you like, or make your own using a blender (bell peppers, avocado, apple cider vinegar, pick a few spices, maybe some mustard or ginger, some dates for sweetness, and lemon/lime for sour touch. Herbs help too)\n- Soup: I like potato/lentil soups, which I use a pressure cooker to make.\n\nSnacks\n- Nuts\n- Crackers/toast/snap peas and hummus\n- FRUIT!\n- Dried fruit (I keep a lot of dried fruit and nuts/seeds in my desk at work)\n\nTips:\n- Frozen vegetables/fruit are extremely useful. I buy several veggie mixes with 5-10 different veggies in it, and they're so versatile (no need to chop veggies!).\n- Frozen spinach/kale are super useful. Easy addition to smoothies, soups, any pasta. I find fresh spinach always goes gross before I use it all, so freezing it helps me.\n- You can freeze any fresh fruit/veggies before they go bad if you don't use them fast enough\n- Start every meal by sautéeing garlic and onions first. \n- Get a variety of spices and sauces... curry powder, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, paprika, minced garlic, minced ginger, sweet thai sauce, hot sauce, sriracha, vegannaise, sesame ginger salad dressing. I throw these at random into many different meals for quick and easy flavour. Just experiment, you can't really go wrong!\n\nMy go-to meal:\n- throw a frozen veggie mix into the pan with a bit of water\n- dump a can of beans or lentils in (strain the water from the can first). Try to go ~60:40 veggie mix to beans by volume. Some days I don't even add veggies though hah.\n- Add in two or three scoops of peanut butter\n- Pour in some sweet thai sauce, or sesame ginger salad dressing\n- Add in chili powder or hot sauce to preference\n- Put a lid on the pan, and steam for 5-10 minutes (I usually do dishes or make a smoothie in this time)\n- Remove lid, mix everything up, and heat longer if you made it too watery... otherwise, good to go!\n- Top with nutritional yeast and lime juice\n\nUsually ready in 15 minutes or less from start to finish, almost all of which is just heating time.

The doc is completely, 100% wrong–as you suspect–but you're probably not going to convince them of that. Your best bet is to try what the other poster said and load up on high protein vegan foods. It's unnecessary, but might ease their minds. \n\nIn the end, they can't force-feed you meat, but I understand how stressful playing the whos-more-stubborn game with parents can be. My mom and I found out we're both equally and extraordinarily stubborn when I was a teenager! My advice is to keep a cool head, try to reasons with them, and be understanding. They just want you to follow the medical advice you were given because they think it's the best thing for you.",

"comment": "Is being enslaved in a bigger cage better for these chickens? Yes. Is it being \"treated well\" as you claim? No. \n\nMy problem is with how you frame this situation. Why are you so quick to make excuses for your parents' continued unethical consumption? By accommodating this, you send the signal that it's OK to support the entire industry - they may buy eggs from this person now, but what about all of the products they purchase with eggs in them, all from factory production? All egg consumption supports hatcheries, where male chicks are thrown into grinders or suffocated shortly after hatching. All egg consumption supports the idea that these animals belong to us - which is apparently a belief you still hold on to. \n\nThe baseline of veganism is that other animals aren't ours for any purpose - to eat, to use for research, to keep in zoos or our homes - that's right, keeping pets isn't ethical, either. This is the hardest thing for humans to accept and understand. \n\nImagine the life of a captive animal, treated 'nicely' in a home. Are you aware of how stressful it is to have no choices? Being a captive animal is essentially making the best of a bad situation - they are deprived of every choice imaginable. No choice of who to spend time with, no way to get away from people, no choice of choosing a mate, no choice of food, no ability to make your own schedule. Does this bother other animals? Yes. \n\nBeing an advocate for animals requires that we consider what they want and need, not how 'nicely' we want to use them.",

"comment": "Realizing that negativity doesn't always achieve what you want in some situations.  There may be places for it, but if you have a different or larger goal in mind, that can help you have something else to aim for.  Another thing that can hold your attention is focusing on the process of what you're trying to do, rather than the feelings you're having during it, or the goal you have in mind.  Say you want to talk to people about veganism, in the hopes of getting them interested in it.  If you find it difficult to talk about veganism without feeling toxic negativity, consider spending some time working on, instead of focusing on what you're feeling or how you think others should feel or react, focus on developing exactly what you set out to do: your talking skills.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ano1g2/how_do_you_talk_to_your_family_about_being_vegan/efv4phk?context=3) are some other tips or ideas for communication.  \n\nOther things to keep in mind are that 1). It is okay to take breaks from doing this 2).  Growing apart from some people as you yourself change is a natural part of life and isn't always a tragedy; it's up to you to choose how you spend your time, including who you spend it with 3). You are not responsible for changing absolutely everyone's mind around you.  Especially with close friends and family, sometimes unintuitively hands-off approaches can work, like simply making veganism seem approachable through making lots of delicious vegan food.",

Do you have a source? \n\n&gt;quinoa with rocks in it there.\n\nEven if this is true, this happens with dried lentils too? I genuinely don't see what difference it makes. Check you food before you cook it. \n\n&gt;Read my other replies about farming.\n\nI have, and I've seen the answers given to you - including about vertical farming and aquaponics. Have you looked into those? \n\n&gt;Im not anti vegan\n\nYou do sound pretty anti-vegan. \n\n&gt;I just think that most vegans are just as ignorant about the food production system as kids who don't realize burgers come from cows.\n\nWhy would we - people who've looked into where food comes from to try make the most ethical decisions we can - be as ignorant of food production as a child? Surely, that comparison is more apt with a meat eater? \n\nIf we're talking about vegans not knowing about every ethical problem with everything single ethical thing then sure, I agree - no one does. The world is littered with unethical practices. Doesn't mean we can't all do the best we can. \n\n&gt;The fertilizer insdustry is made up of factory farmed animal components and as far as i know its impossible to get more than a couple years worth of quality crops out of soil without the animal farming industry propping up the soil integraty unless its small scale farming or polyface farming or something.\n\nSo why not look for an alternative, rather than say \"oh well, guess we have to abuse animals\"? Do you not see how that's not relevant?\n\nEdit: clarity/spelling",

Just look closely at the type of words he/she is using and how he/she articulates their opinion within this context. Take away the word vegan, animal rights activists and replace it with jews, blacks, muslims mexicans, gypsies etc or is it just me? Seems this person read mein kampf or is either influenced by someone who has. It's like watching a apartheid or nazi propaganda film.",

"comment": "Although there are changes in your body when eating a plant based diet, the effects are different for everyone. And also the reasons why people go to a plant based diet. For me I quit eating meat for basically two reasons. 1. I don’t have to kill any animals to survive and 2. to help reduce the amount of pollution raising animals to eat. \nThe additional things I’ve noticed is I do not have heartburn anymore. I have a considerable amount of more energy. \nRemember that everyone is different and effects of whatever we do are different as well.",

Went to the only place open asked for vegetable meal as my dad and I were vegetarian at the time. I am not sure what they served but it had a brainy tang. I ate as much as I could get in, it wasn’t good but we were famished. I can still taste it 15years later, yuck",

I spent years and years cutting out the usual culprits like gluten and dairy to help my stomach and it did to some extent but I was still missing some part of the puzzle. I went vegan when I woke up to how bad the industry was and noticed very quickly that I was no longer feeling sick at all! Meat and eggs had been contributing to my pain all this time but it had never crossed my mind that it could be causing me harm. I wish what you and I have found out was more common knowledge as there are so many people with stomach problems that will never know that meat and eggs can contribute.\n\nIt makes me happy to hear of your success, those kinds of stomach problems can be demoralising.",
